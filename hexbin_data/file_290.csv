748,New Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Therapeutic Strategies Based on the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/Angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas Receptor Axis,2012-01-26,"Angiotensin (Ang)-(1–7) is now recognized as a biologically active component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The discovery of the angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue ACE2 revealed important metabolic pathways involved in the Ang-(1–7) synthesis. This enzyme can form Ang-(1–7) from Ang II or less efficiently through hydrolysis of Ang I to Ang-(1–9) with subsequent Ang-(1–7) formation. Additionally, it is well established that the G protein-coupled receptor Mas is a functional ligand site for Ang-(1–7). The axis formed by ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas represents an endogenous counter regulatory pathway within the RAS whose actions are opposite to the vasoconstrictor/proliferative arm of the RAS constituted by ACE/Ang II/AT(1) receptor. In this review we will discuss recent findings concerning the biological role of the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas arm in the cardiovascular and pulmonary system. Also, we will highlight the initiatives to develop potential therapeutic strategies based on this axis.","Ferreira, Anderson J.; Murça, Tatiane M.; Fraga-Silva, Rodrigo A.; Castro, Carlos Henrique; Raizada, Mohan K.; Santos, Robson A.

1378,Effect of the One-Child Policy on Influenza Transmission in China: A Stochastic Transmission Model,2014-02-06,"BACKGROUND: China's one-child-per-couple policy, introduced in 1979, led to profound demographic changes for nearly a quarter of the world's population. Several decades later, the consequences include decreased fertility rates, population aging, decreased household sizes, changes in family structure, and imbalanced sex ratios. The epidemiology of communicable diseases may have been affected by these changes since the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases depend on demographic characteristics of the population. Of particular interest is influenza because China and Southeast Asia lie at the center of a global transmission network of influenza. Moreover, changes in household structure may affect influenza transmission. Is it possible that the pronounced demographic changes that have occurred in China have affected influenza transmission? METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this question, we developed a continuous-time, stochastic, individual-based simulation model for influenza transmission. With this model, we simulated 30 years of influenza transmission and compared influenza transmission rates in populations with and without the one-child policy control. We found that the average annual attack rate is reduced by 6.08% (SD 2.21%) in the presence of the one-child policy compared to a population in which no demographic changes occurred. There was no discernible difference in the secondary attack rate, −0.15% (SD 1.85%), between the populations with and without a one-child policy. We also forecasted influenza transmission over a ten-year time period in a population with a two-child policy under a hypothesis that a two-child-per-couple policy will be carried out in 2015, and found a negligible difference in the average annual attack rate compared to the population with the one-child policy. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the average annual attack rate is slightly lowered in a population with a one-child policy, which may have resulted from a decrease in household size and the proportion of children in the population.","Liu, Fengchen; Enanoria, Wayne T.

1470,Comparative Analysis of Lycorine in Wild Plant and Callus Culture Samples of Hymenocallis littoralis by HPLC-UV Method,2014-05-06,"The Hymenocallis littoralis, an ornamental and medicinal plant, had been traditionally used for wound healing. In the present study, an analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in the extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H. littoralis. The separation was achieved using a reversed-phase column. The method was found to be accurate, repeatable, and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples. The highest lycorine content was found in the bulb extract (2.54 ± 0.02 μg/mg) whereas the least was in the root extract (0.71 ± 0.02 μg/mg) of the wild plants. Few callus culture samples had high content of lycorine, comparable to that of wild plants. The results showed that plant growth regulators, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) alone at 4.5 μM (2.58 ± 0.38 μg/mg) or a combination of 2,4-D at 9.00 μM with 4.5 μM of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP), were the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine (2.45 ± 0.15 μg/mg) content in callus culture. The present analytical method could be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the tissue culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.","Subramaniam, Sreeramanan; Sundarasekar, Jeevandran; Sahgal, Geethaa; Murugaiyah, Vikneswaran",ScientificWorldJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4033353/,290
1676,Chemical and Biological Mechanisms of Pathogen Reduction Technologies,2014-08-20,"Within the last decade new technologies have been developed and implemented which employ light, often in the presence of a photosensitizer, to inactivate pathogens that reside in human blood products for the purpose of transfusion. These pathogen reduction technologies attempt to find the proper balance between pathogen kill and cell quality. Each system utilizes various chemistries that not only impact which pathogens they can inactivate and how, but also how the treatments affect the plasma and cellular proteins and to what degree. This paper aims to present the various chemical mechanisms for pathogen reduction in transfusion medicine that are currently practiced or in development.","Mundt, Janna M; Rouse, Lindsay; Van den Bossche, Jeroen; Goodrich, Raymond P",Photochem Photobiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277684/,290
1908,The role of heterogeneity in contact timing and duration in network models of influenza spread in schools,2015-07-06,"Influenza poses a significant health threat to children, and schools may play a critical role in community outbreaks. Mathematical outbreak models require assumptions about contact rates and patterns among students, but the level of temporal granularity required to produce reliable results is unclear. We collected objective contact data from students aged 5–14 at an elementary school and middle school in the state of Utah, USA, and paired those data with a novel, data-based model of influenza transmission in schools. Our simulations produced within-school transmission averages consistent with published estimates. We compared simulated outbreaks over the full resolution dynamic network with simulations on networks with averaged representations of contact timing and duration. For both schools, averaging the timing of contacts over one or two school days caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 1–8%. Averaging both contact timing and pairwise contact durations caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 10% at the middle school and 72% at the elementary school. Averaging contact durations separately across within-class and between-class contacts reduced the increase for the elementary school to 5%. Thus, the effect of ignoring details about contact timing and duration in school contact networks on outbreak size modelling can vary across different schools.","Toth, Damon J.

2382,Inferring R(0) in emerging epidemics—the effect of common population structure is small,2016-08-11,"When controlling an emerging outbreak of an infectious disease, it is essential to know the key epidemiological parameters, such as the basic reproduction number R(0) and the control effort required to prevent a large outbreak. These parameters are estimated from the observed incidence of new cases and information about the infectious contact structures of the population in which the disease spreads. However, the relevant infectious contact structures for new, emerging infections are often unknown or hard to obtain. Here, we show that, for many common true underlying heterogeneous contact structures, the simplification to neglect such structures and instead assume that all contacts are made homogeneously in the whole population results in conservative estimates for R(0) and the required control effort. This means that robust control policies can be planned during the early stages of an outbreak, using such conservative estimates of the required control effort.","Trapman, Pieter; Ball, Frank; Dhersin, Jean-Stéphane; Tran, Viet Chi; Wallinga, Jacco; Britton, Tom",J R Soc Interface,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014060/,290

4241,Interplay between cost and effectiveness in influenza vaccine uptake: a vaccination game approach,2019-12-18,"Pre-emptive vaccination is regarded as one of the most protective measures to control influenza outbreak. There are mainly two types of influenza viruses—influenza A and B with several subtypes—that are commonly found to circulate among humans. The traditional trivalent (TIV) flu vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. The quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine targets one extra B virus strain that ensures better protection against influenza; however, the use of QIV vaccine can be costly, hence impose an extra financial burden to society. This scenario might create a dilemma in choosing vaccine types at the individual level. This article endeavours to explain such a dilemma through the framework of a vaccination game, where individuals can opt for one of the three options: choose either of QIV or TIV vaccine or none. Our approach presumes a mean-field framework of a vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, entangling the disease spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccination decision-making processes taking place before an epidemic season. We conduct a series of numerical simulations as an attempt to illustrate different scenarios. The framework has been validated by the so-called multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach.","Arefin, Md.

4750,"Abstracts: 8th EBSA European Biophysics Congress, August 23rd–27th 2011, Budapest, Hungary",2011-08-06,"Unusual biological threats demand adequate preparedness efforts, as demonstrated, for example, by the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa in 2014/2015 and pandemic influenza in 2009/2010. In Germany, responsibilities for such efforts are located in different governmental authorities and differ from state to state. As a result, there are many different preparedness approaches using divergent core terminology. In this article a common definition for the term “unusual biological incident” is proposed. To do so, a literature review as well as semi-structured expert interviews with representatives of central actors in Germany were conducted. The understanding of “unusual biological incident” was not consistent among experts; four approaches to qualify a biological incident as “unusual” were identified. These were merged in a comprehensive system-oriented approach that focuses on the health system’s resilience and on shortages of knowledge and material resources during incidents. Based on this approach, we suggest a stage model for the categorization of biological threats as “incident,” “crisis,” “severe crisis,” or “disaster.” The need for central coordination is a defining characteristic to qualify a biological incident as “unusual.” Based on the identified shortages, the necessary response strategies can be derived.","Sachse, Sven; Hunger, Iris",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080037/,290
5088,Inhibitory zinc sites in enzymes,2013-03-01,"Does society benefit from encouraging or discouraging private infectious disease-risk mitigation? Private individuals routinely mitigate infectious disease risks through the adoption of a range of precautions, from vaccination to changes in their contact with others. Such precautions have epidemiological consequences. Private disease-risk mitigation generally reduces both peak prevalence of symptomatic infection and the number of people who fall ill. At the same time, however, it can prolong an epidemic. A reduction in prevalence is socially beneficial. Prolongation of an epidemic is not. We find that for a large class of infectious diseases, private risk mitigation is socially suboptimal—either too low or too high. The social optimum requires either more or less private mitigation. Since private mitigation effort depends on the cost of mitigation and the cost of illness, interventions that change either of these costs may be used to alter mitigation decisions. We model the potential for instruments that affect the cost of illness to yield net social benefits. We find that where a disease is not very infectious or the duration of illness is short, it may be socially optimal to promote private mitigation effort by increasing the cost of illness. By contrast, where a disease is highly infectious or long lasting, it may be optimal to discourage private mitigation by reducing the cost of disease. Society would prefer a shorter, more intense, epidemic to a longer, less intense epidemic. There is, however, a region in parameter space where the relationship is more complicated. For moderately infectious diseases with medium infectious periods, the social optimum depends on interactions between prevalence and duration. Basic reproduction numbers are not sufficient to predict the social optimum.","Morin, B. R.; Kinzig, A. P.; Levin, S. A.; Perrings, C.

We found that, compared to seronegative controls, mice that were seropositive at least to Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) and Mycoplasma pulmonis: (i) exhibited a higher interindividual variability in all the parameters quantifying metastatic progression; (ii) had elevated serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines both before and at the end of the experiment; (iii) were more susceptible to hepatic metastasis. Interestingly, final levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-18 correlated with the extent of hepatic colonization by the melanoma cells. To confirm the metastasis-enhancing effect of MHV and M. pulmonis we measured the ability of B16M cells to metastasize in pathogen-free animals housed for increasing time-intervals in the vicinity of MHV(+) animals. Notably, susceptibility to metastasis was lower in animals seronegative to MHV than in MHV(+) mice, whereas the latter were less susceptible to metastasis than MHV(+) M. pulmonis(+) mice. Seropositive animals had increased levels of TNF-α and IL-18 suggesting that MHV and M. pulmonis enhance the metastatic ability of melanoma cells by inducing the release of proinflammatory cytokines. While our results highlight the importance of using pathogen-free animals in metastasis studies, they emphasize the need for a comprehensive health monitoring of the mice used in such studies, particularly in case of using facilities lacking appropriate containment measures.","Rodríguez-Cuesta, Juan; Vidal-Vanaclocha, Fernando; Mendoza, Lorea; Valcárcel, María; Gallot, Natalia; de Tejada, Guillermo Martínez",Clin Exp Metastasis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088291/,290
5254,The Circle,2014-02-01,"Influenza pandemics have occurred intermittently throughout the 20th century and killed millions of people worldwide. It is expected that influenza pandemics will continue to occur in the near future. Huge number of deaths and cases is the most troublesome aspect of the influenza pandemics, but the other important trouble is the economic impact of the influenza pandemics to the countries. In this study, we try to detect the cost of a possible influenza pandemic under different scenarios and attack rates. We include the vaccination and antiviral treatment cost for direct cost and we add the work absenteeism cost to the calculations for indirect cost of influenza pandemics. As a case study, we calculate the economic impact of pandemic influenza for Turkey under three different scenarios and three different attack rates. Our optimistic estimation shows that the economic impact of pandemic influenza will be between 1.364 billion dollars and 2.687 billions dollars to Turkish economy depending on the vaccination strategies.","Yoldascan, Elcin; Kurtaran, Behice; Koyuncu, Melik; Koyuncu, Esra",J Med Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088331/,290

5428,Program Schedule,1983,"A 7-year-old female-spayed, domestic short-haired cat was presented to her veterinarian with a mass on the hind paw.

5492,Hospital ventilation simulation for the study of potential exposure to contaminants,2011-12-04,"The cost of nosocomial infections in the United States is estimated to be $4 billion to $5 billion annually. Applying a scientifically based analysis to disease transmission and performing a site specific risk analysis to determine the design of the ventilation system can provide real and long term cost savings. Using a scientific approach and convincing data, this paper hypothetically illustrates how a ventilation system design can be optimized to potentially reduce infection risk to occupants in an isolation room based on a thorough risk assessment without necessarily increasing ventilation airflow rate. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed to examine the transport mechanism, particle path and a suggested control strategy for reducing airborne infectious disease agents. Most studies on the transmission of infectious disease particles have concentrated primarily on air changes per hour (ACH) and how ACH provides a dilution factor for possible infectious agents. Although increasing ventilation airflow rate does dilute concentrations better when the contaminant source is constant, it does not increase ventilation effectiveness. Furthermore, an extensive literature review indicates that not every exposure to an infectious agent will necessarily cause a recipient infection. The results of this study suggest a hypothesis that in an enclosed and mechanically ventilated room (e.g., an isolation room), the dominant factor that affects the transmission and control of contaminants is the path between the contaminant source and exhaust. Contaminants are better controlled when this path is uninterrupted by an air stream. This study illustrates that the ventilation system design, i.e., when it conforms with the hypothesized path principle, may be a more important factor than flow rate (i.e., ACH). A secondary factor includes the distance from the contaminant source. This study provides evidence and supports previous studies that moving away from the patient generally reduces the infection risk in a transient (coughing) situation, although the effect is more pronounced under higher flow rate. It is noted that future research is needed to determine the exact mode of transmission for most recently identified organisms.","Memarzadeh, Farhad; Xu, Weiran",Build Simul,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090659/,290
5499,Tracer gas is a suitable surrogate of exhaled droplet nuclei for studying airborne transmission in the built environment,2020-02-21,"As a counterpoint to studies that make a case for the use of oxytocin in short-term inhibition of food intake, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the peptide facilitates weight gain in female rats in a more long-term perspective. Two different variants of female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. The two variants differed in daily weight gain (0.38 g/day vs. 1.41 g/day during 28 days), and were designated slowly and rapidly growing rats (SGR and RGR) respectively. Oxytocin 1 mg/kg given s.c. to SGR for a five-day period increased weight gain significantly in comparison to a previous five-day period with NaCl-treatment (18.0 g/5 days versus 5.0 g/5 days; p<0.01). In a separate study, oxytocin 1 mg/kg given for four days increased weight gain significantly in SGR versus saline-treated controls (7.5 g/4 days versus 1.6 g/4 days; p<0.05). The weight-difference persisted six days later (p<0.001). The weight increase of oxytocin occurred only during estrus (p<0.05) and was not accompanied by any measurable increase in food intake. In RGR, oxytocin-treatment decreased food intake significantly (p<0.001) and tended to decrease weight gain, although not significantly. The SGR and RGR also had different endocrine profiles with, for example, twice as high oxytocin (p<0.01) and insulin levels (p<0.01) in RGR compared to the SGR. These data suggest that oxytocin influences weight gain and food intake differently in the two variants of Sprague-Dawley rats, perhaps depending on factors such as endocrine profile and oxytocin sensitivity.","Uvnas-Moberg, Kerstin; Alster, Pawel; Petersson, Maria",Integr Physiol Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090716/,290

The framing of infectious disease as a threat to global public health and economic security coincides with preemptive forms of control. A particular type of preemptive regulation is global pandemic influenza planning that entails the governing of an imminent, albeit uncertain, global health event. We examine the discourse of ‘preparedness’ within pandemic planning documents produced by the World Health Organization from 1999 to 2009. We present key findings on: the construction of the influenza virus in terms of its potential to transform and expand across corporeal and territorial boundaries; and the integration of pandemic preparedness into everyday practices. Our analysis illustrates how the discourse of preparedness links the justification for population-level preemptive approaches to discursive constructions of the virus. By articulating this relationship, this article contributes to understandings of the implications of ‘molecular’ constructions for the biopolitical regulation of the global population.","Sanford, Sarah; Polzer, Jessica; McDonough, Peggy",Soc Theory Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100152/,290

Elucidation of the structural changes in the red blood cell induced by parasite invasion and maturation and an understanding of the accompanying functional alterations have the ability to considerably extend our knowledge of structure-function relationships in the normal red blood cell.

Completion of nucleotide sequence information for genomes of NCP and CP-BVDV isolates was an important milestone. Subsequent work on the protein map of BVDV and polyprotein processing pathways paved the way for the interpretation of many other virologic and immunologic studies. Discovery of a correlation between genotype II and virulence (hemorrhagic syndrome) will help to clarify previously controversial data and to improve disease control. Description of multiple pathways of p80 expression in CP-BVDV offered insight into the pathogenesis of mucosal disease. Identification of gp53/E2 as the target of neutralizing antibodies and source of antigenic hypervariability helped us to understand immunity to BVDV.

9401,Challenges and opportunities for HIV/AIDS control in China,2012-03-01,"BACKGROUND: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a signaling phospholipid involved in pathophysiologic progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through its roles in endothelial barrier function and immune modulation. We hypothesized that decreased serum S1P level is associated with the clinical outcomes of ARDS and polymorphisms in the S1P gene are associated with serum S1P levels. METHODS: This multicenter prospective study includes ARDS patients and healthy blood donors as controls. Serum S1P levels were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the S1P gene were detected, and their associations with S1P levels were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 121 ARDS patients and 100 healthy individuals were enrolled. Serum S1P levels were lower in ARDS patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Decreased S1P levels correlated with more organ dysfunction and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores. Changes in S1P levels in ARDS patients were associated with the clinical outcomes. The recessive model for SNP rs3743631 suggests that GG homozygote is associate with a higher risk for ARDS. The dominant model for SNP rs907045 suggests that AA or TA genotype might increase the risk for ARDS. In ARDS patients, the rs3743631 GG genotype showed lower S1P levels than those harboring AG and AA genotypes. The serum S1P levels of rs907045 AA or TA genotype patients were lower than those of TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Serum S1P levels are dramatically decreased in ARDS patients. Reduced S1P levels are associated with worse clinical outcomes. There is a significant association between S1P rs3743631, rs907045 polymorphisms and susceptibility of ARDS.","Zhao, Jiangnan; Tan, Yan; Wang, Li; Su, Xin; Shi, Yi",J Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7137241/,290

To determine the amount of genetic divergence within and between these species, allozyme analyses were conducted on 14 populations distributed from Pennsylvania to eastern Texas. Seventeen loci were surveyed, 13 of which were polymorphic, with all populations being polymorphic at one or more loci. Interspecific genetic identities ranged from 0.560 (C. willdenowii and C. basiantha) to 0.807 (C. basiantha and C. superata). Alleles for the isozymes Aat‐1, Dia‐1, Idh‐2, Mdh‐2, Per‐1, Pgm‐1, and Pgm‐2 served to distinguish C. willdenowii from C. basiantha and C. superata. Carex basiantha and C. superata were recognized by alleles of Mdh‐2, Pgm‐1, and Tpi‐2. The genetic identities of populations within species were high and exceeded 0.957. A caespitose growth habit and perigynia in close proximity to the staminate flowers suggest adaptations for selfing and therefore low levels of heterozygosity. Paradoxically, the values for expected heterozygosities (H (exp)) were always lower than those obtained by direct count (H (obs)): F values were highly negative, indicating heterozygous excess. Disassortative mating and selection are discussed as possible mechanisms for maintaining heterozygous excess within populations.","Ford, Bruce A.; McQueen, D. A. Ross; Naczi, Robert F.

For this reason, scientists are working on the advancement of medical devices that are capable of decreasing the workload of health caregivers. In this study, the development of an iontophoretic drug delivery device that could be controlled using a mobile is described. For the purpose, hardware and a software module were developed. The hardware module consisted of a two-channel voltage-controlled constant current sources that were used for driving the iontophoretic device. A mobile app was developed to control the two-channel iontophoretic device and to monitor the loose lead of the active and the passive patches. In the case of detection of the loose lead, the specific iontophoretic channel was stopped. Further, the audio-visual indicator was developed for the detection of the detachment of the patches (loose lead). The device was tested in vitro by performing the drug release study using drug-loaded emulsion gels that were formulated.","Reddy, Mynampati Akshitha; Pradhan, Bikash Kumar; Qureshi, Dilshad; Pal, Sumit Kumar; Pal, Kunal",J Med Device,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7164504/,290

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins represent a possibility to quickly produce proteins with new features demanding relatively little cellular resources. FK506 binding protein (FKBP) 51 is a pivotal stress protein that is involved in the regulation of several executers of PTMs. This mini-review discusses the role of FKBP51 in the function of proteins responsible for setting the phosphorylation, ubiquitination and lipidation of other proteins. Examples include the kinases Akt1, CDK5 and GSK3β, the phosphatases calcineurin, PP2A and PHLPP, and the ubiquitin E3-ligase SKP2. The impact of FKBP51 on PTMs of signal transduction proteins significantly extends the functional versatility of this protein. As a stress-induced protein, FKBP51 uses re-setting of PTMs to relay the effect of stress on various signaling pathways.","Rein, Theo",Biochem Soc Trans,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200631/,290
10791,Regeneration of monsoon rain forest in northern Australia: the sapling bank,2009-02-24,Abstract. Meteorological patterns have a decisive influence on the inter‐annual dynamics of therophyte pastures under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The germination behaviour of annual pasture species was studied by subjecting two collections of seeds taken from plants and soil‐seed banks to two phytotron‐simulated weather patterns: early and late autumn rains. Species from these pastures were arranged along a gradient of sensitivity to temperature on the arrival of the first persistent rain. This sensitivity was manifested in both the total germination success of the species and the germination time profile. The different germination patterns of the species can provide competitive advantages depending on the autumn weather conditions.,"Espigares, T.; Peco, B.",J Veg Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7201889/,290
10915,Impact of the infectious period on epidemics,2018-05-11,"The two-step contagion model is a simple toy model for understanding pandemic outbreaks that occur in the real world. The model takes into account that a susceptible person either gets immediately infected or weakened when getting into contact with an infectious one. As the number of weakened people increases, they eventually can become infected in a short time period and a pandemic outbreak occurs. The time required to reach such a pandemic outbreak allows for intervention and is often called golden time. Understanding the size-dependence of the golden time is useful for controlling pandemic outbreak. Using an approach based on a nonlinear mapping, here we find that there exist two types of golden times in the two-step contagion model, which scale as [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] with the system size [Formula: see text] on Erdős-Rényi networks, where the measured [Formula: see text] is slightly larger than [Formula: see text]. They are distinguished by the initial number of infected nodes, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , respectively. While the exponent [Formula: see text] of the [Formula: see text]-dependence of the golden time is universal even in other models showing discontinuous transitions induced by cascading dynamics, the measured [Formula: see text] exponents are all close to [Formula: see text] but show model-dependence. It remains open whether or not [Formula: see text] reduces to [Formula: see text] in the asymptotically large- [Formula: see text] limit. Our method can be applied to several models showing a hybrid percolation transition and gives insight into the origin of the two golden times.","Choi, Wonjun; Lee, Deokjae; Kertész, J.; Kahng, B.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217535/,290

The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) developed guidelines for the use of noninvasive respiratory support techniques in the hypoxaemic patient in the peri-operative and periprocedural period. The panel outlined five clinical questions regarding treatment with noninvasive respiratory support techniques [conventional oxygen therapy (COT), high flow nasal cannula, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)] for hypoxaemic patients with acute peri-operative/periprocedural respiratory failure. The goal was to assess the available literature on the various noninvasive respiratory support techniques, specifically studies that included adult participants with hypoxaemia in the peri-operative/periprocedural period. The literature search strategy was developed by a Cochrane Anaesthesia and Intensive Care trial search specialist in close collaboration with the panel members and the ESA group methodologist. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to assess the level of evidence and to grade recommendations. The final process was then validated by both ESA and ESICM scientific committees. Among 19 recommendations, the two grade 1B recommendations state that: in the peri-operative/periprocedural hypoxaemic patient, the use of either NIPPV or CPAP (based on local expertise) is preferred to COT for improvement of oxygenation; and that the panel suggests using NIPPV or CPAP immediately post-extubation for hypoxaemic patients at risk of developing acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.

METHODS: A three-limbed double-blinded randomized control trial was conducted in a Level 3 neonatal intensive care unit. Forty five preterm neonates undergoing ROP screening were included. Eligible babies were randomly assigned to one of the three groups that orally received either expressed breast milk (n = 14), 10% dextrose solution (n = 14) or sterile water (n = 17), one minute before eye examination. The outcome measure was PIPP score. RESULTS: All 3 groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The mean PIPP scores were comparable (p = 0.18) in the three groups (11.8 ± 2.8 vs. 9.8 ± 3.3 vs. 10.2 ± 2.9). The behavioral and physiological variables were also similar across all three groups.

The biosensor employs a single-strand deoxyoligonucleotides (ssDNA) probe, conjugated to immobilized gold nanoparticles on the core surface of an optical fiber. We explore the steric effects on hybridization affinity and limit of detection (LOD), by using different ssDNA probe designs and surface chemistries, including diluent molecules of different lengths in mixed self-assembled monolayers, ssDNA probes of different oligonucleotide lengths, ssDNA probes in different orientations to accommodate target oligonucleotides with a hybridization region located unevenly in the strand. Based on the optimized ssDNA probe design and surface chemistry, we achieved LOD at sub-nM level, which makes detection of target oligonucleotides as low as 1 fmol possible in the 10-μL sensor chip. Additionally, the FOPPR biosensor shows a good correlation in determining HLA-B27 mRNA, in extracted blood samples from patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), with the clinically accepted real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. The results from this fundamental study should guide the design of ssDNA probe for anti-sense sensing.

Accumulating evidences show that mitoproteomes contain lots of these dual localized proteins termed echoforms. Unraveling the existence of mitochondrial echoforms using current GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) fusion microscopy approaches is extremely difficult because the GFP signal of the cytosolic echoform will almost inevitably mask that of the mitochondrial echoform. We therefore engineered a yeast strain expressing a new type of Split-GFP that we termed Bi-Genomic Mitochondrial-Split-GFP (BiG Mito-Split-GFP). Because one moiety of the GFP is translated from the mitochondrial machinery while the other is fused to the nuclear-encoded protein of interest translated in the cytosol, the self-reassembly of this Bi-Genomic-encoded Split-GFP is confined to mitochondria. We could authenticate the mitochondrial importability of any protein or echoform from yeast, but also from other organisms such as the human Argonaute 2 mitochondrial echoform.","Bader, Gaétan; Enkler, Ludovic; Araiso, Yuhei; Hemmerle, Marine; Binko, Krystyna; Baranowska, Emilia; De Craene, Johan-Owen; Ruer-Laventie, Julie; Pieters, Jean; Tribouillard-Tanvier, Déborah; Senger, Bruno; di Rago, Jean-Paul; Friant, Sylvie; Kucharczyk, Roza; Becker, Hubert Dominique",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358010/,290

As a first step to determine whether investing in such a system offers value for money, this study used contingent valuation to estimate people’s willingness to pay for such an early warning system in six European countries. The contingent valuation experiment was conducted through online questionnaires administered in February to March 2018 to cross-sectional, representative samples in the UK, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and The Netherlands, yielding a total sample size of 3140. Mean willingness to pay for an early warning system was €21.80 (median €10.00) per household per month. Pooled regression results indicate that willingness to pay increased with household income and risk aversion, while they decreased with age. Overall, our results indicate that approximately 80–90% of people would be willing to pay for an increase in health safety in the form of an early warning system for infectious diseases and food-borne outbreaks. However, our results have to be interpreted in light of the usual drawbacks of willingness to pay experiments.

A functional wound dressing that is capable of promoting ordered diabetic wound recovery is eagerly anticipated. In this study, we designed a silicone elastomer with embedded 20(S)-protopanaxadiol-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (PPD-NS) to achieve ordered recovery in scarless diabetic ulcer healing. The nanostructured lipid carriers were prepared through an emulsion evaporation-solidification method and then incorporated into a network of silicone elastomer to form a unique nanostructured lipid carrier-enriched gel formulation. Interestingly, the PPD-NS showed excellent in vitro anti-inflammatory and proangiogenic activity. Moreover, in diabetic mice with full-thickness skin excision wound, treatment with PPD-NS significantly promoted in vivo scarless wound healing through suppressing inflammatory infiltration in the inflammatory phase, promoting angiogenesis during the proliferation phase, and regulating collagen deposition in the remodeling phase. Hence, this study demonstrates that the developed PPD-NS could facilitate ordered diabetic wound recovery via multifunctional improvement during different wound-healing phases. This novel approach could be promising for scarless diabetic wound healing.","Sun, Di; Guo, Shi-yan; Yang, Li; Wang, Ya-ru; Wei, Xiao-hui; Song, Sha; Yang, Yi-wei; Gan, Yong; Wang, Zheng-tao",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7471442/,290

14779,Transmembrane Prolyl 4-Hydroxylase is a Novel Regulator of Calcium Signaling in Astrocytes,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Stigma is a barrier to the uptake of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder. Harm reduction treatment models intend to minimize this stigma by organizing care around non-judgmental interactions with people who use drugs. There are few examples of implementing buprenorphine treatment using a harm reduction approach in a primary care setting in the USA. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study by interviewing leadership, staff, and external stakeholders at Respectful, Equitable Access to Compassionate Healthcare (REACH) Medical in Ithaca, NY. REACH is a freestanding medical practice that provides buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder since 2018. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participants with the objective of describing REACH’s model of care. We selected participants based on their position at REACH or in the community. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes using content analysis, guided by the CDC Evaluation Framework. RESULTS: REACH provided buprenorphine, primary care, and mental health services in a low-threshold model. We identified three themes related to delivery of buprenorphine treatment. First, an organizational mission to provide equitable and low-stigma healthcare, which was a key to organizational identity. Second, a low-threshold buprenorphine treatment approach that was critical, but caused concern about over-prescribing and presented logistical challenges. Third, creation and retention of a harm reduction-oriented workforce by offering value-based work and by removing administrative barriers providers may face elsewhere to providing buprenorphine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A harm reduction primary care model can help reduce stigma for people who use drugs and engage in buprenorphine treatment. Further research is needed to evaluate whether this model leads to improved patient outcomes, can overcome community stakeholder concerns, and is sustainable.

Primary metabolites were quantified by quantitative (1)H NMR (qNMR) method. The results showed that tyrosine, one precursor of the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, was higher in endophytic extract compared to plant extract. In total, 22 compounds were identified including five molecules common to plant and endophyte extracts (tyrosine, isoleucine, valine, fatty acids and tyramine). In addition, endophytic extracts were analyzed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the identification of compounds in very low concentrations. Five Amaryllidaceae alkaloids were detected in the extracts of endophytic bacteria. Lycorine, previously detected by (1)H NMR, was confirmed with LC-MS analysis. Tazettine, pseudolycorine, acetylpseudolycorine, 1,2-dihydro-chlidanthine were also identified by LC-MS using the positive ionization mode or by GC-MS. In addition, 11 primary metabolites were identified in the endophytic extracts such as tyramine, which was obtained by decarboxylation of tyrosine. Thus, Bacillus sp. isolated from L. aestivum bulblets synthesized some primary and specialized metabolites in common with the L. aestivum plant. These endophytic bacteria are an interesting new approach for producing the Amaryllidaceae alkaloid such as lycorine.","Spina, Rosella; Saliba, Sahar; Dupire, François; Ptak, Agata; Hehn, Alain; Piutti, Séverine; Poinsignon, Sophie; Leclerc, Sebastien; Bouguet-Bonnet, Sabine; Laurain-Mattar, Dominique",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916811/,290

16385,"Title, Table of Contents and Acknowledgements",2021-01-22,"Unraveling molecular regulatory networks underlying disease progression is critically important for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying drug targets. The existing methods for inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) rely mainly on time-course gene expression data. However, most available omics data from cross-sectional studies of cancer patients often lack sufficient temporal information, leading to a key challenge for GRN inference. Through quantifying the latent progression using random walks-based manifold distance, we propose a latent-temporal progression-based Bayesian method, PROB, for inferring GRNs from the cross-sectional transcriptomic data of tumor samples. The robustness of PROB to the measurement variabilities in the data is mathematically proved and numerically verified. Performance evaluation on real data indicates that PROB outperforms other methods in both pseudotime inference and GRN inference. Applications to bladder cancer and breast cancer demonstrate that our method is effective to identify key regulators of cancer progression or drug targets. The identified ACSS1 is experimentally validated to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of bladder cancer cells, and the predicted FOXM1-targets interactions are verified and are predictive of relapse in breast cancer. Our study suggests new effective ways to clinical transcriptomic data modeling for characterizing cancer progression and facilitates the translation of regulatory network-based approaches into precision medicine.","Sun, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Ji; Nie, Qing",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968745/,290
16774,The effect of pessary treatment on puborectalis muscle function,2021-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU) physicians have extended the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) to deliver and monitor long-term volatile sedation in critically ill patients. There is limited evidence of MAC’s reliability in controlling sedation depth in this setting. We hypothesized that sedation depth, measured by the electroencephalography (EEG)-derived Narcotrend-Index (burst-suppression N_Index 0—awake N_Index 100), might drift downward over time despite constant MAC values. METHODS: This prospective single-centre randomized clinical study was conducted at a University Hospital Surgical Intensive Care Unit and included consecutive, postoperative ICU patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to receive uninterrupted inhalational sedation with isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane. The end-expiratory concentration of the anaesthetics and the EEG-derived index were measured continuously in time-stamped pairs. Sedation depth was also monitored using Richmond-Agitation-Sedation-Scale (RASS). The paired t-test and linear models (bootstrapped or multilevel) have been employed to analyze MAC, N_Index and RASS across the three groups. RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited (female/male: 10/20, age 64 ± 11, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II 30 ± 10). In the first 24 h, 21.208 pairs of data points (N_Index and MAC) were recorded. The median MAC of 0.58 ± 0.06 remained stable over the sedation time in all three groups. The t-test indicated in the isoflurane and sevoflurane groups a significant drop in RASS and EEG-derived N_Index in the first versus last two sedation hours. We applied a multilevel linear model on the entire longitudinal data, nested per patient, which produced the formula N_Index = 43 − 0.7·h (R(2) = 0.76), showing a strong negative correlation between sedation’s duration and the N_Index. Bootstrapped linear models applied for each sedation group produced: N_Index of 43–0.9, 45–0.8, and 43–0.4·h for isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, respectively. The regression coefficient for desflurane was almost half of those for isoflurane and sevoflurane, indicating a less pronounced time-effect in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining constant MAC does not guarantee stable sedation depth. Thus, the patients necessitate frequent clinical assessments or, when unfeasible, continuous EEG monitoring. The differences across different volatile anaesthetics regarding their time-dependent negative drift requires further exploration. Trial registration: NCT03860129.

Intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrations are associated with nutrient availability, but the mechanisms by which a cell responds to fluctuations in acetyl-CoA levels remain elusive. Here, we generate a cell system to selectively manipulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic levels of acetyl-CoA using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing and acetate supplementation of the culture media. Using this system and quantitative omics analyses, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA depletion alters the integrity of the nucleolus, impairing ribosomal RNA synthesis and evoking the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of p53. This nucleolar remodeling appears to be mediated through the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). Our findings highlight acetylation-mediated control of the nucleolus as an important hub linking acetyl-CoA fluctuations to cellular stress responses.","Houston, Ryan; Sekine, Shiori; Calderon, Michael J.; Seifuddin, Fayaz; Wang, Guanghui; Kawagishi, Hiroyuki; Malide, Daniela A.; Li, Yuesheng; Gucek, Marjan; Pirooznia, Mehdi; Nelson, Alissa J.; Stokes, Matthew P.; Stewart-Ornstein, Jacob; Mullett, Steven J.; Wendell, Stacy G.; Watkins, Simon C.; Finkel, Toren; Sekine, Yusuke",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7728262/,290

According to the WHO's 2020 report, a quarter of the world's population were infected with M. tuberculosis, and ~1.4 million people died of TB. Therefore, TB is a significant public health concern, which requires cost-effective strategies for prevention and treatment. The microbiota has been considered as a “forgotten organ” and a complex dynamic ecosystem, which plays a significant role in many physiological processes, and its dysbiosis is closely associated with infectious disease. Recently, a few studies have indicated associations between TB and microbiota. This review summarizes studies concerning the alterations of the gut and respiratory microbiota in TB, and their relationship with host susceptibility to M. tuberculosis infection, indicating that microbiota signatures in different stages in TB progression could be considered as biomarkers for TB diagnosis and control.

These domains play important roles in signaling, binding, prion formation, and functional phase separation. Azf1p is a prion-forming yeast transcription factor that contains two homorepeat domains, a polyglutamine and a polyasparagine domain. In this work, we report a new phenotype for Azf1p and identify a large set of genes that are regulated by Azf1p during growth in glucose. We show that the polyasparagine (polyN) domain plays a subtle role in transcription but is dispensable for Azf1p localization and prion formation. Genes upregulated upon deletion of the polyN domain are enriched in functions related to carbon metabolism and storage. This domain may therefore be a useful target for engineering yeast strains for fermentation applications and small molecule production. We also report that both the polyasparagine and polyglutamine domains vary in length across strains of S. cerevisiae and propose a model for how this variation may impact protein function.","Stewart, Taylor; Wolfe, Benjamin E.; Fuchs, Stephen M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8139511/,290

The mechanism of injury involves inhalation of water, lung injury and hypoxia. This systematic review addressed the following question: In drowning patients with lung injury, what is the evidence from primary studies regarding treatment strategies and subsequent patient outcomes? METHODS: The search strategy utilised PRISMA guidelines. Databases searched were MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS. There were no restrictions on publication date or age of participants. Quality of evidence was evaluated using GRADE methodology. RESULTS: Forty-one papers were included. The quality of evidence was very low. Seventeen papers addressed the lung injury of drowning in their research question and 24 had less specific research questions, however included relevant outcome data. There were 21 studies regarding extra-corporeal life support, 14 papers covering the theme of ventilation strategies, 14 addressed antibiotic use, seven papers addressed steroid use and five studies investigating diuretic use. There were no clinical trials. One retrospective comparison of therapeutic strategies was found. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations as to best practice when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient. Mechanical ventilation is associated with barotrauma in drowning patients, but the evidence predates the practice of lung protective ventilation. There was insufficient evidence to make recommendations regarding adjuvant therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Treating the lung injury of drowning has a limited evidentiary basis. There is an urgent need for comparative studies of therapeutic strategies in drowning.

Depletion of this transcriptionally activating mark by DOT1L deletion or high concentrations of the inhibitor pinometostat downregulates HOXA9 and MEIS1, and consequently reduces leukemia survival. Yet, some MLL-rearranged leukemias are inexplicably susceptible to low-dose pinometostat, far below concentrations that downregulate this canonical proliferation pathway. In this context, we define alternative proliferation pathways that more directly derive from H3K79me2 loss. By ICeChIP-seq, H3K79me2 is markedly depleted at pinometostat-downregulated and MLL-fusion targets, with paradoxical increases of H3K4me3 and loss of H3K27me3. Although downregulation of polycomb components accounts for some of the proliferation defect, transcriptional downregulation of FLT3 is the major pathway. Loss-of-FLT3-function recapitulates the cytotoxicity and gene expression consequences of low-dose pinometostat, whereas overexpression of constitutively active STAT5A, a target of FLT3-ITD-signaling, largely rescues these defects. This pathway also depends on MLL1, indicating combinations of DOT1L, MLL1 and FLT3 inhibitors should be explored for treating FLT3-mutant leukemia.","Richter, William F; Shah, Rohan N; Ruthenburg, Alexander J",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8315800/,290

We establish and study a new compartmental model for Lassa fever transmission including asymptomatic carriers, quarantine and periodic coefficients to model annual weather changes. We determine parameter values providing the best fit to data from Nigerian states Edo and Ondo from 2018–20. We perform uncertainty analysis and PRCC analysis to assess the importance of different parameters and numerical simulations to estimate the possible effects of control measures in eradicating the disease. The results suggest that the most important parameter which might be subject of control measures is death rate of mice, while mouse-to-human and human-to-human transmission rates also significantly influence the number of infected. However, decreasing the latter two parameters seems insufficient to eradicate the disease, while a parallel application of decreasing transmission rates and increasing mouse death rate might be able to stop the epidemic.","Barua, Saumen; Dénes, Attila; Ibrahim, Mahmoud A.",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8367792/,290

20318,An investigation of tuberculosis progression revealing the role of macrophages apoptosis via sensitivity and bifurcation analysis,2021-08-26,"The process of integrating observations into a numerical model of an evolving dynamical system, known as data assimilation, has become an essential tool in computational science. These methods, however, are computationally expensive as they typically involve large matrix multiplication and inversion. Furthermore, it is challenging to incorporate a constraint into the procedure, such as requiring a positive state vector. Here we introduce an entirely new approach to data assimilation, one that satisfies an information measure and uses the unnormalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, rather than the standard choice of Euclidean distance. Two sequential data assimilation algorithms are presented within this framework and are demonstrated numerically. These new methods are solved iteratively and do not require an adjoint. We find them to be computationally more efficient than Optimal Interpolation (3D-Var solution) and the Kalman filter whilst maintaining similar accuracy. Furthermore, these Kullback-Leibler data assimilation (KL-DA) methods naturally embed constraints, unlike Kalman filter approaches. They are ideally suited to systems that require positive valued solutions as the KL-DA guarantees this without need of transformations, projections, or any additional steps. This Kullback-Leibler framework presents an interesting new direction of development in data assimilation theory. The new techniques introduced here could be developed further and may hold potential for applications in the many disciplines that utilize data assimilation, especially where there is a need to evolve variables of large-scale systems that must obey physical constraints.","Pimentel, Sam; Qranfal, Youssef",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8389478/,290

The main purpose of this study was to explore if there was an association between unstable housing and hospital use for people who use opioids. METHODS: Analysis utilized self-reported data from the Alberta Health and Drug Use Survey which surveyed 813 Albertans in three cities. Hospital use was modeled using a logistic regression with our primary variable of interest being housing unstable status. Chi square tests were conducted between hospital use and variables associated with demographics, characteristics of drug use, health characteristics, and experiences of receiving services to establish model inclusion. RESULTS: Results revealed a significant association between housing instability and hospital use with unstably housed individuals twice as likely torequire hospital care.

20978,Role of Metastasis-Related microRNAs in Prostate Cancer Progression and Treatment,2021-09-06,"Employees in female-dominated sectors are exposed to high workloads, emotional job demands, and role ambiguity, and often have insufficient resources to deal with these demands. This imbalance causes strain, threatening employees’ work ability. The aim of this study was to examine whether resource-providing leadership at the workplace level buffers against the negative repercussions of these job demands on work ability. Employees (N = 2383) from 290 work groups across three countries (Germany, Finland, and Sweden) in female-dominated sectors were asked to complete questionnaires in this study. Employees rated their immediate supervisor’s resource-providing leadership and also self-reported their work ability, role ambiguity, workload, and emotional demands. Multilevel modeling was performed to predict individual work ability with job demands as employee-level predictors, and leadership as a group-level predictor. Work ability was poor when employees reported high workloads, high role ambiguity, and high emotional demands. Resource-providing leadership at the group level had a positive impact on employees’ work ability. We observed a cross-level interaction between emotional demands and resource-providing leadership. We conclude that resource-providing leadership buffers against the repercussions of emotional demands for the work ability of employees in female-dominated sectors; however, it is not influential in dealing with workload or role ambiguity.","Richter, Anne; Roczniewska, Marta; Loeb, Carina; Stempel, Christiane R.; Rigotti, Thomas",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431616/,290

21771,Water evaporation from solute-containing aerosol droplets: Effects of internal concentration and diffusivity profiles and onset of crust formation,2021-09-14,"5′-Nucleotidases (EC 3.1.3.5) are enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of 5′-ribonucleotides and 5′-deoxyribonucleotides to their respective nucleosides and phosphate. Most 5′-nucleotidases have broad substrate specificity and are multifunctional enzymes capable of cleaving phosphorus from not only mononucleotide phosphate molecules but also a variety of other phosphorylated metabolites. 5′-Nucleotidases are widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life and found in different cellular locations. The well-studied vertebrate 5′-nucleotidases play an important role in cellular metabolism. These enzymes are involved in purine and pyrimidine salvage pathways, nucleic acid repair, cell-to-cell communication, signal transduction, control of the ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools, etc. Although the first evidence of microbial 5′-nucleotidases was obtained almost 60 years ago, active studies of genetic control and the functions of microbial 5′-nucleotidases started relatively recently. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about microbial 5′-nucleotidases with a focus on their diversity, cellular localizations, molecular structures, mechanisms of catalysis, physiological roles, and activity regulation and approaches to identify new 5′-nucleotidases. The possible applications of these enzymes in biotechnology are also discussed. Key points • Microbial 5′-nucleotidases differ in molecular structure, hydrolytic mechanism, and cellular localization. • 5′-Nucleotidases play important and multifaceted roles in microbial cells. • Microbial 5′-nucleotidases have wide range of practical applications.

22552,1(st) International One Health Congress Abstracts: Plenary Abstracts,2011-01-22,"BACKGROUND: Influenza is a significant pathogen for long-term care facility (LTCF) residents. As part of a randomized controlled trial to assess early detection of influenza in LTCFs, we deployed rapid influenza detection tests (RIDTs) at intervention LTCFs. Our primary objectives for this interim analysis were to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Quidel Sofia® Influenza A+B Fluorescent Immunoassay RIDT in a high-risk, nontraditional population, and to describe the virology of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in LTCF residents. METHODS: Personnel at LCTFs identified cases of ARI, collected nasal specimens, and ran RIDTs from 10/21/2016 to 4/28/2017. The residual nasal swab and leftover lysis buffer were placed into a viral transport medium tube and sent to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene for confirmatory influenza RT-PCR testing. In addition, all specimens were tested for other viruses using the Luminex NxTAG® Respiratory Pathogen Panel. Sensitivity and specificity of the Sofia RIDT were calculated using RT-PCR results as the reference standard. RESULTS: Specimens were collected from 228 residents (mean age = 71.3 ± 22.4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to specimen collection was 1.4 ± 1.6 days (range: 0-7 days). Respiratory viruses were identified in 134/228 cases (58.8%); influenza viruses (A: 7.5% and B: 14.5%) were the most commonly detected virus by PCR, followed by rhinovirus/enterovirus (13.2%), RSV (11.0%) and coronaviruses (10.1%). The sensitivities of Sofia RIDT for influenza A and influenza B were 77.8% (95% CI: 52.4–93.6%) and 80.0% (95% CI: 61.4–92.3%), respectively, with specificities of 98.4% (95.3–99.7%) and 97.1% (93.4–99.1%), respectively. Overall performance assessment for influenza A or B yielded a sensitivity of 79.2% (65.0–89.5%) and specificity of 96.1% (91.7–98.6%). The estimated likelihood of discovering one of the first two influenza cases at a LTCF using this RIDT is estimated to be ≥95.7%. CONCLUSION: Although a wide constellation of respiratory viruses cause ARIs within LTCF populations, influenza is very common. Early ARI recognition in residents, with testing shortly after symptom onset, likely contributed to high performance of the Sofia RIDT. Use of RIDTs allows early identification of influenza with high sensitivity and specificity in elderly LTCF residents. DISCLOSURES: J.

While there are a large number of camels in East Africa, often traded to the Arabian Peninsula, no autochthonous human MERS-CoV case is reported in East Africa. Furthermore, there is limited information of MERS-CoV in East Africa. In this study, MERS-CoV in dromedary camels from Ethiopia was detected using RT-qPCR. Next-generation sequencing was used to obtain the full genome of MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV antibodies were also detected through MERS-spike pseudoparticle neutralization assay. Phylogenetic analysis of full-genome sequences and spike-genome antibodies indicates that MERS-CoV in East Africa is genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula. The results from this study show that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedary camels in East Africa are genetically distinct from those in the Arabian Peninsula. Further studies are needed to evaluate the risk of zoonotic transmission in East Africa.","Zhou, Ziqi; Chu, Daniel K W; Ali, Abraham; Demissié, Getnet F; Peiris, Malik",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6736029/,290

Pre-mRNA splicing, furthermore, relies on the spatial proximity of the splice junctions that can be separated by very long introns. Similar effects appear in the processing of RNA virus genomes. Albeit a crude measure, the distribution of spatial distances in thermodynamic equilibrium therefore provides useful information on the overall shape of the molecule can provide insights into the interplay of its functional domains. Spatial distance can be approximated by the graph-distance in RNA secondary structure. We show here that the equilibrium distribution of graph-distances between arbitrary nucleotides can be computed in polynomial time by means of dynamic programming. A naive implementation would yield recursions with a very high time complexity of O(n (11)). Although we were able to reduce this to O(n (6)) for many practical applications a further reduction seems difficult. We conclude, therefore, that sampling approaches, which are much easier to implement, are also theoretically favorable for most real-life applications, in particular since these primarily concern long-range interactions in very large RNA molecules.","Backofen, Rolf; Fricke, Markus; Marz, Manja; Qin, Jing; Stadler, Peter F.",Algorithms in Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114971/,290

23987,Immunologie,2010-05-26,"Vasculitis, characterized by inflammation and necrosis, manifests a wide spectrum of presentation by involving a vasculature of various sizes and locations. A definitive diagnosis of vasculitis invariably requires histologic confirmation since there are no diagnostic clinical, imaging, or laboratory findings. The most widely adopted vasculitis classification is the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) nomenclature of systemic vasculitis which integrated clinical symptoms, histopathologic features, and laboratory findings. This classification accounts for the size of the involved vessels. This chapter outlines the clinical and histologic features of the small-vessel vasculitis including the immune complex vasculitis and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; medium-vessel vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa and Kawasaki disease; large-vessel vasculitis, namely, giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis; variable-vessel vasculitis such as Behcet disease and Cogan syndrome; and vasculitis associated with systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus vasculitis, and sarcoid vasculitis. Vasculitis can also be secondary to drugs, infection, underlying systemic disease, or trauma. Therefore, a diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be based on histologic ground alone. Clinical pathologic correlation is necessary.","Hoang, Mai P.; Park, Joonsoo",Hospital-Based Dermatopathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120156/,290

24886,Emerging Risks Related to Food Technology,2011-03-09,"Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases as well as cancer pose great global health impacts on the society. Vaccines have emerged as effective treatments to prevent or reduce the burdens of already developed diseases. This is achieved by means of activating various components of the immune system to generate systemic inflammatory reactions targeting infectious agents or diseased cells for control/elimination. DNA virus-based genetic vaccines gained significant attention in the past decades owing to the development of DNA manipulation technologies, which allowed engineering of recombinant viral vectors encoding sequences for foreign antigens or their immunogenic epitopes as well as various immunomodulatory molecules. Despite tremendous progress in the past 50 years, many hurdles still remain for achieving the full clinical potential of viral-vectored vaccines. This chapter will present the evolution of vaccines from “live” or “attenuated” first-generation agents to recombinant DNA and viral-vectored vaccines. Particular emphasis will be given to human adenovirus (Ad) for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Ad biological properties related to vaccine development will be highlighted along with their advantages and potential hurdles to be overcome. In particular, we will discuss (1) genetic modifications in the Ad capsid protein to reduce the intrinsic viral immunogenicity, (2) antigen capsid incorporation for effective presentation of foreign antigens to the immune system, (3) modification of the hexon and fiber capsid proteins for Ad liver de-targeting and selective retargeting to cancer cells, (4) Ad-based vaccines carrying “arming” transgenes with immunostimulatory functions as immune adjuvants, and (5) oncolytic Ad vectors as a new therapeutic approach against cancer. Finally, the combination of adenoviral vectors with other non-adenoviral vector systems, the prime/boost strategy of immunization, clinical trials involving Ad-based vaccines, and the perspectives for the field development will be discussed.","Borovjagin, Anton V.; Gomez-Gutierrez, Jorge G.; Shirwan, Haval; Matthews, Qiana L.",Novel Technologies for Vaccine Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121347/,290

All this is discussed with special regard of the many new micro-organisms described in human pathology and also in situations in which the deliberate use of them for biological warfare or related menace (bioterrorism) is realized.","Ciafarone, Alessia; D’Amico, Argilia; Bologna, Mauro",Molecular Technologies for Detection of Chemical and Biological Agents,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123535/,290
26681,Novel vaccination strategies,2005,"The epidemics and pandemics of a few infectious diseases during the past couple of decades have accentuated the significance of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) due to their influence on public health. Although Asia region has been identified as the epicentre of many EIDs and upcoming infections, several new pathogens have also emerged in the past in other parts of the world. Furthermore, the emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A (H5N1), Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example threatening adversely both animal and public health globally. Infectious diseases are dynamic and concerning due to their epidemiology and aetiological agents, which is manifested within a host, pathogen and environment continuum involving domestic animals, wildlife and human populations. The complex relationship among host populations and other environmental factors creates conditions for the emergence of diseases. The factors driving the emergence of different emerging infectious disease (EID) interfaces include global travel, urbanisation and biomedical manipulations for human EIDs; agricultural intensification for domestic animal EIDs; translocation for wildlife EIDs; human encroachment, ex situ contact and ecological manipulation for wildlife–human EIDs; encroachment, new introductions and ‘spill-over’ and ‘spill-back’; and technology and industry for domestic animal–human EIDs. The concepts of sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures and biosecurity have gained recognition globally in almost all the realms of human activities, including livestock health and production management. This chapter provides the experience gained in the control and management of a few important TADs and EIDs along with the successes, constraints, limitations and future research needs for developing better control approaches.","Yadav, Mahendra Pal; Singh, Raj Kumar; Malik, Yashpal Singh",Emerging and Transboundary Animal Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123659/,290

The recent findings reviewed here highlight that NK cells can exhibit different predilictions for tissue compartments, i.e., lymph nodes, inflamed tissues, etc., where they can play an important role as active participants in directing DC maturation and T cell response polarization and/or as cytotoxic effector cells. The mechanisms regulating tissue-selective NK cell homing and functional specialization are just starting to be unraveled, but the importance of tissue microenvironment is becoming increasingly clear. An example is given by decidual NK cells whose differentiation, accumulation and functional program are under hormonal influence.","Gismondi, Angela; Santoni, Angela",Lymphocyte Trafficking in Health and Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123677/,290

The disease is diffused in tropical areas, where it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. P. falciparum is the most dangerous species, mainly affecting young children. The parasite cycle occurs both in humans (asexual stages) and in mosquitoes (sexual stages). In humans, Plasmodium grows and multiplies within red blood cells using hemoglobin as essential source of nutrients and energy. However, this process generates toxic heme that the parasite aggregates into an insoluble inert biocrystal called hemozoin. This molecule sequesters in various organs (liver, spleen, and brain), potentially contributing to the development of malaria immunopathogenesis. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria clinical frame ranges from asymptomatic infection to classic symptoms such as fever, chills, sweating, headache, and muscle aches. However, malaria can also evolve into severe life-threatening complications, including cerebral malaria, severe anemia, respiratory distress, and acute renal failure.","Giribaldi, Giuliana; D’Alessandro, Sarah; Prato, Mauro; Basilico, Nicoletta",Human and Mosquito Lysozymes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123976/,290

Fostering students’ scientific and technological literacy has, therefore, become a primary goal for many science educators. Yet the concept of scientific literacy is itself not at all clear. In this article, we contest the dominant approach, which defines scientific literacy in terms of what scientists produce or do. We argue that a more viable approach begins by framing a more general project of (democratic) citizenship and asks what kind of scientific literacy can contribute to this project. The different parts of our argument are illustrated with data from a three-year ethnographic study of science in one community. These data feature adult residents who were dealing with the contested issue of whether or not to extend the existing water main in order to supply with water a part of the community that, at the time, had to rely on seasonally contaminated wells. Irrespective of their science background, these citizens engaged scientists. We argue that educating for citizenship presupposes participation in democratic processes, a stance that has considerable implications for science education.","Roth, Wolff-Michael; Désautels, Jacques",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149063/,290

Even this is complicated, as it is impossible to generalize with this virus, due to marked differences in the biologic behavior of the myriad virus strains, plus the marked effects of a large number of host factors. It is now known that the MHV group is represented by numerous variants that are constantly mutating, and that these viruses can be biologically separated into respiratory (polytropic) MHVs and enterotropic MHVs, with distinctly different patterns of tissue tropism. This dichotomy is emphasized for discussion, but biology is never absolute. Many of the early MHV isolations are made as a result of contamination of biological materials that correlated with their polytropic biologic behavior. Their stated tropisms frequently were the result of the investigators' research interests and many have therefore been subjected to selective passage that favors a particular tissue tropism. All MHV isolates are related genetically and antigenically, but isolates can be differentiated by genetic sequencing, cross-serum neutralization, or with monoclonal antibodies. Genetic and antigenic relationships are not predictive of biologic behavior.","W. Barthold, Stephen; L.

There are five distinct physiographic areas on the slope, each separated by sharp boundaries which mostly correspond to boundaries between features on the cliffs above. The physiography is a consequence of a series of landslides of different, but unknown, ages. A model of the physiographic history is presented. Each physiographic area supports a different vegetation community, also separated by sharp boundaries. The present structure of two communities, Melaleuca howeana scrub and Howea forsterana forest, is a consequence of damage by feral animals. Melaleuca scrub has replaced Cyperus lucidus sedgeland destroyed by goats (Capra hircus) browsing from 1914 until their extermination in 1955. Howea forest has a markedly unimodal age distribution with very few small individuals of the dominant palms. This is a result of the combined effects of browsing by goats on small palms, and seed predation by black rats (Rattus rattus) from the 1920s, preventing regeneration. Unless rat numbers are periodically reduced to reduce seed predation, regeneration may be insufficient to guarantee long‐term survival of the forest.","PICKARD, JOHN",Austral Ecol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7175997/,290

Exotic species, particularly in disturbed environments, had the highest foliage nutrient concentrations. Results presented here showed that foliage nutrient concentrations are consistent with definitions of these groups on the basis of total soil phosphorus.

This hypothesis suggests that moderate exercise has the ability to improve immune function above sedentary levels while high intensity exercise depresses the immune system. However, some methodological problems exist in studies of the J-curve which makes evidence more anecdotal than evidence-based regarding the role of moderate and intense exercise in the incidence of URTI.

However, since the ignorance of the fact that data in different modalities shares similar distributions in feature space, most works did not mining the inter-modal distribution relationships completely, which eventually leads to unacceptable common features. To address this issue, we propose the deep multimodal clustering with cross reconstruction method, which firstly focuses on multimodal feature extraction in an unsupervised way and then clusters these extracted features. The proposed cross reconstruction aims to build latent connections among different modalities, which effectively reduces the distribution differences in feature space. The theoretical analysis shows that the cross reconstruction reduces the Wasserstein distance of multimodal feature distributions. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves obviously improvement over several state-of-arts.","Zhang, Xianchao; Tang, Xiaorui; Zong, Linlin; Liu, Xinyue; Mu, Jie",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206244/,290

This is coupled with debates about the nature of living and working patterns through intensive utilisation of information and telecommunication technologies, leading to the social and institutional acceptability of these patterns as the ‘new normal.’ The primary objective of this article is to instigate a discourse about the potential contribution of architecture and urban design and planning in generating knowledge that responds to pressing questions about future considerations of post pandemic architecture and urbanism. Methodologically, the discussion is based on a trans-disciplinary framework, which is utilised for conceptual analysis and is operationalized by identifying and discoursing design and planning implications. The article underscores relevant factors; originates insights for areas where future research will be critically needed, through key areas: a) Issues related to urban dynamics are delineated from the perspective of urban and human geography, urban design and planning, and transportation engineering; b) Questions that pertain to socio-spatial implications and urban space/ urban life dialectics stem from the field of environmental psychology; and c) Deliberations about new environments that accommodate new living/working styles supervene from ethnographical and anthropological perspectives. The article concludes with an outlook that captures key aspects of the needed synergy between architectural and urban education, research, and practice and public health in a post pandemic virtual and global world.","Salama, Ashraf M.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219560/,290

As for antibiotics, intravenous fluid administration should follow the four Ds: drug, dosing, duration, de-escalation. Among crystalloids, balanced solutions limit acid–base alterations and chloride load and should be preferred, as this likely prevents renal dysfunction. Among colloids, albumin, the only available natural colloid, may have beneficial effects. The last decade has seen growing interest in the potential harms related to fluid overloading. In the perioperative setting, appropriate fluid management that maintains adequate organ perfusion while limiting fluid administration should represent the standard of care. Protocols including a restrictive continuous fluid administration alongside bolus administration to achieve hemodynamic targets have been proposed. A similar approach should be considered also for critically ill patients, in whom increased endothelial permeability makes this strategy more relevant. Active de-escalation protocols may be necessary in a later phase. The R.O.S.E. conceptual model (Resuscitation, Optimization, Stabilization, Evacuation) summarizes accurately a dynamic approach to fluid therapy, maximizing benefits and minimizing harms. Even in specific categories of critically ill patients, i.e., with trauma or burns, fluid therapy should be carefully applied, considering the importance of their specific aims; maintaining peripheral oxygen delivery, while avoiding the consequences of fluid overload.","Malbrain, Manu L.

33287,Basics of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM),2020-05-30,"The 1-2-3 Conjecture states that every nice graph G (without component isomorphic to [Formula: see text]) admits a proper 3-labelling, i.e., a labelling of the edges with 1, 2, 3 such that no two adjacent vertices are incident to the same sum of labels. Another interpretation of this conjecture is that every nice graph G can be turned into a locally irregular multigraph M, i.e., with no two adjacent vertices of the same degree, by replacing each edge by at most three parallel edges. In other words, for every nice graph G, there should exist a locally irregular multigraph M with the same adjacencies and having few edges. We study proper labellings of graphs with the extra requirement that the sum of assigned labels must be as small as possible. That is, given a graph G, we are looking for a locally irregular multigraph [Formula: see text] with the fewest edges possible that can be obtained from G by replacing edges with parallel edges. This problem is quite different from the 1-2-3 Conjecture, as we prove that there is no k such that [Formula: see text] can always be obtained from G by replacing each edge with at most k parallel edges. We investigate several aspects of this problem. We prove that the problem of designing proper labellings with minimum label sum is [Formula: see text]-hard in general, but solvable in polynomial time for graphs with bounded treewidth. We also conjecture that every nice connected graph G admits a proper labelling with label sum at most [Formula: see text], which we verify for several classes of graphs.","Bensmail, Julien; Fioravantes, Foivos; Nisse, Nicolas",Combinatorial Algorithms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7254921/,290

Although music within the field of AI has been studied relatively extensively, the arena in which we operate is, to the best of our knowledge, unexplored. When it concerns computer composition, a noteworthy piece of research has involved the automated generation of the chordal notes when the underlying melody is specified. The chordal notes and beats have been generated based on models of well-known composers like Bach, Beethoven, and so on. The problem we study is the converse. We assume that the system is provided with the chords of some unknown melody. Our task is to generate a melody that flows with the given chords and which is also aesthetically and musically fitting. As far as we know, there is no research that has been reported to solve this problem and in that sense, although we have merely provided “baby steps”, our work is pioneering.","Helmy, I.; John Oommen, B.",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256408/,290

The ABC algorithm combines different initial populations and generation of new food source methods, including a moving operations technique and a local search method increasing the variable neighbourhood search that, as a result, improves the solution quality. The algorithm is validated and its performance is tested in a static environment in 9 instances of Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) from Brandimarte dataset obtaining in 5 instances the best known for the instance under study and a new best known in instance mk05. The work also focus in developing tools to process the information on the factory through the development of solutions when facing disruptions and dynamic events. Three real-time events are considered on the dynamic environment: jobs cancellation, operations cancellation and new jobs arrival. Two scenarios are studied for each real-time event: the first situation considers the minimization of the disruption between the previous schedule and the new one and the second situation generates a completely new schedule after the occurrence. Summarizing, six adaptations of ABC algorithm are created to solve dynamic environment scenarios and their performances are compared with the benchmarks of two case studies outperforming both.","Ferreira, Inês C.; Firme, Bernardo; Martins, Miguel S.

In this work, we have developed an adaptive framework for efficient online remote visualization of critical weather applications. We present three algorithms, namely, most-recent, auto-clustering and adaptive, for reducing lag between the simulation and visualization times. Using experiments with different network configurations, we find that the adaptive algorithm strikes a good balance in providing reduced lags and visualizing most representative frames, with up to 72% smaller lag than auto-clustering, and 37% more representative than most-recent for slow networks.","Malakar, Preeti; Natarajan, Vijay; Vadhiyar, Sathish S.",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7302828/,290

Link prediction in dynamic social networks is an essential problem in social network analysis. Although different methods have been proposed to enhance the performance of link prediction, these methods need significant improvement in accuracy. In this study, we focus on the temporal behavior of social networks to predict potential future interactions. We examine the evolving pattern of vertices of a given network [Formula: see text] over time. We introduce a time-varying score function to evaluate the activeness of vertices that uses the number of new interactions and the number of frequent interactions with existing connections. To consider the impact of timestamps of the interactions, the score function engages a time difference of the current time and the time of the interaction occurred. Many existing studies ignored the weight of the link in the given network [Formula: see text], which brings the time-varied details of the links. We consider two additional objective functions in our model: a weighted shortest distance between any two nodes and a weighted common neighbor index. We used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a deep learning architecture as a classifier to predict the link formation in the future and define our model as a binary classification problem. To evaluate our model, we train and test with six real-world dynamic networks and compare it with state-of-the-art methods as well as classic methods. The results confirm that our proposed method outperforms most of the state-of-the-art methods.","Selvarajah, Kalyani; Kobti, Ziad; Kargar, Mehdi",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304046/,290

For each channel, only absolute spectral value is used to calculate the spectral similarity between the current frame pixel and reference average value in the matching process, which can simplify the matching equations. Besides, the deciding boundaries are obtained based on statistical information extracted from the data and always adjusting themselves to the scene changes. Results demonstrate that with the proposed techniques, we can acquire a comparable accuracy with other methods using the same multispectral dataset for background subtraction.","Liu, Rongrong; Ruichek, Yassine; El Bagdouri, Mohammed",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340888/,290

This was a prospective observational diagnostic accuracy study in a third-level neonatal intensive care unit. Preterm infants with a gestational age below 32 weeks were included. A LUS score (range 0–24 points) was calculated by assessing aeration semiquantitatively (0–3 points) in eight lung zones on the 7th day of life (DOL) and repeated on the 28th DOL. ROC curves and logistic regression were used for analysis. Forty-two preterm infants were included. The LUS on the 7th DOL had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87–1) for the prediction of sBPD (optimal cutoff of ≥8 points: sensitivity 93%, specificity 91%). The LUS score was independently associated with sBPD [OR 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1–3.9), p = 0.022, for each additional point in the score]. Conclusions: Lung aeration as assessed by LUS on the 7th DOL may predict the development of sBPD.","Oulego-Erroz, Ignacio; Alonso-Quintela, Paula; Terroba-Seara, Sandra; Jiménez-González, Aquilina; Rodríguez-Blanco, Silvia",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358564/,290
37333,Malaria Elimination in India: Bridging the Gap Between Control and Elimination,2020-07-29,"Deep-sea mussels of the subfamily Bathymodiolinae are common and numerically dominant species widely distributed in cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. During long-time evolution, deep-sea mussels have evolved to be well adapted to the local environment of cold seeps and hydrothermal vents by various ways, especially by establishing endosymbiosis with chemotrophic bacteria. However, biological processes underlying the establishment and maintenance of symbiosis between host mussels and symbionts are largely unclear. In the present study, Gigantidas platifrons genes possibly involved in the symbiosis with methane oxidation symbionts were identified and characterized by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pull-down and in situ hybridization. Five immune related proteins including Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), integrin, vacuolar sorting protein (VSP), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), and leucine-rich repeat (LRR-1) were identified by LPS pull-down assay. These five proteins were all conserved in either molecular sequences or functional domains and known to be key molecules in host immune recognition, phagocytosis, and lysosome-mediated digestion. Furthermore, in situ hybridization of LRR-1, TLR2 and VSP genes was conducted to investigate their expression patterns in gill tissues of G. platifrons. Consequently, LRR-1, TLR2, and VSP genes were found expressed exclusively in the bacteriocytes of G. platifrons. Therefore, it was suggested that TLR2, integrin, VSP, MMP1, and LRR-1 might be crucial molecules in the symbiosis between G. platifrons and methane oxidation bacteria by participating in symbiosis-related immune processes.

Controversy and ongoing discussion remains about the validity and appropriateness of teleneuropsychology, but provider and patient risk associated with in-person testing needs to be considered when cognitive evaluation is warranted. We describe the remote evaluation of a man hospitalized with altered mental status and positive COVID-19 infection and the effectiveness of teleneuropsychology in clarifying cognition/assisting clinical management in a non-English-speaking individual with limited formal education. METHOD: 35 year old Spanish-speaking male with no formal education referred for inpatient neuropsychological consultation to rule in/rule out possible encephalopathy and confirm premorbid cognitive functioning. Cognitive evaluation completed using iPad and Zoom technology at bedside. RESULTS: Tele-neuropsychology was conducted in the patient’s primary language without the necessity for PPE, which enabled improved engagement. Although testing had to be modified; the environment could not be controlled; and all cognitive domains could not be evaluated—remote evaluation confirmed fluctuations and variability, both within and between tasks, with notable fluxes in attention, comprehension and speech.

It is infectious to humans and is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak which has elicited an emergency in public health and a call for immediate international concern has been linked to it. The coronavirus main proteinase which is also known as the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a very important protein in all coronaviruses for the role it plays in the replication of the virus and the proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins. The resultant cytotoxic effect which is a product of consistent viral replication and proteolytic processing of polyproteins can be greatly reduced through the inhibition of the viral main proteinase activities. This makes the 3C-like protease of the coronavirus a potential and promising target for therapeutic agents against the viral infection. RESULTS: This study describes the detailed computational process by which the 2019-nCoV main proteinase coding sequence was mapped out from the viral full genome, translated and the resultant amino acid sequence used in modeling the protein 3D structure. Comparative physiochemical studies were carried out on the resultant target protein and its template while selected HIV protease inhibitors were docked against the protein binding sites which contained no co-crystallized ligand. CONCLUSION: In line with results from this study which has shown great consistency with other scientific findings on coronaviruses, we recommend the administration of the selected HIV protease inhibitors as first-line therapeutic agents for the treatment of the current coronavirus epidemic.","Durojaye, Olanrewaju Ayodeji; Mushiana, Talifhani; Uzoeto, Henrietta Onyinye; Cosmas, Samuel; Udowo, Victor Malachy; Osotuyi, Abayomi Gaius; Ibiang, Glory Omini; Gonlepa, Miapeh Kous",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7529470/,290

In this study, we have standardized a highly specific and reproducible multiplexing mass spectrometry method using the tandem mass tag (TMT) strategy in combination with depletion of abundant proteins from serum and high-pH reversed-phase peptide fractionation. Differential proteome profiling of 4 year-old DMD boys (n = 9) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 9) identified 38 elevated and 50 decreased serum proteins (adjusted P < 0.05, FDR <0.05) in the DMD group relative to the healthy control group. As expected, we confirmed previously reported biomarkers but also identified novel biomarkers. These included novel muscle injury-associated biomarkers such as telethonin, smoothelin-like protein 1, cofilin-1, and plectin, additional muscle-specific enzymes such as UTP–glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase PKM, lactotransferrin, tissue alpha-l-fucosidase, pantetheinase, and ficolin-1, and some pro-inflammatory and cell adhesion-associated biomarkers such as leukosialin, macrophage receptor MARCO, vitronectin, galectin-3-binding protein, and ProSAAS. The workflow including serum depletion, sample processing, and mass spectrometry analysis was found to be reproducible and stable over time with CV < 20%. Furthermore, the method was found to be superior in terms of specificity compared to other multiplexing affinity-based methods. These findings demonstrate the specificity and reliability of TMT-based mass spectrometry methods in detection and identification of serum biomarkers in presymptomatic young DMD patients.","Alayi, Tchilabalo D.; Tawalbeh, Shefa M.; Ogundele, Michael; Smith, Holly R.; Samsel, Alison M.; Barbieri, Marissa L.; Hathout, Yetrib",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7581259/,290

We view the inspection of a product at a retail location as a search for product fit. We quantify the cost and benefit from searching for product fit using a discrete choice model of demand with optimal sequential search. In these models, the benefit of searching is measured by the standard deviation of the product fit and has, heretofore, been fixed to one in estimation. We show that, with an exogenous search cost shifter, both the cost and benefit of searching can be separately estimated. Our empirical setting is the U.S. automotive market. We assemble a unique data set containing individual-level smartphone geolocation data that inform us about dealership visits. We also obtain information on new vehicle purchases from proprietary DMV registration data. Our exogenous cost shifter is the distance a consumer must travel to visit a dealership. Our results show that the benefit provided by dealerships to consumers is substantial. Within our empirical context, failure to estimate the standard deviation of the product fit leads to biased search cost and consumer surplus estimates and to inaccurate predictions regarding consumers’ number of searches and effects of at-home test drive programs.","Yavorsky, Dan; Honka, Elisabeth; Chen, Keith",Quant Mark Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585835/,290

None seems immune to the virus and to the economic consequences of the lockdown measures imposed to contain its diffusion. We exploit novel data from two real-time surveys to study the early impact on the labor market of the lockdown in Italy—one of the two countries, with China, hit hard and early. We find that low-educated workers, blue collars, and low-income service workers were more likely to have stopped working both 3-week and 6-week after the lockdown. Low-educated workers were less likely to work from home. Blue collars worked more from their regular workplace, but not from home. Low-income service workers were instead less likely to work from the regular workplace. For both blue collars and low-income service workers, the monthly labor income dropped already in March. Some positive adjustments took place between the 3rd and the 6th week from the lockdown: the share of idle workers dropped, as the proportion of individuals working at home and from their regular workplace increased. However, these adjustments benefited mostly highly educated workers and white collars. Overall, low-income individuals faced worse labor market outcomes and suffered higher psychological costs.

Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators during viral infection. Emerging data demonstrates that lncRNAs play essential roles at the host pathogen interface modulating viral infection by either antiviral response at distinct level including pathogen recognition receptors or by epigenetic, transcriptional, and post‐transcriptional effects. Furthermore, differentially expressed lncRNAs may be employed as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for viral diseases. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of lncRNAs and their functions in viral infections with a specific focus on host‐virus responses. In addition, the potential implications of lncRNAs in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 will be discussed.","Ginn, Lucy; La Montagna, Manuela; Wu, Qinghua; Shi, Lei",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753287/,290

Growing evidence has shown that the active ingredients from TCM have antibacterial, antiproliferative, antioxidant, and apoptosis-inducing features. However, poor solubility and low bioavailability limit clinical application of active compounds from TCM. “Nanoformulations” (NFs) are novel and advanced drug-delivery systems. They show promise for improving the solubility and bioavailability of drugs. In particular, “smart responsive NFs” can respond to the special external and internal stimuli in targeted sites to release loaded drugs, which enables them to control the release of drug within target tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated that smart responsive NFs can achieve targeted release of active compounds from TCM at disease sites to increase their concentrations in diseased tissues and reduce the number of adverse effects. Here, we review “internal stimulus–responsive NFs” (based on pH and redox status) and “external stimulus–responsive NFs” (based on light and magnetic fields) and focus on their application for active compounds from TCM against tumors and infectious diseases, to further boost the development of TCM in modern medicine.","Jiang, Xuejun; Lin, Mei; Huang, Jianwen; Mo, Mulan; Liu, Houhe; Jiang, Yuan; Cai, Xiaowen; Leung, Wingnang; Xu, Chuanshan",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758496/,290
44353,Nachruf auf Prof. Dr. med. Dr. med. dent. Dieter Weingart,2021-01-07,"In recent years, aged care living has drawn attention because of population aging and extension of average lifespan. Moreover, the rapid development of information communication technology and the internet of things lay the foundation for the application of sensor networks and cloud computing on medical care. Most elderly often suffer from chronic diseases due to weaker immunity causing a higher infection risk. The problem of infection controlling is an essential issue for residences living in aged care facilities. In the past, for infection control, medical personnel use the manual method of tracking, investigating, and interviewing patients to obtain patient contact list. This method cannot identify residents who have a high risk of infection, distinguish the distance between patients and other residents, and evaluate the risk of infection. To isolate all the residents who contact patients is the only solution that does not only cause repulsion of other residents but also waste medical resources. This study proposes a visual infection control positioning system for aged care facilities using the RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology and IoT technology. It can calculate the distance between users and reduce the positioning error. The system combines location fingerprinting with the K-nearest neighbor algorithm to fix errors caused by signal fluctuation of RFID to improve the positioning accuracy. The system records the indoor movement path of the residents in a real-time manner through the positioning function. When infectious diseases spread in aged care living residences, to help medical personnel, the system can screen out residents with a high risk of infection who closely contact with patients according to the movement path of the patients and other residents, and visually display them. For some infectious diseases, residents who live together with patients may be infected even if they do not have contact with the patients closely. This system can also identify the residents whose cumulative contact time exceeds the limit according to the medical definition of various infectious diseases and input time value.","Hung, Lun-Ping; Hsieh, Nan-Chen; Chen, Chien-Liang",Mobile Netw Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786346/,290

PURPOSE: This study aimed to determine the exit-knowledge level and its determinants among patients attending outpatient pharmacy of the Ambo General Hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 study participants who visited the outpatient pharmacy in Ambo General Hospital from October to December 2019. Face-to-face interview was conducted using structured questionnaires to assess the exit-knowledge of the patients about their dispensed medication at the pharmacy exit. A binary logistic regression was employed to determine factors associated with the exit-knowledge. The association was statistically significant at 95% of confidence interval with a p-value less than 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients participated in the study with a 100% response rate. Of the total, 222 (55.5%) patients had sufficient exit-knowledge about their dispensed medication. Patients in the age group of 19–29 (AOR=3.1; 95% CI (1.7–5.6) and 49 −59 (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI (2.3–6.0)) had greater exit-knowledge than the elderly participants (>60 years). Participants who reported the comfort of the waiting area was not suitable had lower odds of sufficient exit-knowledge (AOR= 0.7; 95% CI (0.2–3.0)) in comparison to those who reported a suitable waiting area. Lower odds of sufficient exit-knowledge (AOR=0.4; 95% CI (0.3–0.7)) was determined among those who responded fairly clarity of the dispensers guidance in comparison with those reported clear guidance. The gender and the residence of the participants were also had a significant association with the exit-knowledge level. CONCLUSION: Modest number of the patients had sufficient exit-knowledge of their dispensed medication. Age, gender, residence, perceived comfort of the waiting area and perceived clarity of the pharmacists’ guidances were significantly associated with the exit-knowledge.","Eticha, Endalkachew Mekonnen; Gemechu, Workineh Diriba",Patient Prefer Adherence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7797343/,290
44750,Detection of microplastics in human colectomy specimens,2020-11-21,"Smoking is a risk factor for periodontal disease, and a cause of oral microbiome dysbiosis. While this has been evaluated for traditional cigarette smoking, there is limited research on the effect of other tobacco types on the oral microbiome. This study investigates subgingival microbiome composition in smokers of different tobacco types and their effect on periodontal health. Subgingival plaques were collected from 40 individuals, including smokers of either cigarettes, medwakh, or shisha, and non-smokers seeking dental treatment at the University Dental Hospital in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. The entire (~ 1500 bp) 16S rRNA bacterial gene was fully amplified and sequenced using Oxford Nanopore technology. Subjects were compared for the relative abundance and diversity of subgingival microbiota, considering smoking and periodontal condition. The relative abundances of several pathogens were significantly higher among smokers, such as Prevotella denticola and Treponema sp. OMZ 838 in medwakh smokers, Streptococcus mutans and Veillonella dispar in cigarette smokers, Streptococcus sanguinis and Tannerella forsythia in shisha smokers. Subgingival microbiome of smokers was altered even in subjects with no or mild periodontitis, probably making them more prone to severe periodontal diseases. Microbiome profiling can be a useful tool for periodontal risk assessment. Further studies are recommended to investigate the impact of tobacco cessation on periodontal disease progression and oral microbiome.","Al Kawas, Sausan; Al-Marzooq, Farah; Rahman, Betul; Shearston, Jenni A.; Saad, Hiba; Benzina, Dalenda; Weitzman, Michael",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7806658/,290

45255,Nieuws,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that exposure to air pollution may increase stroke risk, but the results remain inconsistent. Evidence of more recent studies is highly warranted, especially gas air pollutants. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify studies till February 2020 and conducted a meta-analysis on the association between air pollution (PM(2.5), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm; PM(10), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm; NO(2), nitrogen dioxide; SO(2), sulfur dioxide; CO, carbon monoxide; O(3), ozone) and stroke (hospital admission, incidence, and mortality). Fixed- or random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (OR)/hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for a 10 μg/m(3) increase in air pollutant concentration. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies conducted from more than 23 million participants were included in our meta-analysis. Meta-analyses showed significant associations of all six air pollutants and stroke hospital admission (e.g., PM(2.5): OR = 1.008 (95% CI 1.005, 1.011); NO(2): OR = 1.023 (95% CI 1.015, 1.030), per 10 μg/m(3) increases in air pollutant concentration). Exposure to PM(2.5), SO(2), and NO(2) was associated with increased risks of stroke incidence (PM(2.5): HR = 1.048 (95% CI 1.020, 1.076); SO(2): HR = 1.002 (95% CI 1.000, 1.003); NO(2): HR = 1.002 (95% CI 1.000, 1.003), respectively). However, no significant differences were found in associations of PM(10), CO, O(3), and stroke incidence. Except for CO and O(3), we found that higher level of air pollution (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2)) exposure was associated with higher stroke mortality (e.g., PM(10): OR = 1.006 (95% CI 1.003, 1.010), SO(2): OR = 1.006 (95% CI 1.005, 1.008). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to air pollution was positively associated with an increased risk of stroke hospital admission (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), NO(2), CO, and O(3)), incidence (PM(2.5), SO(2), and NO(2)), and mortality (PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), and NO(2)). Our study would provide a more comprehensive evidence of air pollution and stroke, especially SO(2) and NO(2).

45586,"Test antigénique, mode d’emploi",2021-02-09,"Likert scales are useful for collecting data on attitudes and perceptions from large samples of people. In particular, they have become a well-established tool in soundscape studies for conducting in situ surveys to determine how people experience urban public spaces. However, it is still unclear whether the metrics of the scales are consistently interpreted during a typical assessment task. The current work aims at identifying some general trends in the interpretation of Likert scale metrics and introducing a procedure for the derivation of metric corrections by analyzing a case study dataset of 984 soundscape assessments across 11 urban locations in London. According to ISO/TS 12913-2:2018, soundscapes can be assessed through the scaling of 8 dimensions: pleasant, annoying, vibrant, monotonous, eventful, uneventful, calm, and chaotic. The hypothesis underlying this study is that a link exists between correlations across the percentage of assessments falling in each Likert scale category and a dilation/compression factor affecting the interpretation of the scales metric. The outcome of this metric correction value derivation is introduced for soundscape, and a new projection of the London soundscapes according to the corrected circumplex space is compared with the initial ISO circumplex space. The overall results show a general non-equidistant interpretation of the scales, particularly on the vibrant-monotonous direction. The implications of this correction have been demonstrated through a Linear Ridge Classifier task for predicting the London soundscape responses using objective acoustic parameters, which shows significant improvement when applied to the corrected data. The results suggest that the corrected values account for the non-equidistant interpretation of the Likert metrics, thereby allowing mathematical operations to be viable when applied to the data.","Lionello, Matteo; Aletta, Francesco; Mitchell, Andrew; Kang, Jian",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7862575/,290

Scholars have long debated whether the theories that explain foreign policy, overwhelmingly developed in western countries, are likely to explain the same phenomena elsewhere, especially in the Global South. Theories and approaches such as Almond’s Mood theory, domestic audience costs, bureaucratic politics, Groupthink, poliheuristic theory or foreign policy approaches that explain foreign policy in democracies have limited explanatory power over African countries, OAU and AU’s institutional foreign policy. This chapter examines the existence, absence, role and the sources of foreign policy in Africa—elites, bureaucracies, citizens, domestic audiences and the external stakeholders in the making of foreign policy. Foreign policy is a more recent area of growth in scholarship in global politics, and theory-testing around who the key actors, ideas and approaches continue to evolve. Though Africa’s post-colonial foreign policy was partly informed by colonial experiences and residual colonization, limited educational and political participation during colonialism impacted the ability of citizens to direct foreign policy and gave elites much latitude in crafting foreign policy. Still, once-consensus national, regional and Pan African goals were swept up in personality disagreements and regional vendettas. Still, understanding foreign policy from a theoretical perspective is invaluable; this chapter examines approaches that are more, or less likely, to explain foreign policy in Africa.","Magu, Stephen M.",Explaining Foreign Policy in Post-Colonial Africa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978756/,290

Part-I of the chapter focuses on the Microwave range of the EM spectrum. With the advent of smart technologies, Microwave has reached each house and every individual, which makes precise and traceable electromagnetic measurements and hazardless interconnectivity very important. CSIR-NPL (NMI of the country) provides measurements for microwave frequencies from 9 kHz to 110 GHz frequency range that are precise, accurate, reliable, internationally recognized and traceable to the SI units through Microwave Metrology. The Microwave based National Standards and measurement capabilities are realized, established, maintained, and upgraded at CSIR-NPL. These standards are disseminated to reference laboratories across India to provide traceability to various sectors: strategic, defence, manufacturers, testing industries, government regulators and research institutions. Microwave metrology at CSIR-NPL has a unique combination of comprehensive capabilities of various parameters of Electromagnetics such as attenuation, microwave power, E-Field and specific absorption rate (SAR), along with various free space measurements parameters. Upcoming 5G technology is not just a routine technological change but a platform to enable several smart technologies such as smart banking, smart city, smart village, smart healthcare smart automobile and many more. This shows the overall impact of Microwave metrology on country’s upcoming technological needs. Based on impact analysis of dissemination of microwave metrology by the NMI of India, its role on technological revolution will be discussed in detail. This chapter comprises of closed system microwave parameters such as attenuation, impedance, insertion loss followed by free space microwave measurements such as Electric Filed, SAR, Shielding effectiveness, dielectric measurements along with advanced Quantum E-Field measurements traceable to Plank Constant. Each parameter is discussed in terms of its associated primary standards, their calibration and measurement capabilities (CMCs) and their degree of equivalence with the leading NMIs of the world, and on-going research for advanced measurements including quantum standards. Next section of all microwave metrology parameters deals with their impact on quality infrastructure creation at strategic, defence and industrial fronts. How ministries, regulators, manufacturers, industries, academia and research institution directly/indirectly benefit from these parameters in terms of calibration, testing, training, human resource development and technical consultancy is discussed in detail. Questions related to the issues such as—the measurement challenges, effect on industrial certification and technical consultation, challenges for regulators to catch up with upcoming series of modified standards—associated with the advent of technology in electromagnetic domain are dealt with. The importance of a strong link amongst the ministries, regulators, NMI (CSIR-NPL) and industries evolving as a game changer to enhance export and improve the quality of import will be discussed.

Analysis of these programmes has tended to focus upon intent and scale of ambition. Despite growing emphasis on stakeholder engagement corporate approaches are continuing to originate from northern hemisphere derived ethics, governance and standards that are being uncritically applied in the global south. By applying insights from postcolonial studies, this paper argues that CSR approaches are both reproducing colonial approaches and northern hemisphere sponsored development programmes that followed independence. Consequently, CSR programmes are based upon Northern hemisphere knowledge and are reinforcing power differentials within and between regions. The chapter concludes by tentatively proposing how to re-position CSR out of the post-colonial trajectory and towards the delivery of more sustainable improvements. To do so will require the more philanthropic approach of companies operating in the southern hemisphere (Amaeshi et al., Corporate social responsibility in Nigeria: Western mimicry or indigenous influences? 2006; Frynas, International Affairs, 81:581–598; Kuhn et al., Business and Society 54:1–44, 2015) to become more engaging, strategic and sustainable.","Vertigans, Stephen",Global Challenges to CSR and Sustainable Development,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980962/,290

Less examined is how predatory financial investors have shaped the crisis and profited from it. We examine how U.S. shadow banks, such as private equity, venture capital, and hedge fund firms, have affected hardship and inequality during the crisis. First, we identify how these investors helped to hollow out the health care industry and disenfranchise the low-wage service sector, putting frontline workers at risk. We then outline how, as the downturn unfolds, shadow banks are shifting their investments in ways that profit on the misfortunes of frontline workers, vulnerable populations, and distressed industries. After the pandemic subsides and governments withdraw stimulus support, employment will likely remain insecure, many renters will face evictions, and entire economic sectors will need to rebuild. Shadow banks are planning accordingly to profit from the fallout of the crisis. We argue that this case reveals how financial investors accumulate capital through private and speculative investments that exploit vulnerabilities in the economic system during a time of crisis. To conclude, we consider the prospects for change and inequality over time.","Neely, Megan Tobias; Carmichael, Donna",Am Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7992100/,290

More specifically, we investigate how Hegel initiated the move from classical mechanicism to dialectics, thus rearranging the ruling scientific logic at his time. We do this by introducing some of the metaphysical assertions implied by mechanicism and showing how these assertions are scientifically inadequate in explicating the relation between the empirical matter and abstract representation of a given (developmental) phenomenon. This claim leads us to a discussion of the theory of knowledge offered by Hegel as opposed to Kant, and how these theories relate to the struggle between process and structure. Finally, we find that the subject is displaced in between observation and experience and thus epistemically constrained in its access to empirical matters. This fact draws attention to the importance of considering the metaphysical aspects of the sense-modalities, and how such aspects relate to any given developmental phenomenon. Overall the article illustrates the potentials of Hegelian dialectics for avoiding entrenched dualisms and static oppositions in future research.","Ebbesen, Denis Kiyak; Olsen, Jeppe",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8021211/,290

In order to find answers to this question, I examine about 50 letters to the editor from Swiss and German daily newspapers, all of which are related to COVID-19. In all letters, the writer presents an argument by telling a story. It turns out that the story usually serves as a premise for an argument from example in an argumentation with an evaluative standpoint. For the writers, unfolding such a premise as a narrative has the advantage that they can successively convey an evaluation together with the exemplary event. A socio-cultural benefit of such narrative arguments from example might be that they can easily connect the social micro-level with the societal macro-level in political debates.","Schröter, Juliane",Z Literaturwiss Linguistik,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8045440/,290

It is more common among patients with multiple comorbidities such as cardiac disease, kidney dysfunction, and hypertension requiring AV nodal blockers. Cardiac conduction abnormalities are frequently caused by severe hyperkalemia. However, it may also occur in mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia with concomitant use of AV nodal blockers due to the synergistic effects between these two factors in the presence of renal insufficiency. It is essential for the physician to identify BRASH syndrome as the treatment may differ from standard advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol. We report the two cases of patient who presented with BRASH syndrome who failed to respond to standard ACLS protocol.","Wong, Chui King; Jaafar, Mohd Johar",Turk J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8091996/,290

Nanomaterials have the ability to directly penetrate cancer cells and potentially achieve minimally invasive, precise and efficient tumor annihilation. As such, nanoscale metal organic frameworks (nMOFs) are becoming increasingly attractive as potential therapeutic agents in the medical field due to their high structural variability, good biocompatibility, ease of surface functionalization as well as their porous morphologies with tunable cavity sizes. This overview addresses five different common strategies used to find cancer therapies, while summarizing the recent progress in using nMOFs as cytotoxic cancer cell agents largely through in vitro studies, although some in vivo investigations have also been reported. Chemo and targeted therapies rely on drug encapsulation and delivery inside the cell, whereas photothermal and photodynamic therapies depend on photosensitizers. Concurrently, immunotherapy actively induces the body to destroy the tumor by activating an immune response. By choosing the appropriate metal center, ligands and surface functionalization, nMOFs can be utilized in all five types of therapies. In the last section, the future prospects and challenges of nMOFs with respect to the various therapies will be presented and discussed.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of infants treated with 1 or 2 courses of dexamethasone for BPD. Effectiveness was defined as successful step-down in respiratory support by end of treatment. Adverse effects on growth were analyzed and compared to untreated controls. RESULTS: A total of 132 dexamethasone-treated infants were identified. In total, 52% (69/132) of infants treated with initial dexamethasone achieved step-down in respiratory support compared to 38% (20/52) of infants with repeat dexamethasone. Growth trajectory did not significantly differ among infants treated with 1 or 2 courses of dexamethasone compared with controls (weight: P = 0.23, length: P = 0.68, and head circumference: P = 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: Repeat dexamethasone for BPD was less effective in weaning respiratory support compared to initial course. Changes in growth parameters to discharge were comparable between controls and infants treated with 1 or 2 dexamethasone courses.","Cuna, Alain; Quiqley, Anastasia; Varghese, Kevin; Ciccolari-Micaldi, Greta; Oliveros, Christian; Cheng, An-Lin; Norberg, Michael; Truog, William E.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8184867/,290

The motivation of writing this paper is to collect the information of various existing Internet of Things Architecture and Communication Techniques used in Healthcare Monitoring System to observe that how efficiently, different researchers have used it. So we have studied different real-time health monitoring system based on diseases which are common in elderly people like diabetes, blood pressure, heart disease, sleep apnea, and cancer, etc. In this real-time health monitoring system, researchers introduced many new measures, communication techniques like ZigBee, Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRawan), Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Apart from this, it was also observed that remote monitoring system in Healthcare is incomplete without data processing and early prediction in such diseases. Though, Machine learning provides efficient techniques to extract knowledge from diagnostic medical datasets collected from the patients. That is why we highlighted the current role of various Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, etc., for processing of Healthcare data and also helpful to predict the output more precisely.","Verma, Navneet; Singh, Sukhdip; Prasad, Devendra",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8188533/,290

This observation is also avowed in over the world. The present study extends the theory of planned behavior (TPB) by incorporating relevant variables from Self-determination Theory (SDT). The latter suggests that individuals persist with a behavior when they are internally motivated than externally motivated. Online survey was administrated to assess TPB constructs (attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral control (PBC), personal moral) and two of SDT factors (autonomous and controlled). 321 donors responded to the questionnaire. Results revealed that effects of autonomous and controlled motivation on behavioral intention were mediated by attitude, PBC as well as moral norms.

However, limited knowledge exists about the inter-relationship between these factors among university students in low-middle income countries. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and their relationship with sleep quality, sleep hygiene practices, and psychological stress. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a randomly selected sample of students in Mizan-Aman, Ethiopia. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire, which included questions about socio-demographics, socio-economic factors, the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire-Mizan, Sleep hygiene index, Perceived stress scale-10 (PSS-10), and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was about 22%. Multivariate regression analysis showed that both anxiety status χ(2)[(13, N = 480) = 82.68, p < 0.001], and increasing levels of anxiety (model adjusted R2 = 0.204, p < 0.001) were associated with greater psychological stress, inadequate sleep hygiene practices, and poor sleep quality scores after adjusting for age, gender, attendance, substance use, years of university education, time spent in athletic activity every day, and frequency of tea/coffee consumption. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in this study population, and this condition was associated with psychological stress, poor sleep, and inadequate sleep hygiene parameters.

55955,Aerial Swarms: Recent Applications and Challenges,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Current health reports indicate an increased rate of mental illness among employees in social interaction professions. This reflects the high psychosocial demands in these fields of work. Against the background of the social significance of these professions, there are no comparative figures on the classification and significance of mental exhaustion among those in employment in these areas. OBJECTIVES: The study examines the psychological exhaustion among employees in the areas of care, early childhood education, schools, social work, and the police with other employees over time and in a gender comparison. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mental exhaustion is statistically analyzed using an established index and univariate and bivariate analyzes. The BIBB/BAuA Employee Surveys—Work and Career in Transition, Acquisition and Exploitation of Professional Qualifications from 2006, 2012, and 2018 are used by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB) and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA). RESULTS: Mental exhaustion is higher in all socially interactive occupations than in other workers. It is highest in the care professions, followed by educational staff, teaching staff, police, and social workers. In the majority of occupations, mental exhaustion increased in the survey period from 2006 to 2018. DISCUSSION: The results show that the burden in personal service occupations has increased considerably in recent years. Measures to remedy the structural deficits and health-promoting measures are necessary to stabilize the health situation of the employees.","Bauknecht, Jürgen; Wesselborg, Bärbel",Pr&#x000e4;v Gesundheitsf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279031/,290

Australian women in midlife (45–64 years) are at highest lifetime risk for developing breast cancer but demonstrate low awareness of this link. We explore women’s exposure to messages about alcohol and breast cancer in Australian print media in the period 2002–2018. Methods: Paired thematic and framing analyses were undertaken of Australian print media from three time-defined subsamples: 2002–2004, 2009–2011, and 2016–2018. Results: Five key themes arose from the thematic framing analysis: Ascribing Blame, Individual Responsibility, Cultural Entrenchment, False Equilibrium, and Recognition of Population Impact. The framing analysis showed that the alcohol–breast cancer link was predominantly framed as a behavioural concern, neglecting medical and societal frames. Discussion: We explore the representations of the alcohol and breast cancer risk relationship. We found their portrayal to be conflicting and unbalanced at times and tended to emphasise individual choice and responsibility in modifying health behaviours. We argue that key stakeholders including government, public health, and media should accept shared responsibility for increasing awareness of the alcohol–breast cancer link and invite media advocates to assist with brokering correct public health information.","Rudge, Amy; Foley, Kristen; Lunnay, Belinda; Miller, Emma R.; Batchelor, Samantha; Ward, Paul R.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8304242/,290

A mixed-method research design was utilized to explore the projected behavioral response to UBI of current and former recipients of traditional assistance, in regard to themselves and others. Responses indicate that the majority of participants would not alter their current work arrangements and would rather plan for future financial stability while assuming that other Americans would quit working and spend the money irresponsibly.

57284,The opioid antagonist naltrexone decreases seizure‐like activity in genetic and chemically induced epilepsy models,2021-06-09,"STUDY QUESTION: How can cycle monitoring using a urine-based hormonal assay device improve current clinical practice in medically assisted reproduction (MAR)? SUMMARY ANSWER: A urine-based hormonal assay has the potential to overcome the inconvenience of blood tests and reduce the frequency of appointments, waiting times and patient burden. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Cycle monitoring via ultrasound and serum-based hormonal assays during MAR can provide information on the ovarian response and assist in optimising treatment strategies and reducing complications, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). However, blood tests may cause inconvenience to patients due to repeated venepuncture and the need for frequent clinic appointments. Urine-based assays have been historically used by fertility specialists in clinics, but since got replaced by more practical and automated serum-based assays. Novel technology utilising rapid chromatographic immunoassay to test urinary reproductive hormones in a home setting could provide an alternative to current serum-based testing at clinics. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A questionnaire was disseminated among 24 fertility specialists (2019–2020) on the use of ultrasound and serum-based hormone monitoring in clinical practice. In addition, the literature on the reliability of urine-based hormonal assays compared to serum-based hormonal assays during MAR was reviewed in order to examine if urine-based hormonal monitoring could be re-introduced in clinical practice using novel state-of-the-art technology. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All 24 surveyed fertility specialists responded, representing 10 countries from across Europe, Asia and Latin America. Questions assessed the frequency and role of hormonal monitoring, the hormones tested and the drawbacks of blood tests. The PubMed search engine was used to search the Medline database for publications between 1960–2020 with (MeSH-) search terms related to cycle monitoring (e.g. fertility monitoring, controlled ovarian stimulation, ovulation confirmation) and hormonal assays (e.g. estrone–3-glucuronide or E1–3G). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The survey confirmed that many fertility practitioners (n = 22/24) routinely conducted hormone monitoring during MAR, primarily for guiding dose adjustments (n = 20/24) and indicating risk of OHSS (n = 20/24). The reported drawbacks of blood tests included validity of results from different service providers, long waiting times and discomfort to patients due to travelling to clinics for tests and repeated venepunctures. The hormones routinely checked were E2 (n = 22/22), P4 (n = 18/22) and LH (n = 15/22). The literature review revealed a relatively high correlation (correlation coefficients 0.85–0.95) between serum E2 and urinary E1–3G in gonadotrophin stimulated cycles (Lessing 1987, Catalan 1989, Rapi 1992 and Alper 1994). No studies assessed the correlation between serum P4 and urinary PdG or between serum LH and urinary LH in stimulated cycles. In natural cycles, the correlation coefficients between serum P4 and urinary PdG seemed to be slightly higher than those between serum E2 and urinary E1–3G (0.73–0.94 vs. 0.54–0.88) (Denari 1981, Munro 1991, Roos 2015, Stanczyk 1980). One study reported a moderate correlation coefficient (0.72) between serum and urinary LH in natural cycles (Roos 2015). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: There is risk of selection-bias for fertility specialists included in survey, however, the 100% response rate is reassuring. The correlation coefficients between serum- and urine-based hormonal assay and the cost-effectiveness and time-efficiency of urinary assay should be confirmed in further clinical studies using a novel state-of-the-art remote urinary monitoring device. Wider implications of the findings: Remote hormonal monitoring can be part of a novel digital health solution that includes remote ultrasound and tele-counselling to link clinics and patients at home. Especially during the unprecedented times of the COVID–19 pandemic, the prospect of remote monitoring system has the potential to improve patient experience during fertility treatment.

57520,Herausgeberbrief,2021-09-07,"BACKGROUND: Hospital mortality is high for patients with encephalopathy caused by microbial infection. Microbial infections often induce sepsis. The damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is defined as sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). However, the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and the prognosis of SAE patients is still unclear, especially gut microbiota, and there is no clinical tool to predict hospital mortality for SAE patients. The study aimed to explore the relationship between pathogenic microorganisms and the hospital mortality of SAE patients and develop a nomogram for the prediction of hospital mortality in SAE patients. METHODS: The study is a retrospective cohort study. The lasso regression model was used for data dimension reduction and feature selection. Model of hospital mortality of SAE patients was developed by multivariable Cox regression analysis. Calibration and discrimination were used to assess the performance of the nomogram. Decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. RESULTS: Unfortunately, the results of our study did not find intestinal infection and microorganisms of the gastrointestinal (such as: Escherichia coli) that are related to the prognosis of SAE. Lasso regression and multivariate Cox regression indicated that factors including respiratory failure, lactate, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, SpO(2), temperature, and renal replacement therapy were significantly correlated with hospital mortality. The AUC of 0.812 under the nomogram was more than that of the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (0.745), indicating excellent discrimination. DCA demonstrated that using the nomogram or including the prognostic signature score status was better than without the nomogram or using the SAPS II at predicting hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of SAE patients has nothing to do with intestinal and microbial infections. We developed a nomogram that predicts hospital mortality in patients with SAE according to clinical data. The nomogram exhibited excellent discrimination and calibration capacity, favoring its clinical utility.","Zhao, Lina; Li, Yun; Wang, Yunying; Gao, Qian; Ge, Zengzheng; Sun, Xibo; Li, Yi",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417384/,290

In this paper, a new regression is constructed to identify the variables that affected the first-wave COVID-19 mortality rates in the U.S. states. The mortality rates in these states are computed by considering the total of deaths recorded on 30, 90, and 180 days from the 10th recorded case. The proposed regression is compared to the Kumaraswamy and unit-Weibull regressions, which are useful in modeling proportional data. It provides the best goodness-of-fit measures for the mortality rates and explains [Formula: see text] of its variability.

58398,Ethical dilemma of colorectal screening: What age should a screening colonoscopy start and stop?,2021-09-16,"Due to lacking a proofreading mechanism in their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp), RNA viruses generally possess high mutation frequencies, making them evolve rapidly to form viral quasispecies during serial passages in cells, especially treated with mutagens, like ribavirin. Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus. Its L protein functions as an RdRp during viral replication. In this study, a recombinant enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged CDV (rCDV-eGFP) was rescued from its cDNA clone, followed by viral identification and characterization at passage-7 (P7). This recombinant was independently subjected to extra 40 serial passages (P8 to 47) in ribavirin- and non-treated cells. Two viral progenies, undergoing passages in ribavirin- and non-treated VDS cells, were named rCDV-eGFP-R and -N, respectively. Both progenies were simultaneously subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) at P47 for comparing their quasispecies diversities with each other. The rCDV-eGFP-R and -N showed 62 and 23 single-nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in individual antigenomes, respectively, suggesting that the ribavirin conferred a mutagenic effect on the rCDV-eGFP-R. The spectrum of 62 SNMs contained 26 missense and 36 silent mutations, and that of 23 SNMs was composed of 17 missense and 6 silent mutations. Neither the rCDV-eGFP-R nor -N exhibited nonsense mutation in individual antigenomes. We speculate that the rCDV-eGFP-R may contain at least one P47 sub-progeny characterized by high-fidelity replication in cells. If such a sub-progeny can be purified from the mutant swarm, its L protein would elucidate a molecular mechanism of CDV high-fidelity replication.","Liu, Fuxiao; Wang, Ning; Lin, Jiahui; Wang, Qianqian; Huang, Yilan; Zhang, Youming; Shan, Hu",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481889/,290

It describes how the disneyfied main part of the UNESCO heritage site of universal values turned into a ghost town as functional changes were turning into physical ones amid restrictions. From the results of pre-pandemic processes (that, as we argue, turned the city into its disneyfied version), to the lockdown (that later revealed itself to be but the first one in a row), to the post-lockdown recovery, these changes are presented in modified figure-ground diagrams with accessibility being defined by both tangible and intangible properties. The results are set against the background of the city’s current policies regarding economic recovery, mobility and accessibility to urban green areas. As an attempt to address the present vulnerability of the once resilient historic city centres—of which Kraków Old Town is a luminous example—this paper tends to be a voice in the debate on the post-2020 planning and the strategies we will need to face the subsequent waves of this, or other, pandemics as well as consequences of climate change.","Porębska, Anna; Barnaś, Krzysztof; Dendura, Bartosz; Kania, Olga; Łukasik, Marta; Rogulska, Aleksandra; Szpakowska-Loranc, Ernestyna; Zieliński, Miłosz",Urban Des Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488930/,290

Methods We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL, OTSeeker and PEDro with search terms in four broad areas: upper limb, intervention, workplace and clinical trial (no date limits). Studies including neck pain only or musculoskeletal pain in other areas were not included. Results Initial search located 1071 articles, of which 80 were full text reviewed. Twenty-eight articles were included, reporting on various outcomes relating to a total of seventeen studies. Nine studies were of high methodological quality, seven of medium quality, and one of low quality. Studies were sorted into intervention categories: Ergonomic controls (n = 3), ergonomic training and workstation adjustments (n = 4), exercise and resistance training (n = 6), clinic-based versus workplace-based work hardening (n = 1), nurse case manager training (n = 1), physiotherapy versus Feldenkrais (n = 1), and ambulant myofeedback training (n = 1). The largest body of evidence supported workplace exercise programs, with positive effects for ergonomic training and workstation adjustments, and mixed effects for ergonomic controls.

Understanding MERS CoV genetic aspects and codon usage pattern is important to understand MERS CoV survival, adaptation, evolution, resistance to innate immunity, and help in finding the unique aspects of the virus for future drug discovery experiments. In this work, we provide comprehensive analysis of 238 MERS CoV full genomes comprised of human (hMERS) and camel (cMERS) isolates of the virus. MERS CoV genome shaping seems to be under compositional and mutational bias, as revealed by preference of A/T over G/C nucleotides, preferred codons, nucleotides at the third position of codons (NT3s), relative synonymous codon usage, hydropathicity (Gravy), and aromaticity (Aromo) indices. Effective number of codons (ENc) analysis reveals a general slight codon usage bias. Codon adaptation index reveals incomplete adaptation to host environment. MERS CoV showed high ability to resist the innate immune response by showing lower CpG frequencies. Neutrality evolution analysis revealed a more significant role of mutation pressure in cMERS over hMERS. Correspondence analysis revealed that MERS CoV genomes have three genetic clusters, which were distinct in their codon usage, host, and geographic distribution. Additionally, virtual screening and binding experiments were able to identify three new virus-encoded helicase binding compounds. These compounds can be used for further optimization of inhibitors.","Alnazawi, Mohamed; Altaher, Abdallah; Kandeel, Mahmoud",Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1248/bpb.b17-00241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769010/,290

How high preoperative pain scores impact the clinical course and outcomes of patients after lumbar microdiscectomy is not always clear. Here, the authors aimed to determine whether patients reporting higher preoperative pain scores have worse outcomes after lumbar microdiscectomy than those reporting lower preoperative scores. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of patients with symptomatic lumbar disc herniations that had failed to improve with nonsurgical methods and who had undergone tubular lumbar microdiscectomy. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) scores had been collected in the preoperative and postoperative period. The anatomical severity of disease was graded based on lumbar disc health (Pfirrmann classification), facet degeneration, thecal sac cross-sectional area, and disc herniation grade. Data on each patient's narcotic consumption and length of stay were collected. A Student t-test and chi-square test were used to compare patients with high preoperative pain scores (HP cohort) and those with lower preoperative scores (non-HP cohort). RESULTS One hundred thirty-eight patients were included in this analysis. The 47 patients in the HP cohort had taken more preoperative opioids (12.0 ± 21.2 vs 3.6 ± 11.1 morphine equivalent doses, p = 0.01). However, there was no statistically significant difference in Pfirrmann classification (p > 0.15), facet grade (p > 0.11), thecal sac cross-sectional area (p = 0.45), or disc herniation grade (p = 0.39) between the HP and non-HP cohorts. The latter cohort had statistically significant higher preoperative PROMIS scores (36.5 ± 7.0 vs 29.9 ± 6.4, p < 0.001), SF-12 mental component summary scores (48.7 ± 11.5 vs 38.9 ± 16.1, p < 0.001), and SF-12 physical component summary scores (PCS; 32.4 ± 8.6 vs 27.5 ± 10.0, p = 0.005), but a lower Oswestry Disability Index (56.4 ± 22.1 vs 35.4 ± 15.5, p < 0.001). There were only two time points after microdiscectomy when the HP cohort had worse HRQOL scores: at the 2-week follow-up for SF-12 PCS scores (32.4 ± 8.6 vs 29.3 ± 7.1, p = 0.03) and the 12-week follow-up for PROMIS scores (45.2 ± 9.5 vs 39.5 ± 7.1, p = 0.01). All other postoperative HRQOL measurements were similar between the two cohorts (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A patient's perceived severity of disease often does not correlate with the actual clinical pathology on imaging. Although patients who report high pain and have a symptomatic lumbar disc herniation may describe their pain as more extreme, they should be counseled that the outcomes of microdiscectomy are positive.","Virk, Sohrab; Vaishnav, Avani S; Mok, Jung Kee; McAnany, Steven; Iyer, Sravisht; Albert, Todd J; Gang, Catherine Himo; Qureshi, Sheeraz A",Journal of neurosurgery.

59781,Risk Assessment and Mitigation of the Mycotoxin Content in Medicinal Plants by the Infusion Process.,2020-05-09,"Introduction: Varicosis is a condition affecting the superficial venous system of the lower limbs. Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is a minimally invasive method that uses different frequencies of laser for treatment. Radiofrequency (RF) has also been effectively used for vein ablation through thermal mechanisms. This study compares the success rate and side effects of EVLA and RF to treat varicose veins in the lower limbs within 12 months. Methods: In this two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled, single-blind study, 1090 patients with lower limb varicosis proven by Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) were randomly placed into one of the two groups: EVLA and RF ablation. In the EVLA group, we used a 980-nm diode laser in a pulse mode and in the RF group, a 7-cm ClosureFast (Covidien, USA) catheter with an RF generator. We assessed pain during the operation and 8 and 24 hours after the surgery by the numerical rating scale (NRS). The patients were followed up on day 7, then 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The presence or absence of pain and then the severity of pain (according to NRS), the recurrence rate, complications, and the length of the procedure were compared. Results: There was no significant difference between the two groups in the patients' characteristics, major adverse events and pain severity during the procedure and 8 and 24 hours after the surgery. According to NRS, the mean chronic pain severity in the EVLA group was 3.99± 0.754 versus 4.50± 0.657 in the RF group, and the difference was not significant. The length of operation and the recurrence rate 12 months after the procedure were not significantly different. Conclusion: The results of our study further establish the efficacy of EVLT and RF ablation for lower limb varicosis treatment without any significant difference in the clinical outcomes and complications during a 12-months follow-up.","Mohammadi Tofigh, Arash; Tahmasebi, Hamed; Zebarjadi, Javad",Journal of lasers in medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.34172/jlms.2020.s7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33995968/,290

This review summarizes the knowledge and updated management of anemia in the setting of ACS. Areas covered: We provide a review on the prevalence, pathophysiology, prognosis, impact, and updated management of anemia. Expert opinion: Patients with anemia represent a therapeutic challenge in the setting of acute coronary syndrome and require specific acute and chronic management. Despite the high prevalence of anemia and the large amount of data confirming its strong impact on short- and long-term outcomes, a commonly used and accurate definition in the context of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and stent implantation for ACS is still lacking. Furthermore, therapeutic options to address anemia remain limited. The combined use of risk scores to identify high-risk characteristics for adverse bleeding or thrombotic events may guide individualized treatment of anemic patients, for example, by selecting an antiplatelet regimen aimed at minimizing bleeding or thrombotic risk. The optimal strategy for blood transfusion is currently being evaluated by an ongoing randomized trial.","Guedeney, Paul; Sorrentino, Sabato; Claessen, Bimmer; Mehran, Roxana",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2019.1575729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30712411/,290

61928,Some antibodies can dampen antiviral defences in people with severe COVID.,2021-03-01,"Virus infection can initiate a type I interferon (IFN-α/β) response via activation of the cytosolic RNA sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Furthermore, it can activate kinases that phosphorylate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which leads to inhibition of (viral) protein translation and formation of stress granules (SG). Most viruses have evolved mechanisms to suppress these cellular responses. Here, we show that a mutant mengovirus expressing an inactive leader (L) protein, which we have previously shown to be unable to suppress IFN-α/β, triggered SG formation in a protein kinase R (PKR)-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that infection of cells that are defective in SG formation yielded higher viral RNA levels, suggesting that SG formation acts as an antiviral defense mechanism. Since the induction of both IFN-α/β and SG is suppressed by mengovirus L, we set out to investigate a potential link between these pathways. We observed that MDA5, the intracellular RNA sensor that recognizes picornaviruses, localized to SG. However, activation of the MDA5 signaling pathway did not trigger and was not required for SG formation. Moreover, cells that were unable to form SG-by protein kinase R (PKR) depletion, using cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable eIF2α protein, or by drug treatment that inhibits SG formation-displayed a normal IFN-α/β response. Thus, although MDA5 localizes to SG, this localization seems to be dispensable for induction of the IFN-α/β pathway.","Langereis, Martijn A; Feng, Qian; van Kuppeveld, Frank J",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03213-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536668/,290

However, Few emergency departments (EDs) have ophthalmologists on call, and eye care provided in EDs without ophthalmic services can be inaccurate. METHODS We review the current state of ophthalmic telemedical care in EDs and highlight important considerations when implementing telemedicine in this setting. RESULTS Telemedicine allows ophthalmologists to work with on-site emergency care providers to interview and examine patients remotely in EDs, enabling proper assessment of patient history, visual acuity, pupils, intraocular pressure, as well as the anterior and posterior segment. To date, patients' perceptions of this new model of care have been largely positive. DISCUSSION The use of telemedical consultations for remote evaluation of patients with ophthalmic complaints stands to improve the quality of care provided to patients and extend the reach of remote ophthalmologists. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of in-person care further highlights the potential for telemedicine to augment existing models of emergency care.","De Arrigunaga, Sofia; Aziz, Kanza; Lorch, Alice C; Friedman, David S; Armstrong, Grayson W",Seminars in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1080/08820538.2021.1922712; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027803/,290

63751,Author Correction: Covidization of research: what are the risks?,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND Morbidity after major surgery is associated with low oxygen delivery. Haemodynamic therapy aimed at increasing oxygen delivery in an effort to reduce oxygen debt, tissue injury, and morbidity, is controversial. The most appropriate target for this strategy is unclear and might have several off-target effects, including loss of neural (parasympathetic)-mediated cellular protection. We hypothesised that individualised oxygen delivery targeted haemodynamic therapy (goal-directed therapy) in high-risk surgical patients would reduce postoperative morbidity, while secondarily addressing whether goal-directed therapy affected parasympathetic function. METHODS In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial, adult patients undergoing major elective surgery were allocated by computer-generated randomisation to a postoperative protocol (fluid, with and without dobutamine) targeted to achieve their individual preoperative oxygen delivery value (goal-directed therapy) or standardised care (control). Patients and staff were masked to the intervention. The primary outcome was absolute risk reduction (ARR) in morbidity (defined by Clavien-Dindo grade II or more) on postoperative day 2. We also assessed a secondary outcome focused on parasympathetic function, using time-domain heart rate variability measures. Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. The trial was registered with Controlled Clinical Trials (number ISRCTN76894700). FINDINGS We enrolled 204 patients between May 20, 2010, and Feb 12, 2014. Intention-to-treat analysis of the 187 (92%) patients who completed the trial intervention period showed that early morbidity was similar between goal-directed therapy (44 [46%] of 95 patients) and control groups (49 [53%] of 92 patients) (ARR -7%, 95% CI -22 to 7; p=0·30). Prespecified secondary analysis showed that 123 (66%) of 187 patients achieved preoperative oxygen delivery (irrespective of intervention). These patients sustained less morbidity (ARR 19%, 95% CI 3-34; p=0·016), including less infectious complications. Goal-directed therapy reduced parasympathetic activity postoperatively (relative risk 1·33, 95% CI 1·01-1·74). INTERPRETATION Achievement of preoperative oxygen delivery values in the postoperative phase was associated with less morbidity, but this was not affected by the use of an oxygen delivery targeted strategy. Reduced parasympathetic activity after goal-directed therapy was associated with the failure of this intervention to reduce postoperative morbidity.

Reliance allows formally, or informally, one regulatory authority to use assessments made by other regulatory authorities while remaining responsible for the final decision. Reliance is an essential concept to increase the efficiency of the global regulatory oversight of medical products by national regulatory authorities. Areas covered: This article describes the findings and recommendations from the IPRP survey. It shows that reliance in the area of medical product oversight is broadly accepted. The first part presents the acceptance and reasons for accepting reliance including the need for trust, then gives examples of the most common areas for reliance, and explains the difference between unilateral or reciprocal reliance. Finally, the article analyzes the lessons learned including challenges and opportunities for reliance on regulatory authorities to facilitate patient access in their jurisdictions. Expert opinion: Regulatory reliance facilitates regulatory approvals and allows to use resources in a more efficient way and ultimately serves patients by facilitating earlier access to quality-assured, safe, and effective medicines.","Doerr, Petra; Valentin, Marie; Nakashima, Nobumasa; Orphanos, Nick; Santos, Gustavo; Balkamos, Georgios; Saint-Raymond, Agnes",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17512433.2021.1865798; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355025/,290

Gel filtration chromatography, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and finally NMR spectroscopy all indicate the natively unfolded nature of this NS5A-D2 domain. Because mutations in this domain have been linked to cyclosporin A resistance, we used NMR spectroscopy to investigate potential interactions between NS5A-D2 and cellular CypA and CypB. We observed a direct molecular interaction between NS5A-D2 and both cyclophilins. The interaction surface on the cyclophilins corresponds to their active site, whereas on NS5A-D2, it proved to be distributed over the many proline residues of the domain. NMR heteronuclear exchange spectroscopy yielded direct evidence that many proline residues in NS5A-D2 form a valid substrate for the enzymatic peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity of CypA and CypB.","Hanoulle, Xavier; Badillo, Aurélie; Wieruszeski, Jean-Michel; Verdegem, Dries; Landrieu, Isabelle; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Penin, François; Lippens, Guy",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m809244200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19297321/,290
64146,Mathematical models for assessing the role of airflow on the risk of airborne infection in hospital wards.,2009,"A number of multiresistant pathogens including Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) place a heavy burden on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients in intensive care units (ICU). It is critically important to differentiate between bacterial infection and colonization to avoid prescribing unnecessary antibiotics. Quantitative culture of lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens, however, requires invasive procedures. Nowadays, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been studied in vitro and in vivo to identify pathogen-derived biomarkers. Therefore, an exploratory pilot study was conceived for a proof of concept that the appearance and level of A. baumannii-derived metabolites might be correlated with the presence of the pathogen and its ecological niche (i.e. the infection and colonization states) in ICU ventilated patients. Twenty patients with A. baumannii VAP (infection group), 20 ventilated patients with LRT A. baumannii colonization (colonization group) and 20 ventilated patients with neurological disorders, but without pneumonia or A. baumannii colonization (control group) were enrolled in the in vivo pilot study. A clinical isolate of A. baumannii strains was used for the in vitro culture experiment. The adsorptive preconcentration (solid-phase microextraction fiber and Tenax(®) TA) and analysis technique of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were applied in the studies. Breath profiles could be visually differentiated between A. baumannii cultivation in vitro and culture medium, and among in vivo groups. In the in vitro experiment, nine compounds of interest (2,5-dimethyl-pyrazine, 1-undecene, isopentyl 3-methylbutanoate, decanal, 1,3-naphthalenediol, longifolene, tetradecane, iminodibenzyl and 3-methyl-indene) in the headspace were found to be possible A. baumannii derivations. While there were eight target VOCs (1-undecene, nonanal, decanal, 2,6,10-trimethyl-dodecane, 5-methyl-5-propyl-nonane, longifolene, tetradecane and 2-butyl-1-octanol) exhibiting characteristics of A. baumannii VAP derivations. The selected VOC profile in vivo could be adopted to efficiently differentiate the presence of LRT A. baumannii from its absence, and LRT A. baumannii infection from its colonization (AUC = 0.89 and 0.88, respectively). It is not feasible to simply transfer the metabolic biomarkers from the in vitro condition to in vivo. The direct detection of exhaled A. baumannii-derived VOCs may be adopted for an early alert of the LRT bacterial presence in ventilated ICU patients, and even in different parasitic states of A. baumannii (i.e. infection and colonization). However, further refinement and validation are required before its clinical use.","Gao, Jianping; Zou, Yingchang; Wang, Yonggang; Wang, Feng; Lang, Lang; Wang, Ping; Zhou, Yong; Ying, Kejing",Journal of breath research,https://doi.org/10.1088/1752-7155/10/2/027102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27272697/,290

To accomplish this feat, ACS must bind CoA and interact with two other proteins that contribute the CO and CH3+, respectively: CO dehydrogenase (CODH) and corrinoid Fe-S protein (CFeSP). Previous structural data show that, in the model acetogen Moorella thermoacetica, domain 1 of ACS binds to CODH such that a 70-Å-long internal channel is created that allows CO to travel from CODH to the A-cluster. The A-cluster is largely buried and is inaccessible to CFeSP for methylation. Here we use electron microscopy to capture multiple snapshots of ACS that reveal previously uncharacterized domain motion, forming extended and hyperextended structural states.

However, evidence suggests that immigrants in the United States do not access mental health services to the same extent as nonimmigrants. In particular, immigrant adolescents and young adults may have unique stressors related to their developmental stage, experiences in school and with peer groups, and shifting roles within family systems. This scoping review summarizes findings from published research studies and practitioner-focused gray literature about the mental health needs of immigrant communities in the United States. The review finds that specific mental health needs vary across factors like age, racial/ethnic group, immigration status, and place of residency. Findings also indicate that structural factors like immigration-related laws affect both access to mental health services and stressors in the overall environment for immigrants and their families. This review also explores models of community-level initiatives that utilize strengths-based approaches to promoting mental health and well-being among immigrant communities. Findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the mental health needs and current barriers to care among diverse immigrant populations, as immigration continues to play a major role in U.S. public policy and discourse. The COVID-19 pandemic taking place as this article goes to press in 2020 also raises questions regarding health equity and access for marginalized populations, including immigrants and their communities, and so these findings also indicate the need for further interdisciplinary research to assess intersections among the pandemic's many impacts, including those related to mental health and well-being.","Rodriguez, Darlene Xiomara; Hill, Jessica; McDaniel, Paul N",Health promotion practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920942511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729336/,290
65162,Awareness of normal risk is not normal.,2020-10-29,"Purpose. Indigenous (Diné) communities have long endured high rates of behavioral and mental health diseases like depression, drug and alcohol dependency, and suicide due to historical trauma and posttraumatic stress disorders. Western research methods used to address these issues have often failed to provide sufficient understanding of the culturally nuanced dynamics underpinning these health disparities in Indigenous contexts. As a result, Indigenous health disparities have actually increased and complex culture-based relationships that influence health outcomes are underconceptualized. Aim. For the first time a community-based participatory research approach from a Diné perspective is introduced to three Navajo communities in New Mexico to collaboratively explore their perspectives about community-engaged research and community well-being from a Diné lens. The overarching research question was: Can a community-based participatory research approach embedded within a Diné research paradigm be utilized to develop a culturally centered intervention approach? Methods. The study utilized a mixed method approach that included surveys and focus groups. Results. Six overarching themes emerged that underscored the important role of utilizing a community-based participatory Diné-centered approach to define community well-being and increase community agency to address their own health disparities. Conclusion. Indigenous-centered community-engaged research can potentially become an intervention approach for informing Indigenous communities' understandings of well-being by drawing upon local cultural Indigenous knowledge. This study demonstrated that developing an effective community-engaged research partnership to address health disparities in a Diné context must be informed by a Diné paradigm grounded in local community cultural knowledge.","Werito, Vincent; Belone, Lorenda",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,https://doi.org/10.1177/10901981211011926; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080481/,290

The maize stem is one of the most important parts of the plant and is also a component of many agronomic traits in maize. This study aimed to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying maize stem traits. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Ye478 and Qi319 was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling stem height (SH), ear height (EH), stem node number (SN), ear node (EN), and stem diameter (SD), and two derived traits (ear height coefficient (EHc) and ear node coefficient (ENc)). Using an available ultra-high density bin map, 46 putative QTL for these traits were detected on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Individual QTL explained 3.5-17.7% of the phenotypic variance in different environments. Two QTL for SH, three for EH, two for EHc, one for SN, one for EN, and one for SD were detected in more than one environment. QTL with pleiotropic effects or multiple linked QTL were also identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10, which are potential target regions for fine-mapping and marker-assisted selection in maize breeding programs. Further, we discussed segregation of bin markers (mk1630 and mk4452) associated with EHc QTL in the RIL population. We had identified two putative WRKY DNA-binding domain proteins, AC209050.3_FG003 and GRMZM5G851490, and a putative auxin response factor, GRMZM2G437460, which might be involved in regulating plant growth and development, as candidate genes for the control of stem architecture.","Shang, Qiqi; Zhang, Degui; Li, Rong; Wang, Kaixin; Cheng, Zimeng; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Hao, Zhuanfang; Pan, Jinbao; Li, Xinhai; Shi, Liyu",Plant molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11103-020-01062-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901412/,290

The hematochemical values of routine blood exams could represent a faster and less expensive alternative. Methods Three different training data set of hematochemical values from 1,624 patients (52% COVID-19 positive), admitted at San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020, were used for developing machine learning (ML) models: the complete OSR dataset (72 features: complete blood count (CBC), biochemical, coagulation, hemogasanalysis and CO-Oxymetry values, age, sex and specific symptoms at triage) and two sub-datasets (COVID-specific and CBC dataset, 32 and 21 features respectively). 58 cases (50% COVID-19 positive) from another hospital, and 54 negative patients collected in 2018 at OSR, were used for internal-external and external validation. Results We developed five ML models: for the complete OSR dataset, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.83 to 0.90; for the COVID-specific dataset from 0.83 to 0.87; and for the CBC dataset from 0.74 to 0.86. The validations also achieved good results: respectively, AUC from 0.75 to 0.78; and specificity from 0.92 to 0.96. Conclusions ML can be applied to blood tests as both an adjunct and alternative method to rRT-PCR for the fast and cost-effective identification of COVID-19-positive patients.

OBJECTIVE To present scientific evidence regarding the impact of COVID-19 spreaders. DESIGN AND SETTING Systematic review of the literature (using the PRISMA framework), performed at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Florianópolis (SC), Brazil. METHODS A search for articles was carried out in the SciELO, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus, Bireme and Web of Science databases. A search for gray literature was also conducted via Google Scholar. There was no restriction regarding place or language, and the search covered the period from January 2010 to August 2020. Studies were selected based on a combination of descriptors from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). RESULTS Isolated cases of people diagnosed with COVID-19 who were classified as super-spreaders were found. They had been classified thus because they may have had greater potential for infecting other individuals. However, greater numbers of interventions are needed in order to identify and manage COVID-19 cases. There is little evidence regarding this detection, which further hinders recognition and understanding of super-spreading events. CONCLUSION The scientific community needs greater depth of evaluation and understanding of how these patients physiologically develop the ability to propagate COVID-19 more intensely. A simpler way of tracking them is also necessary, given that many infected people are asymptomatic. Many patients also have mild symptoms, suggesting that these individuals could also be classified as possible COVID-19 spreaders.PROSPERO Number: ID 217874 (submitted for publication and is being assessed by the editorial team).","Rambo, Ana Paula Schmitz; Gonçalves, Laura Faustino; Gonzáles, Ana Inês; Rech, Cassiano Ricardo; Paiva, Karina Mary de; Haas, Patrícia",Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina,https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2020.0618.r1.10122020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605305/,290
66142,Selected phlebological abstracts.,2021-04-01,"Salmonella utilizes translocated virulence proteins (termed effectors) to promote host cell invasion. The effector SopD contributes to invasion by promoting scission of the plasma membrane, generating Salmonella-containing vacuoles. SopD is expressed in all Salmonella lineages and plays important roles in animal models of infection, but its host cell targets are unknown. Here we show that SopD can bind to and inhibit the small GTPase Rab10, through a C-terminal GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain. During infection, Rab10 and its effectors MICAL-L1 and EHBP1 are recruited to invasion sites. By inhibiting Rab10, SopD promotes removal of Rab10 and recruitment of Dynamin-2 to drive scission of the plasma membrane. Together, our study uncovers an important role for Rab10 in regulating plasma membrane scission and identifies the mechanism used by a bacterial pathogen to manipulate this function during infection.","Boddy, Kirsten C; Zhu, Hongxian; D'Costa, Vanessa M; Xu, Caishuang; Beyrakhova, Ksenia; Cygler, Miroslaw; Grinstein, Sergio; Coyaud, Etienne; Laurent, Estelle M N; St-Germain, Jonathan; Raught, Brian; Brumell, John H",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24983-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349110/,290

This research note analyses differences in contraceptive method mix across Sustainable Development Goal regions and applies assumed method-specific declines in use to produce an illustrative scenario of the potential impact of COVID-19 on contraceptive use and on the proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods. Globally, it had been estimated that 77 per cent of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) would have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods in 2020. However, taking into account the potential impact of COVID-19 on method-specific use, this could fall to 71 per cent, resulting in around 60 million fewer users of modern contraception worldwide in 2020. Overall declines in contraceptive use will depend on the methods used by women and their partners and on the types of disruptions experienced. The analysis concludes with the recommendation that countries should include family planning and reproductive health services in the package of essential services and develop strategies to ensure that women and couples are able to exercise their reproductive rights during the COVID-19 crisis.","Dasgupta, Aisha; Kantorová, Vladimíra; Ueffing, Philipp",Gates open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13148.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330836/,290

67874,"ACDS 32nd Annual Meeting Abstracts, March 17-18, 2021.",2021,"BACKGROUND Employees in the aviation sector constitute an especially interesting professional group due to a lack of empirical data on their psychological functioning, and the fact that this industry is currently experiencing a phase of dynamic development. However, taking into consideration the automation and specific qualities of the sector, human resources should be given much more attention as they are constantly challenged and face diverse difficulties at work while cooperating in various organic and non-organic teams. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 326 employees of Pyrzowice (Poland), Szymany (Poland), and Košice (Slovakia) airports (however, people employed at the Polish airports were predominant, N = 250). The average age of the participants was 39.3 years, and the sample was predominantly male (N = 278, 85.3%). During the research procedure, the following questionnaires were used: the Feeling of Threat in the Workplace Questionnaire, the Feeling of Stress Questionnaire, the 10-Item Personality Inventory, and the Mini-COPE Stress Inventory. RESULTS The regression analysis indicated that personality variables did not allow for predicting the level of stress. However, the helplessness-oriented style (β = 0.191, p = 0.004), avoidant behaviors (β = 0.244, p < 0.001), and the feeling of threat (β = 0.147, p = 0.009) were significant predictors of the feeling of stress, and their high level corresponded with a higher level of stress. The final model explained 23% of the total variance in the feeling of stress. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results, practical recommendations should concern developing employees' skills related to monitoring stressors and strengthening proactivity in difficult or threatening situations. Such proactive strategies may decrease the tendency to use avoidant and helplessness-oriented behaviors that may cause a higher level of stress perceived by employees. Also, the authors recommend providing training and support using some cognitive behavioral techniques because it seems that the regular application of those methods supports the development of agency and control while facing challenging situations.

67936,Cardiovascular Research at the frontier of biomedical science.,2020-05-14,"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted household food purchasing and preparation, including elements identified as important drivers of household food waste. The two main aims of this study were (1) to examine changes in food waste behaviors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and Italy; and (2) to investigate potential predictors of food waste behavior, including avoidance of supermarkets, increased home cooking, and increased role of health concerns in food choices. A sample of n = 478 (79% female) individuals from the U.S., mean (SD) age = 30.51 (10.85), and n = 476 individuals from Italy, (78% female), mean (SD) age = 33.84 (12.86), completed an online survey between April 8th and April 28th 2020. Just under half of respondents (49%) reported decreased food waste since the start of the pandemic. Rates were significantly higher among the U.S. sample (61.5%, n = 294) compared to the Italian sample (38%, n = 180). Controlling for the time since restrictions were introduced, age, gender, and perceived financial security, logistic regression revealed greater reduction in food waste since the beginning of the pandemic for U.S. individuals relative to participants from Italy (OR = 0.47, p < .001). In addition, increased importance of health concerns when making food choices (OR = 1.34, p < .005) as well as more frequent cooking (OR = 1.35, p < .001), and greater avoidance of supermarkets (OR = 1.15, p = .049) were associated with greater probability of less food waste. Scarcity and greater reliance on cooking may encourage individuals to reflect on food waste practices. Further research should explore how these factors may be targeted to reduce food waste beyond the pandemic.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Linardon, Jake; Guillaume, Sebastien; Fischer, Laura; Tyszkiewicz, Matthew Fuller-",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33428972/,290

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Reproductive medicine center at a tertiary hospital. POPULATION We studied women with a positive β-hCG after IVF/ICSI treatment from May 2014 to April 2019. METHODS Odds ratios (ORs) for early (13 ≤ weeks) and late (>13 weeks) pregnancy loss were calculated among women with and without PCOS for plurality of the pregnancy with adjustment for confounding factors. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Early pregnancy loss (EPL) and late pregnancy loss (LPL). RESULTS From 21,820 women identified with a positive β-hCG, 2,357 (10.8%) women had PCOS, and 19,463 (89.2%) women did not. EPL occurred in 16.6% (391) of women with PCOS versus 18.3% (3565) in women with non-PCOS (OR .89, 95%CI, .79-.99, P=.04). After adjustment for age and other confounders, the rate of EPL was not statistically significant associated with PCOS status (aOR .91, 95%CI, .80-1.05). Women with PCOS demonstrated a higher rate of LPL (6.4% in PCOS vs 3.6% in non-PCOS, OR 1.81, 95% CI, 1.48-2.21, P<.001). In multivariable analysis, the potential impact of PCOS was less strong (aOR 1.38, 95% CI, .96-1.98), with BMI and maternal comorbidities also associated with LPL (aOR 1.08, 95%CI, 1.04-1.1 and aOR 2.07,95%CI,1.43-3.00). CONCLUSIONS PCOS was not independently associated with EPL. There was an increased risk of LPL, but this difference was not statistically significant.","Cai, He; Mol, Ben W; Gordts, Stephan; Wang, Hui; Wang, Tao; Li, Na; Shi, Juanzi",BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology,https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.16590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142019/,290

Injectable preparations from the hemi-parasite plant Viscum album L. (European mistletoe) are commonly prescribed as complementary cancer therapy in European countries such as Germany, but their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated in-depth the in vitro response of human T cells towards mistletoe-extract drugs by analyzing their functional and T-cell-receptor (TCR) response using flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing respectively. Non-fermented mistletoe-extract drugs (AbnobaViscum), but not their fermented counterparts (Iscador), induced specific expansion of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells among T cells. Furthermore, AbnobaViscum rapidly induced the release of cytotoxic granules and the production of the cytokines IFNγ and TNFα in Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. This stimulation of anti-cancer Vγ9Vδ2 T cells was mediated by the butyrophilin BTN3A, did not depend on the accumulation of endogenous phosphoantigens and involved the same Vγ9Vδ2 TCR repertoire as those of phosphoantigen-reactive Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. These insights highlight Vγ9Vδ2 T cells as a potential target for mistletoe-extract drugs and their role in cancer patients receiving these herbal drugs needs to be investigated.","Ma, Ling; Phalke, Swati; Stévigny, Caroline; Souard, Florence; Vermijlen, David",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32604868/,290

Intercellular adhesions, termed apical junctional complexes (AJCs), at the apical surface between RGCs are necessary for cell polarization. However, the mechanism by which AJCs are established remains unclear. Here, we show that a SNARE complex composed of SNAP23, VAMP8, and Syntaxin1B has crucial roles in AJC formation and RGC polarization. Central nervous system (CNS)-specific ablation of SNAP23 (NcKO) results in mice with severe hypoplasia of the neocortex and no hippocampus or cerebellum. In the developing NcKO brain, RGCs lose their polarity following the disruption of AJCs and exhibit reduced proliferation, increased differentiation, and increased apoptosis. SNAP23 and its partner SNAREs, VAMP8 and Syntaxin1B, are important for the localization of an AJC protein, N-cadherin, to the apical plasma membrane of RGCs. Altogether, SNARE-mediated localization of N-cadherin is essential for AJC formation and RGC polarization during brain development.","Kunii, Masataka; Noguchi, Yuria; Yoshimura, Shin-Ichiro; Kanda, Satoshi; Iwano, Tomohiko; Avriyanti, Erda; Atik, Nur; Sato, Takashi; Sato, Ken; Ogawa, Masaharu; Harada, Akihiro",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.201910080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33332551/,290

The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 is widely affecting global healthcare systems. AIM This study assesses effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. hospice agencies, staff, and patients as reported by hospice agency staff. DESIGN An anonymous electronic survey was developed. Free-text comments were assessed for impacts on hospice agencies, staff, and patients and their families. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS The target audience was members of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine and the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association who self-identified as being active with hospice agencies in the United States. RESULTS Reported impacts include inadequate supplies of personal protective equipment, changes in hospice services, and decreased access by hospice personnel to patients in long term care facilities. Flow of patients through hospice care settings was impeded. Agencies experienced changes in workforce availability and increased emotional support needs of staff. Patient and families experienced increased bereavement needs. Nearly one-third of respondents reported negative effects on patient outcomes, such as inadequate symptom management and negative psychosocial effects. CONCLUSION Respondents indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic had negative effects on both hospice patient care and hospice agency functioning. Hospice agencies appear to face challenges unique among U.S. healthcare agencies due to their service delivery model and focus on interdisciplinary care. There is need for further exploration of the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has on hospice agencies in order to improve care for their patient population during public health emergencies.","Baker Rogers, Janna E; Constantine, Lori A; Thompson, Jesse M; Mupamombe, Charles T; Vanin, Jennifer M; Navia, R Osvaldo",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909121989987; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33499673/,290

METHODS HRQOL was assessed using the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) utility index score in patients with complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) and progressive disease (PD) at 8 weeks, and time-to-deterioration (TtD) of the EQ-5D score, with the preset minimally important difference (MID) of 0.05, was compared between these populations. Among the enrolled patients, 143 and 160 patients were assessable in weekly solvent-based paclitaxel (Sb-PTX) arm and weekly nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) arm, respectively. RESULTS Changes of the EQ-5D score from baseline to 8 weeks in the nab-PTX arm were 0.0009 and - 0.1229 in CR + PR and PD patients, respectively; the corresponding values for the Sb-PTX arm were - 0.0019 and - 0.1549. For both treatments, changes of the EQ-5D score from baseline at 8 weeks were significantly larger in patients with PD than in those with CR + PR. The median TtD was 3.9 and 2.2 months in patients with CR + PR and PD, respectively, for nab-PTX [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.595, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.358-0.989]. For Sb-PTX, the corresponding values were 4.7 and 2.0 months (HR = 0.494, 95% CI 0.291-0.841).

69243,Concept of disposable duodenoscope: at what cost?,2019,"CLINICAL RELEVANCE Following the COVID-19 lockdown, uptake of slitlamp-enabled live teleophthalmology increased. Its use contributed to a reduction of referrals escalated to secondary care during-lockdown (avoided: 64% pre-lockdown vs 86% during-lockdown). BACKGROUND Live teleophthalmology using video conferencing allows real-time, three-way consultation between secondary care, community providers and patients, improving interpretation of slit lamp findings and potentially reducing referrals to secondary care. NHS Forth Valley implemented live teleophthalmology in March 2019. In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created urgency to deliver ophthalmic care while minimising the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. We aim to compare the uptake and two outcomes (number of avoided secondary care referrals; pattern of presenting conditions) of live teleophthalmology consultations in NHS Forth Valley before and during the COVID-19 national lockdown. METHODS An NHS secure video conferencing platform connected the video slit lamps of optometrists, or an iPad mounted on a slit lamp and viewing through the eyepieces, to a secondary care ophthalmologist via a virtual live clinic/waiting area. Data about avoiding a secondary care referral were extracted from a post-consultation ophthalmologist survey for 14 months of data. Pre- and during-lockdown intervals were before/after 23 March 2020, when routine eyecare appointments were suspended. Numbers of avoided referrals to secondary care and patterns of presenting conditions were compared for pre- and during-lockdown periods. RESULTS The COVID-19 pandemic markedly increased use of live teleophthalmology in NHS Forth Valley. Surveys were completed for 164 of 250 (66%) teleophthalmology consultations over the study period. Data from 154 surveys were analysed, 78 and 76 for the pre- and during-lockdown periods, respectively. Significantly more during-lockdown (86%) than pre-lockdown (64%; difference 21%, 95% CI 8-34%, p = 0.001) surveys indicated that referrals to secondary care were avoided.

We sought to explore associations of APOL1 risk variants with cause of sudden death using the CVPath Sudden Death Autopsy Registry. Approach and Results: APOL1 haplotypes and causes of sudden death, as determined through autopsy and histopathology, were obtained for 764 Black subjects. Genotyping revealed APOL1 risk alleles in 452 of 764 (59%) subjects with 347 (77%) subjects carrying one risk allele and 105 (23%) subjects harboring 2 risk alleles. APOL1 risk allele carrier status was associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary thrombosis due to plaque rupture, versus noncarriers (odds ratio for rupture, 1.655 [95% CI, 1.079-2.539]; P=0.021). Histological examinations showed coronary plaques in carriers of 2 APOL1 risk alleles had larger necrotic cores compared with noncarriers (necrotic core area/total plaque area: 46.79%±6.47% versus 20.57%±5.11%; P=0.0343 in ruptured plaques, and 41.48%±7.49% versus 18.93%±3.97%; P=0.0342 in nonruptured plaques), and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining revealed APOL1-positive areas localized primarily to the necrotic core. CONCLUSIONS APOL1 risk alleles were independently associated with an increased risk of thrombotic coronary death due to plaque rupture. Our results suggest that carriers of both 1 and 2 APOL1 risk alleles have greater accumulation of APOL1 protein within culprit plaques and greater necrotic core sizes than noncarriers. These findings suggest that APOL1 plays a role in determining plaque stability.","Cornelissen, Anne; Fuller, Daniela T; Fernandez, Raquel; Zhao, Xiaoqing; Kutys, Robert; Binns-Roemer, Elizabeth; Delsante, Marco; Sakamoto, Atsushi; Paek, Ka Hyun; Sato, Yu; Kawakami, Rika; Mori, Masayuki; Kawai, Kenji; Yoshida, Teruhiko; Latt, Khun Zaw; Miller, Clint L; de Vries, Paul S; Kolodgie, Frank D; Virmani, Renu; Shin, Myung Kyun; Hoek, Maarten; Heymann, Jurgen; Kopp, Jeffrey B; Rosenberg, Avi Z; Davis, Harry R; Guo, Liang; Finn, Aloke V","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.120.315788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039022/,290

Materials and methods: Forty-eight patients with abnormal papillary frenum were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned into three groups; conventional frenectomy operation (C group), diode laser-assisted frenectomy (L group), and diode laser-assisted frenectomy with conventional horizontal incision on the periosteum (L + P group). Post-operative pain, discomfort in speaking, and chewing scores were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) at post-operative 3rd hour and on days 1, 7, 14, 21, and 45. Epithelialization process of the wound surface was evaluated by hydrogen peroxide solution applied to the wound on days 7, 14, 21, and 45 following operations. The distance between the frenum attachment point and mucogingival junction (FMGJ) was recorded at baseline, post-operative 45th day, and 6th month to assess the reattachment of the frenum. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, and probing depth were recorded at baseline and post-operative 7th, 14th, 21st, and 45th days. Results: On the 1st and 7th day after operation, VAS pain score in the C group was significantly higher than in the L and L + P groups (p < 0.017). Difficulty in speaking and chewing scores were significantly lower in the L and L + P groups compared to the C group at post-operative 3rd hour and 7th day (p < 0.017). The FMGJ and epithelization period demonstrated no difference among the groups at any time point (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Our results suggest that diode laser provides better post-operative patient's perceptions than the conventional technique in frenectomy operation. In addition, both conventional and laser-assisted frenectomy surgeries prevent the frenum reattachment regardless of periosteal horizontal incision.","Sezgin, Gamze; Ozturk Ozener, Hafize; Meseli, Suleyman Emre; Kuru, Leyla","Photobiomodulation, photomedicine, and laser surgery",https://doi.org/10.1089/photob.2019.4783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609576/,290

The relationship between splinting and tooth loss was also studied. The data were analyzed using descriptive and statistical methods. RESULTS A significant relationship was observed between the different clinical variables and tooth loss, in particular the status of the alveolar socket as the most relevant clinical factor; there was also a significant relationship between splinting and tooth loss, as this was the main protective factor.

70318,Effect of 3D printed foot orthoses stiffness and design on foot kinematics and plantar pressures in healthy people.,2020-08-14,"Human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) commonly causes upper respiratory tract infections. However, lower respiratory tract infections can occur in some individuals, indicating that cells in the distal lung are susceptible to HCoV-229E. This study determined the virus susceptibility of primary cultures of human alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Fluorescent antibody staining indicated that HCoV-229E could readily infect AMs, but no evidence was found for infection in differentiated alveolar epithelial type II cells and only a very low level of infection in type II cells transitioning to the type I-like cell phenotype. However, a human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) was readily infected. The innate immune response of AMs to HCoV-229E infection was evaluated for cytokine production and interferon (IFN) gene expression. AMs secreted significant amounts of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES/CCL5) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP-1β/CCL4) in response to HCoV-229E infection, but these cells exhibited no detectable increase in IFN-β or interleukin-29 in mRNA levels. AMs from smokers had reduced secretion of TNF-α compared with non-smokers in response to HCoV-229E infection. Surfactant protein A (SP-A) and SP-D are part of the innate immune system in the distal lung. Both surfactant proteins bound to HCoV-229E, and pre-treatment of HCoV-229E with SP-A or SP-D inhibited infection of 16HBE cells. In contrast, there was a modest reduction in infection in AMs by SP-A, but not by SP-D. In summary, AMs are an important target for HCoV-229E, and they can mount a pro-inflammatory innate immune response to infection.","Funk, C Joel; Wang, Jieru; Ito, Yoko; Travanty, Emily A; Voelker, Dennis R; Holmes, Kathryn V; Mason, Robert J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.038414-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22090214/,290

The 126 consecutive patients treated by LRYGB between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2002 were analyzed in August 2011. Seventy-seven patients (61.1 %), including 18 who had had previous bariatric surgery, were available for evaluation after 9.4 ± 0.6 years (range, 8.7-10.9 years). Eight patients (10.4 %) suffered from type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMII) at the time of surgery. Initial body mass index (BMI) was 40.3 ± 7.5 kg/m(2) (range, 24.5-66.1 kg/m(2)). There was no postoperative mortality, but two patients died of causes unrelated to the surgery. Some 9 % of the patients suffered from internal herniation, despite the closure of potential hernia sites. With time, the patients had the tendency to experience weight regain: percentage of excess BMI lost was 56.2 ± 29.3 % (range, -78.8 to 117.9 %), down from a maximum of 88.0 ± 29.6 % (range, -19.7 to 197.1 %), that had been obtained after a median of 2.0 years (range, 1-8 years). LRYGB was effective for diabetes control in 85.7 % of the affected patients, but, surprisingly, 27.9 % developed new-onset diabetes. The weight regain in this latter patient group was statistically not different from the nondiabetic group. Conversely, four patients required hospitalization for hypoglycemic syndrome. Two patients underwent reversal of their bypass for problems linked to glucose metabolism (one hypoglycemia, one DMII). Patient quality of life was fair. The patient satisfaction remained good in 76 % of the cases.","Himpens, Jacques; Verbrugghe, Anneleen; Cadière, Guy-Bernard; Everaerts, Wouter; Greve, Jan-Willem",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-012-0707-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22865194/,290

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms of brain injury caused by PHEV. To gain insight into the interaction between the virus and host cells, changes in global gene expression in the cerebral cortex of PHEV- or mock-infected mice were investigated using DNA microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. The results of the microarray analysis showed that 365 genes on day 3 post-infection (p.i.) and 781 genes on day 5 p.i. were differentially expressed in response to PHEV infection in the cerebral cortex. The upregulated genes were mainly involved in immune system processes, antigen processing and presentation, the Jak-STAT signalling pathway, the RIG-I-like receptor signalling pathway, Toll-like receptor signalling and apoptosis-related proteases. Significantly downregulated genes were mainly involved in nervous-system development, synaptic transmission, neuron-projection development, the transmission of nerve impulses and negative regulation of glial cell differentiation. The differential expression of these genes suggests a strong antiviral host response, but may also contribute to the pathogenesis of PHEV resulting in encephalomyelitis.","Lan, Yungang; Zhao, Kui; Zhao, Jiakuan; Lv, Xiaoling; Wang, Gaili; Lu, Huijun; Tang, Bo; Li, Zi; Chang, Lingzhu; Jin, Zhao; He, Wenqi; Gao, Feng",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.066845-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973237/,290
71869,Hype and hope of bedtime dosing of antihypertensives: better to sleep on it?,2020-12-01,"Automated Screening of COVID-19 from chest CT is of emergency and importance during the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide in 2020. However, accurate screening of COVID-19 is still a massive challenge due to the spatial complexity of 3D volumes, the labeling difficulty of infection areas, and the slight discrepancy between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia in chest CT. While a few pioneering works have made significant progress, they are either demanding manual annotations of infection areas or lack of interpretability. In this paper, we report our attempt towards achieving highly accurate and interpretable screening of COVID-19 from chest CT with weak labels. We propose an attention-based deep 3D multiple instance learning (AD3D-MIL) where a patient-level label is assigned to a 3D chest CT that is viewed as a bag of instances. AD3D-MIL can semantically generate deep 3D instances following the possible infection area. AD3D-MIL further applies an attention-based pooling approach to 3D instances to provide insight into each instance's contribution to the bag label. AD3D-MIL finally learns Bernoulli distributions of the bag-level labels for more accessible learning. We collected 460 chest CT examples: 230 CT examples from 79 patients with COVID-19, 100 CT examples from 100 patients with common pneumonia, and 130 CT examples from 130 people without pneumonia. A series of empirical studies show that our algorithm achieves an overall accuracy of 97.9%, AUC of 99.0%, and Cohen kappa score of 95.7%. These advantages endow our algorithm as an efficient assisted tool in the screening of COVID-19.","Han, Zhongyi; Wei, Benzheng; Hong, Yanfei; Li, Tianyang; Cong, Jinyu; Zhu, Xue; Wei, Haifeng; Zhang, Wei",IEEE transactions on medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.2996256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730211/,290

As a result, epidemiological models are being used to inform policy on how to effectively deal with this pandemic. The majority of existing models assume random diffusion but do not take into account differences in the amount of interactions between individuals, i.e. the underlying human interaction network, whose structure is known to be scale-free. Here, we demonstrate how this network of interactions can be used to predict the spread of the virus and to inform policy on the most successful mitigation and suppression strategies. Using stochastic simulations in a scale-free network, we show that the epidemic can propagate for a long time at a low level before the number of infected individuals suddenly increases markedly, and that this increase occurs shortly after the first hub is infected. We further demonstrate that mitigation strategies that target hubs are far more effective than strategies that randomly decrease the number of connections between individuals. Although applicable to infectious disease modelling in general, our results emphasize how network science can improve the predictive power of current COVID-19 epidemiological models.","Herrmann, Helena A; Schwartz, Jean-Marc",Physical biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1478-3975/aba8ec; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702678/,290
72874,"Scientists, keep an open line of communication with the public.",2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Heart valves often undergo a degenerative process leading to mechanical dysfunction that requires valve replacement. This process has been compared with atherosclerosis because of shared pathology and risk factors. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of inflammation triggered by cholesterol infiltration and cholesterol crystals formation causing mechanical and biochemical injury in heart valves. METHODS Human and atherosclerotic rabbit heart valves were evaluated. New Zealand White male rabbits were fed an enriched cholesterol diet alone or with simvastatin and ezetimibe simultaneous or after 6 months of initiating cholesterol diet. Inflammation was measured using C-reactive protein (CRP) and RAM 11 of tissue macrophage content. Cholesterol crystal presence and content in valves was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS Cholesterol diet alone induced cholesterol infiltration of valves with associated increased inflammation. Tissue cholesterol, CRP levels and RAM 11 were significantly lower in simvastatin and ezetimibe rabbit groups compared with cholesterol diet alone. However, the treatment was effective only when initiated with a cholesterol diet but not after lipid infiltration in valves. Aortic valve cholesterol content was significantly greater than all other cardiac valves. Extensive amounts of cholesterol crystals were noted in rabbit valves on cholesterol diet and in diseased human valves. CONCLUSIONS Prevention of valve infiltration with cholesterol and reduced inflammation by simvastatin and ezetimibe was effective only when given during the initiation of high cholesterol diet but was not effective when given following infiltration of cholesterol into the valve matrix.","El-Khatib, Layan A; De Feijter-Rupp, Heather; Janoudi, Abed; Fry, Levi; Kehdi, Michael; Abela, George S",Open heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2020-001274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747455/,290

Owing to its reversibility, S-acylation is important in regulation of diverse signaling cascades, including Ras-associated cancers in mammals, stress response and metabolic regulation. Here we describe a simple protocol for analysis of protein S-acylation using gas chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Analysis can be carried out with as little as 1 microg of purified protein and allows chemical identification and, potentially, quantification of the acyl moieties. The method is based on cleavage of the fatty acids from proteins by hydrogenation with platinum (IV) oxide. This causes an acid transesterification of the acyl groups, adding an ethyl group to the carboxyl head of the fatty acid. The addition of the ethyl group reduces the polarity of the fatty acids, allowing their efficient separation by gas chromatography.","Sorek, Nadav; Yalovsky, Shaul",Nature protocols,https://doi.org/10.1038/nprot.2010.33; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20379138/,290
73047,The world will celebrate wound care in 2022.,2020-06-01,"Stimulation of mechanoreceptors in skeletal muscles such as contraction and stretch elicits reflexive autonomic nervous system changes which impact cardiovascular control. There are pressure-sensitive mechanoreceptors in skeletal muscles. Mechanical pressure stimulation of skeletal muscles can induce reflex changes in heart rate (HR) and blood pressure, although the neural mechanisms underlying this effect are unclear. We examined the contribution of cardiac autonomic nerves to HR responses induced by mechanical pressure stimulation (30 s, ~10 N/cm2) of calf muscles in isoflurane-anesthetized rats. Animals were artificially ventilated and kept warm using a heating pad and lamp, and respiration and core body temperature were maintained within physiological ranges. Mechanical stimulation was applied using a stimulation probe 6 mm in diameter with a flat surface. Cardiac sympathetic and vagus nerves were blocked to test the contribution of the autonomic nerves. For sympathetic nerve block, bilateral stellate ganglia, and cervical sympathetic nerves were surgically sectioned, and for vagus nerve block, the nerve was bilaterally severed. In addition, mass discharges of cardiac sympathetic efferent nerve were electrophysiologically recorded. Mechanical stimulation increased or decreased HR in autonomic nerve-intact rats (range: -56 to +10 bpm), and the responses were negatively correlated with pre-stimulus HR (r = -0.65, p = 0.001). Stimulation-induced HR responses were markedly attenuated by blocking the cardiac sympathetic nerve (range: -9 to +3 bpm, p < 0.0001) but not the vagus nerve (range: -75 to +30 bpm, p = 0.17). In the experiments with cardiac sympathetic efferent nerve activity recordings, mechanical stimulation increased, or decreased the frequency of sympathetic nerve activity in parallel with HR (r = 0.77, p = 0.0004). Furthermore, the changes in sympathetic nerve activity were negatively correlated with its tonic level (r = -0.62, p = 0.0066). These results suggest that cardiac sympathetic nerve activity regulates HR responses to muscle mechanical pressure stimulation and the direction of HR responses depends on the tonic level of the nerve activity, i.e., bradycardia occurs when the tonic activity is high and tachycardia occurs when the activity is low.","Watanabe, Nobuhiro; Hotta, Harumi",Frontiers in neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2016.00614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119562/,290

In this study, we describe a fetoscopic two-layer (myofascial and skin) closure technique for the treatment of NTD in five patients and report the preliminary anatomical outcome at birth. METHODS From February to September 2017, five pregnant women with a fetus with a NTD, including three cases of myelomeningocele and two cases of myelocele, were operated on using a fetoscopic two-layer closure technique. In this technique, with the uterus exteriorized and using three 10-Fr ports, the placode is dissected from the surrounding tissue and detethered, removing the cystic tissue. The skin is undermined by blunt dissection and the defect is sutured to the midline in two layers (myofascial and skin) using a running 4/0 resorbable barbed suture. RESULTS Median gestational age at the procedure was 24 + 3 (range, 23 + 5 to 27 + 3) weeks. Surgery was successful in all cases, without any intraoperative complications. Median time in surgery was 180 (range, 140-180) min and median time for fetoscopy was 105 (range, 65-120) min. In terms of obstetric complications, three cases of premature rupture of membranes and one case of chorioamnionitis were recorded. Median gestational age at delivery was 34 + 1 (range, 25 + 4 to 37 + 2) weeks and two patients delivered vaginally. The closed defect was watertight with good quality tissue in all cases. CONCLUSION Fetoscopic two-layer closure of NTD may improve the quality of the tissue covering the defect, diminishing the need for postnatal surgical revision, and preserving the well-documented beneficial effects of prenatal closure on the neural tissue and hindbrain herniation. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those cases with wide diastasis of the myofascial layer or with a low quantity of available tissue. Copyright © 2018 ISUOG.

73721,Laparoscopic specimen retrieval bags.,2014,"PURPOSE As the designated tertiary referral centre for infectious diseases in Hong Kong, our hospital received the city's first group of patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Herein, we studied the earliest patients admitted to our centre in order to clarify the typical radiological findings, particularly computed tomography (CT) findings, associated with COVID-19. METHODS From 22 January 2020 to 29 February 2020, 19 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent high-resolution or conventional CT scans of the thorax in our centre. The CT imaging findings of these patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong were reviewed in this study. RESULTS Ground-glass opacities (GGO) with peripheral subpleural distribution were found in all patients (100%). No specific zonal predominance was observed. All lobes were involved in 16 (84.2%) patients, focal subsegmental consolidations were observed in 14 (73.7%) patients, and interlobular septal thickening was present in 12 (63.2%) patients. No mediastinal lymph node enlargement, centrilobular nodule, or pleural effusion was detected in any of the patients. Other imaging features present in several patients include bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, and crazy-paving patterns. CONCLUSION Peripheral subpleural GGO without zonal predominance in the absence of centrilobular nodule, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement were consistent findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The observed radiological patterns on CT scans can help identify COVID-19 and assess affected patients in the context of the ongoing outbreak.","Li, S K; Ng, F H; Ma, K F; Luk, W H; Lee, Y C; Yung, K S",Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,https://doi.org/10.12809/hkmj208521; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729554/,290

Intervention options have proliferated in recent years necessitating an update to McDonald et al's 2013 systematic review of interventions to reduce diagnostic error. OBJECTIVES (1) To describe the types of published interventions for reducing diagnostic error that have been evaluated in terms of an objective patient outcome; (2) to assess the risk of bias in the included interventions and perform a sensitivity analysis of the findings; and (3) to determine the effectiveness of included interventions with respect to their intervention type. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2019. Publications were included if they delivered patient-related outcomes relating to diagnostic accuracy, management outcomes and/or morbidity and mortality. The interventions in each included study were categorised and analysed using the six intervention types described by McDonald et al (technique, technology-based system interventions, educational interventions, personnel changes, structured process changes and additional review methods). RESULTS Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen of the 20 included studies (including three randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) demonstrated improvements in objective patient outcomes following the intervention. These three RCTs individually evaluated a technique-based intervention, a technology-based system intervention and a structured process change. The inclusion or exclusion of two higher risk of bias studies did not affect the results. CONCLUSION Technique-based interventions, technology-based system interventions and structured process changes have been the most studied interventions over the time period of this review and hence are seen to be effective in reducing diagnostic error. However, more high-quality RCTs are required, particularly evaluating educational interventions and personnel changes, to demonstrate the value of these interventions in diverse settings.","Dave, Neha; Bui, Sandy; Morgan, Corey; Hickey, Simon; Paul, Christine L",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408064/,290
74690,Cost of Alteplase Has More Than Doubled Over the Past Decade.,2017,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of prosthetic carotid bypass (PCB) with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in treatment of restenosis after CEA or carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS From January 2000 to December 2014, 66 patients (57 men and 9 women; mean age, 71 years) presenting with recurrent carotid artery stenosis ≥70% (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial [NASCET] criteria) were enrolled in a prospective study in three centers. The study was approved by an Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from all patients. During the same period, a total of 4321 CEAs were completed in the three centers. In these 66 patients, the primary treatment of the initial carotid artery stenosis was CEA in 57 patients (86%) and CAS in nine patients (14%). The median delay between primary and redo revascularization was 32 months. Carotid restenosis was symptomatic in 38 patients (58%) with transient ischemic attack (n = 20) or stroke (n = 18). In this series, all patients received statins; 28 patients (42%) received dual antiplatelet therapy, and 38 patients (58%) received single antiplatelet therapy. All PCBs were performed under general anesthesia. No shunt was used in this series. Nasal intubation to improve distal control of the internal carotid artery was performed in 33 patients (50%), including those with intrastent restenosis. A PTFE graft of 6 or 7 mm in diameter was used in 6 and 60 patients, respectively. Distal anastomosis was end to end in 22 patients and end to side with a clip distal to the atherosclerotic lesions in 44 patients. Completion angiography was performed in all cases. The patients were discharged under statin and antiplatelet treatment. After discharge, all of the patients underwent clinical and Doppler ultrasound follow-up every 6 months. Median length of follow-up was 5 years. RESULTS No patient died, sustained a stroke, or presented with a cervical hematoma during the postoperative period. One transient facial nerve palsy and two transient recurrent nerve palsies occurred. Two late strokes in relation to two PCB occlusions occurred at 2 years and 4 years; no other graft stenosis or infection was observed. At 5 years, overall actuarial survival was 81% ± 7%, and the actuarial stroke-free rate was 93% ± 2%. There were no fatal strokes. CONCLUSIONS PCB with PTFE grafts is a safe and durable alternative to CEA in patients with carotid restenosis after CEA or CAS in situations in which CEA is deemed either hazardous or inadvisable.","Illuminati, Giulio; Belmonte, Romain; Schneider, Fabrice; Pizzardi, Giulia; Calió, Francesco G; Ricco, Jean-Baptiste",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2016.11.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28268107/,290

75985,Aberrant default mode network in patients with primary dysmenorrhea: a fMRI study.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Pediatric emergency mass critical care during disasters requires modifications to standard healthcare operations. Modification of standards for pediatric emergency mass critical care should include incorporation of family-centered care principles. Family-centered care, which is an integral aspect of current pediatric practice, encourages active participation of the child's family in medical care delivery. While family-centered care should be practical in most disasters, whether we can operationalize it in pediatric emergency mass critical care is unknown. However, every effort to adhere to the principles should be made. This manuscript addresses some of the basic tensions that exist between creating efficient disaster-related standards and offering family-centered care by augmenting the concepts outlined elsewhere in the supplement with practical suggestions on incorporating family-centered care. In addition, this manuscript demonstrates how family-centered care benefits not only children and families, but also the staff providing care to pediatric patients in disasters. METHODS In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations.Steering Committee members established subgroups by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010.The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS This paper offers a list of practical suggestions for incorporating family-centered care principles into each of the following healthcare settings during a disaster, including a pediatric emergency mass critical care event: emergency medical services transport, emergency departments, pediatric intensive care units, general pediatric wards, and alternative sites. Disaster and pediatric emergency mass critical care responses must incorporate family-centered care principles to the extent possible in a variety of healthcare settings.","Mason, Katherine E; Urbansky, Holly; Crocker, Liz; Connor, Maureen; Anderson, Michael R; Kissoon, Niranjan",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0b013e318234a812; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22067925/,290

76626,Editor Profile: Nikos Karamanos.,2021-08-01,"The functional adaptability and conformational plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins allow for the efficient modulation of complex phenotypic responses to the host receptor and antibodies. In this study, we combined atomistic simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning approaches to examine binding mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with three different classes of antibodies. The ensemble-based profiling of binding and allosteric propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues showed that these proteins can work as functionally adaptable and allosterically regulated machines. Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417, E484, and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations can modulate collective motions, alter the global allosteric response, and elicit binding resistance. We suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit the plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter the response to antibody binding without compromising the activity of the spike protein.","Verkhivker, Gennady; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz; Gupta, Grace",Journal of chemical theory and computation,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.1c00372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138559/,290

METHODS The oncologic outcomes were compared between 140 patients with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or higher (obese group) and 140 patients with a BMI of <25 kg/m(2) (nonobese group) that were matched for sex, tumor location, date of operation, and pTNM stage. RESULTS The proportion of patients with postoperative complications was significantly higher in the obese group (15 %) than in the nonobese group (6 %). The disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate in patients with stage I or II disease were similar in the obese group (98.6 and 98.8 %, respectively) and the nonobese group (97.8 and 97.8 %, respectively). The disease-free survival rate and overall survival rate in patients with stage III disease also did not differ significantly between the obese group (77.2 and 79.4 %, respectively) and the nonobese group (83.4 and 84.9 %, respectively).

The reasons for this are likely to be multifactorial including improved survival of preterm infants. AIM To assess the severity of viral bronchiolitis in preterm compared with term infants admitted at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt, based on the outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted throughout a 3-year period from September 2011 to October 2014. It included 153 infants, 74 healthy preterm and 79 healthy term infants, admitted with clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis at a tertiary hospital in Cairo, Egypt. Bronchiolitis severity score (BSS) was recorded, and nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each patient at the time of presentation. Viruses were identified using reverse transcription PCR. The clinical course and patient's outcome were recorded. RESULTS This study recorded a significantly more severe BSS for preterm compared with term infants. The preterm group had an increased mean length of hospital stay and oxygen therapy and were more likely to need ICU admission and mechanical ventilation compared with the term group. The mean ±SD BSS for infections with human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 3 was more significantly severe in preterm compared with term infants. Bacterial co-infection was significantly correlated with severity scoring in both groups. CONCLUSION Prematurity significantly affects the severity of bronchiolitis, and this underscores the importance of early categorization of these infants as a high-risk group on their first visit. Physician should be aware that their illness runs a more severe course, even if they have no underlying disorders.","El Basha, Noussa; Marzouk, Huda; Sherif, May; El Kholy, Amani",The Journal of the Egyptian Public Health Association,https://doi.org/10.21608/epx.2018.16152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30341997/,290

The link to the online survey that was created for this study was shared with Brazilian endodontists through social networking applications. The questionnaire contained questions that pertained to COVID-19 and its impact on dental practice. The collected data were analyzed using t-test, chi-square analysis, and analysis of variance, and the level of significance was set at 0.05. A total of 2,135 participants responded to the questionnaire, and all five Brazilian regions were represented in the sample. A total of 98.50% of endodontists reported that dental procedures can transmit COVID-19. Complete social distancing was practiced by 96.68% of the participants, and approximately 25% knew someone who had COVID-19. Moreover, in their daily practice, 72.13% of them implemented biosecurity measures that are ineffective in preventing COVID-19. Furthermore, 91.7% of them reportedly suspended elective dental procedures. Only 55.69% of them reported that they performed only emergency procedures in their workplaces. Those who believed that COVID-19 cannot be transmitted during dental procedures were less knowledgeable about the symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.0095). Endodontists who believed that personal protective equipment cannot prevent contamination were more knowledgeable about the symptoms of COVID-19 than their counterparts (p = 0.0003). The participating Brazilian endodontists demonstrated adequate knowledge about the risk of contamination during dental procedures and the main symptoms of COVID-19.

78426,Maternal vaccination: moving the science forward.,2015,"INTRODUCTION The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic. Many studies have shown that several laboratory parameters are related to disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 cases. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship of a prognostic factor, D-dimer, with disease severity, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS A systematic search for all observational studies and trials involving adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 that had any data related to D-dimer on admission was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD) of D-dimer values for outcomes such as disease severity, mortality, and need for ICU care. RESULTS A total of 29 studies (4,328 patients) were included in this meta-analysis, which revealed a higher mean of D-dimer levels on admission in severe patients than in nonsevere patients (MD = 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.28], P < .05; I2 = 90%). The nonsurvivor group had a higher pooled MD of D-dimer values on admission (MD = 5.54 [95% CI: 3.40-7.67], P < .05; I2 = 90%). Patients who needed ICU admission had insignificantly higher D-dimer values than patients who did not need ICU admission (MD = 0.29, [95% CI: -0.05 to 0.63], P = .10; I2 = 71%). CONCLUSION Elevated D-dimer levels on admission were associated with an increased risk of disease severity and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nugroho, Johanes; Wardhana, Ardyan; Maghfirah, Irma; Mulia, Eka Prasetya Budi; Rachmi, Dita Aulia; A'yun, Maya Qurota; Septianda, Imanita",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32931146/,290

Nevertheless, more complex surgical procedures have brought a higher complexity and longer duration for general anesthesia, which has led to a series of adverse events such as hemodynamic instability, under- or overdosage of anesthetic drugs, and an increased number of post-anesthetic events. In order to adapt the anesthesia according to the particularities of each patient, the multimodal monitoring of these patients is highly recommended. Classically, general anesthesia monitoring consists of the analysis of vital functions and gas exchange. Multimodal monitoring refers to the concomitant monitoring of the degree of hypnosis and the nociceptive-antinociceptive balance. By titrating anesthetic drugs according to these parameters, clinical benefits can be obtained, such as hemodynamic stabilization, the reduction of awakening times, and the reduction of postoperative complications. Another important aspect is the impact on the status of inflammation and the redox balance. By minimizing inflammatory and oxidative impact, a faster recovery can be achieved that increases patient safety. The purpose of this literature review is to present the most modern multimodal monitoring techniques to discuss the particularities of each technique.","Rogobete, Alexandru Florin; Bedreag, Ovidiu Horea; Papurica, Marius; Popovici, Sonia Elena; Bratu, Lavinia Melania; Rata, Andreea; Barsac, Claudiu Rafael; Maghiar, Andra; Garofil, Dragos Nicolae; Negrea, Mihai; Petcu, Laura Bostangiu; Toma, Daiana; Dumbuleu, Corina Maria; Rimawi, Samir; Sandesc, Dorel",Medicina,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57020132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33540844/,290

BACKGROUND Percutaneous treatment of peripheral vascular disease is associated with a high recurrence. Paclitaxel-coated balloons at 3 μg/mm(2) formulated differently have shown promising results with reduced restenosis. Methods Subjects at 9 centers with Rutherford class 2 to 5 femoropopliteal lesions were randomized between June 2009 and December 2009 to treatment with Lutonix DCB (n = 49) versus uncoated balloons (control group [n = 52]), stratified by whether balloon-only treatment (n = 75) or stenting (n = 26) was intended. The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included adjudicated major adverse events (death, amputation, target lesion thrombosis, reintervention), functional outcomes, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS Demographic, peripheral vascular disease, and lesion characteristics were matched, with mean lesion length of 8.1 3.8 cm and 42% total occlusions. At 6 months, late lumen loss was 58% lower for the Lutonix DCB group (0.46 1.13 mm) than for the control group (1.09 1.07 mm; p = 0.016). Composite 24-month major adverse events were 39% for the DCB group, including 15 target lesion revascularizations, 1 amputation, and 4 deaths versus 46% for uncoated balloon group, with 20 target lesion revascularizations, 1 thrombosis, and 5 deaths. Pharmacokinetics showed biexponential decay with peak concentration (Cmax) of 59 ng/ml and total observed exposure (AUC(all)) of 73 ng h/ml. For successful DCB deployment excluding 8 malfunctions, 6-month late lumen loss was 0.39 mm and the 24-month target lesion revascularization rate was 24%. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of femoropopliteal lesions with the low-dose Lutonix DCB reduced late lumen loss with safety comparable to that of control angioplasty.

79657,JAMA.,2020-02-18,"PURPOSE Bacterial infections are a factor for morbidity in patients with acute appendicitis (AA). The spreading of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a significant problem in surgery, and the most relevant MDR pathogens are summarized as Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococci (ESKAPE) bacteria. Data regarding the species and distribution of bacteria in AA are available, but information about the resistances and their relevance is deficient. METHODS In this retrospective study, we analyzed microbiological swabs of patients with AA. The outcome parameters of patients after laparoscopic appendectomy were analyzed against microbiological results, including antibiotic resistance testing. Positive swabs were compared with bacteria cultivated after alternative abdominal emergency surgery (AES). RESULTS In total, 584 patients with AA were included and had a mean age of 35.5 years. In 216 patients (36.9%), a swab was taken, and in 128 (59.3%) swabs, bacteria could be cultivated. The most frequent organisms were Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, and Pseudomonas. In 9.4% of the positive AA swabs, MDR germs were cultivated, and all of them were ESKAPE pathogens. Patients with MDR bacteria in AA suffered more infectious complications (p = 0.006) and needed longer hospitalizations (p < 0.009). In AES, aside from appendicitis, a different spectrum containing more MDR bacteria was cultivated (5.9 vs. 20.9%; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Although they occur less frequently in appendectomy compared to emergency surgeries for other abdominal diseases, MDR bacteria are traceable in this common disease and contribute to additional morbidity.","Reinisch, Alexander; Malkomes, Patrizia; Habbe, Nils; Bechstein, Wolf Otto; Liese, Juliane",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-017-2862-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28710611/,290

However, the relationships between OPN expression and chronic shunt-dependent hydrocephalus (SDHC) have never been investigated. In 166 SAH patients (derivation and validation cohorts, 110 and 56, respectively), plasma OPN levels were serially measured at days1-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 after aneurysmal obliteration. The OPN levels and clinical factors were compared between patients with and without subsequent development of chronic SDHC. Plasma OPN levels in the SDHC patients increased from days 1-3 to days 4-6 and remained high thereafter, while those in the non-SDHC patients peaked at days 4-6 and then decreased over time. Plasma OPN levels had no correlation with serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a systemic inflammatory marker. Univariate analyses showed that age, modified Fisher grade, acute hydrocephalus, cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and OPN and CRP levels at days 10-12 were significantly different between patients with and without SDHC. Multivariate analyses revealed that higher plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 were an independent factor associated with the development of SDHC, in addition to a more frequent use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and higher modified Fisher grade at admission. Plasma OPN levels at days 10-12 maintained similar discrimination power in the validation cohort and had good calibration on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Prolonged higher expression of OPN may contribute to the development of post-SAH SDHC, possibly by excessive repairing effects promoting fibrosis in the subarachnoid space.","Asada, Reona; Nakatsuka, Yoshinari; Kanamaru, Hideki; Kawakita, Fumihiro; Fujimoto, Masashi; Miura, Yoichi; Shiba, Masato; Yasuda, Ryuta; Toma, Naoki; Suzuki, Hidenori",Translational stroke research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12975-020-00886-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423213/,290

80273,"Impact of timing on wound dressing removal after caesarean delivery: a multicentre, randomised controlled trial.",2020-04-21,"Liver transplantation (LT) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive recipients with end-stage liver disease has become an accepted practice. However, because these patients are increasingly being recognized as prothrombotic, we reviewed their posttransplant thrombotic complications. Because morphological changes might be responsible in part for this prothrombotic state, we also conducted a histopathological review of explants from HIV-positive patients. Between 1990 and 2010, 24 of 3502 recipients (including 23 adults) were HIV-positive at LT. These patients and their postoperative courses were reviewed with a particular focus on vascular complications, risk factors, and outcomes. Another patient in whom HIV was detected 12 years after LT was also examined. Among the 24 HIV-positive LT recipients (17 males and 22 whole liver grafts; median age = 40 years), 5 developed arterial complications [including 3 cases of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), 1 case of generalized arteriopathy (on angiography), and 1 case of endoarteritis (on histological analysis)]. Multiple arterial anastomoses were performed in 8 of the 24 recipients, and HAT occurred twice within this anastomosis group. The outcomes of the 3 patients with HAT included retransplantation, biliary stenting for ischemic cholangiopathy followed by retransplantation, and observation only. In addition, 5 separate venous thrombotic events were detected in the 24 recipients during this period. Moreover, the delayed-HIV recipient developed delayed HAT and subsequently ischemic cholangiopathy and was being assessed for retransplantation at the time of this writing. In conclusion, the prothrombotic state associated with combined HIV and liver disease is a cause of morbidity after LT: 8 of the 24 recipients (33%) in this series suffered vascular thrombotic complications. There is a potential increase in the risk of HAT: the rate for the HIV-positive cohort was higher than the rate for historical HIV-negative controls [12% versus 3.2%, P = 0.016 (Fisher's exact test)]. The minimization of complex arterial reconstruction, coagulopathy screening, and risk-adapted antithrombotic chemoprophylaxis appear to be reasonable precautions.","Cherian, P Thomas; Alrabih, Wesal; Douiri, Abdel; Quaglia, Alberto; Heneghan, Michael A; O'Grady, John; Rela, Mohamed; Heaton, Nigel D",Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/lt.22449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22006832/,290
80310,When and how to perform a biopsy on a chronic wound.,2010,"The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RTPCR-RFLP) technique has been developed and used in the serotype diagnosis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infection. In this report, we first demonstrate that the RT-PCR-RFLP was sensitive in detecting both Massachusetts 41 (Mass 41) and JMK strains of IBV singly; the detection limit for both was approximately 0.15ng viral RNA using gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, the ability of the technique to semi-quantify the relative amounts of Mass 41 and JMK RNA in their mixture was shown by performing RT-PCR-RFLP on various combinations of serially diluted known amounts of Mass 41 and JMK RNA. Results indicated that both Mass 41 and JMK can be detected and semi-quantified when there is less than 10(3)-fold difference between the two viral RNA template inputs, which are above the lower detection limit. Based on this result, the interaction between Mass 41 and JMK in ovo was examined by inoculating 10-day-old embryos with various combinations of different EID(50) titers of Mass 41 and JMK. RT-PCR-RFLP results showed that Mass 41 dominates over JMK in an EID(50) titerdependent fashion, but not the reverse. To further investigate the underlying mechanism, replication efficiency of Mass 41 and JMK was compared at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48h after inoculation of embryos with 10(5.3) EID(50) of individual Mass 41 and JMK. No significant difference (P > 0.05) on replication efficiency between these two serotypes was found based on the results of total RNA concentration and RT-PCR results of 10-fold dilution of RNA at the indicated time points. By inoculating heat-inactivated Mass 41 with live JMK into embryos, only JMK was detected by RT-PCR-RFLP and no dominating interference was observed. Data suggest that the dominance is not due to the replication efficiency of Mass 41 and JMK; a receptor-mediated mechanism might be responsible for it.","Wang, X; Khan, M I",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/030794500750047199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19184836/,290

Longitudinal data from U.S. adults in a romantic relationship (N = 291) were collected via three waves of an online survey. Participants self-reported anxiety, depression, increased alcohol use, and dyadic coping since the pandemic. Relationship conflict variables included whether the participant reported that they and their partner ""had disagreements related to the Coronavirus,"" ""had more disagreements than usual,"" ""had more verbal fights than usual,"" and ""had more physical fights than usual"" in the past two weeks. Analyses controlled for sociodemographic characteristics as well as days spent in lockdown and employment change due to COVID-19. Results indicated that couples' disagreement and verbal fighting scores increased from Time 1 to Time 2, but disagreements related to COVID-19 and physical fighting did not. Couples with higher levels of dyadic coping reported fewer fights and disagreements on average. However, dyadic coping did not buffer participants from increases in relationship conflict. Increased alcohol use since the pandemic was positively associated with disagreements related to COVID-19, disagreement scores, and verbal fighting scores. More days spent in lockdown was associated with increases in disagreements related to COVID-19. The conditions created by COVID-19 may contribute to worsening relationship conflict, even among couples who start with high levels of dyadic coping. Depression and alcohol use may contribute to poorer relationship quality during the pandemic. There is need for enhanced intervention and mental health supports to mitigate the potential effects of the pandemic on couples' relationship functioning.","Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Rodriguez, Christina M",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211006359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33866855/,290
81975,"Estimating the protective effect of case isolation with transmission tree reconstruction during the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria, 2014.",2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Marginal ulcer perforation is a known complication of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and laparoscopic repair may be a feasible option minimizing the morbidity associated with a large laparotomy incision. We present our experience with laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcers in patients who have previously undergone RYGB. METHODS A retrospective chart review from August 2005 to April 2007 was performed identifying all patients who underwent laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB at one hospital. The perforation was repaired either by laparoscopic primary suture closure followed by application of an omental patch or by laparoscopic Graham patch without primary suture repair. Operative time, duration of hospitalization, postoperative follow-up, and postoperative complications were recorded. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. RESULTS Six patients underwent laparoscopic repair of a perforated marginal ulcer. Operative time was 101.8 ± 50 minutes with a mean hospitalization of 5.3 ± 2.7 days. Follow-up was 6.2 ± 7.5 months. Postoperative complications included 2 patients with nausea and vomiting related to an exposed suture at the gastrojejunostomy, 1 patient with chronic gastritis, and 1 patient developed a stricture at the gastrojejunostomy. CONCLUSIONS We present the largest series to date of laparoscopic repair of perforated marginal ulcers utilizing an omental patch for repair. We demonstrate that a laparoscopic repair can be completed in a reasonable operative time, with minimal postoperative hospitalization, and low associated morbidity. Patients who develop a perforated marginal ulcer after RYGB can be safely and effectively treated with laparoscopic repair with an omental patch.","Wheeler, Andrew A; de la Torre, Roger A; Fearing, Nicole M",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Recipients' mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) and tracheal epithelial cells (TEC) were harvested, cultured, expanded, and seeded on a donor trachea within a bioreactor. Prior techniques used for cellular seeding have involved only static-seeding methods. Here, we describe a novel bioreactor for recellularization of long-segment tracheae. Tracheae were recellularized with epithelial cells on the luminal surface and bone marrow-derived MSC on the external surface. We used dynamic perfusion seeding for both cell types and demonstrate an increase in both cellular counts and homogeneity scores compared with traditional methods. Despite these improvements, orthotopic transplantation of these scaffolds revealed no labeled cells at postoperative day 3 and lack of re-epithelialization within the first 2 weeks. The animals in this study had postoperative respiratory distress and tracheal collapse that was incompatible with life.","Haykal, Siba; Salna, Michael; Zhou, Yingzhe; Marcus, Paula; Fatehi, Mostafa; Frost, Geoff; Machuca, Tiago; Hofer, Stefan O P; Waddell, Thomas K","Tissue engineering.

82524,COVID-19 vaccines start moving into advanced trials.,2020-06-08,"OBJECTIVES The use of bipolar sealing devices during pulmonary resection is particularly useful in thoracoscopic surgery. Theoretically, a bipolar device, which contains the current in a smaller area and completes the current cycle only through the tissue between the electrodes, may reduce the proportion of patients experiencing atrial fibrillation compared with monopolar devices such as the electrosurgical pencil using which the current completes the cycle through the patient. We investigated the impact of the LigaSure™ (LS) tissue fusion technology with the ForceTriad™ energy platform device on the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation and on the reduction of postoperative chest tube output and hospital length of stay after open pulmonary lobectomy. METHODS A pilot prospective randomized, controlled trial comparing LS tissue fusion technology with the ForceTriad™ energy platform to the conventional electrosurgical pencil. Overall, 146 patients with resectable lung cancer were recruited at the Division of Thoracic Surgery of the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Fondazione Pascale, IRCCS, between January 2011 and July 2013. Of these, 119 candidates to open lobectomy for non-small-cell lung cancer were randomized to either LS tissue fusion technology with the ForceTriad™ energy platform (LS: 57 patients) or standard haemostatic procedure (standard treatment, ST: 62 patients) for hilar and mediastinal nodal dissection. The primary end-point was to compare the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation of LS compared with ST. The secondary end-point was to compare the efficacy of LS compared with ST in terms of total chest tube drainage, daily chest tube drainage and chest tube duration. RESULTS There was no statistically significant difference between LS and ST in terms of postoperative atrial fibrillation (P=0.31). However, LS was associated to significant reduction of duration of both mediastinal nodal dissection (P=0.017) and the cumulative chest tube drainage (P=0.025). CONCLUSIONS The incidence of atrial fibrillation with LS tissue fusion technology with the ForceTriad™ energy platform is not reduced as compared with conventional electrosurgical pencil. However, the use of LS during mediastinal nodal dissection is associated to shorter duration of lymphadenectomy and duration of chest tube drainage.","Martucci, Nicola; Tracey, Maura; La Rocca, Antonello; La Manna, Carmine; De Luca, Giuseppe; Rocco, Gaetano",European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezu391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25312529/,290

The aim of this study was to assess the cut-off scores proposed by the MALDI-TOF MS system for mycobacteria identification. A total of 693 clinical isolates from liquid media and 760 from solid media were analysed, encompassing 67 different nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species. MALDI-TOF MS identified 558 (80.5%) isolates from liquid media and 712 (93.7%) isolates from solid media with scores ≥1.60. Among these, four (0.7%) misidentifications were obtained from liquid media and four (0.5%) from solid media. Regarding species diversity, MALDI-TOF MS successfully identified 64 (95.5%) different species, while PCR-reverse hybridization (GenoType CM/AS) identified 24 (35.8%) different species. With a MALDI-TOF MS score ≥2 all isolates were correctly identified, as well as most isolates in the range 1.60-1.99, except M. angelicum, M. parascrofulaceum, M. peregrinum, M. porcinum and M. gastri In conclusion, MALDI-TOF MS is a useful method for identifying a large diversity of NTM species. A score threshold of 1.60 proved useful for identifying almost all the isolates tested; only a few species required a higher score (≥2.00) to obtain a valid definitive identification.","Rodriguez-Temporal, David; Rodríguez-Sánchez, Belén; Alcaide, Fernando",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01103-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719033/,290
83248,NaME-PrO-assisted ARMS (NAPA): a novel approach for the improvement of ARMS-PCR specificity in liquid biopsies.,2019,"Injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children in the USA. Understanding the impact of executive functions (EFs) on the risk of injuries is crucial for developing effective interventions. However, literature has failed to examine the relationship between multiple EFs and injury domains. The present paper quantitatively synthesized research on cool and hot EFs and children's intentional and unintentional injury risks using a novel meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) approach. A systematic review was conducted in the following databases: PsycINFO, Scopus, SafetyLit, Cochrane Central, and PubMed (Medline). After screening titles, abstracts, and full texts, a total of 31 studies were eligible for the MASEM analysis. One-stage MASEM was conducted on six conceptualized path analysis models according to the complexity of exogenous and endogenous variables. The MASEM models suggested that hot and cool EFs were negatively associated with children's risk of injury or injury-related risk behaviors regardless of mean age and proportion of females. Among cool EF skills, inhibitory control, but not working memory or cognitive flexibility, was significantly associated with risks of unintentional injuries. Emotion regulation was the dominant hot EF skill examined in the literature and was found significantly associated with risks of non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSIs). EF has a significant impact on children's risk of both unintentional and intentional injuries. Future research should focus on the combined force of hot and cool EF on children's risks of injuries and injury-related risk behaviors.","Shen, Jiabin; Wang, Yan; Kurpad, Nayantara; Schena, David A",Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11121-021-01271-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34212300/,290

85372,Does virtual reality simulation training result in fewer real-life cataract surgery complications? A systematic literature review.,2020-07-13,"Surface plasmon resonance based sensors have emerged as a commercially fostering portable bio-detector. The scientific community is engaged in extensive research to improve its performance in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility for the recognition of specific biomolecules. Essentially, there is a need for miniaturizing the size of existing sensors with innovative designs without compromising its bio-affinity and sensitivity performance. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a grating-coupled surface plasmon polariton sensor on a thin flat gold layer using a hybrid configuration. The proof of concept of the grating architecture has been realized through an innovative fabrication procedure, with experimental verification of its bulk sensitivity. The geometry is identical to the prism-coupling configuration, yet, with miniaturization and compactness. Characteristics of the excited modes in the spectral regime of interest are investigated using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation. The effective index calculation of the resonance conditions and the accompanying field distribution can identify the excited surface plasmon polariton (SPP) and metal-assisted guided-mode resonance (MaGMR) modes. Detailed probing of the electric field distribution of the desired SPP mode reveals an extended evanescent decay length of 1284 nm, close to the theoretical limit, and an extended propagation length of 270 μm. The experimental demonstration of reflectance dip with two different analyte media perceived an increased bulk sensitivity of 1133 nm/RIU. Remarkably, this resonant mode exhibits sensing capabilities for a wide range of analyte refractive index. We believe that the fabricated configuration with observed high-sensitivity and calculated ultra-deep evanescent field penetration depth along with extended propagation length can lead to the designing of a hands-on biochip for detecting large biomolecules.","Joseph, Shereena; Sarkar, Swagato; Joseph, Joby",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c12525; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962344/,290

Little is known about the relationship between host cell proteins and viroporin activity. The human JC polyomavirus (JCV) is the causative agent of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The JCV-encoded agnoprotein, which is essential for viral replication, has been shown to act as a viroporin. Here we demonstrate that the JCV agnoprotein specifically interacts with adaptor protein complex 3 through its δ subunit. This interaction interrupts adaptor protein complex 3-mediated vesicular trafficking with suppression of the targeting of the protein to the lysosomal degradation pathway and instead permits the transport of agnoprotein to the cell surface with resulting membrane permeabilization. The findings demonstrate a previously undescribed paradigm in virus-host interactions allowing the host to regulate viroporin activity and suggest that the viroporins of other viruses may also be highly regulated by specific interactions with host cell proteins.","Suzuki, Tadaki; Orba, Yasuko; Makino, Yoshinori; Okada, Yuki; Sunden, Yuji; Hasegawa, Hideki; Hall, William W; Sawa, Hirofumi",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1311457110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24167297/,290

However, another evolving focus is assessing and mitigating the risk of vertical transmission amongst COVID-19-positive mothers. The objective of this review was to summarize the current evidence on the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester and its effects on the neonate.Methods: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL) were searched from January 2020 to May 2020, with continuous surveillance.Results: 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 157 mothers and 160 neonates. The mean age of the pregnant patients was 30.8 years and the mean gestational period was 37 weeks and 1 d. Currently, there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. Amongst 81 (69%) neonates who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5 (6%) had a positive result. However, amongst these 5 neonates, the earliest test was performed at 16 h after birth, and only 1 neonate was positive when they were later re-tested. However, this neonate initially tested negative at birth, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely hospital-acquired rather than vertically transmitted. 13 (8%) neonates had complications or symptoms.Conclusions: The findings of this rapid descriptive review based on early clinical evidence suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to neonate/newborn did not occur. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal management of neonates born to COVID-19-positive mothers.","Thomas, Priya; Alexander, Paul Elias; Ahmed, Usman; Elderhorst, Erica; El-Khechen, Hussein; Mammen, Manoj J; Debono, Victoria Borg; Aponte Torres, Zuleika; Aryal, Komal; Brocard, Eva; Sagastuy, Begoña; Alhazzani, Waleed","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1786055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32611247/,290
85519,Sterile Technique.,2018,"BACKGROUND One small study suggests that gargling with licorice before induction of anesthesia reduces the risk of postoperative sore throat. Double-lumen tubes are large and thus especially likely to provoke sore throats. We therefore tested the hypothesis that preoperative gargling with licorice solution prevents postoperative sore throat and postextubation coughing in patients intubated with double-lumen tubes. METHODS We enrolled 236 patients having elective thoracic surgery who required intubation with a double-lumen endotracheal tube. Patients were randomly assigned to gargle 5 minutes before induction of anesthesia for 1 minute with: (1) Extractum Liquiritiae Fluidum (licorice 0.5 g); or (2) Sirupus Simplex (sugar 5 g); each diluted in 30 mL water. Sore throat and postextubation coughing were evaluated 30 minutes, 90 minutes, and 4 hours after arrival in the postanesthesia care unit, and the first postoperative morning using an 11-point Likert scale by an investigator blinded to treatment. RESULTS The incidence of postoperative sore throat was significantly reduced in patients who gargled with licorice rather than sugar-water: 19% and 36% at 30 minutes, 10% and 35% at 1.5 hours, and 21% and 45% at 4 hours, respectively. The corresponding estimated treatment effects (relative risks) were 0.54 (95% CI, 0.30-0.99, licorice versus sugar-water; P = 0.005), 0.31 (0.14-0.68) (P < 0.001), and 0.48 (0.28-0.83) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Licorice gargling halved the incidence of sore throat. Preinduction gargling with licorice appears to be a simple way to prevent a common and bothersome complication.","Ruetzler, Kurt; Fleck, Michael; Nabecker, Sabine; Pinter, Kristina; Landskron, Gordian; Lassnigg, Andrea; You, Jing; Sessler, Daniel I",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318299a650; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23921656/,290

OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of mobile technologies versus usual care for supporting communication and consultations between healthcare providers on healthcare providers' performance, acceptability and satisfaction, healthcare use, patient health outcomes, acceptability and satisfaction, costs, and technical difficulties. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and three other databases from 1 January 2000 to 22 July 2019. We searched clinical trials registries, checked references of relevant systematic reviews and included studies, and contacted topic experts. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised trials comparing mobile technologies to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and consultations compared with usual care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We followed standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and EPOC. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS We included 19 trials (5766 participants when reported), most were conducted in high-income countries. The most frequently used mobile technology was a mobile phone, often accompanied by training if it was used to transfer digital images. Trials recruited participants with different conditions, and interventions varied in delivery, components, and frequency of contact. We judged most trials to have high risk of performance bias, and approximately half had a high risk of detection, attrition, and reporting biases. Two studies reported data on technical problems, reporting few difficulties. Mobile technologies used by primary care providers to consult with hospital specialists We assessed the certainty of evidence for this group of trials as moderate to low. Mobile technologies: - probably make little or no difference to primary care providers following guidelines for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD; 1 trial, 47 general practices, 3004 participants); - probably reduce the time between presentation and management of individuals with skin conditions, people with symptoms requiring an ultrasound, or being referred for an appointment with a specialist after attending primary care (4 trials, 656 participants); - may reduce referrals and clinic visits among people with some skin conditions, and increase the likelihood of receiving retinopathy screening among people with diabetes, or an ultrasound in those referred with symptoms (9 trials, 4810 participants when reported); - probably make little or no difference to patient-reported quality of life and health-related quality of life (2 trials, 622 participants) or to clinician-assessed clinical recovery (2 trials, 769 participants) among individuals with skin conditions; - may make little or no difference to healthcare provider (2 trials, 378 participants) or participant acceptability and satisfaction (4 trials, 972 participants) when primary care providers consult with dermatologists; - may make little or no difference for total or expected costs per participant for adults with some skin conditions or CKD (6 trials, 5423 participants). Mobile technologies used by emergency physicians to consult with hospital specialists about people attending the emergency department We assessed the certainty of evidence for this group of trials as moderate. Mobile technologies: - probably slightly reduce the consultation time between emergency physicians and hospital specialists (median difference -12 minutes, 95% CI -19 to -7; 1 trial, 345 participants); - probably reduce participants' length of stay in the emergency department by a few minutes (median difference -30 minutes, 95% CI -37 to -25; 1 trial, 345 participants). We did not identify trials that reported on providers' adherence, participants' health status and well-being, healthcare provider and participant acceptability and satisfaction, or costs. Mobile technologies used by community health workers or home-care workers to consult with clinic staff We assessed the certainty of evidence for this group of trials as moderate to low. Mobile technologies: - probably make little or no difference in the number of outpatient clinic and community nurse consultations for participants with diabetes or older individuals treated with home enteral nutrition (2 trials, 370 participants) or hospitalisation of older individuals treated with home enteral nutrition (1 trial, 188 participants); - may lead to little or no difference in mortality among people living with HIV (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.22) or diabetes (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.12) (2 trials, 1152 participants); - may make little or no difference to participants' disease activity or health-related quality of life in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (1 trial, 85 participants); - probably make little or no difference for participant acceptability and satisfaction for participants with diabetes and participants with rheumatoid arthritis (2 trials, 178 participants). We did not identify any trials that reported on providers' adherence, time between presentation and management, healthcare provider acceptability and satisfaction, or costs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our confidence in the effect estimates is limited. Interventions including a mobile technology component to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and management of care may reduce the time between presentation and management of the health condition when primary care providers or emergency physicians use them to consult with specialists, and may increase the likelihood of receiving a clinical examination among participants with diabetes and those who required an ultrasound. They may decrease the number of people attending primary care who are referred to secondary or tertiary care in some conditions, such as some skin conditions and CKD. There was little evidence of effects on participants' health status and well-being, satisfaction, or costs.","Gonçalves-Bradley, Daniela C; J Maria, Ana Rita; Ricci-Cabello, Ignacio; Villanueva, Gemma; Fønhus, Marita S; Glenton, Claire; Lewin, Simon; Henschke, Nicholas; Buckley, Brian S; Mehl, Garrett L; Tamrat, Tigest; Shepperd, Sasha",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd012927.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32813281/,290
86498,Shear Forces.,2020-10-28,"Hospitalists play an important role in treating current and preventing future acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), which are associated with high rates of medical resource use and morbidity. Comprehensive admission screening and diagnostic tests are important in enabling hospitalists to reliably identify patients with AECOPD, the severity of the episode, and related issues that may prolong patients' hospital length of stay. Recurring exacerbations, especially those that require repeated acute care, can reduce physical activity and accelerate pulmonary decline and risk of death. Recommended pharmacotherapies for AECOPD should include short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and appropriate antibiotics in cases of suspected bacterial infection. Patients with demonstrable hypoxemia or respiratory failure may benefit from oxygen and/or ventilatory support. Long-term disease management with the goal of preventing future exacerbations should include ongoing emphasis toward smoking cessation and up-to-date vaccination, in addition to prescribing maintenance pharmacotherapies in accordance with respiratory treatment guidelines. Additional benefits may be derived from nonpharmacologic therapies, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, weight-loss recommendations, and treatment of obstructive sleep dyspnea when present. Effective communication among members of the inpatient and outpatient health care teams, the patient, and his or her caregivers is an important aspect of care transitions. Hospital discharge summaries should be transmitted to the patient's primary care physician and be readily available at the first follow-up visit. Discharge coaches and other allied health care providers can aid hospitalists in reinforcing self-management skills and patient education, and in emphasizing the importance of follow-up visits. Recent findings suggest that health and cost benefits are associated with improved COPD management. This article focuses on the pivotal role of the hospitalist in promoting and facilitating the steps toward improving quality outcomes and transitions of care for patients with COPD.","Chuang, Chan",Hospital practice,https://doi.org/10.3810/hp.2012.02.958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406893/,290

Two systematic reviews on obesity-management interventions in undergraduate medical education, both published in 2012, reported discrepant findings. This study aimed to build on previous research by identifying, systematically reviewing, and synthesizing current literature on the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at teaching management of patients with obesity to medical students. A comprehensive search of seven databases was performed with no date or language restrictions. Database search identified 6462 studies; 5373 were screened against title and abstract, 156 full-text articles were retrieved, 31 met eligibility criteria, and 17 were included after critical appraisal of study methodology. Nine cohort-studies, three qualitative, two case-controls, two mixed-methods, and one randomized controlled trial were included. Findings supported the educational effectiveness of brief (<3 h) educational interventions, the value of video-clips to deliver content, and the importance of in-person teaching. Findings also demonstrated an increase in the number of studies describing educational interventions aimed at teaching management of patients with obesity to medical students. These results can be used by medical educators to inform the design of educationally effective curricula focused on the management of patients with obesity in undergraduate medical education.","Katz, Nathan J; Neary, Emma; Tang, Natasha; Braund, Heather; Cofie, Nicholas; Zevin, Boris",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.13329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34378850/,290

This patient population is often considered as a high-risk group for surgical procedures. We, therefore, investigated the safety and efficacy of transvenous lead extraction in octogenarians using powered extraction sheaths. METHODS Between January 2013 and March 2017, 403 patients underwent lead extraction at 2 high-volume lead extraction centers. 71 octogenarians were treated with laser lead extraction and were included in this analysis. Primary extraction method was Laser lead extraction, with additional use of mechanical rotational sheaths or femoral snares, if necessary. Patient-based and procedural data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS Mean age was 83.5 ± 3.3 years, 64.7% were male. 152 leads were extracted. The mean lead dwell time of treated leads was 10.2 ± 5.2 years. Complete procedural success rate was 92.9%, while clinical success was achieved in 98.6%. Failure of extraction occurred in 1 patient (1.4%). In 6 (7.7%) patients, additional mechanical rotational sheaths or femoral snares were used. Overall complication rate was 4.2%, including 1 (1.4%) major (RA perforation) and 2 (2.8%) minor complications. No procedure related mortality was observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION Transvenous lead extraction in octogenarians with old leads, is safe and effective when performed in experienced centers. Patient's age should therefore not be considered as contraindication for lead extraction using powered extraction sheaths. This article is protected by copyright.

87485,Flavonoids targeting NRF2 in neurodegenerative disorders.,2020-10-15,"INTRODUCTION A life-threatening respiratory disease, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), has spread across the globe since December 2019. Many prognostic factors have already been put forward to predict the risk of death and other outcomes. The current study is evaluating the survival rate between hypertensive and non-hypertensive infected patients. METHODS Patients who were included in this study were admitted between 20 February to 1 March 2020 in Fars (southwest of Iran) province hospitals. Data were collected from the electronic base registry which contained demographic information, medical symptoms, and signs, underlying diseases, CT scan results, and final outcome. RESULTS Of all 1239 positive cases, 159 (12.83%) had known with hypertension ant this group was significantly older than non-hypertensive patients (66.1 years Vs 48.95 years, p < .001). According to Kaplan-Meier survival curve and log-rank test, it was seen hypertensive patients deteriorated more rapidly than non-hypertensive group (p = .032). Moreover, HIV, cardiovascular, and kidney disease were diagnosed as factors that increase the risk of death in hypertensive patients. CONCLUSION The current study about the survival rate of COVID-19 patients had shown hypertensive patents are in danger of disease severity, although it may be related to their age. Moreover, the probability of other complications like diabetes, smoking, asthma, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases, and either some other infections such as HIV can make the condition complicated and need more consideration to prevent noxious outcomes.","Emami, Amir; Javanmardi, Fatemeh; Akbari, Ali; Kojuri, Javad; Bakhtiari, Hamid; Rezaei, Tahereh; Keshavarzi, Abdolkhalegh; Falahati, Farshad",Clinical and experimental hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1080/10641963.2020.1812624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835530/,290
87645,Evaluation of quality of life in fertile Turkish women with severe endometriosis.,2015,"Stapler-less laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is emerging as a new potential affordable cost-effective alternative procedure. However, no pre-clinical data are currently available on human tissue. We aimed to evaluate whether traditionally suturing without the use of surgical stapling may produce a comparable bursting pressure on human gastric tissue. A prospective cohort of consecutive patients undergoing LSG was divided in two groups to compare a barbed extra-mucosal running suture (stapler-less) versus a standard stapler line. A burst pressure test was applied to the gastric specimen employing high-resolution manometric catheter. Type, location and features of the leak were described. We enrolled a total of 40 obese patients, 20 patients for each group. Median burst pressures of the stapler-less group resulted statistically significant increased (p < 0.0001) than the one in standard stapler group. In all cases, leak occurred along the surgical closure site independently from the used technique (group 1 vs 2; p = N.S.), more often at the proximal stomach (p < 0.05). In human ex vivo model, traditional surgical suture (i.e. running hand-sewn) produced an effective temporary closure, with superior resistance to increasing volume and pressure. How this may impact on clinical LSG outcomes needs further evaluations and was not the object of this study.","Del Genio, Gianmattia; Gambardella, Claudio; Tolone, Salvatore; Brusciano, Luigi; Parmeggiani, Domenico; Lanza Volpe, Mariachiara; Lucido, Francesco Saverio; Docimo, Ludovico",Updates in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-021-00975-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496955/,290
88923,Editor Profile: Angela Gronenborn.,2021-08-01,"BACKGROUND Automated titration of propofol and remifentanil guided by the bispectral index (BIS) has been used for numerous surgical procedures. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) uniquely combines major changes in circulating volume, an anhepatic phase, and ischaemia-reperfusion syndrome. We assessed the behaviour of this automated controller during OLT. METHODS Adult patients undergoing OLT were included in this pilot study. Consumption of propofol and remifentanil was calculated for each surgery period (dissection, anhepatic, and liver reperfusion phases). Arterial blood samples were collected at several time points to allow comparison of actual with calculated propofol and remifentanil concentrations. Data are presented as median [25th and 75th percentiles] or percentage (95% confidence interval). RESULTS Thirteen patients were studied. System performance, defined as the percentage of time with BIS in the range 40-60, was 88% (86-94) of the total duration of anaesthesia. Propofol requirement was decreased during the anhepatic phase compared with the dissection phase (2.9 [1.9-5.0] mg kg(-1) h(-1) and 4.6 [3.5-8.1] mg kg(-1) h(-1); P<0.03) while remifentanil consumption was unchanged (0.11 [0.09-0.19] µg kg- (1) min(-1)). Bland-Altman analysis showed a weak concordance for propofol (bias of 0.7 µg ml(-1) and limits of agreement of -2.2 to +3.7 µg ml(-1)) and remifentanil (bias of 1.3 ng ml(-1) and limits of agreement -4.3 to +6.8 ng ml(-1)). No adverse events were reported during anaesthesia. CONCLUSIONS This pilot study indicates that automated titration of propofol and remifentanil guided by the BIS is feasible during OLT.","Restoux, A; Grassin-Delyle, S; Liu, N; Paugam-Burtz, C; Mantz, J; Le Guen, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aew262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27543528/,290

The authors describe three patients who had confirmed COVID-19 and met the criteria for hospital admission but could not be assigned a hospital bed in a resource-limited country. The patients included a 72-year-old male, an 82-year-old female, and a 56-year-old male. They typically presented with fever, dyspnea, loss of taste and smell, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Oxygen saturation during the initial evaluation ranged from 80-89%. Laboratory results reported lymphopenia and neutrophilia, with leukocytosis in two patients. Inflammatory markers were also elevated for all three patients. CT scan findings showed bilateral ground-glass pulmonary opacities. SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in all three patients by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Home-based treatment was established. At the time of writing this report, all patients remain asymptomatic and with negative COVID-19 testing. Telemedicine and home-based treatment were essential assets in the care of these severely ill patients living in a low-resource setting where not all patients who have criteria to be admitted into the hospital are able to find a place in a collapsed health care system.","Briones-Claudett, Killen H; Mónica, H Briones-Claudett; Briones-Zamora, Killen H; Briones-Márquez, Diana C; Icaza-Freire, Andrea; Grunauer, Michelle",The Eurasian journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.5152/eurasianjmed.2021.20227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177302/,290

90491,Relationship between wild-caught organisms for bioassays and sampling areas: Widespread serpulid early-development comparison between two distinct populations after trace element exposure.,2020-08-17,"BACKGROUND Antibody-based imaging agents are available commercially, but their success has been limited, mainly because of low contrast and the emergence of 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scanning. In pretargeting, administration of the radionuclide is separated from the antibody, thereby enhancing image contrast and allowing detection at earlier time points after injection. METHODS The authors conducted an open-label, single-arm trial that assessed a pretargeting procedure in which an anticarcinoembryonic antigen x (anti-CEA x) anti-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (anti-DTPA)-indum (In) antibody was used in combination with a (111)In-labeled di-DTPA peptide for the diagnostic imaging of CEA-expressing colorectal cancer. Three patients received the (111)In peptide alone to investigate tumor targeting, organ distribution, and clearance of the peptide. Thereafter, 11 patients received the bispecific antibody (bsAb) (5 mg) to pretarget the tumor. After 3 to 5 days, patients were injected with 185 megabecquerels of (111)In-labeled peptide to assess the optimal interval for best image quality. RESULTS Fourteen patients with primary colorectal cancer were enrolled. One of 3 patients who received (111)In peptide alone had low-level tumor uptake. In 9 of 11 other patients, tumors were observed. In 1 patient, FDG-PET-positive lymph nodes were observed clearly with pretargeted immunoscintigraphy. Peptide pharmacokinetics revealed enhanced circulating levels of (111)In-labeled peptide in patients in the 3-day interval cohort compared with the other cohorts. Tumor-to-background ratios ranged from 3.5 to 6.4 in the 3-day interval group, from 5.1 to 14.2 in the 4-day interval group, and from 3.5 to 3.9 in the 5-day interval group. The best images were acquired with a 4-day interval at 24 hours after injection of the radiolabeled peptide. Grade 1 adverse events were observed in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS Imaging of colorectal cancer using a 2-step, pretargeting system produced the best imaging results 24 hours after peptide administration using a 4-day interval between injection of the bsAb and the peptide.","Aarts, Frits; Boerman, Otto C; Sharkey, Robert M; Hendriks, Thijs; Chang, Chien-Hsing; McBride, William J; Bleichrodt, Robert P; Oyen, Wim J G; Goldenberg, David M",Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.24799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20127959/,290

Methods All IDS members were asked to fill in a questionnaire, sent by email. A questionnaire available in English was sent to all IDS members (≈16.0000 members) by email. The questionnaire was anonymous, with a compiling time of less than 5 minutes. The survey was open for 30 days (from April 24, 2020 to May 24, 2020) and it could only be filled out once. Results Overall, 678 dermatologists responded to the questionnaire; 334 members stated that there has been a reduction of more than 75% in daily work activity during the pandemic, 265 dermatologists worked fewer days per week, and 118 experienced telemedicine for the first time. Acrodermatitis was the most frequently observed skin manifestation (n = 80) followed by urticarial rash (n = 69), morbilliform rash (n = 53) and purpuric manifestation (n = 40). In regard to the role of teledermatology, 565 dermatologists reported an increased number of teleconsultations, and the number of melanomas diagnosed during the pandemic was practically 0 for 385 (56.78%) of respondents. Conclusion This survey highlights that the outbreak had a negative impact on most dermatology services, with a significant reduction in consultation time spent for chronic patients, and an increased risk of missed melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) diagnosis. Moreover, our study confirms earlier findings of a wide range of skin manifestations associated with COVID-19.","Conforti, Claudio; Lallas, Aimilios; Argenziano, Giuseppe; Dianzani, Caterina; Di Meo, Nicola; Giuffrida, Roberta; Kittler, Harald; Malvehy, Josep; Marghoob, Ashfaq A; Soyer, H Peter; Zalaudek, Iris",Dermatology practical & conceptual,https://doi.org/10.5826/dpc.1101a153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614221/,290

92211,Burnout Among Urologists from Denmark and Michigan.,2020-09-08,"OBJECTIVES The average annual healthcare expenditure among elderly patients in Korea is increasing rapidly in indirect healthcare sectors, requiring an understanding of factors related to the use of both formal and informal caregivers. This study analyzed the characteristics of caregiver use and caregiving costs among elderly patients hospitalized due to acute illness or exacerbation of chronic diseases. METHODS A total of 819 study participants were selected from the 2017 Korea Health Panel Study Data. Replacement costing methods were applied to estimate the hours of informal caregiver assistance received by elderly inpatients. Elderly inpatients' predisposing, enabling, and need factors were studied to identify the relationship between caregiver uses, based on Andersen's behavior model. A two-part model was applied to analyze the factors related to care receipt and to estimate the incremental costs of care. RESULTS Elderly inpatients who used tertiary hospitals (OR: 2.77, p-value < 0.00) and received financial support (OR: 2.68, p-value < 0.00) were more likely to receive support from a caregiver. However, elderly inpatients living alone were lesser to do so (OR: 0.49, p-value < 0.00). Elderly inpatients with Medicaid insurance (β:0.54, p-value = 0.02) or financial aid (β: 0.64, p-value < 0.00) had a statistically positive association with spending more on caregiving costs. Additionally, financial support receivers had incremental costs of $627 in caregiving costs than nonreceivers. CONCLUSIONS This study presented significant socioenvironmental characteristics of formal and informal caregiver use and the related expenditures.

The aims of the study were to describe their screening experience and to compare clinical and laboratory features of H1N1 versus seasonal flu cases. METHODOLOGY The authors conducted a prospective observational study on consecutive patients aged 16 years and above presenting to a busy, urban ED for H1N1 screening over 50 days. Clinical, laboratory, radiological and PCR data were collected from the hospital electronic databases. Primary outcomes were proportions of confirmed H1N1 cases and their distribution of clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Secondary outcomes were comparison of clinical and laboratory features of H1N1 versus seasonal flu cases. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis was used to compare factors between the two groups. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS 1205 patients were screened. 31 (2.6%) and 133 (11%) of them had H1N1 and seasonal flu infections, respectively. The two groups had similar symptoms. There were six clinical and two laboratory features with statistically significant differences between H1N1 and seasonal flu cases. Clinical factors were travel or contact history, median age, respiratory rate, diastolic blood pressure and length of hospital stay. Laboratory factors were median platelet and lymphocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS The authors report their experience as the nation's H1N1 screening centre. They identified factors that were different between H1N1 and seasonal flu cases.

RESULTS Among the 1157 retrieved abstracts, only 69 met the inclusion criteria. 3D printed bone models were mainly used as training or simulation models for tumor removal, or bone reconstruction. Material jetting printers showed best performance but the highest cost. Stereolithographic, laser sintering and binder jetting printers allowed to create accurate models with adequate haptic feedback. The cheap fused deposition modeling printers exhibited satisfactory results for creating training models. CONCLUSION Patient-specific 3D printed models are known to be useful surgical and educational tools. Faced with the large diversity of software, printing technologies and materials, the clinical team should invest in a 3D printer specifically adapted to the final application.","Meglioli, Matteo; Naveau, Adrien; Macaluso, Guido Maria; Catros, Sylvain",3D printing in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s41205-020-00082-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079298/,290
92611,Proof of Concept: The Use of Whole-Slide Images (WSI) for Peer Review of Tissues on Routine Regulatory Toxicology Studies.,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is a common complication of viral upper respiratory tract infections (URI). Clinical characteristics of URIs complicated by ABS in young children have not been well studied. METHODS We identified ABS episodes in a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 294 children (6-35 months of age at enrollment), who were followed up for 1 year to capture all URI episodes and complications. At the initial URI visit seen by the study personnel (median day = 4 from symptoms onset), nasopharyngeal samples were obtained for bacterial cultures and viral studies. RESULTS Of 1295 documented URI episodes, 103 (8%) episodes (in 73 children) were complicated by ABS, 32 of which were concurrent with acute otitis media. The majority (72%) of ABS episodes were diagnosed based on persistent symptoms or a biphasic course. Average age at ABS diagnosis was 18.8 ± 7.2 months; White children were more likely to have ABS episodes than Blacks (P = 0.01). Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (P < 0.0001) was negatively associated, and adequate 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine immunization status (P = 0.001) appeared to increase the risk of ABS. Girls had more ABS episodes than boys (0.5 ± 0.8 vs. 0.3 ± 0.6 episodes/yr, respectively, P = 0.03). Viruses were detected in 63% during the initial URI visit; rhinovirus detection was positively correlated with ABS risk (P = 0.01). Bacterial cultures were positive in 82/83 (99%) available samples obtained at the initial URI visit; polymicrobial (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (20%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10%) were the most common cultures. Presence of pathogenic bacteria overall and presence of M. catarrhalis during URI were positively correlated with the risk for ABS (P = 0.04 for both). CONCLUSIONS ABS complicates 8% of URI in young children. Girls have more frequent ABS episodes than boys. Presence of rhinovirus and M. catarrhalis during URI are positively correlated with the risk for ABS complication.","Marom, Tal; Alvarez-Fernandez, Pedro E; Jennings, Kristofer; Patel, Janak A; McCormick, David P; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24717966/,290
92633,Flow Diversion after Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,2017,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to analyse the hospital cost of treatment with robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy for women with endometrial cancer or atypical complex hyperplasia and to identify differences in resource use and cost. MATERIAL AND METHODS This cost analysis was based on two cohorts: women treated with robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy (n = 202) or with total abdominal hysterectomy (n = 158) at Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark. We conducted an activity-based cost analysis including consumables and healthcare professionals' salaries. As cost-drivers we included severe complications, duration of surgery, anesthesia and stay at the post-anesthetic care unit, as well as number of hospital bed-days. Ordinary least-squares regression was used to explore the cost variation. The primary outcome was cost difference in Danish kroner between total abdominal hysterectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy. RESULTS The average cost of consumables was 12,642 Danish kroner more expensive per patient for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy than for total abdominal hysterectomy (2014 price level: 1€ = 7.50 Danish kroner). When including all cost-drivers, the analysis showed that the robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy procedure was 9386 Danish kroner (17%) cheaper than the total abdominal hysterectomy (p = 0.003). When the robot investment was included, the cost difference reduced to 4053 Danish kroner (robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy was 7% cheaper than total abdominal hysterectomy) (p = 0.20). Increasing age and Type 2 diabetes appeared to influence the overall costs. CONCLUSION For women with endometrial cancer or atypical complex hyperplasia, robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy was cheaper than total abdominal hysterectomy, mostly due to fewer complications and shorter length of hospital stay.","Herling, Suzanne F; Palle, Connie; Møller, Ann M; Thomsen, Thordis; Sørensen, Jan",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.12820; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26575851/,290

93369,Incidental Findings in the Trauma Population: Interdisciplinary Approach and Electronic Medical Record Reminder Association with Pre-Discharge Reporting and Medicolegal Risk.,2020-12-29,"BACKGROUND Infants undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk of a negative protein balance, due to increased proteolysis in response to surgery and the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit, and limited intake. The aim of the study was to quantify the effect on protein kinetics of a short-term high-protein (HP) diet in infants following cardiac surgery. METHODS In a prospective, double-blinded, randomized trial we compared the effects of a HP (5 g · kg(-1) · d(-1)) versus normal protein (NP, 2 g · kg(-1) · d(-1)) enteral diet on protein kinetics in children <24 months, on day 2 following surgical repair of congenital heart disease. Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSRalb) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-(13)C]valine infusion. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate differences between group medians. Additionally, the Hodges-Lehmann procedure was used to create a confidence interval with a point estimate of median differences between groups. RESULTS Twenty-eight children (median age 9 months, median weight 7 kg) participated in the study, of whom in only 20 subjects isotopic data could be used for final calculations. Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters. We observed valine synthesis rate of 2.73 (range: 0.94 to 3.36) and 2.26 (1.85 to 2.73) μmol · kg(-1) · min(-1) in the HP and NP diet, respectively. The net valine balance was 0.54 (-0.73 to 1.75) and 0.24 (-0.20 to 0.63) μmol · kg(-1) · min(-1) in the HP and NP group. Between groups, there was no difference in FSRalb. We observed increased oxidation and BUN in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, as a plausible explanation of the metabolic fate of surplus protein. CONCLUSIONS It is plausible that the surplus protein in the HP group has caused the increase of valine oxidation and ureagenesis, compared to the NP group. Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.

Different organizations have recommended performing polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) as part of the preoperative screening of surgical patients. We aimed to determine the performance of PCR testing to detect asymptomatic carriers. Methods Observational study carried out at a tertiary care center. We compared the results of preoperative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR test (RT-PCR) performed on a cohort of patients pending surgery with the results we would have expected assuming the epidemiological data released by government offices. Results We registered no positives in the 2,722 preoperative RT-PCR tests performed in our health care area between epidemiological Weeks 18 to 21, meaning a cumulative incidence trending to zero. Assuming public epidemiological data, the probabilistic projection of potential asymptomatic individuals ranged from 0.27*10e -4 (according to official data of new cases diagnosed by PCR) to 4.69*10e -4 if we assumed cases confirmed by IgG test in our province. Assuming a RT-PCR sensitivity of 95%, to obtain a positive result we should perform 38,461 and 2,028 tests respectively. Conclusions In scenarios of very low prevalence and despite high sensitivity scores, indiscriminate preoperative RT-PCR screening is of a questionable effectiveness for detecting asymptomatic carriers. Our findings evidence the difficulty of establishing reliable predictive models for the episodic and rapidly evolving incidence of infections such as has characterized the SARS CoV2 pandemic.","de la Matta, M; Delgado-Sánchez, J M; Gutiérrez, G M; López Romero, J L; Del Mar Martínez Gómez, M; Domínguez Blanco, A",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redar.2020.10.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34176974/,290

However, the extent to which effects might vary in different types of patient is uncertain. AIMS AND DESIGN We describe the protocol for an updated individual patient data meta-analysis of trials of intravenous alteplase, including results from the recently reported third International Stroke Trial, in which a wide range of patients enrolled up to six-hours after stroke onset were randomized to alteplase vs. control. STUDY OUTCOMES This protocol will specify the primary outcome for efficacy, specified prior to knowledge of the results from the third International Stroke Trial, as the proportion of patients having a 'favorable' stroke outcome, defined by modified Rankin Score 0-1 at final follow-up at three- to six-months. The primary analysis will be to estimate the extent to which the known benefit of alteplase on modified Rankin Score 0-1 diminishes with treatment delay, and the extent to which it is independently modified by age and stroke severity. Key secondary outcomes include effect of alteplase on death within 90 days; analyses of modified Rankin Score using ordinal, rather than dichotomous, methods; and effects of alteplase on symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, fatal intracranial hemorrhage, symptomatic ischemic brain edema and early edema, effacement and/or midline shift.

Using the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III trial data, we explored the relationship between computed tomography angiogram (CTA) collateral status and CT perfusion (CTP) parameters. METHODS Baseline CTA collaterals were trichotomized as good, intermediate, and poor, and CTP studies were analyzed to quantify ischemic core, tissue at risk, and mismatch ratios. Kruskal-Wallis and Spearman tests were used to measure the strength of association and correlation between CTA collaterals and CTP parameters. RESULTS A total of 95 patients had diagnostic CTP studies in the IMS III trial. Of these, 53 patients had M1/M2 middle cerebral artery±intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion, where baseline CTA collateral grading was performed. CTA collaterals were associated with smaller CTP measured ischemic core volume (P=0.0078) and higher mismatch (P=0.0004). There was moderate negative correlation between collaterals and core (rs=-0.45; 95% confidence interval, -0.64 to -0.20) and moderate positive correlation between collaterals and mismatch (rs=0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.71). CONCLUSION Better collaterals were associated with smaller ischemic core and higher mismatch in the IMS III trial. Collateral assessment and perfusion imaging identify the same biological construct about ischemic tissue sustenance.","Vagal, Achala; Menon, Bijoy K; Foster, Lydia D; Livorine, Anthony; Yeatts, Sharon D; Qazi, Emmad; d'Esterre, Chris; Shi, Junzi; Demchuk, Andrew M; Hill, Michael D; Liebeskind, David S; Tomsick, Thomas; Goyal, Mayank",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26658448/,290

Unfortunately, most EEG electrodes and systems are not designed to accommodate coarse and curly hair common in individuals of African descent. In neuroscience studies, this can lead to poor quality data that might be discarded in scientific studies after recording from a broader population set. In clinical diagnoses, it may lead to an uncomfortable and/or emotionally taxing experience, and, in the worst cases, misdiagnosis. Our prior work demonstrated that braiding hair in cornrows to expose the scalp at target locations leads to reduced electrode-skin impedance for existing electrodes. In this work, we design and implement novel electrodes that harness braided hair, and demonstrate that, across time, our electrodes, in conjunction with braiding, lower the impedance further, attaining 10x lower impedance than existing systems.","Etienne, Arnelle; Laroia, Tarana; Weigle, Harper; Afelin, Amber; Kelly, Shawn K; Krishnan, Ashwati; Grover, Pulkit",Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society.

97074,SECAL en modo pandemia/SECAL in pandemic mode.,2020-08-26,"BACKGROUND Endometriosis is a common condition which causes pain and reduced fertility. Treatment can be difficult, especially for severe disease, and an accurate preoperative assessment would greatly help in the managment of these patients. The objective of this study is to assess the accuracy of pre-operative transvaginal ultrasound scanning (TVS) in identifying the specific features of pelvic endometriosis and pelvic adhesions in comparison with laparoscopy. METHODS Consecutive women with clinically suspected or proven pelvic endometriosis, who were booked for laparoscopy, were invited to join the study. They all underwent a systematic transvaginal ultrasound examination in order to identify discrete endometriotic lesions and pelvic adhesions. The accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis was determined by comparing pre-operative ultrasound to laparoscopy findings. RESULTS 198 women who underwent preoperative TVS and laparoscopy were included in the final analysis. At laparoscopy 126/198 (63.6%) women had evidence of pelvic endometriosis. 28/126 (22.8%) of them had endometriosis in a single location whilst the remaining 98/126 (77.2%) had endometriosis in two or more locations. Positive likelihood ratios (LR+) for the ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian endometriomas, moderate or severe ovarian adhesions, pouch of Douglas adhesions, and bladder deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), recto-sigmoid colon DIE, rectovaginal DIE, uterovesical fold DIE and uterosacral ligament DIE were >10, whilst for pelvic side wall DIE and any ovarian adhesions the + LH was 8.421 and 9.81 respectively.The negative likelihood ratio (LR-) was: <0.1 for bladder DIE; 0.1-0.2 for ovarian endometriomas, moderate or severe ovarian adhesions, and pouch of Douglas adhesions; 0.5-1 for rectovaginal, uterovesical fold, pelvic side wall and uterosacral ligament DIE. The accuracy of TVS for the diagnosis of both total number of endometriotic lesions and DIE lesions significantly improved with increasing total number of lesions. CONCLUSIONS Our study has shown that the TVS diagnosis of endometriotic lesion is very specific and false positive results are rare. Negative findings are less reliable and women with significant symptoms may still benefit from further investigation even if TVS findings are normal. The accuracy of ultrasound diagnosis is significantly affected by the location and number of endometriotic lesions.","Holland, Tom K; Cutner, Alfred; Saridogan, Ertan; Mavrelos, Dimitrios; Pateman, Kate; Jurkovic, Davor",BMC women's health,https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6874-13-43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24165087/,290
97179,Neonatal sepsis is mediated by maternal fever in labour epidural analgesia.,2014,"Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1/2 (MST1/2) plays an important role in cell growth and apoptosis and functions as a tumor suppressor. Previously, we showed that MST2 overexpression activates Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells in the absence of a ligand. Here, we examined the role of MST2 in the growth of ER-positive MCF-7 cells. Cell cycle, apoptosis, and mammosphere formation assay method were implemented to detect the biological effects of MST2 ablation on the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro. The effect of MST2-siRNA on MCF-7 cells tumor growth in vivo was studied in tumor-bearing mouse model. Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis was used to determine the effect of MST2 on overall survival in breast cancer patients. MST2 overexpression increased cell viability marginally. The ablation of MST2 using siRNA dramatically suppressed the viability of the MCF-7 cells, but not ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, MST2 knockdown increased caspase-dependent apoptosis and led to decreased mammosphere formation. Treatment of MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice with MST2 siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth. The tumor weight was reduced further when tamoxifen was added. Patients with ER-positive breast cancer with low MST2 expression had better overall survival than did those with high MST2 expression in Kaplan-Meier survival analyses using public datasets. Our results provide new insight into the role of MST2, a key component of the Hippo signaling pathway, in mediating breast cancer progression.","Park, Joonwoo; Kim, Ga Hee; Lee, Jeonggeun; Phuong, Bui Thi Chau; Kong, Byounguk; Won, Ji Eun; Won, Gun Woo; Lee, Yong Hee; Han, Hee Dong; Lee, YoungJoo",Toxicology and applied pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2020.115257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007383/,290

98599,Building peace amid the storm.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). METHOD Patients' inclusion criteria were uncomplicated gallstones, BMI ≤30, ASA score ≤2, and no past surgery in the upper abdomen. Five surgeons performed only SILC and seven only CLC. Data analyzed included operative time, morbidity, quality of life (QOL), cosmetic result, and global patient satisfaction. The last three parameters were evaluated 3 months after surgery. QOL was assessed with the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire. Cosmetic result and patient satisfaction were rated using a 5-grade Likert scale. RESULTS This study included 104 patients operated on between April and June 2010. A SILC was performed in 35 patients and a CLC in 69. The preoperative characteristics of the two groups were similar. Median operative time for SILC was higher than that for CLC: 55 versus 40 min (p < 0.001). Postoperative complications (0 vs. 2) and postoperative GIQLI scores (123 ± 13 vs. 121 ± 18) were not significantly different between groups. Cosmetic result and patient satisfaction were better for SILC than for CLC. The percentages of results rated as excellent were 68 versus 37 % (p < 0.006) and 80 versus 57 % (p < 0.039), respectively. For the whole group, multivariate statistical analysis revealed that postoperative GIQLI score and cosmetic result were independent predictive factors of patient satisfaction. The percentages of satisfaction rated as excellent were greater in patients who had a postoperative GIQLI score ≥130 (92 vs. 49 %, odds ratio [OR] = 4, p < 0.001) and in patients who had an excellent cosmetic result (82 vs. 47 %, OR = 7, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Compared to CLC, SILC is associated with a longer operative time, an equivalent morbidity and QOL, and a better cosmetic result. The improved aesthetic result also leads to a better global patient satisfaction.","Hauters, Philippe; Auvray, Sylvain; Cardin, Jean Luc; Papillon, Marc; Delaby, Jean; Dabrowski, André; Framery, Dominique; Valverde, Alain; Rubay, Raphaël; Siriser, Frank; Malvaux, Philippe; Landenne, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2657-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23224032/,290

METHODS Data were obtained from the medical records (2016-2018) of cats that had an ultrasonographic honeycomb appearance of the spleen, a splenic cytological diagnosis and a complete blood count. RESULTS Twenty-five cats were included. Prevalence of the honeycomb pattern was 6.8%. None of the spleen was considered normal on cytology and four types of lesions were found: lymphoid hyperplasia (64%), neoplasia (16%), extramedullary haematopoiesis (12%) and splenitis (8%). A honeycomb pattern was successfully identified with a linear high-frequency probe in all cats, but only in 36% of cases with the micro-convex probe. Follow-up information was available for four cats, in which the honeycomb appearance persisted up to 105 days after the first examination; there was persistence of the honeycomb pattern in all cases. Cats with a splenic cytological diagnosis of extramedullary haematopoiesis had the lowest haemoglobin plasma concentration ( P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Honeycomb appearance of the spleen is uncommon in cats and, in our study, was systematically associated with cytological alterations; most of the time it was benign (84%). The use of a high-frequency linear probe improves its detection rate. No epidemiological, ultrasonographic or clinical criteria allow differentiation between the different types of infiltration and fine-needle aspiration is therefore recommended.","Harel, Mathieu; Touzet, Chloe; Barthélemy, Anthony; Ségard-Weisse, Emilie M",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x19837336; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30896332/,290

Activated protein C resistance (44%) was the most common inherited thrombophilia. Twenty-one (66%) patients were anemic with a mean (±SD) hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL (±2.3). Regression analysis showed a positive association of anemia with multiple sinus involvement (P-value 0.009) but not with duration of symptoms (P-value 0.344), hospital stay (P-value 0.466), age (P-value 0.863) or gender (P-value 0.542) of the patients. SARS-COV2 was negative in patients during 2020. Adolescents were primarily affected by sinus thrombosis and infections was the predominant risk factor for all age groups, with a low all-cause mortality. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis and intervention.","Moiz, Bushra; Ukrani, Ronika Devi; Arif, Aiman; Akbar, Inaara; Sadiq, Muhammed Wahhaab; Altaf, Sadaf",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,https://doi.org/10.1177/10760296211022847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137283/,290

Age-related mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs) detected from genotyping of blood-derived DNA, are structural somatic variants indicative of clonal hematopoiesis, and are associated with aberrant leukocyte cell counts, hematological malignancy, and mortality. Here, we show that mCAs predispose to diverse types of infections. We analyzed mCAs from 768,762 individuals without hematological cancer at the time of DNA acquisition across five biobanks. Expanded autosomal mCAs were associated with diverse incident infections (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.15-1.36; P = 1.8 × 10-7), including sepsis (HR 2.68; 95% CI = 2.25-3.19; P = 3.1 × 10-28), pneumonia (HR 1.76; 95% CI = 1.53-2.03; P = 2.3 × 10-15), digestive system infections (HR 1.51; 95% CI = 1.32-1.73; P = 2.2 × 10-9) and genitourinary infections (HR 1.25; 95% CI = 1.11-1.41; P = 3.7 × 10-4). A genome-wide association study of expanded mCAs identified 63 loci, which were enriched at transcriptional regulatory sites for immune cells. These results suggest that mCAs are a marker of impaired immunity and confer increased predisposition to infections.","Zekavat, Seyedeh M; Lin, Shu-Hong; Bick, Alexander G; Liu, Aoxing; Paruchuri, Kaavya; Wang, Chen; Uddin, Md Mesbah; Ye, Yixuan; Yu, Zhaolong; Liu, Xiaoxi; Kamatani, Yoichiro; Bhattacharya, Romit; Pirruccello, James P; Pampana, Akhil; Loh, Po-Ru; Kohli, Puja; McCarroll, Steven A; Kiryluk, Krzysztof; Neale, Benjamin; Ionita-Laza, Iuliana; Engels, Eric A; Brown, Derek W; Smoller, Jordan W; Green, Robert; Karlson, Elizabeth W; Lebo, Matthew; Ellinor, Patrick T; Weiss, Scott T; Daly, Mark J; Terao, Chikashi; Zhao, Hongyu; Ebert, Benjamin L; Reilly, Muredach P; Ganna, Andrea; Machiela, Mitchell J; Genovese, Giulio; Natarajan, Pradeep",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01371-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34099924/,290

Therefore, in addition to the vaccine, the use of supplements to support the immune system may also be important. The main purpose of this study is to indicate the possible effect of low serum vitamin D (25(OH)D<20 ng/mL or 50nmol/L) on the Covid-19 infection and outcomes. Methods To accomplish our objectives, we searched on Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases without any language restrictions for articles between 01.01.2020 and 15.12.2020. We performed three meta-analyses to combine the OR values by paying attention to laboratory measurement units for vitamin D and the measured serum 25(OH)D level. Results 23 eligible studies involving the relationship between vitamin D and Covid-19 infection/outcomes were identified (n=206861). We applied three meta-analyses called D-CIMA, D-CSMA and D-CMMA for Covid-19 infection, severity, and mortality, respectively. According to obtained result from D-CIMA, one which has low serum vitamin D are 1.64 times (95%CI=[1.32-2.04],p<0.001) more likely to get Covid-19 infection. In D-CSMA, we found that people with the serum 25(OH)D level below 20ng/mL or 50nmol/L have 2.58 times (95%CI=[1.28-5.19],p=0.008) more likely to risk having severe Covid-19. We obtained from D-CMMA that low vitamin D level has no effect on Covid-19 mortality (OR=2.42 95%CI=[0.73-8.04],p=0.148). Conclusion Vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of Covid-19 infection and the potential for the severity of the disease. Therefore, vitamin D supplements should be added to prevention and treatment protocols for Covid-19 disease.","Kaya, Mehmet Onur; Pamukçu, Esra; Yakar, Burkay",Epidemiology and health,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2021074; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34607398/,290

99904,Letter from our virtually neurological world.,2020-10-08,"BACKGROUND Obesity is a global epidemic, and several surgical programs have been created to combat this public health issue. Although demand for bariatric surgery has grown, so too has the attrition rate. In this study we identify patient characteristics and operational interventions that have contributed to high attrition in a multistage, multidisciplinary bariatric surgery program. STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study was conducted of 1,682 patients referred for bariatric surgery at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada, from June 2008 to July 2011. Demographic information, presurgical assessment dates, and records describing operational changes were collected. Several penalized likelihood and mixed effects multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine whether patient characteristics, operational changes, and previous experience affected program completion and intermediate transitions between assessments. RESULTS Although the majority of attrition appears to be the result of patient self-removal, males (odds ratio [OR] 0.511, 95% CI 0.392 to 0.663, p < 0.001), and individuals with active substance use (OR 0.223, 95% CI 0.096 to 0.471, p < 0.001) were less likely to undergo surgery. Operational practices had a detrimental effect on program completion (OR 0.590, 95% CI 0.456 to 0.762, p < 0.001). Conversely, patients with a BMI > 40 kg/m(2) (OR 1.756, 95% CI 1.233 to 2.515, p = 0.002) and those who lived within 25 to 300 km of the center (OR > 1.633, p < 0.001) were more likely to undergo surgery. CONCLUSIONS Certain subgroups in the referral population were found to be at a higher risk of noncompletion. Specialized care pathways must be implemented to address this issue. Furthermore, careful consideration must be given to operational decisions because they may negatively affect access to care, as we have shown.","Diamant, Adam; Milner, Joseph; Cleghorn, Michelle; Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Okrainec, Allan; Jackson, Timothy D; Quereshy, Fayez A",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.08.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25256371/,290

COVID-19 was detected in Brazil for the time in the 9th epidemiological week of 2020, and the test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus was included in the surveillance protocol starting in the 12th epidemiological week. This study's objective was to investigate the pattern of hospitalizations for SARI in Brazil since the entry of SARS-CoV-2, comparing the temporal and age profiles and laboratory results to the years 2010 through 2019. In 2020, hospitalizations for SARI, compiled from the date of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 up to the 12th week, exceeded the numbers observed during the same period in each of the previous 10 years. The age bracket over 60 years was the most heavily affected, at higher than historical levels. There was a considerable increase in negative laboratory tests, suggesting circulation of a different virus from those already present in the panel. We concluded that the increase in hospitalizations for SARI, the lack of specific information on the etiological agent, and the predominance of cases among the elderly during the same period in which there was an increase in the number of new cases of COVID-19 are all consistent with the hypothesis that severe cases of COVID-19 are already being detected by SARI surveillance, placing an overload on the health system. The inclusion of testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the SARI surveillance protocol and the test's effective nationwide deployment are extremely important for monitoring the evolution of severe COVID-19 cases in Brazil.","Bastos, Leonardo Soares; Niquini, Roberta Pereira; Lana, Raquel Martins; Villela, Daniel A M; Cruz, Oswaldo G; Coelho, Flávio C; Codeço, Claudia T; Gomes, Marcelo F C",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00070120; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32321075/,290

DESIGN Prospective cohort study. SETTING Two perinatal centres in Melbourne, Australia. PATIENTS At-risk infants born at ≥35+0 weeks gestation with a paediatric doctor in attendance who were initially vigorous and received DCC for >60 s. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Delivery room respiratory support defined as facemask positive pressure ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure and/or supplemental oxygen within 10 min of birth. RESULTS Two hundred and ninety-eight infants born at a median (IQR) gestational age of 39+3 (38+2-40+2) weeks were included. Cord clamping occurred at a median (IQR) of 128 (123-145) s. Forty-four (15%) infants received respiratory support at a median of 214 (IQR 156-326) s after birth. Neonatal unit admission for respiratory distress occurred in 32% of infants receiving delivery room respiratory support vs 1% of infants who did not receive delivery room respiratory support (p<0.001). Risk factors independently associated with delivery room respiratory support were average heart rate (HR) at 90-120 s after birth (determined using three-lead ECG), mode of birth and time to establish regular cries. Decision tree analysis identified that infants at highest risk had an average HR of <165 beats per minute at 90-120 s after birth following caesarean section (risk of 39%). Infants with an average HR of ≥165 beats per minute at 90-120 s after birth were at low risk (5%). CONCLUSIONS We present a clinical decision pathway for at-risk infants who may benefit from close observation following DCC. Our findings provide a novel perspective of HR beyond the traditional threshold of 100 beats per minute.","Badurdeen, Shiraz; Santomartino, Georgia A; Thio, Marta; Heng, Alissa; Woodward, Anthony; Polglase, Graeme R; Hooper, Stuart B; Blank, Douglas A; Davis, Peter G",Archives of disease in childhood.

Objective: To document the process of transition from in-person to virtual care. Design: The charts of 1744 consecutive patients in our SCC located in the United States were retrospectively reviewed during the four weeks before transition (February 14-March 12), four weeks after transition (March 20-April 16), and transition week (March 13-March 19). Patient demographics, vital aspects of a supportive care visit such as assessments (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-Financial and Spiritual [ESAS-FS], Cut-down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener Screen-Adapted to Include Drugs [CAGE-AID], and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale [MDAS]), interdisciplinary team involvement, and visit type were recorded. Results: In total 763 patients were seen before transition, 168 during the transition week, and 813 after transitioning to virtual care. Patient characteristics, ESAS-FS, CAGE-AID, and nurse assessment did not significantly differ among the three groups. The after-transition group had a small reduction in counseling intervention compared with before (20.2% vs. 26.2%; p = 0.0068). MDAS completion was higher after transition (99.6% vs. 98%; p = 0.007).

To date, the standard operation with the circular stapler (CS) used the 25 mm with a staple height of 4.8 mm. We present herein our experience with the 3.5-mm staple height. METHODS A total of 1,074 morbidly obese patients who underwent fully stapled laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass over a period of 18 months were included in the study. Mean body mass index was 41.9 (range 28.6-70.7). Mean age was 40.9 years (range 15-74 years). Mean operating time was 73 min (range 43-210 min) and the mean length of stay was 4.2 days (range 1-25 days). The 30-day complication rate associated with GJA was prospectively analyzed. RESULTS Twenty patients (1.86%) developed postoperative bleeding. Four developed GJA bleeding (0.37%). One leak was recorded from the vertical staple line of the gastric pouch, but no leaks from the GJA were seen. Conversion to open approach was required in two patients (0.18%). Reoperation and readmission rates were 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Perioperative complications were observed in 34 patients (3.1%). One case of clinical GJA stenosis was detected in a mean follow-up of 10.5 months (range 5-20 months). There was no mortality in our series. CONCLUSION Compared to our previous experience with 4.8 mm CS, creating the GJA using a smaller staple height significantly reduced the bleeding rate and seems to be a safe technique that potentially reduces other complications related to the GJA as reported in the literature.","Sakran, Nasser; Assalia, Ahmad; Sternberg, Ahud; Kluger, Yoram; Troitsa, Anton; Brauner, Eran; Van Cauwenberge, Sebastiaan; De Visschere, Marieke; Dillemans, Bruno",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-010-0308-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21082289/,290

METHODS A dual-species film, Enterococcus faecalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis, was cultivated on root canal dentin for 7 days. The canal wall was irrigated with 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite (n = 8 each), with a control group (n = 2) irrigated with sterile saline. The roots were then split horizontally at 5-, 7-, and 9-mm levels from root apex and examined under confocal laser scanning microscope and then scanning electron microscope. The proportions of viable cells situated on different depths into root canal dentin were compared at a significance level of P = .05. RESULTS Both concentrations of sodium hypochlorite significantly reduced the amount of live bacteria in the most superficial layer (first 0.1 mm) of root canal dentin, compared with the control; however, the difference was not significant between the 2 concentrations. For the next 2 layers (0.1-0.3 mm into dentinal tubules), irrigation with 3% hypochlorite resulted in significantly lower amounts of viable bacteria than 0.5% hypochlorite or saline. No significant difference between 0.5% or 3% sodium hypochlorite and the positive control was observed in deeper (>0.3 mm) regions into the root canal wall. CONCLUSIONS Increasing the concentration of sodium hypochlorite improves the penetration depth of its antibacterial action into dentinal tubules, but that seemed unable to completely eradicate bacteria residing there. Total elimination of bacteria from dentinal tubules cannot be achieved by irrigation with sodium hypochlorite alone.","Wong, Debbie T S; Cheung, Gary S P",Journal of endodontics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joen.2013.09.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24862710/,290

Although prenatal complete tracheal occlusion (cTO) causes hypoplastic CDH lungs to enlarge, improved lung function has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, cTO interferes with the dynamic pressure change and fluid flow associated with fetal breathing. PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to assess a novel dynamic tracheal occlusion (dTO) device that preserves pressure changes and fluid flow. METHODS In this pilot study, CDH was created in fetal lambs at 65 days of gestational age (GA). At 110 days GA, a cTO device (n = 3) or a dTO device (n = 4) was placed in the fetal trachea. At 135 days GA, lambs were delivered and resuscitated. Unoperated lamb co-twins (n = 5), sham thoracotomy lambs (n = 2), and untreated CDH lambs (n = 3) served as controls. RESULTS Tracheal opening pressure, lung volume, lung fluid total protein, and phospholipid were significantly higher in the cTO group than in the dTO and unoperated control groups.

CONCLUSION Preliminary results suggest that in the fetal lamb CDH model, dTO restores normal lung morphometrics and function, whereas cTO leads to enlarged but less functional lungs.","Jelin, Eric B; Etemadi, Mozziyar; Encinas, Jose; Schecter, Samuel C; Chapin, Cheryl; Wu, Jianfeng; Guevara-Gallardo, Salvador; Nijagal, Amar; Gonzales, Kelly D; Ferrier, William T; Roy, Shuvo; Miniati, Doug",Journal of pediatric surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2011.03.049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21683214/,290
103599,Promoting diagnostics as a global good.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Smoking increases the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia, yet it is unknown if smoking cessation changes this risk. We sought to determine if smoking cessation and the duration of abstinence from tobacco reduce the risk of pneumonia hospitalization. METHODS We performed secondary analysis of data collected from male United States Veterans participating in a randomized trial. We used Cox proportional-hazard models to estimate risk of hospitalization for pneumonia within one year of enrollment. We adjusted for confounders, including: demographics, comorbidity, alcohol use, prior pneumonia, inhaled corticosteroid use, and intensity of tobacco exposure. Among a restricted cohort excluding never smokers, we assessed for effect modification by a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RESULTS Of the 25,235 participants, we identified 6720 current, 13,625 former, and 4890 never smokers. Compared to current smokers, never smokers had a decreased (adjusted HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.31-0.74), while former smokers had no difference in (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.63-1.09) risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. Among participants without COPD, former smokers had a lower risk of hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45-0.95). However, this lower risk was isolated to those who quit tobacco more than 10 years previously (adjusted HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93). Among those with COPD, there was no difference in risk with smoking cessation or duration of remaining tobacco-free. CONCLUSIONS Tobacco cessation is likely important in reducing hospital admissions for pneumonia, but its benefit depends on duration of smoking cessation and is likely attenuated in the presence of COPD.","Cecere, Laura M; Williams, Emily C; Sun, Haili; Bryson, Chris L; Clark, Brendan J; Bradley, Katharine A; Au, David H",Respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2012.03.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22541719/,290
103940,Fluctuations of extracellular glucose and lactate in the mouse primary visual cortex during visual stimulation.,2018,"BACKGROUND Parastomal hernia is a frequent complication of intestinal stomata. Mesh repair gives the best results, with the mesh inserted via laparotomy or laparoscopically. It was the aim of this retrospective multicenter study to determine the early and late results of the laparoscopically performed, modified Sugarbaker technique with ePTFE mesh. METHODS From 2005 to 2010, a total of 61 consecutive patients (mean age = 61 years), with a symptomatic parastomal hernia, underwent laparoscopic repair using the modified Sugarbaker technique with ePTFE mesh. Fifty-five patients had a colostomy, 4 patients an ileostomy, and 2 a urostomy according to Bricker. The records of the patients were reviewed with respect to patient characteristics, postoperative morbidity, and mortality. All patients underwent physical examination after a follow-up of at least 1 year to detect a recurrent hernia. Morbidity rate was 19 % and included wound infection (n = 1), ileus (n = 2), trocar site bleeding (n = 2), reintervention (n = 2), and pneumonia (n = 1). One patient died in the postoperative period due to metastasis of lung carcinoma that caused bowel obstruction. Concomitant incisional hernias were detected in 25 of 61 patients (41 %) and could be repaired at the same time in all cases. A recurrent hernia was found in three patients at physical examination, and in one patient an asymptomatic recurrence was found on a CT scan. The overall recurrence rate was 6.6 % after a mean follow-up of 26 months. CONCLUSION The laparoscopic Sugarbaker technique is a safe procedure for repairing parastomal hernias. In our study, the overall morbidity was 19 % and the recurrence rate was 6.6 % after a mean follow-up of 26 months. Moreover, the laparoscopic approach revealed concomitant hernias in 41 % of the patients, which could be repaired successfully at the same time.","Hansson, B M E; Morales-Conde, S; Mussack, T; Valdes, J; Muysoms, F E; Bleichrodt, R P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2464-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23052490/,290

Despite the scale of this threat, there are inherent limitations in preventing and controlling EIDs, including the scope of current disease surveillance efforts. All of this leads to the following questions in the context of Mexico's recent swine flu experience: What were the cultural, political, and economic challenges to Influenza A/H1N1 virus response in Mexico? By way of comparison, what can we learn from the U.S. experience in 1976 with A/New Jersey/76 (Hsw1N1), later referred to as H1N1? This article explores the comparative political economy of Mexico's handling of influenza virus A/H1N1 outbreak in 2009. Research provides notable observations-based on the strengths and weaknesses of each country's response--that can be used as a starting point of discussion for the design of effective EIDs surveillance programs in developing and middle-income countries. In the U.S., the speed and efficiency of the 1976 U.S. mobilization against H1N1 was laudable. Although the U.S. response to the outbreak is seldom praised, the unity of the scientific and political communities demonstrated the national ability to respond to the situation. Mexico's strongest characteristics were its transparency, as well as the cooperation the country exhibited with other nations, particularly the U.S. and Canada. While Mexico showed savvy in its effective management of public and media relations, as the article details, political, economic, and cultural problems persisted.","Ear, Sophal",Politics and the life sciences : the journal of the Association for Politics and the Life Sciences,https://doi.org/10.2990/31_1-2_52; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23379315/,290

The regulatory mechanism of YAP in Hippo-low contexts is poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference screen to identify genes whose loss of function in a Hippo-null background affects YAP activity. We discovered that the coatomer protein complex I (COPI) is required for YAP nuclear enrichment and that COPI dependency of YAP confers an intrinsic vulnerability to COPI disruption in YAP-driven cancer cells. We identified MAP2K3 as a YAP regulator involved in inhibitory YAP phosphorylation induced by COPI subunit depletion. The endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway activated by COPI malfunction appears to connect COPI and MAP2K3. In addition, we provide evidence that YAP inhibition by COPI disruption may contribute to transcriptional up-regulation of PTGS2 and proinflammatory cytokines. Our study offers a resource for investigating Hippo-independent YAP regulation as a therapeutic target for cancers and suggests a link between YAP and COPI-associated inflammatory diseases.","Kim, Yong Joon; Jung, Eunji; Shin, Eunbie; Hong, Sin-Hyoung; Jeong, Hui Su; Hur, Gayeong; Jeong, Hye Yun; Lee, Seung-Hyo; Lee, Ji Eun; Kim, Gun-Hwa; Kim, Joon",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1915387117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747557/,290

METHODS We present two cases of patients who underwent rebubbling of a partially detached DMEK grafts at the slit lamp following DMEK surgery without peripheral iridotomy. The rebubbling was performed with a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1ml syringe and the patients seated at the slit lamp. Air was injected into the anterior chamber until a 50% air fill was achieved. The patients were instructed to lie supine for 30 min in clinic and the remainder of the day at home. RESULTS We performed two rebubbling procedures at the slit lamp using the standard needle and syringe. Both cases achieved 50% air fills without any complications. At 3 days post-procedure the air bubble had resolved and the graft appeared attached centrally and at day 14 post-procedure the two patients had a clear and attached corneal graft with corrected visual acuity of 6/7.5 and 6/9, respectively. CONCLUSION Rebubbling of detached DMEK grafts at the slit lamp with 50% air fill in the anterior chamber is a relatively simple and effective procedure. This provides an alternative approach for managing the complication of partially detached DMEK grafts in the era of COVID-19 with limited operating theatre access and avoids the risk of complications such as pupillary block in 'PI-less' DMEK.","Franka, Mustafa; Mistry, Meera; Moustafa, Mohanad; Erikitola, Ore-Oluwa; Lyall, Douglas",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120972017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213181/,290

BACKGROUND Hypertension is the leading cause of morbidity, the identified cause of heart failure in 45% of patients and is associated with more than 70% of cardiovascular disease-related hospital admissions in Haiti. DESIGN An integrative review of the literature. METHODS Searching four databases from 2007 to 2018, Whittemore and Knafl's method was used to review the literature. Three nurse researchers independently reviewed and appraised each publication applying the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Appraisal tool. RESULTS Eight publications were identified and appraised for level and quality of evidence. The synthesis of the literature yielded common themes of (i) high prevalence of hypertension among adults living in rural areas, (ii) public health challenges, (iii) lack of knowledge and awareness of hypertension and (iv) barriers to effective treatment. CONCLUSION Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease in Haiti that is understudied and warrants attention. To better serve this vulnerable population, culturally tailored prevention strategies and disease management programmes are recommended. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE There is a lack of quality evidence to guide nurses in the management of hypertension for this vulnerable population.

105539,[Deescalation and glucocorticoid-free treatment in SLE].,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND Ureteral injury is the most common urological complication of pelvic surgery, with a reported incidence during colon resection of 0.3-1.5%. Ureteral stenting is commonly performed preoperatively to prevent ureteral injury. Because tactile sensation is not reliable during laparoscopic surgery, the effect of the ureteral stent is considered limited. Recently, fluorescence imaging has been used in laparoscopic surgery. The Near-Infrared Ray Catheter (NIRC™) fluorescent ureteral catheter (NIRFUC) is a new catheter with built-in NIR fluorescent resin. This pilot study was performed to evaluate the utility of fluorescence ureteral navigation using the NIRFUC during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. METHODS We evaluated the intraoperative utility of the NIRFUC and the short-term outcomes in 20 patients treated with colorectal surgery at Kawaguchi Municipal Medical Center between February and July 2020. In all, 18 patients with malignant tumors and 2 patients with benign disease, i.e., a sigmoid colovesical fistula, were included. Ten patients developed preoperative intestinal obstruction. One patient experienced preoperative perforation. Nine patients developed preoperative peritumoral abscesses. Laparoscopic surgery was performed with the VISERA ELITE2 system. RESULTS In all cases, the ureters were very clearly identified as fluorescent without the need for dissection. In all cases, only a moment was required to identify the ureter by fluorescence observation. In all cases, R0 resection was performed. The mean surgical duration was 334 min (161-1014), the mean blood loss was 10 ml (1-500), and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 11 days (8-47). There were no cases of ureteral injury. CONCLUSION The NIRFUC was very clearly identified as fluorescent in a moment during surgery without dissection around the ureter. Fluorescence ureteral navigation using the NIRFUC may make colorectal surgery easier and facilitate completion of complex minimally invasive surgery, especially during surgery in patients with invasion of the surrounding tissue or a history of pelvic surgery or radiation.","Ryu, Shunjin; Okamoto, Atsuko; Nakashima, Keigo; Hara, Keigo; Ishida, Kota; Ito, Ryusuke; Nakabayashi, Yukio",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-021-08538-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33978850/,290

Materials and Methods Synchrotron radiation Xray microcomputed tomography (SRμCT) and microhardness testing were carried out on 8 and 20 tooth samples, respectively. Enamel mineral density was derived from SRμCT technique using ImageJ software. Microhardness samples were subjected to Vickers indentations followed by calculation of microhardness and percentage mineral volume values using respective mathematical measures. Data were analyzed using paired t-test at a significance level of 5%. Qualitative analysis of the enamel microstructure was done with two-dimensional projection images and scanned electron micrographs using μCT and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Results Vickers microhardness and SRμCT techniques showed a decrease in microhardness and an increase in mineral density, respectively, in postirradiated samples. These changes were related to mineral density variation and alteration of hydroxyapatite crystal lattice in enamel surface. Enamel microstructure showed key features such as microporosities and loss of smooth homogeneous surface. These indicate tribological loss and delamination of enamel which might lead to radiation caries. Conclusions Tooth surface loss might be a major contributing factor for radiation caries in head-and-neck cancer patients prescribed to radiotherapy. Such direct effects of radiotherapy cause enamel abrasion, delamination, and damage to the dentinoenamel junction. Suitable measures should, therefore, be worked out to protect nontarget oral tissues such as teeth while delivering effective dosages to target regions.","Kudkuli, Jagadish; Agrawal, Ashish; Gurjar, Om Prakash; Sharma, Sunil Dutt; Rekha, P D; Manzoor, Muhammed A P; Singh, Balwant; Rao, B S; Abdulla, Riaz",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4103/jcrt.jcrt_8_19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719276/,290

Recent studies demonstrated that AnxA2 also functions in immunity against infection, but the underlying mechanism remains largely elusive. Using a mouse infection model, we reveal a crucial role for AnxA2 in host defense against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as anxa2(-/-) mice manifested severe lung injury, systemic dissemination, and increased mortality compared with wild-type littermates. In addition, anxa2(-/-) mice exhibited elevated inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ), decreased bacterial clearance by macrophages, and increased superoxide release in the lung. We further identified an unexpected molecular interaction between AnxA2 and Fam13A, which activated Rho GTPase. P. aeruginosa infection induced autophagosome formation by inhibiting Akt1 and mTOR. Our results indicate that AnxA2 regulates autophagy, thereby contributing to host immunity against bacteria through the Akt1-mTOR-ULK1/2 signaling pathway.","Li, Rongpeng; Tan, Shirui; Yu, Min; Jundt, Michael C; Zhang, Shuang; Wu, Min",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1500967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371245/,290

The HH-GLI pathway has mostly been investigated in the context of canonical signal transduction and the inhibition of the membrane components of the pathway. In this work we investigated the role of downstream inhibitors GANT61 and lithium chloride (LiCl) on cell viability, wound closure, and colony forming ability of HNSCC cell lines. Five HNSCC cell lines were treated with HH-GLI pathway inhibitors affecting different levels of signal transduction. GANT61 and LiCl reduce the proliferation and colony formation capabilities of HNSCC cell lines, and LiCl has an additional effect on wound closure. The major effector of the HH-GLI signaling pathway in HNSCC is the GLI3 protein, which is expressed in its full-length form and is functionally regulated by GSK3β. LiCl treatment increases the inhibitory Ser9 phosphorylation of the GSK3β protein, leading to increased processing of GLI3 from full-length to repressor form, thus inhibiting HH-GLI pathway activity. Therefore, downstream inhibition of HH-GLI signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for HNSCC.","Zubčić, Vedran; Rinčić, Nikolina; Kurtović, Matea; Trnski, Diana; Musani, Vesna; Ozretić, Petar; Levanat, Sonja; Leović, Dinko; Sabol, Maja",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899202/,290

Safe and effective airway management strategies are therefore key to the practice of pediatric anesthesia. The goal of this review is to highlight recent publications (2019-2021) aimed to advance pediatric airway safety and to highlight a proposed simple, pediatric-specific, universal framework to guide clinical practice. RECENT FINDINGS Recent investigations demonstrate that infants with normal and difficult airways experience high incidences of multiple laryngoscopy attempts and resulting hypoxemia. Video laryngoscopy may improve tracheal intubation first attempt success rate in infants with normal airways. In infants with difficult airways, standard blade video laryngoscopy is associated with higher first attempt success rates over non-standard blade video laryngoscopy. Recent studies in children with Pierre Robin sequence and mucopolysaccharidoses help guide airway equipment and technique selection. Department airway leads and hospital difficult airway services are necessary to disseminate knowledge, lead quality improvement initiatives, and promote evidence-based practice guidelines. SUMMARY Pediatric airway management morbidity is a common problem in pediatric anesthesia. Improvements in individual practitioner preparation and management strategies as well as systems-based policies are required. A simple, pediatric-specific, universal airway management framework can be adopted for safe pediatric anesthesia practice.","Hsu, Grace; von Ungern-Sternberg, Britta S; Engelhardt, Thomas",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000993; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33935175/,290

The fundamental chemical and physical structure of SF allows its structure to be altered using various crosslinking strategies. The established crosslinking methods enable the formation of three-dimensional (3D) networks under physiological conditions. There are different chemical and physical crosslinking mechanisms available for the generation of SF hydrogels (SFHs). These methods, either chemical or physical, change the structure of SF and improve its mechanical stability, although each method has its advantages and disadvantages. While chemical crosslinking agents guarantee the mechanical strength of SFH through the generation of covalent bonds, they could cause some toxicity, and their usage is not compatible with a cell-friendly technology. On the other hand, physical crosslinking approaches have been implemented in the absence of chemical solvents by the induction of β-sheet conformation in the SF structure. Unfortunately, it is not easy to control the shape and properties of SFHs when using this method. The current review discusses the different crosslinking mechanisms of SFH in detail, in order to support the development of engineered SFHs for biomedical applications.","Farokhi, Maryam; Aleemardani, Mina; Solouk, Atefeh; Mirzadeh, Hamid; Teuschl, Andreas Herbert; Redl, Heinz",Biomedical materials,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-605x/abb615; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594992/,290

Gathered clinicopathological evidence in COVID-19 patients shows that alveoli injuries and interstitial changes are the major mechanisms of impaired O2/CO2 exchange. Few rehabilitation exercises concerning COVID-19 patients were reported. Here, we present a modified version of rehabilitation exercises based on the underlying mechanism of the disease to mild cases of COVID-19. These exercises aimed to improve the pulmonary function of patients and ease the expectoration process. Additionally, an essential branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named acupressure was integrated into the exercises to facilitate the recovery and maintenance of pulmonary function. METHODS From March 4, 2020 to May 5, 2020, a total of 60 COVID-19 patients who completed the full course of MRE were enrolled in this observational study. The diagnostic and classification criteria were based on the 7th edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We prospectively gathered patients' reported outcomes concerning respiration-related symptoms at four different time points, including: (I) at admission; (II) at the time of hospital discharge; (III) two weeks after discharge; (IV) four weeks after discharge. The reported respiratory symptoms included dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea. RESULTS In total, 60 confirmed mild COVID-19 cases were enrolled with a median age of 54 years old. The baseline prevalence for dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea were 41.7%, 43.3%, 35.0%, and 50.0%, respectively. The pronounced decline in symptom prevalence was recorded over time. Interestingly, four weeks after discharge, we noticed a lower remission rate in productive cough and difficulty in expectoration. CONCLUSIONS The modified rehabilitation exercises were retrieved from the Eight-Section Brocade, and are specifically designed for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients at home or health facilities. Based on current findings on pronouncedly improved remission rate in respiratory symptoms, we recommend the MRE as suitable rehabilitation exercise to smooth respiration and ease the expectoration process in mild COVID-19 cases.","Zha, Lulu; Xu, Xi; Wang, Dongya; Qiao, Guibin; Zhuang, Weitao; Huang, Shujie",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787373/,290

109153,War epidemiology: an urgent plea.,2015,"AIM Minimally invasive approaches for stoma closure offer considerable benefits for patients. Single port access via an end ileostomy site after stoma take-down in patients with prior total colectomy and a rectal stump remnant could allow restoration of ileorectal continuity by anastomosis but has not been detailed previously. METHODS After mobilisation of the end ileostomy, the anvil of a circular stapler is secured into the open end of the distal ileum and the intestine returned into the abdominal cavity. A single port access device (in this description, a 'surgical glove port') is placed then into the stoma site and full laparoscopy performed. Once the rectal stump is identified and prepared, an intracorporeal anastomosis can be constructed in a tension-free manner using a Knight-Griffin technique. Leak-testing can also be performed and the operation concluded with closure of the solitary incision. RESULTS In selected cases, adhesiolysis and anastomosis can be safely performed in toto. If the peritoneal environment is challenging, access can be escalated to multiport laparoscopy or even laparotomy. CONCLUSION Initiation of ileorectal anastomosis construction by single port laparoscopy at least allows peritoneal assessment but can provide for the operation's completion. This can confer maximum patient benefit for the most minimally invasive option.","Naqi, Syed Ali; Smyth, James; Mortensen, Neil; Hompes, Roel; Cahill, Ronan",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.12584; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24506165/,290
109246,The effect of humidified heated breathing circuit on core body temperature in perioperative hypothermia during thyroid surgery.,2017,"Despite its isolation and extreme climate, Antarctica is home to diverse fauna and associated microorganisms. It has been proposed that the most iconic Antarctic animal, the penguin, experiences low pathogen pressure, accounting for their disease susceptibility in foreign environments. There is, however, a limited understanding of virome diversity in Antarctic species, the extent of in situ virus evolution, or how it relates to that in other geographic regions. To assess whether penguins have limited microbial diversity we determined the RNA viromes of three species of penguins and their ticks sampled on the Antarctic peninsula. Using total RNA sequencing we identified 107 viral species, comprising likely penguin associated viruses (n = 13), penguin diet and microbiome associated viruses (n = 82), and tick viruses (n = 8), two of which may have the potential to infect penguins. Notably, the level of virome diversity revealed in penguins is comparable to that seen in Australian waterbirds, including many of the same viral families. These data run counter to the idea that penguins are subject to lower pathogen pressure. The repeated detection of specific viruses in Antarctic penguins also suggests that rather than being simply spill-over hosts, these animals may act as key virus reservoirs.","Wille, Michelle; Harvey, Erin; Shi, Mang; Gonzalez-Acuña, Daniel; Holmes, Edward C; Hurt, Aeron C",The ISME journal,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0643-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32286545/,290
109589,May Hope Bloom and Grow.,2021-05-01,"Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, swabs or other samples have increasingly been taken from the upper aero-digestive tract, since high viral loads exist here, especially in the early stages of the disease. As diagnostic options, swabs from the anterior nose, from the nasopharynx, from the oropharynx or the extraction of throat rinse water or saliva are possible. The laboratory methods available are antigen tests that can be read in a few minutes or more lengthy RT-PCR methods in a lab. Swabs are carried out by physicians, medical staff, laypeople and in the self-test, in each case according to prior instructions. Many of these factors therefore have an influence on the informative value and the sensitivity of the entire diagnostic process. The PCR laboratory method is more sensitive than the antigen method; the swabs from the nasopharynx are considered the most valid smear site; correct execution of a test can be achieved even with non-professional individuals with good instructions. Complications with such swabs are reported very rarely, given the assumed number of procedures performed. Short-term nosebleeds after traumatic smears can be assumed without publications about it being found. Broken parts of swabs had to be removed by an ENT doctor. There are only very few reports on injuries to the skullbase with CSF-leaks, including 2 times with anomalies such as meningoceles. The choice of a suitable diagnostic medium depends on many parameters such as availability, the timing of the result, a smear test by knowledgeable staff or a self-test, and a number of other practical considerations.","Deitmer, Thomas; Dietz, A; Chaberny, I F; Pietsch, C",Laryngo- rhino- otologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1498-3549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34010974/,290

METHODS Surface electromyography (sEMG) of masticatory muscles was made in 30 chronic TMD patients, diagnosed with disc displacement with reduction (DDR) and pain. Two 15-patient subgroups, with moderate (TMDmo) and severe (TMDse) signs and symptoms, were compared with a control group of 15 healthy subjects matched by age. The experimental tasks were: a 5s inter-arch maximum voluntary clench (MVC); right and left 15s unilateral gum chewing tests. Standardized sEMG indices characterizing masseter and temporalis muscles activity were calculated, and a comprehensive functional index (FI) was introduced to quantitatively summarize subjects' overall performance. Mastication was also clinically evaluated. RESULTS During MVC, TMDse patients had a significantly larger asymmetry of temporalis muscles contraction. Both TMD groups showed reduced coordination between masseter and temporalis muscles' maximal contraction, and their muscular activity distribution shifted significantly from masseter to temporalis muscles. During chewing, TMDse patients recruited the balancing side muscles proportionally more than controls, specifically the masseter muscle. When comparing right and left side chewing, the muscles' recruitment pattern resulted less symmetric in TMD patients, especially in TMDse. Overall, the functional index of both TMDmo and TMDse patients was significantly lower than that obtained by controls. CONCLUSIONS Chronic TMD patients, specifically those with severe symptomatology, showed a reorganized activity, mainly resulting in worse functional performances.","Mapelli, Andrea; Zanandréa Machado, Bárbara Cristina; Giglio, Lucia Dantas; Sforza, Chiarella; De Felício, Cláudia Maria",Archives of oral biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2016.08.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27597536/,290
109939,Meet the First Authors.,2020-09-11,"In the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, laboratory diagnosis plays a critical role by isolating and identifying poliovirus (PV) from the stool samples from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. In recent years, reestablishment of PV circulation in countries where PV was previously eliminated has occurred because of decreased herd immunity, possibly due to poor vaccination coverage. To monitor the vulnerability of countries to PV circulation, surveillance of neutralizing-antibody titers against PV in susceptible populations is essential in the end game of the polio eradication program. In this study, we have developed a PV neutralization test with type 1, 2, and 3 PV pseudoviruses to determine the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV in human serum samples. With this test, the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV could be determined within 2 days by automated interpretation of luciferase signals without using infectious PV strains. We validated the pseudovirus PV neutralization test with 131 human serum samples collected from a wide range of age groups (ages 1 to >60 years) by comparison with a conventional neutralization test. We found good correlation in the neutralizing-antibody titers determined by these tests. These results suggest that a pseudovirus PV neutralization test would serve as a safe and simple procedure for the measurement of the neutralizing-antibody titer against PV.","Arita, Minetaro; Iwai, Masae; Wakita, Takaji; Shimizu, Hiroyuki",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://doi.org/10.1128/cvi.05225-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880850/,290

METHODS One hundred and eighty-five patients (87 men, 98 women; mean age, 48.7 years), who underwent RT-PCR sampling and high-resolution CT examination in our hospital between March 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, and got a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 disease via initial or follow-up RT-PCR test, were included in the study. We comprehensively analyzed the most common and relatively rare CT imaging features (e.g., distribution pattern, density of the lesions, additional CT signs) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS Thirty-eight patients (20.6%) had no evidence of pneumonia on their initial high-resolution CT images. Among 147 patients (79.4%) who had parenchymal infiltration consistent with pneumonia, 10 (6.8%) had a negative baseline RT-PCR test, and positivity was detected as a result of repeated tests. Most of the patients had multifocal (89.1%) and bilateral (86.4%) lesions. The most common location, right lower lobe, was affected in 87.8% of the patients. Lesions were distributed predominantly at peripheral (87.1%) and posterior (46.3%) areas of lung parenchyma. Most of the patients had pure ground glass opacity (GGO) (82.3%) followed by GGO with consolidation (32.7%) and crazy paving pattern (21.8%). Pure consolidation, solid nodules, halo sign, reverse halo sign, vascular enlargement, subpleural line, air-bronchogram, and bronchiectasis were the other findings observed in at least 15% of the cases. Halo sign, acinar nodules, air-bubble sign, pleural thickening and effusion, mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were seen rarely (2%-12.9%). Pericardial effusion, pneumothorax, cavitation, and tree-in-bud pattern were not detected in our study group. CONCLUSION Multifocal and bilateral GGO infiltration predominantly distributed in peripheral, posterior, and lower lung areas was the most common infiltration pattern.","Çinkooğlu, Akın; Hepdurgun, Cenk; Bayraktaroğlu, Selen; Ceylan, Naim; Savaş, Recep",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.5152/dir.2020.20307; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32558645/,290

We performed a clinical review by searching Medline and EMBASE. These databases were searched for articles on ""clinical trials"" and ""randomised controlled trials"". The keywords selected were non-invasive ventilation pulmonary infections, influenza-A (H1N1), SARS and tuberculosis. These terms were cross-referenced with the following keywords: health care workers, airborne infections, complications, intensive care unit and pandemic. The members of the International NIV Network examined the major results regarding NIV applications and SARS, H1N1 and tuberculosis. Cross-referencing mechanical ventilation with SARS yielded 76 studies, of which 10 studies involved the use of NIV and five were ultimately selected for inclusion in this review. Cross-referencing with H1N1 yielded 275 studies, of which 27 involved NIV. Of these, 22 were selected for review. Cross-referencing with tuberculosis yielded 285 studies, of which 15 involved NIV and from these seven were selected. In total 34 studies were selected for this review. NIV, when applied early in selected patients with SARS, H1N1 and acute pulmonary tuberculosis infections, can reverse respiratory failure. There are only a few reports of infectious disease transmission among healthcare workers.","Esquinas, Antonio M; Egbert Pravinkumar, S; Scala, Raffaele; Gay, Peter; Soroksky, Arie; Girault, Christophe; Han, Fang; Hui, David S; Papadakos, Peter J; Ambrosino, Nicolino",European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,https://doi.org/10.1183/09059180.00009413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445941/,290

111564,Zoonoses: Preventing disease transmission from animals.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation is a leading preventable cause of recurrent stroke for which early detection and treatment are critical. However, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and likely to go undetected and untreated in the routine care of patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). METHODS We randomly assigned 572 patients 55 years of age or older, without known atrial fibrillation, who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA within the previous 6 months (cause undetermined after standard tests, including 24-hour electrocardiography [ECG]), to undergo additional noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring with either a 30-day event-triggered recorder (intervention group) or a conventional 24-hour monitor (control group). The primary outcome was newly detected atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer within 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included episodes of atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer and anticoagulation status at 90 days. RESULTS Atrial fibrillation lasting 30 seconds or longer was detected in 45 of 280 patients (16.1%) in the intervention group, as compared with 9 of 277 (3.2%) in the control group (absolute difference, 12.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0 to 17.6; P<0.001; number needed to screen, 8). Atrial fibrillation lasting 2.5 minutes or longer was present in 28 of 284 patients (9.9%) in the intervention group, as compared with 7 of 277 (2.5%) in the control group (absolute difference, 7.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 11.3; P<0.001). By 90 days, oral anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for more patients in the intervention group than in the control group (52 of 280 patients [18.6%] vs. 31 of 279 [11.1%]; absolute difference, 7.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.6 to 13.3; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with a recent cryptogenic stroke or TIA who were 55 years of age or older, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was common. Noninvasive ambulatory ECG monitoring for a target of 30 days significantly improved the detection of atrial fibrillation by a factor of more than five and nearly doubled the rate of anticoagulant treatment, as compared with the standard practice of short-duration ECG monitoring.

In reason of that, special attention was recently paid by the scientific community to the mathematical modeling of infection spreading by including in classical models the effects of the distribution of contacts between individuals. Among other approaches, the coupling of the classical SIR model with a statistical study of the distribution of social contacts among the population, led some of the present authors to build a Social SIR model, able to accurately follow the effect of the decrease in contacts resulting from the lockdown measures adopted in various European countries in the first phase of the epidemic. The Social SIR has been recently tested and improved through a fruitful collaboration with the Health Protection Agency (ATS) of the province of Pavia (Italy), that made it possible to have at disposal all the relevant data relative to the spreading of COVID-19 infection in the province (half a million of people), starting from February 2020. The statistical analysis of the data was relevant to fit at best the parameters of the mathematical model, and to make short-term predictions of the spreading evolution in order to optimize the response of the local health system.","Zanella, Mattia; Bardelli, Chiara; Azzi, Mara; Deandrea, Silvia; Perotti, Pietro; Silva, Santino; Cadum, Ennio; Figini, Silvia; Toscani, Giuseppe",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2021169; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34198391/,290

At end-of-life, when faced with poor prognosis for a meaningful health-related quality of life, most patients indicate their preference to abstain from aggressive, life-sustaining treatments. Patients whose wishes are left unsaid often receive burdensome life sustain therapy by default, prolonging patient suffering. The CoVID pandemic has strained our healthcare resources and raised the need for prioritization of life-sustaining therapy. This highlights the urgency of ACDs more than ever. Despite ACDs' potential to provide patients with care that aligns with their values and preferences and reduce resource competition, there has been relatively little conversation regarding the overlap of ACDs and CoVID-19. There is low uptake among patients, lack of training for healthcare professionals, and inequitable adoption in vulnerable populations. However, solutions are forthcoming and may include electronic medical record completion, patient outreach efforts, healthcare worker programs to increase awareness of at-risk minority patients, and restructuring of incentives and reimbursement policies. This review carefully describes the above challenges and unique opportunities to address them in the CoVID-19 era. If solutions are leveraged appropriately, ACDs have the potential to address the described challenges and ethically resolve resource conflicts during the current crisis and beyond.","Gupta, Amol; Bahl, Bhavyaa; Rabadi, Saher; Mebane, Alexander; Levey, Robert; Vasudevan, Viswanath",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120963698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021094/,290

METHOD Adult patients with severe ARDS requiring VV ECMO were analyzed in two groups: continuous infusion neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium versus no neuromuscular blockade. Similar mechanical ventilation strategies were utilized. The primary end point was duration of VV ECMO. RESULTS This single center, retrospective observational cohort included a total of 47 patients. A total of 28 patients received continuous infusion cisatracurium and 19 patients that did not receive neuromuscular blockade. There was no difference in the duration of VV ECMO in patients that received cisatracurium, 226.5 hr (interquartile range (IQR), 119 - 362.3) versus 187.0 hr (IQR, 108 - 374) in the group that did not receive a paralytic (P = 0.64). There were no differences in secondary outcomes of days in the hospital, days free of organ dysfunction, ECMO survival, or discharged alive.

Therefore, the repurposing of FDA-approved drugs against today's diseases involves the use of de-risked compounds with potentially lower costs and shorter development timelines. In this study, the recently resolved X-ray crystallographic structure of COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) was used to generate a pharmacophore model and to conduct a docking study to capture antiviral drugs as new promising COVID-19 main protease inhibitors. The developed pharmacophore successfully captured five FDA-approved antiviral drugs (lopinavir, remdesivir, ritonavir, saquinavir and raltegravir). The five drugs were successfully docked into the binding site of COVID-19 Mpro and showed several specific binding interactions that were comparable to those tying the co-crystallized inhibitor X77 inside the binding site of COVID-19 Mpro. Three of the captured drugs namely, remdesivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were reported to have promising results in COVID-19 treatment and therefore increases the confidence in our results. Our findings suggest an additional possible mechanism of action for remdesivir as an antiviral drug inhibiting COVID-19 Mpro. Additionally, a combination of structure-based pharmacophore modeling with a docking study is expected to facilitate the discovery of novel COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors.","Daoud, Safa; Alabed, Shada J; Dahabiyeh, Lina A",Acta pharmaceutica,https://doi.org/10.2478/acph-2021-0016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151166/,290

This study aims to explore the drivers of LCD inequality and evolution based on an extended spatial decomposition model. We find that potential energy intensity is the most important factor responsible for both national LCD inequality and its evolution. Further analysis suggests that the central region made some progress in LCD due to the decline of potential energy intensity. Nonetheless, the west must pay attention to the high potential energy intensity and deteriorating industry structure for the persistent poor LCD. And the provincial results indicate that the poorer the economy, the worse the LCD. The LCD formation and evolution mechanism of the various provinces are highly heterogeneous.

114942,Challenging times.,2016,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a lethal, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) protein. Preclinical studies demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of approaches that target and reduce Atxn1 expression in a non-allele-specific manner. However, studies using Atxn1-/- mice raise cautionary notes that therapeutic reductions of ATXN1 might lead to undesirable effects such as reduction in the activity of the tumor suppressor Capicua (CIC), activation of the protease β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and subsequent increased amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), or a reduction in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells that would impact hippocampal function. Here, we tested whether an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated reduction of Atxn1 produced unwanted effects involving BACE1, CIC activity, or reduction in hippocampal neuronal precursor cells. Notably, no effects on BACE1, CIC tumor suppressor function, or number of hippocampal neuronal precursor cells were found in mice subjected to a chronic in vivo ASO-mediated reduction of Atxn1. These data provide further support for targeted reductions of ATXN1 as a therapeutic approach for SCA1.","O'Callaghan, Brennon; Hofstra, Bente; Handler, Hillary P; Kordasiewicz, Holly B; Cole, Tracy; Duvick, Lisa; Friedrich, Jillian; Rainwater, Orion; Yang, Praseuth; Benneyworth, Michael; Nichols-Meade, Tessa; Heal, Wesley; Ter Haar, Rachel; Henzler, Christine; Orr, Harry T",Molecular therapy.

115526,Ayman Abu Al-Ouf.,2021-06-26,"UNLABELLED The abdominoperineal resection of the rectum is a classical operation performed in case of patients diagnosed with rectal cancer. The development of laparoscopic techniques in recent years, introduced yet another method of treatment, considering patients with rectal cancer- laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. The aim of the study was to present initial treatment results considering the above-mentioned patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study group comprised 25 patients (16 male and 9 female) diagnosed with low-rectal cancer, subjected to surgery by means of the above-mentioned method. Mean patient age amounted to 66 years. Three (12%) patients required conversion to classical surgery (laparotomy), while one patient required reoperation, due to presacral vascular bleeding. Complications were observed in 10 (40%) patients. Average hospitalization was 7 days. In case of all patients the radial margin was negative, and mean number of removed lymph nodes amounted to 9.6. Mortality was not observed during the perioperative period. Due to the initial character of the study analysis (mean observation period in case of 68% of patients was shorter than 2 years), oncological results were not subject to evaluation. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic abdominoperineal resections are considered as technically difficult operations, requiring significant experience of the operating team. However, they enable the patient to take advantage of the many assets of minimally invasive surgery, with comparable rates of postoperative complications.","Grous, Aleksander; Uryszek, Mariusz; Ciesielski, Adam; Dib, Naser; Tarnowski, Wiesław",Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,https://doi.org/10.2478/pjs-2013-0085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24310759/,290

116423,A novel method for high precision aortic constriction that allows for generation of specific cardiac phenotypes in mice.,2018,"BACKGROUND As the number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infected people is skyrocketing worldwide, the international medical situation becomes very serious. Potential therapeutic drugs, vaccine and stem cell replacement methods are emerging, it is urgent to find specific therapeutic drugs and the best treatment regimens. After the publication of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with anti-SARS-COV-2 activity in vitro, a small, non-randomized, open-label clinical trial showed that HCQ treatment was significantly associated with reduced viral load in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Meanwhile, a large prophylaxis study of HCQ sulfate for COVID-19 has been initiated in the United States. HCQ offered a promising efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, but the optimal administration is still being explored. METHODS Use the keyword 'Hydroxychloroquine' to conduct a literature search in PubMed to collect relevant literature on the mechanism of action of HCQ, clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, precautions for clinical use and drug interactions, and extract and organize information. RESULTS This paper reviews the mechanism, clinical efficacy and safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, exposure-response relationship and precautions and drug interactions of HCQ, and summarized dosage recommendations for HCQ sulfate. CONCLUSION It has been proved that HCQ, which has an established safety profile, is effective against SARS-CoV-2 with sufficient pre-clinical rationale and evidence. Data from high-quality clinical trials are urgently needed worldwide.","Cui, Cheng; Tu, Siqi; En, Valerie Sia Jie; Li, Xiaobei; Yao, Xueting; Li, Haiyan; Liu, Dongyang",Current drug metabolism,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389200221666200610172929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32520683/,290
117175,The need for ecocentrism in biodiversity conservation.,2020-05-18,"Research into gender and postdivorce mental and physical health has been highly inconsistent. The Gender Similarities Hypothesis suggests there are more similarities than differences and the Divorce Stress Adjustment Perspective suggests that structural inequalities may contribute to adverse postdivorce outcomes. We conducted secondary analyses from an RCT study to investigate if there were gender-specific trajectories and whether gender was associated with outcomes (self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, general hostility, and overall mental and physical health) after controlling for effects of the intervention, income, and number of children using linear mixed-effect regression modeling, and whether number of children and income influenced these outcomes. Participants were 1,239 women and 617 men from the Cooperation after Divorce (CAD) study, conducted in Denmark, a country with less income disparity, high gender equality, shared childrearing by men and women, and societal acceptance of divorce. The analyses assessing the relationship between gender and 12-month postdivorce adjustment in terms of physical and mental health outcomes revealed that for self-perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization, hostility, and overall mental and physical health in this sample postdivorce adjustment trajectories were not gender-specific, and gender was only significantly associated with stress and somatization as a time-invariant additive effect. These findings suggest gender similarities in postdivorce adjustment and contribute to the Gender Similarities Hypothesis and the Divorce-Stress-Adjustment-Perspective by assessing individuals' postdivorce adjustment in a low-stigma and relatively egalitarian setting, providing a clearer assessment of the role of gender without potentially confounding issues of structural inequalities.

117401,The lesson of ivermectin: meta-analyses based on summary data alone are inherently unreliable.,2021-09-22,"OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare postoperative pain and surgical outcomes after transumbilical single-port access (SPA) and conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery for adnexal lesions. METHODS A retrospective case-control study was conducted matched by age, body mass index, and frequency of previous abdominal surgery. A total of 110 SPA laparoscopy patients (cases) were matched with a cohort of 107 patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy (controls) for benign adnexal lesions. SPA system consisted of a wound retractor, surgical glove, two 5-mm trocars, and one 11-mm trocar. Postoperative pain scores were measured immediately after surgery and at 6, 24, and 48 hours postsurgery using the numerical rating scale. RESULTS Postoperative pain scores did not differ between the 2 groups (P = .552). However, higher number of painkiller administrations was observed in the SPA laparoscopy group (median 3 vs 1, P < .001). The type of surgery and intraoperative blood loss were the significant factors influencing the number of painkiller administrations after controlling for other parameters by linear regression (P < .0001). The SPA laparoscopy group had less intraoperative blood loss (45.3 vs 87.5 mL, P < .001) and shorter hospital stay (2.1 ± 0.8 vs 2.7 ± 1.0 days, P < .001) compared with the conventional laparoscopy group. Operative time and perioperative complications did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS There was no difference in pain intensity between the SPA and conventional laparoscopic group in this study. Future trials are warranted to better define the benefits of SPA surgery in terms of postoperative pain.","Yim, Ga Won; Lee, Maria; Nam, Eun Ji; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Sang Wun",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350612439632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22410390/,290

117907,"This issue of ACTA, printed and electronic.",2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Ureteric stone obstruction commonly presents to the emergency department, with definitive management often involving ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy. Insertion of a ureteric stent prior to staged lithotripsy is commonly performed in the public healthcare system. Foreign bodies in the urinary tract are also known to increase urinary tract infection (UTI) risk. This study aims to evaluate the association between stent dwell time and UTI prior to lithotripsy. METHODS The medical records of all patients who were treated for ureteric stones with initial stent insertion and staged lithotripsy, from 1 January 2018 to 30 June 2019 at a single tertiary centre, by eight urologists were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic features, disease factors and urine culture data were collected and analysed. RESULTS Of the 172 patients (median age 56.7 years) identified, one-third had a positive pre-stent urine culture. Twenty-three percent had a positive pre-lithotripsy urine culture with 38% of females compared with 15% of males having a positive culture (P = 0.001). Only 4.3% of patients had a pre-lithotripsy UTI when the stent dwell time was less than 1 month compared with 26.2% when ureteric stents were in situ for longer than 1 month (P = 0.021). The correlation between ureteric stent dwell time and pre-lithotripsy UTI was not linear. Patient comorbidities, stone size, burden and location were not statistically correlated to pre-lithotripsy UTI. CONCLUSION In delayed two-staged surgical management of acute urolithiasis, optimal ureteric stent dwell time is less than 1 month to reduce pre-lithotripsy UTI. Female gender is an independent risk factor for pre-lithotripsy UTI.","Hanna, Bishoy; Zhuo, Kevin; Chalasani, Venu; Vass, Justin; Rasiah, Krishan; Wines, Michael; Vaux, Kenneth; Chung, Amanda",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.16414; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135843/,290

118516,Immunoinformatics and its relevance to understanding human immune disease.,2005,"The epidemiology of invasive filamentous fungal diseases requires monitoring due to changes in susceptibility patterns of new and established antifungal agents that may affect clinical practices. We evaluated the activity of posaconazole against 2,157 invasive moulds collected worldwide from 2010-2017. The isolates included 1,775 Aspergillus spp. and 382 non-Aspergillus moulds, including 81 Fusarium spp., 62 Mucorales group, and 57 Scedosporium spp. Isolates were tested using the CLSI reference broth microdilution method. Posaconazole showed similar activity to itraconazole and voriconazole against A. fumigatus. Applying published ECV, 98.0% of the A. fumigatus and 97.7% to 100.0% of other common Aspergillus species were wildtype to posaconazole. Categorical agreement between posaconazole and the other azoles tested against A. fumigatus was 98.7%. Notably, most of the Aspergillus spp. isolates recovered from this large collection were wildtype to echinocandins and all azoles. Posaconazole non-wildtype rates of A. fumigatus varied across the different geographic regions, with 2.1% in Europe, 2.2% in North America, 1.8% in Latin America, and 0.7% in the Asia-Pacific region. The frequency of azole non-wildtype A. fumigatus isolates from Europe increased steadily from 2010-2017 for all 3 triazoles (0.0%-5.0%). The azole non-wildtype A. fumigatus rates from the other geographic areas were stable over time. Fusarium and/or Scedosporium spp. isolates were highly resistant to azoles and echinocandins. Posaconazole and amphotericin B were the most active agents against the Mucorales. Posaconazole was very active against most species of Aspergillus and was comparable to itraconazole and voriconazole against the less common moulds. Posaconazole should provide a useful addition to the anti-mould grouping of antifungal agents.","Pfaller, Michael A; Carvalhaes, Cecilia G; Messer, Shawn A; Rhomberg, Paul R; Castanheira, Mariana",Diagnostic microbiology and infectious disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2021.115473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352433/,290
118643,Preparing for the 2020-2021 Influenza Season.,2020-11-02,"Purpose: To demonstrate the validity and reliability of a smartphone app to measure ROM after stroke.Materials and methods: Twenty-one stroke survivors with a diagnosis of stroke that affected the motor cortex or subcortical motor pathways and were hospital inpatients at one of two metropolitan hospitals were recruited. A within-session test-retest design was used to compare ROM measurements taken using the GetMyROM app for iPhone to those taken by a digital inclinometer. Torque-controlled passive elbow and wrist extension were collected and statistical analysis of concurrent validity and test-retest reliability performed.Results: GetMyROM app was valid when compared to the digital inclinometer for measuring passive ROM of the elbow (r = .98, p = .0001, ICC = 0.97) and wrist (r = .97, p = .0001, ICC = 0.96) in individuals with acute stroke. Both the GetMyROM app and inclinometer demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability: ICC values are 0.84 to 0.93, and standard error of measurement between 6° to 10°.Conclusion: The GetMyROM app may be implemented in a clinical setting similar to that where the study was conducted, enabling rehabilitation physicians and therapists to use a smartphone to take precise measurements of ROM in daily clinical practice.Implications for rehabilitationApproximately half of all stroke survivors experience reduced passive upper limb range of movement.Accurate measurement of passive upper limb range of movement using validated assessments and/or instruments is paramount.This study demonstrates that the GetMyROM app is valid and reliable compared to the gold standard comparison (digital inclinometer), and is therefore appropriate to use in clinical settings to take precise measurements.","Lin, Natalie Chew Jin; Hayward, Kathryn S; D'Cruz, Kate; Thompson, Eloise; Li, Xia; Lannin, Natasha A",Disability and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2019.1585972; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084443/,290

Here, we demonstrate that PD-1 signals are needed for optimal memory. Mice deficient in the PD-1 pathway exhibit impaired CD8+ T cell memory following acute influenza infection, including reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and compromised recall responses. PD-1 blockade during priming leads to similar differences early post-infection but without the defect in memory formation, suggesting that timing and/or duration of PD-1 blockade could be tailored to modulate host responses. Our studies reveal a role for PD-1 as an integrator of CD8+ T cell signals that promotes CD8+ T cell memory formation and suggest PD-1 continues to fine-tune CD8+ T cells after they migrate into non-lymphoid tissues. These findings have important implications for PD-1-based immunotherapy, in which PD-1 inhibition may influence memory responses in patients.","Pauken, Kristen E; Godec, Jernej; Odorizzi, Pamela M; Brown, Keturah E; Yates, Kathleen B; Ngiow, Shin Foong; Burke, Kelly P; Maleri, Seth; Grande, Shannon M; Francisco, Loise M; Ali, Mohammed-Alkhatim; Imam, Sabrina; Freeman, Gordon J; Haining, W Nicholas; Wherry, E John; Sharpe, Arlene H",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107827; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610128/,290

119694,A word from the Editors on Protocol Review.,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE Hospital readmissions in the United States, especially in patients at high-risk, cost more than $17 billion annually. Although care transitions is an important area of research, data are limited regarding its efficacy, especially among rural patients. In this study, we describe a novel transitions-of-care clinic (TOCC) to reduce 30-day readmissions in a Veterans Health Administration setting that serves a high proportion of rural veterans. METHODS In this quality improvement initiative we conducted a pre-post study evaluating clinical outcomes in adult patients at high risk for 30-day readmission (Care Assessment Needs score > 85) discharged from the Iowa City Veterans Affairs (ICVA) Health Care System from 2017 to 2020. The ICVA serves 184,000 veterans across 50 counties in eastern Iowa, western Illinois, and northern Missouri, with more than 60% of these patients residing in rural areas. We implemented a multidisciplinary TOCC to provide in-person or virtual follow-up to high-risk veterans after hospital discharge. The main purpose of this study was to assess how TOCC follow-up impacted the monthly 30-day patient readmission rate. RESULTS The TOCC resulted in a 19.2% relative reduction in 30-day readmission rates in the 12-month postimplementation period compared to the preimplementation period (9.2% vs 11.4%, P = .04). Virtual visits were more popular than in-person visits among both urban and rural veterans. There was no difference in outcomes between these two follow-up options, and both groups had reduced readmission rates compared to non-TOCC follow-up. CONCLUSIONS A multidisciplinary TOCC within the ICVA featuring both virtual and in-person visits reduced the 30-day readmission rate. This reduction was particularly notable among patients with congestive heart failure.","Griffin, Benjamin R; Agarwal, Neeru; Amberker, Rachana; Perez, Jeydith A Gutierrez; Eichorst, Kelsi; Chapin, Jennifer; Schweitzer, Amy C; Hagiwara, Mariko; Wu, Chaorong; Eyck, Patrick Ten; Reisinger, Heather Schacht; Vaughan-Sarrazin, Mary; Kuperman, Ethan F; Glenn, Kevin; Jalal, Diana I",Journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424188/,290

Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping has important clinical implications for the treatment of CA. We developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for the detection of HPV. Methods We collected 294 cervical scrape samples, including 30 HPV-6-positive, 30 HPV-11-positive, 22 HPV-16-positive, 20 HPV-42-positve, 30 HPV-43-positive, 20 HPV-44-positive and 142 HPV-negative samples. Tissues from 40 patients with a pathological diagnosis of CA were paraffin-embedded and analyzed by LAMP and Luminex. Hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) and electrophoresis were used to detect the results of LAMP. Results LAMP and Luminex systems were compared in detecting six subtypes of HPV. LAMP reactions were specific for each subtype. The sensitivity of LAMP for HPV-6, as determined by the HNB indicator assay, was 1000 copies/tube. The kappa value between the two methods was 0.98 (HPV-6), 0.94 (HPV-11), 0.89 (HPV-43), 0.87 (HPV-42) 0.79 (HPV-16) and 0.68 (HPV-44). Among the 142 HPV-negative samples determined by the Luminex assay, HPV-6 was detected in eight and HPV-11 in one by LAMP. Among the 40 CA samples, the results of LAMP and Luminex were in agreement in 38 (95%). Conclusion The results of this study indicated that the LAMP assay with HNB is superior to the Luminex method in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The specificity of LAMP was 100% and the sensitivity of LAMP was 1000 copies/tube using HNB. LAMP is therefore a useful, quick and accurate method for the clinical diagnosis of HPV subtypes.","Zhong, Q; Li, K; Chen, D; Wang, H; Lin, Q; Liu, W",British journal of biomedical science,https://doi.org/10.1080/09674845.2017.1411864; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29537347/,290

We apply John Kingdon's model of political agenda setting to explore how the convergence of problems, solutions, and political developments culminated in the adoption of a government program that included critical PHC reforms and approval of a results-based funding instrument for implementation. We draw on a review of the gray and peer-reviewed literature and stakeholder consultations, and use content analysis to identify themes organized in line with the dimensions of Kingdon's model. We conclude this paper with three lessons that may be relevant for generating political priority for PHC reforms in other contexts. First, national PHC reforms are likely to be prioritized when there is political alignment of health reforms with the broader political agenda. Second, the availability of technically sound and feasible policy proposals makes it possible to seize the political opportunity when the window opens. Third, partners' coordinated technical and financial support for neglected issues can serve to raise their priority on the political agenda.","Wang, Huihui; Chukwuma, Adanna; Comsa, Radu; Dmytraczenko, Tania; Gong, Estelle; Onofrei, Lidia",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2021.1898187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402391/,290

In this paper, we present a systematic review and meta-analysis of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from stroke that are attributable to exposure to long working hours, for the development of the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates. OBJECTIVES We aimed to systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of exposure to long working hours (three categories: 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (three outcomes: prevalence, incidence, and mortality). DATA SOURCES A protocol was developed and published, applying the Navigation Guide to systematic reviews as an organizing framework where feasible. We searched electronic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CISDOC, PsycINFO, and WHO ICTRP. We also searched grey literature databases, Internet search engines, and organizational websites; hand-searched reference lists of previous systematic reviews; and consulted additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We included working-age (≥15 years) individuals in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State but excluded children (aged < 15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the effect of exposure to long working hours (41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week), compared with exposure to standard working hours (35-40 h/week), on stroke (prevalence, incidence or mortality). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first review stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. Missing data were requested from principal study authors. We combined relative risks using random-effects meta-analysis. Two or more review authors assessed the risk of bias, quality of evidence and strength of evidence, using the Navigation Guide and GRADE tools and approaches adapted to this project. RESULTS Twenty-two studies (20 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 839,680 participants (364,616 females) in eight countries from three WHO regions (Americas, Europe, and Western Pacific). The exposure was measured using self-reports in all studies, and the outcome was assessed with administrative health records (13 studies), self-reported physician diagnosis (7 studies), direct diagnosis by a physician (1 study) or during a medical interview (1 study). The outcome was defined as an incident non-fatal stroke event in nine studies (7 cohort studies, 2 case-control studies), incident fatal stroke event in one cohort study and incident non-fatal or fatal (""mixed"") event in 12 studies (all cohort studies). Cohort studies were judged to have a relatively low risk of bias; therefore, we prioritized evidence from these studies, but synthesised evidence from case-control studies as supporting evidence. For the bodies of evidence for both outcomes with any eligible studies (i.e. stroke incidence and mortality), we did not have serious concerns for risk of bias (at least for the cohort studies). Eligible studies were found on the effects of long working hours on stroke incidence and mortality, but not prevalence. Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were uncertain about the effect on incidence of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (relative risk (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.14, 18 studies, 277,202 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence). There may have been an increased risk for acquiring stroke when working 49-54 h/week compared with 35-40 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00-1.28, 17 studies, 275,181participants, I2 0%, p 0.04, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, working ≥55 h/week may have led to a moderate, clinically meaningful increase in the risk of acquiring stroke, when followed up between one year and 20 years (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61, 7 studies, 162,644 participants, I2 3%, moderate quality of evidence). Compared with working 35-40 h/week, we were very uncertain about the effect on dying (mortality) of stroke due to working 41-48 h/week (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91-1.12, 12 studies, 265,937 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence), 49-54 h/week (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.99-1.29, 11 studies, 256,129 participants, I2 0%, low quality of evidence) and 55 h/week (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.31, 10 studies, 664,647 participants, I2 20%, low quality of evidence). Subgroup analyses found no evidence for differences by WHO region, age, sex, socioeconomic status and type of stroke. Sensitivity analyses found no differences by outcome definition (exclusively non-fatal or fatal versus ""mixed"") except for the comparison working ≥55 h/week versus 35-40 h/week for stroke incidence (p for subgroup differences: 0.05), risk of bias (""high""/""probably high"" ratings in any domain versus ""low""/""probably low"" in all domains), effect estimate measures (risk versus hazard versus odds ratios) and comparator (exact versus approximate definition). CONCLUSIONS We judged the existing bodies of evidence for human evidence as ""inadequate evidence for harmfulness"" for all exposure categories for stroke prevalence and mortality and for exposure to 41-48 h/week for stroke incidence. Evidence on exposure to 48-54 h/week and ≥55 h/week was judged as ""limited evidence for harmfulness"" and ""sufficient evidence for harmfulness"" for stroke incidence, respectively. Producing estimates for the burden of stroke attributable to exposures to working 48-54 and ≥55 h/week appears evidence-based, and the pooled effect estimates presented in this systematic review could be used as input data for the WHO/ILO Joint Estimates.

A plethora of studies are going on all over the world to discover the drug to fight SARS-COV-2. One of the most promising targets is RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible for viral RNA replication in host cells. Since RdRp is a viral enzyme with no host cell homologs, it allows the development of selective SARS-COV-2 RdRp inhibitors. A variety of studies used in silico approaches for virtual screening, molecular docking, and repurposing of already existing drugs and phytochemicals against SARS-COV-2 RdRp. This review focuses on collating compounds possessing the potential to inhibit SARS-COV-2 RdRp based on in silico studies to give medicinal chemists food for thought so that the existing drugs can be repurposed for the control and treatment of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic after performing in vitro and in vivo experiments.","Agrawal, Neetu; Goyal, Ahsas",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201022666210421102513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882805/,290

121903,"""Art in Endoscopy"" - to be continued!",2020-09-01,"Background Human adenovirus (HAdV) can cause severe community-acquired pneumonia, but there are few studies on the associated cytokine patterns. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between inflammatory cytokine and severity of adenovirus pneumonia. Methods This was a prospective observational study. We evaluated pneumonia patients admitted to the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in Korea. On admission, blood samples were acquired from patients who showed signs of pneumonia. HAdV infection was diagnosed using Real-Q RV detection Kit, and types of HAdV were confirmed by nucleotide blast analysis. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to quantify the serum levels of cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, γ-interferon (IFN-γ), and IL-10]. We evaluated clinical characteristics and cytokine patterns. Results Of 74 pneumonia patients, respiratory specimens from 43 tested positive for HAdV-55, and the other 31 tested negatives. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the HAdV group. The serum concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-γ were all significantly higher in the HAdV group. Of the 43 HAdV pneumonia patients, 6 evidenced PaO2/FiO2 (PF) ratio <300, and 37 did not. Compared to the non-hypoxemic group, the hypoxemic group showed significantly lower lymphocyte and monocyte counts, and increased IL-6 and IFN-γ concentrations. Logistic regression analysis showed that the IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ were significantly associated with hypoxemia in the HAdV group. The IL-6, and IFN-γ levels correlated significantly with the PF ratio. Conclusions We found that the levels IL-6, IL-10, and IFN-γ were significantly associated with hypoxemia in patients with HAdV-55 pneumonia.","Lim, Jeong Uk; Choi, Joon Young; Jeong, Ho Jung; Ko, Jae-Hoon; Lee, Ji Eun; Rhee, Chin Kook",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-19-4067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944316/,290

122335,Robot-assisted surgery for the management of apical prolapse: a bi-centre prospective cohort study.,2019,"Background The aim of this study was to observe the preventive effect of flavonoids extracted from Malus asiatica Nakai leaves (FMANL) on esophageal cancer in mice, especially the ability of FMANL to regulate the interleukin 17 (IL-17) signaling pathway during this process. Materials and Methods The C57BL/6J mice were treated with 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide (4NQO) to induce esophageal cancer, and the visceral tissue index and the serum and esophageal tissue indexes of mice were used to verify the effect of FMANL. Results The experimental results showed that FMANL can effectively control the changes in visceral tissue caused by esophageal cancer. FMANL could increase the cytokine levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) and decrease the cytokine levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 12p70 (IL-12p70) in serum of mice with esophageal cancer. FMANL could also reduce CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ and enhance CD19+ mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes. The results of qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that FMANL could down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of IL-17, interleukin 23 (IL-23), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 1 (CXCL1), chemokine (C-X-C) ligand 2 (CXCL2), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP-9), and matrix metalloprotein 13 (MMP-1) in mice with esophageal cancer. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection showed that FMANL contained 10 chemicals, including rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, dihydroquercetin, quercitrin, hesperidin, myricetin, baicalin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, and quercetin. Conclusion It could be concluded that FMANL can effectively prevent experimentally induced esophageal cancer in mice, and its effects might be obtained from 10 compounds present in FMANL.","Jia, Xiang-Bo; Zhang, Quan; Xu, Lei; Yao, Wen-Jian; Wei, Li",OncoTargets and therapy,https://doi.org/10.2147/ott.s261033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764989/,290
122668,The efficacy of medical treatment for adenomyosis after adenomyomectomy.,2020-07-28,"Production of cloned mammals by somatic cell nuclear transfer is associated with functional and structural abnormalities of placentation and with abnormal fetal development. A proteomic analysis was performed in domestic cats (Felis catus) to compare cloned term placentas (CTP) obtained from cesarean section (CS) to control placentas obtained from CS or vaginal delivery. The expression of 20 proteins was altered in CTP (p<0.05) compared to control placentas. The two control groups showed that the method of delivery, vaginal delivery or CS, did not affect protein expression (p>0.05). A total of 13 proteins were up-regulated in CTP, including apoptosis-related cathepsin D (CD), annexin A1 and heat shock protein 27 (HSP 27), and seven proteins were down-regulated in CTP, including prohibitin (PHB). The expression of PHB and CD was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. The abnormal expression of PHB and CD correlated with the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and telomeric DNA, which are associated with cellular senescence and apoptosis. In summary, a specific pattern of abnormal protein expression is associated with the impaired development and functions of cloned placentas and hence with decreased fetal viability. Strategies aimed at restoring normal placental protein expression may increase the efficiency of somatic cell nuclear transfer and transgenic cat production and help restore endangered species.","Bang, Jae-Il; Bae, Dong-Won; Lee, Hyo-Sang; Deb, Gautam K; Kim, Myeong-Ok; Sohn, Sea-Hwan; Han, Chang-Hee; Kong, Il-Keun",Proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1002/pmic.201000772; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21932444/,290

We summarize the latest research. RECENT FINDINGS Concerning pathogenesis of AIH, different groups have identified pieces of the puzzle that fit together well: An altered microbiome in the gut results in a proinflammatory response in the liver. This response is built by type II natural killer cells and CD4 T cells with an inflammatory phenotype and marked tumor necrosis factor production. When looking specifically at autoantigenic CD4 T cells, these have a B-helper phenotype on transcriptomic analysis. This explains not only elevation of immunoglobulins in AIH, but also mechanistically the effect of anti-B-cell substances in treatment. Diagnosis is now facilitated by an improved diagnostic score for AIH also recognizing modern techniques for autoantibody detection. Treatment in the future will increasingly be focused on reducing dosage and duration of steroid exposition. In addition, B-cell-targeted treatments have been evaluated with considerable success. SUMMARY Research in the past 18 months has improved the understanding of pathogenesis and thereby opened a number of possible treatment options. In addition, steroid use is cautioned by the recent findings.","Weiler-Normann, Christina; Lohse, Ansgar W",Current opinion in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mog.0000000000000701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33315793/,290

124727,Long COVID: don't consign ME/CFS to history.,2020-11-01,"The brain's ability to encode temporal patterns and predict upcoming events is critical for speech perception and other aspects of social communication. Deficits in predictive coding may contribute to difficulties with social communication and overreliance on repetitive predictable environments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using a mismatch negativity (MMN) task involving rhythmic tone sequences of varying complexity, we tested the hypotheses that (1) individuals with ASD have reduced MMN response to auditory stimuli that deviate in presentation timing from expected patterns, particularly as pattern complexity increases and (2) amplitude of MMN signal is inversely correlated with level of impairment in social communication and repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography was acquired as individuals (age 6-21 years) listened to repeated five-rhythm tones that varied in the Shannon entropy of the rhythm across three conditions (zero, medium-1 bit, and high-2 bit entropy). The majority of the tones conformed to the established rhythm (standard tones); occasionally the fourth tone was temporally shifted relative to its expected time of occurrence (deviant tones). Social communication and repetitive behaviors were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised. Both neurotypical controls (n = 19) and individuals with ASD (n = 21) show stepwise decreases in MMN as a function of increasing entropy. Contrary to the result forecasted by a predictive coding hypothesis, individuals with ASD do not differ from controls in these neural mechanisms of prediction error to auditory rhythms of varied temporal complexity, and there is no relationship between these signals and social communication or repetitive behavior measures. LAY SUMMARY: We tested the idea that the brain's ability to use previous experience to influence processing of sounds is weaker in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) than in neurotypical individuals. We found no difference between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls in brain wave responses to sounds that occurred earlier than expected in either simple or complex rhythms. There was also no relationship between these brain waves and social communication or repetitive behavior scores.","Knight, Emily J; Oakes, Leona; Hyman, Susan L; Freedman, Edward G; Foxe, John J",Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,https://doi.org/10.1002/aur.2362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881408/,290
124900,Aminophylline partially prevents the decrease of body temperature during laparoscopic abdominal surgery.,2014,"OBJECTIVES (1) To determine if antenna coupling occurs in common operating room scenarios. (2) To define modifiable clinical variables that reduce the magnitude of antenna coupling. BACKGROUND Mechanisms of electrosurgical burns where monitoring devices contact the surgical patient are unclear. Antenna coupling occurs when the ""bovie"" active electrode (electrically active transmitting antenna) emits energy, which is captured by a nonelectrically active wire (electrically inactive receiving antenna) in close proximity without direct contact. METHODS Monopolar radiofrequency energy was delivered to a laparoscopic instrument (electrically active transmitting antenna), whereas other nonelectrically active wires (electrically inactive receiving antenna) including electrocardiogram (EKG) lead, nonactive ""bovie"" pencil, and nerve electrode monitor were placed in proximity. Temperature changes of tissue placed adjacent to the electrically inactive receiving antennae were measured. RESULTS Nonelectrically active wires (receiving antenna) increase tissue temperature when lying parallel to the active electrode cord: EKG pad 2.4°C ± 1.2°C (P = 0.002), ""bovie"" pencil tip 90°C ± 9°C (P < 0.001), and nerve electrode monitor 106°C ± 12°C (P < 0.001). Factors that reduced the heat generated by antenna coupling included the following: increasing angulation between transmitting and receiving antennae (parallel = 90°C ± 9°C; 45° angle = 53°C ± 10°C; perpendicular = 35°C ± 11°C; P < .001), increasing separation distance between parallel transmitting and receiving antenna (<1 cm = 90°C ± 9°C; 15 cm = 44°C ± 18°C; 30 cm = 39°C ± 2°C; P < .001); and decreasing generator power setting (15 W = 59°C ± 11°C; 30 W = 90°C ± 9°C; 45 W = 98°C ± 8°C; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Antenna coupling occurs in common operating room scenarios. Simple, practical measures by the surgeon, such as orienting the receiving antenna at a greater angle and with greater separation to the active electrode cord, or lowering the generator power setting reduce antenna coupling.","Robinson, Thomas N; Barnes, Kelli S; Govekar, Henry R; Stiegmann, Greg V; Dunn, Christina L; McGreevy, Francis T",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e318260263e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22791097/,290

This is an initial effort to create a candidate model that can be applicable to many parts of Asia.

Experts from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) involved in the Trial moderated the session. The practice suggestions in this statement were from a targeted literature review and expert opinion. RESULTS A high prevalence of MMC in Asia supports an effort to adopt the procedure, but only in established FTCs with good maternal and neonatal ancillary supports. The falling incidence of MMCs may affect case volume and maintenance of skill. A regional approach was recommended. Fetal benefits have to be weighed against maternal risks, with a consideration of recent outcome data from the endoscopic approach. Responsible FTCs need standardized diagnosis and management, with their long-term outcome data available for an audit.

Many current therapies have dose-limiting adverse effects and are limited by their short duration of action. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy and safety of cryoanalgesia in postoperative pain. Materials and methods This review was registered in PROSPERO and prepared in accordance with PRISMA. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched until July 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults evaluating perioperatively administered cryoanalgesia for postoperative pain relief. Results Twenty-four RCTS were included. Twenty studies examined cryoanalgesia for thoracotomy, two for herniorrhaphy, one for nephrectomy and one for tonsillectomy. Meta-analysis was performed for thoracic studies. We found that cryoanalgesia with opioids was more efficacious than opioid analgesia alone for acute pain (mean difference [MD] 2.32 units, 95 % confidence interval [CI] -3.35 to -1.30) and persistent pain (MD 0.81 units, 95 % CI -1.10 to -0.53) after thoracotomy. Cryoanalgesia with opioids also resulted in less postoperative nausea compared to opioid analgesia alone (relative risk [RR] 0.23, 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.95), but there was no difference in atelectasis (RR 0.38, 95 % CI 0.07 to 2.17). Conclusion Heterogeneity in comparators and outcomes were important limitations. In general, reporting of adverse events was incomplete and inconsistent. Many studies were over two decades old, and most were limited in how they described their methodology. Considering the potential, larger RCTs should be performed to better understand the role of cryoanalgesia in postoperative pain management.","Park, Rex; Coomber, Michael; Gilron, Ian; Shanthanna, Harsha",Annals of medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408872/,290
125755,15 Years MR-encephalography.,2020-10-20,"The fast-evolving nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented clinical, logistical, and socioeconomical challenges for health-care systems worldwide. While several studies have analyzed the impact on the presentation and management of acute appendicitis (AA) in the adult population, there is a relative paucity of similar research in pediatric patients with AA. To date, there is some evidence that the incidence of simple AA in children may have decreased during the first lockdown period in spring 2020, whereas the number of complicated AA cases remained unchanged or increased slightly. Despite a worrying trend toward delayed presentation, most pediatric patients with AA were treated expediently during this time with comparable outcomes to previous years. Hospitals must consider their individual capacity and medical resources when choosing between operative and non-operative management of children with AA. Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 is imperative in all pediatric patients presenting with fever and acute abdominal pain with diarrhea or vomiting, to differentiate between multisystem inflammatory syndrome and AA, thus avoiding unnecessary surgery. During the further extension of the COVID-19 crisis, parents should be encouraged to seek medical care with their children early in order that the appropriate treatment for AA can be undertaken in a timely fashion.","Saalabian, Kerstin; Rolle, Udo; Friedmacher, Florian",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

We sought to verify the commutability of potential calibrator materials and evaluate their effectiveness in harmonizing LDH results by 2 measurement methods. METHODS We measured LDH in 109 serum samples and 31 materials, including frozen serum pools (with either normal or abnormal isoenzyme patterns), commercial stabilized materials, and the ERM-AD453/IFCC reference material. We assayed LDH activity with the IFCC reference procedure and with 2 commercial methods, 1 using the lactate-to-pyruvate (LP) reaction, and the other the pyruvate-to-lactate (PL) reaction. We selected a commutable material, with LDH value assigned by the reference procedure, as a calibrator for recalculating the results for patient sera by both LP and PL, thereby making them traceable to the IFCC reference procedure. RESULTS Original values for patient sera (n = 109) by the 2 commercial methods showed a mean (SD) PL/LP ratio of 1.97 (0.03); this ratio changed to 1.06 (0.02) after recalculation of results. Linear regression of PL vs LP recalibrated values gave y = 1.108x - 9.7. At the clinically important concentration of 250 U/L (upper reference limit), the systematic difference between methods was 6.8%, which met our proposed quality specifications for inaccuracy and total error. CONCLUSIONS By properly selecting the calibrator, the results of serum LDH measurement by 2 different methods may be harmonized and made traceable to the selected highest (reference) metrological level.","Cattozzo, Giampaolo; Guerra, Elena; Ceriotti, Ferruccio; Franzini, Carlo",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1373/clinchem.2007.100081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18539646/,290

ScFv antibodies, composed of a VH and VL domain, are readily engineered into multimeric formats for the development of diagnostics and targeted therapies. However, the recombinant nature of the selection strategy can result in VH and VL domains with sub-optimal biophysical properties, such as reduced thermodynamic stability and enhanced aggregation propensity, which lead to poor production and limited application. We found that the C10 anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) scFv, and its affinity mutant, P2224, exhibit weak production from E. coli. Interestingly, these scFv contain a fusion of lambda3 and lambda1 V-region (LV3 and LV1) genes, most likely the result of a PCR aberration during library construction. To enhance the biophysical properties of these scFvs, we utilized a structure-based approach to replace and redesign the pre-existing framework of the VL domain to one that best pairs with the existing VH. We describe a method to exchange lambda sequences with a more stable kappa3 framework (KV3) within the VL domain that incorporates the original lambda DE-loop. The resulting scFvs, C10KV3_LV1DE and P2224KV3_LV1DE, are more thermodynamically stable and easier to produce from bacterial culture. Additionally, C10KV3_LV1DE and P2224KV3_LV1DE retain binding affinity to EGFR, suggesting that such a dramatic framework swap does not significantly affect scFv binding. We provide here a novel strategy for redesigning the light chain of problematic scFvs to enhance their stability and therapeutic applicability.","Lehmann, Andreas; Wixted, Josephine H F; Shapovalov, Maxim V; Roder, Heinrich; Dunbrack, Roland L; Robinson, Matthew K",mAbs,https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2015.1088618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26337947/,290
126825,Parenting researchers-an invisible divide.,2020-06-17,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Despite the growing use of percutaneous ablation therapy for the treatment of metastatic spine disease, several issues have yet to be fully addressed. Our aims were to determine whether the vertebral body cortex protects against ablation-induced spinal cord injury; correlate radiofrequency, cryo-, and microwave ablation parameters with resulting spinal ablation zone dimensions and describe normal spinal marrow postablation changes on MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ten thoracolumbar vertebrae in 3 sheep were treated with radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, or microwave ablation under fluoroscopic guidance. Technique parameters were chosen to produce ablation zones that exceeded the volume of the vertebral bodies in sheep 1 and were confined to the vertebrae in sheep 2 and 3. Expected ablation zone dimensions were based on data provided by the device manufacturers. Postablation MR imaging was performed at 48 hours (sheep 1) or 7 days (sheep 2 and 3). RESULTS In sheep 1, cryoablation and microwave ablations extended into the spinal canal and caused histologically confirmed neurologic injury, but radiofrequency ablation did not. The mean difference between the lengths of the radiofrequency ablation zone dimensions measured on gross pathology compared with those expected was 9.6 ± 4.1 mm. The gross pathologic cryo- and microwave ablation zone dimensions were within 1 mm of those expected. All modalities produced a nonenhancing ablation zone with a rim of enhancement, corresponding histologically to marrow necrosis and hemorrhagic congestion. CONCLUSIONS An intact cortex appears to protect against radiofrequency ablation-induced spinal cord injury, but not against non-impedance-based modalities. Ablation dimensions produced by microwave and cryoablation are similar to those expected, while radiofrequency ablation dimensions are smaller. Ablation of normal marrow produces a rim of enhancement at the margin of the ablation zone on MR imaging.","Wallace, A N; Hillen, T J; Friedman, M V; Zohny, Z S; Stephens, B H; Greco, S C; Talcott, M R; Jennings, J W",AJNR.

128536,Virtual delivery: a panacea for the financial and ethical challenges associated with physiology laboratory classes?,2021-12-01,"OBJECTIVE Telehealth is being increasingly incorporated into the delivery of mental health care and has received widespread attention during the COVID-19 pandemic for its ability to facilitate care during physical distancing restrictions. Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. METHOD Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. RESULTS Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats. CONCLUSIONS Results provide preliminary evidence that videoconference group CBT for anxiety and related disorders may be a promising and effective alternative to face-to-face CBT. Additional research is needed to establish equivalence between these delivery formats.","Milosevic, Irena; Cameron, Duncan H; Milanovic, Melissa; McCabe, Randi E; Rowa, Karen",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

METHODS A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of dental caries was obtained from the UK Biobank. A TWAS of dental caries was conducted with the FUSION tool using the gene expression reference weights of musculoskeletal, whole blood, and peripheral blood genes. The dental caries-associated genes identified by the TWAS were further subjected to gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses to explore dental caries-related gene sets. Finally, the TWAS results of dental caries were compared with genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of dental caries to detect common genes and gene sets. RESULTS The TWAS identified 165 musculoskeletal genes, 110 whole blood genes, and 228 peripheral blood genes. GO analysis of the genes identified by the TWAS detected 57 GO terms. For pathway enrichment analysis, we detected 12 candidate pathways. After comparing the TWAS-identified genes with the mRNA expression profiling data, we detected 6 common genes. Further comparing the GO results of the TWAS and mRNA expression profiling identified 5 common GO terms. CONCLUSION We identified a group of dental caries-associated genes and GO terms, providing novel clues for understanding the genetic mechanisms of dental caries.","Tong, Xiangyao; Hou, Siyu; Ma, Mei; Zhang, Lu; Zou, Rui; Hou, Tiezhou; Niu, Lin",Archives of oral biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archoralbio.2020.104863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818884/,290
128849,Time-dependent inhibition of covert shifts of attention.,2021-07-03,"The role of genetics in driving intracortical relationships is an important question that has rarely been studied in humans. In particular, there are no extant high-resolution imaging studies on genetic covariance. In this article, we describe a novel method that combines classical quantitative genetic methodologies for variance decomposition with recently developed semi-multivariate algorithms for high-resolution measurement of phenotypic covariance. Using these tools, we produced correlational maps of genetic and environmental (i.e. nongenetic) relationships between several regions of interest and the cortical surface in a large pediatric sample of 600 twins, siblings, and singletons. These analyses demonstrated high, fairly uniform, statistically significant genetic correlations between the entire cortex and global mean cortical thickness. In agreement with prior reports on phenotypic covariance using similar methods, we found that mean cortical thickness was most strongly correlated with association cortices. However, the present study suggests that genetics plays a large role in global brain patterning of cortical thickness in this manner. Further, using specific gyri with known high heritabilities as seed regions, we found a consistent pattern of high bilateral genetic correlations between structural homologues, with environmental correlations more restricted to the same hemisphere as the seed region, suggesting that interhemispheric covariance is largely genetically mediated. These findings are consistent with the limited existing knowledge on the genetics of cortical variability as well as our prior multivariate studies on cortical gyri.","Schmitt, J Eric; Lenroot, Rhoshel K; Ordaz, Sarah E; Wallace, Gregory L; Lerch, Jason P; Evans, Alan C; Prom, Elizabeth C; Kendler, Kenneth S; Neale, Michael C; Giedd, Jay N",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.06.039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18672072/,290

Nonetheless, data are lacking regarding the management of EES during the pandemic. The object of this study was to understand current worldwide practices pertaining to EES for skull base/pituitary tumors during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and provide a basis for the formulation of guidelines. METHODS The authors conducted a web-based survey of skull base surgeons worldwide. Different practices by geographic region and COVID-19 prevalence were analyzed. RESULTS One hundred thirty-five unique responses were collected. Regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), North America reported using more powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), and Asia and Europe reported using more standard precautions. North America and Europe resorted more to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for screening asymptomatic patients. High-prevalence countries showed a higher use of PAPRs. The medium-prevalence group reported lower RT-PCR testing for symptomatic cases, and the high-prevalence group used it significantly more in asymptomatic cases.Nineteen respondents reported transmission of COVID-19 to healthcare personnel during EES, with a higher rate of transmission among countries classified as having a medium prevalence of COVID-19. These specific respondents (medium prevalence) also reported a lower use of airborne PPE. In the cases of healthcare transmission, the patient was reportedly asymptomatic 32% of the time. CONCLUSIONS This survey gives an overview of EES practices during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Intensified preoperative screening, even in asymptomatic patients, RT-PCR for all symptomatic cases, and an increased use of airborne PPE is associated with decreased reports of COVID-19 transmission during EES.","Champagne, Pierre-Olivier; McDowell, Michael M; Wang, Eric W; Snyderman, Carl H; Zenonos, Georgios A; Gardner, Paul A",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260127/,290

METHODS Retrospectively, we collected patients who underwent a laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal approach. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male patients aged >20 years, (2) untreated hernia, and (3) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≤3. The exclusion criteria included: (1) additional procedures received during surgery, (2) inguinoscrotal hernia, (3) ASA score >3, (4) previous lower abdominal surgery, (5) bleeding disorders, and (6) incarcerated, obstructed, strangulated, or recurrent inguinal hernias. Patients were classified into SPLTEP and CLTEP groups. The demographics, body mass index (BMI), ASA score, comorbidities, blood loss, operation time, postoperative length of stay (LOS)/complications, hernia recurrence, visual analog scale (VAS), and postoperative analgesic requirements were collected for analysis. RESULTS A total of 246 patients were enrolled. There were 103 patients in the SPLTEP group and 143 patients in the CLTEP group. The mean age was 56.1 ± 16.2 years versus 57.9 ± 15.1 years. There were no significances in demographics, BMI, ASA score, comorbidities, blood loss, operation time, postoperative LOS/complications, and hernia recurrence. The SPLTEP group had a shorter postoperative LOS, lower VAS at 18 hours postoperation, and a reduced amount of 24-hour postoperative analgesics. CONCLUSION SPLTEP hernioplasty is as safe as the CLTEP procedure. In addition, the SPLTEP group had a shorter LOS and a lower VAS score and required less postoperative analgesics. Further studies may focus on long-term complications, hernia recurrence, and chronic pain in these 2 groups.","Fang, Chu-Wen; Chiu, Allen W; Huang, Steven Kuan-Hua",The American surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003134820949999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136428/,290

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of the Russian Register of Diabetes database was performed, including patients with type 2 DM (n=309) who suffered pneumonia/COVID-19 in the period from 01.02.2020 to 27.04.2020 and the indicated outcome of the disease (recovery or death) RESULTS: The percentage of lethality was determined to be 15.2% (47 of 309 people). The degree of lethality was found to be significantly higher in males (OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.1–3.9; p=0.022) and in patients on insulin therapy (OR=2.67; 95% CI; 1.42–5.02; p=0.002), while it was significantly lower in patients with an age <65 years (OR=0.34; 95% CI 0.18–0.67; p=0.001) and in patients receiving metformin (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.14–0,5; p<0.0001), antihypertensive therapy (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.22–0.82; p=0.009), β-blockers (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.08–0.86; p=0.018), diuretics (OR=0.4; 95% CI 0.17–0.93; p=0.028) and renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) (OR=0.36; 95% CI 0.18–0.74; p=0.004). A tendency to an increase in lethality at higher rates of HbA1c and BMI was present, but it did not reach a statistical significance. Differences between patients receiving insulin therapy and those who were not receiving the insulin therapy were observed as follows: a significantly longer duration of type 2 DM (13.4 vs. 6.8 years, respectively; p<0.0001), worse overall glyacemic control (HbA1c: 8.1% vs. 7.0%, resp.; p<0.0001), and three times more frequent failure to achieve the HbA1c goal by more than 2.5% (14.7% vs. 5.9%, resp.; p=0.04). CONCLUSION The identified risk factors for lethality in patients with type 2 DM indicate that good glycemic control and previous treatment with metformin and antihypertensive drugs (including RAS blockers) could reduce the frequency of deaths. In patients on insulin therapy, a higher lethality degree was associated with worse glycemic control.","Shestakova, Marina V; Vikulova, Olga K; Isakov, Mikhail А; Dedov, Ivan I",Problemy endokrinologii,https://doi.org/10.14341/probl12458; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351311/,290

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Changsha, China. PARTICIPANTS A total of 2555 college girls were recruited using multistage cluster random sampling. OUTCOME MEASURES A self-report questionnaire was used to measure sociodemographic information, characteristics of PD and self-care strategies for managing PD. Additionally, a Visual Analogue Scale was used to measure pain severity. RESULTS Of the 2555 girls, 1306 had experienced PD, representing a 51.1% prevalence. In addition, the prevalence rates of mild, moderate and severe pain in PD were 18.1%, 27.7% and 5.4%, respectively. The most common symptoms associated with PD were cramps (96.9%), weakness (70.0%), backache (65.1%), facial blemishes (55.3%) and irritability (55.3%). Commonly used self-care strategies for managing PD comprised reducing physical activity (94.6%), keeping warm (84.6%), communicating dysmenorrhea with friends or classmates (79.0%), drinking warm beverages (75.7%) and avoiding cold drinks and foods (74.2%). In addition, only 34.8% self-medicated with Western medicine (15.6%), traditional Chinese medicine (8.6%), or both (10.6%). Medical advice was sought by 27.4% of subjects from a Western medical doctor (10.3%), a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine (13.6%), or both (3.5%). Girls who had greater pain severity were more likely to be self-medicated (OR=7.01; 95% CI 4.50 to 10.91), use complementary therapies (OR=2.64; 95% CI 1.70 to 4.10) and seek medical advice (OR=5.93; 95% CI 3.80 to 9.24). CONCLUSIONS PD is highly prevalent among Chinese college girls, with a high burden of symptoms. In addition, these girls are most likely to change their lifestyle, communicate dysmenorrhea with friends or mothers, use heat therapy and engage in self-talk, but less likely to self-medicate or seek medical advice for managing PD.","Chen, Ling; Tang, Lu; Guo, Shengyu; Kaminga, Atipatsa Chiwanda; Xu, Huilan",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537555/,290

The study was conducted online, and 334 adults from 14 locations in Korea participated. Data collection was conducted from May 19 to May 24, 2020, using a questionnaire consisting of general and COVID-19-related characteristics, perceived physical health, individual and community resilience, and mental health. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, t test, one-way analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression were used. In cases where women were more vulnerable to mental health problems and gender was controlled, regression analysis showed that individual resilience (β = -0.212, p < 0.001), perceived physical health (β = -0.160, p = 0.004), and community resilience (β = -0.119, p = 0.031) had an effect on mental health. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, communities should screen groups vulnerable to mental health problems and develop an integrated mental health program that incorporates predictors of mental health difficulties.

131772,EXPRESS: The Effects of Experimentally Induced Emotions on Revising Common Vaccine Misconceptions.,2021-04-29,"OBJECTIVE The extent of the collateral circulation varies between individuals which affects morbidity and mortality. Experimental data show that collateral coherence between different organs is strain-dependent. Whether this interrelation is also present in humans is unknown. This study investigates the relation between the palmar and the coronary circulation in patients with coronary artery disease and which factors possibly influence collateral development. Approach and Results: In 50 patients with a chronic total occlusion, both the coronary collateral flow index (CFI) and the palmar CFI was measured. The correlation between both indices was determined, together with the relation to clinical variables. Mean coronary CFI was 0.51±0.16, and mean palmar CFI was 0.82±0.13. The coronary and palmar CFI were significantly correlated (ρ=0.48, P=0.001). Coronary CFI was 22% lower in low palmar CFI patients (<0.82) as compared with high palmar CFI patients (0.43±0.12 versus 0.57±0.18, P=0.03). In multivariable analysis, coronary CFI was significantly correlated with the palmar CFI and the duration of angina pectoris. Coronary CFI was inversely correlated with peripheral artery disease and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS The coronary CFI and palmar CFI are significantly correlated, implicating collateral coherence between vascular beds in humans.","Hollander, Maurits R; Jansen, Matthijs F; Schumacher, Stefan P; Stuijfzand, Wijnand J; van Leeuwen, Maarten A H; van de Ven, Peter M; Horrevoets, A J; Nap, Alex; Knaapen, Paul; van Royen, Niels","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.121.316092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730875/,290

134902,Finding Ways to Reduce Coronavirus Exposure During Dialysis.,2020-04-16,"INTRODUCTION Immunity boosting has emerged as a global strategy to fight the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic situation. In India, AYUSH systems of medicine have been promoted as an immune-protection strategy. Andrographis paniculata (Burm. F) Nees (AP) mentioned in Ayurveda has been widely used for treating sore throat, flu, and upper respiratory tract infections which may provide possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways. OBJECTIVES The present work uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics and combination synergy analysis based on network pharmacology to mine multimode evidence to understand the possible mechanism of action, diseases association, protein-protein interaction and major pathways involved therein. MATERIAL AND METHODS Metabolite profiling was performed by Agilent QTOF LC-MS/MS system. Network pharmacology analysis was performed by using functional annotation analysis based on databases like Binding DB, STRING, DAVID and KEGG for further data mining. Further combination synergy was evaluated using ""neighbourhood approach"" and networks were constructed through Cytoscape 3.2.1. RESULTS The molecules from kalmegh provides immune-protection and anti-viral response via involving different pathways, like toll-like receptor pathway, PI3/AKT pathway and MAP kinase pathways against COVID-19 infection. The KEGG analysis showed that in a vast majority of the most enriched pathways, AP were associated with viral infections and upper respiratory tract infections. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest a synergy between andrographolide and other molecules identified as safe and efficacious anti-inflammatory agent having effects on upper respiratory tract infections and can significantly decrease the production of cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors in viral infections.","Banerjee, Subhadip; Kar, Amit; Mukherjee, Pulok K; Haldar, Pallab K; Sharma, Nanaocha; Katiyar, Chandra Kant",Phytochemical analysis : PCA,https://doi.org/10.1002/pca.3011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167083/,290

Twenty-one Angus steers ( = 11) and heifers ( = 10) were housed in individual pens on d -15 and were offered free-choice water, mineral-vitamin mix, and hay until d 21. In Exp. 1, cattle were ranked on d -1 by sex and BW and assigned to 1) oral meloxicam administration (1 mg/kg BW daily) from day -1 to 6 (MEL8), 2) oral meloxicam administration (1 mg/kg BW) on d 0 and oral lactose monohydrate administration (1 mg/kg BW) on d -1 and from d 1 to 6 (MEL1), or 3) oral lactose monohydrate administration (1 mg/kg BW daily) from d -1 to 6 (CON). On d 0, cattle received an intravenous LPS bolus (0.5 μg/kg BW) concurrently with treatment administration. Rectal temperature (RTEMP) was assessed, and blood samples were collected at -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, and 144 h relative to LPS administration. No treatment effects were detected ( ≥ 0.36) for RTEMP, concentrations of serum tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), plasma haptoglobin, cortisol, insulin, and leptin, as well as blood mRNA expression of α and cyclooxygenase-2, although all variables increased ( < 0.01) across treatments after LPS administration. In Exp. 2, cattle received the same treatments that they were assigned to in Exp. 1 from d 7 to d 13 and were vaccinated against respiratory pathogens concurrently with treatment administration on d 8. Blood samples were collected, and RTEMP was assessed as in Exp. 1 in addition to 168, 240, and 336 h relative to vaccination. No treatment effects were detected ( ≥ 0.26) for RTEMP, the same plasma and serum variables evaluated in Exp. 1, and serum concentrations of antibodies against or serum titers against bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, bovine viral diarrhea virus-1, and parainfluenza-3 virus. All variables increased ( < 0.01) across treatments after vaccination, except for serum TNFα and titers against bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 ( ≥ 0.40).

136131,Modeling infectious disease dynamics in the complex landscape of global health.,2015,"BACKGROUND Given both the increased prevalence of natural disasters in recent years and the crippling opioid epidemic, identifying at-risk groups for substance abuse post-disaster is imperative to survivor mental health. The objective of this study was to examine the association between exposure to Hurricane Sandy and risk of opioid abusive behavior. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from two cross-sectional studies that examined the impact of Hurricane Sandy on mental health from October 2013- August 2016. Patient demographics, hurricane exposure and mental health history were obtained via self-report questionnaires. Opioid abuse risk was determined and categorized using adaptations from the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT). Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between hurricane exposure and opioid abuse risk. RESULTS Data was available on 1,687 Hurricane Sandy survivors, the majority being female (59.3%), white (52.0%) and an average age of 46.1 years (std. 19.2). Approximately 9.0% of survivors were classified as being 'High' risk for opioid abuse. For every increase in total exposure reported, the odds of being classified as high risk was 1.09 greater (95% CI 1.05, 1.14) compared to low risk, after adjusting for covariates. Among personal exposures only (i.e. injury to self or family member), for every increase in reported exposure the adjusted odds of being classified as high risk was 1.25 times greater (95% CI 1.15, 1.37) compared to low risk. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that exposure to a natural disaster, specifically personal exposures, are associated with increased risk for opioid abusive behavior.","McCann-Pineo, Molly; Taioli, Emanuela; Schwartz, Rebecca M",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1912098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870867/,290
136342,The State of Refractive Surgery: 2021 and Beyond.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Single-site laparoscopic surgery is a promising emerging technique with potential to decrease postoperative pain, reduce port-site complications, and improve cosmetic results. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LapGB) is a procedure that lends itself well to single-site laparoscopic surgery because the surgery is confined to a single region of the body, the need for a larger incision for port implantation and the fact that bariartric patients are more likely to be body image conscious. The procedure is, however, technically challenging and potentially more time consuming and hazardous. To simplify learning, a hybrid technique that used multiple conventional trocars and laparoscopic equipment through a single periumbilical incision while retaining the use of the Nathanson retractor via a separate epigastric incision was developed. The authors' experience and results with this technique are described. METHODS This retrospective review describes the prospectively collected data for the first 60 consecutive cases completed using the minimally invasive technique described. RESULTS The 60 cases in this study comprised 12 men and 48 women with an average age of 39 years (range 20-59 years). Their average body mass index (BMI) was 39.1 kg/m(2) (range 32-52 kg/m(2)). Four patients (6.7%) needed an additional port either for hemostasis or for access difficulties. Concomitant hiatal hernia repair was performed for 13 patients. Five patients (8.3%) had superficial wound infection requiring oral antibiotic therapy and dressings. No other complications were observed. Overall, the average operating time was 55 min (range 30-160 min). For both surgeons, the learning curve was six cases, with a significant difference in the operating times between the first six cases and the remaining cases (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS The authors' early experience with the minimally invasive LapGB technique shows that it is feasible and safe. It can be used either as a bridging technique to single-site LapGB or on its own as a minimally invasive technique.","Koh, Cherry E; Martin, David J; Cavallucci, David J; Becerril-Martinez, Guillermo; Taylor, Craig J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1259-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20953885/,290

137634,"Sclera-choroid-RPE transport of eight β-blockers in human, bovine, porcine, rabbit, and rat models.",2011,"BACKGROUND Anaemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet physiologic needs; it is caused by many conditions, particularly iron deficiency. Traditionally, daily iron supplementation has been a standard practice for preventing and treating anaemia. However, its long-term use has been limited, as it has been associated with adverse side effects such as nausea, constipation, and teeth staining. Intermittent iron supplementation has been suggested as an effective and safer alternative to daily iron supplementation for preventing and reducing anaemia at the population level, especially in areas where this condition is highly prevalent. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of intermittent oral iron supplementation, alone or in combination with other nutrients, on anaemia and its associated impairments among menstruating women, compared with no intervention, a placebo, or daily supplementation. SEARCH METHODS In February 2018, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, nine other databases, and two trials registers. In March 2018, we also searched LILACS, IBECS and IMBIOMED. In addition, we examined reference lists, and contacted authors and known experts to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were menstruating women; that is, women beyond menarche and prior to menopause who were not pregnant or lactating and did not have a known condition that impeded the presence of menstrual periods. The intervention was the use of iron supplements intermittently (one, two or three times a week on non-consecutive days) compared with placebo, no intervention, or the same supplements provided on a daily basis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Both review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies, checked data entry for accuracy, assessed the risk of bias of the included studies, and rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS We included 25 studies involving 10,996 women. Study methods were not well described in many of the included studies and thus assessing risk of bias was difficult. The main limitations of the studies were lack of blinding and high attrition. Studies were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one third of the included studies did not provide a funding source.Although quality across studies was variable, the results consistently showed that intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) compared with no intervention or a placebo, reduced the risk of having anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.87; 11 studies, 3135 participants; low-quality evidence), and improved the concentration of haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.19 g/L, 95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 15 studies, 2886 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and ferritin (MD 7.46 μg/L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 7 studies, 1067 participants; low-quality evidence). Intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 3 studies, 624 participants; low-quality evidence), but evidence was inconclusive regarding iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 1 study, 97 participants; very low-quality evidence) and all-cause morbidity (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; 1 study, 119 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women in the control group were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving intermittent iron supplements (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate-quality evidence).In comparison with daily supplementation, results showed that intermittent supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) produced similar effects to daily supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) on anaemia (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; 8 studies, 1749 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Intermittent supplementation may produce similar haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.43 g/L, 95% CI -1.44 to 2.31; 10 studies, 2127 participants; low-quality evidence) but lower ferritin concentrations on average (MD -6.07 μg/L, 95% CI -10.66 to -1.48; 4 studies, 988 participants; low-quality evidence) compared to daily supplementation. Compared to daily regimens, intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 1 study, 198 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women receiving iron supplements intermittently were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 6 studies, 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence). No studies reported on the effect of intermittent regimens versus daily regimens on iron deficiency anaemia and all-cause morbidity.Information on disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance was scarce, and evidence about the effects of intermittent supplementation on these outcomes unclear.Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings. Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria was frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Intermittent iron supplementation may reduce anaemia and may improve iron stores among menstruating women in populations with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently is probably as effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression, and adherence to the intervention. The quality of this evidence base ranged from very low to moderate quality, suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects.","Fernández-Gaxiola, Ana C; De-Regil, Luz Maria",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd009218.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699468/,290

We further sought to characterize and identify the predictors of complications that occur despite first attempt success. This was a prospective observational study of consecutive intubations performed with video laryngoscopy at an academic medical Intensive Care Unit. Operator, procedural, and complication data were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between the intubation attempts and the occurrence of one or more complications. A total of 905 patients were intubated using a video laryngoscope. First attempt success occurred in 739 (81.7 %), whereas >1 attempt was needed in 166 (18.3 %). One or more complications occurred in 146 (19.8 %) of those intubated on the first attempt versus 107 (64.5 %, p < 0.001) of those requiring more than one attempt. Logistic regression analysis shows that >1 attempt is associated with 6.4 (95 % CI 4.4-9.3) times the adjusted odds of at least one complication. Pre-intubation predictors of at least one complication despite first attempt success include vomit or edema in the airway as well as the presence of hypoxemia or hypotension. There are increased odds of complications with even a second attempt at intubation in the Intensive Care Unit. Complications occur frequently despite a successful first attempt, and as such, the goal of airway management should not be simply first attempt success, but instead first attempt success without complications.","Hypes, Cameron; Sakles, John; Joshi, Raj; Greenberg, Jeremy; Natt, Bhupinder; Malo, Josh; Bloom, John; Chopra, Harsharon; Mosier, Jarrod",Internal and emergency medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-016-1549-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27738960/,290

SUD-M(513-651) exhibits a macrodomain fold containing the nsp3 residues 528 to 648, and there is a flexibly extended N-terminal tail with the residues 513 to 527 and a C-terminal flexible tail of residues 649 to 651. As a follow-up to this initial result, we also solved the structure of a construct representing only the globular domain of residues 527 to 651 [SUD-M(527-651)]. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments showed that SUD-M(527-651) binds single-stranded poly(A) and identified the contact area with this RNA on the protein surface, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays then confirmed that SUD-M has higher affinity for purine bases than for pyrimidine bases. In a further search for clues to the function, we found that SUD-M(527-651) has the closest three-dimensional structure homology with another domain of nsp3, the ADP-ribose-1""-phosphatase nsp3b, although the two proteins share only 5% sequence identity in the homologous sequence regions. SUD-M(527-651) also shows three-dimensional structure homology with several helicases and nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins, but it does not contain the motifs of catalytic residues found in these structural homologues. The combined results from NMR screening of potential substrates and the structure-based homology studies now form a basis for more focused investigations on the role of the SARS-unique domain in viral infection.","Chatterjee, Amarnath; Johnson, Margaret A; Serrano, Pedro; Pedrini, Bill; Joseph, Jeremiah S; Neuman, Benjamin W; Saikatendu, Kumar; Buchmeier, Michael J; Kuhn, Peter; Wüthrich, Kurt",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01781-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19052085/,290

METHOD Nationally representative longitudinal data from Germany were taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (wave 5 to wave 7; n = 10,446 observations in the analytical sample). Using the three item loneliness scale (UCLA), loneliness was measured. According to the WHO thresholds, obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Asymmetric fixed effects (FE) regressions were used. RESULTS Conventional FE regression analysis revealed that changes in obesity status were associated with changes in loneliness (men: β = -.19, p < .05; women: β = .19, p < .05). Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in men the onset of obesity was associated with a decrease in loneliness (β = -.31, p < .05), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. Asymmetric FE regressions showed that in women, the onset of obesity was associated with an increase in loneliness (β = .33, p < .01), whereas the end of obesity was not associated with loneliness. CONCLUSION Findings showed that the onset of obesity has different consequences in terms of loneliness for older women and men in Germany, whereas the end of obesity was not associated with changes in loneliness scores. We recommend that future studies should distinguish between the onset and the end of obesity - which comes along with important practical implications. When older women report transitions to obesity, efforts to prevent loneliness may be of importance.","Hajek, André; König, Hans-Helmut",Aging & mental health,https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1822285; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962423/,290

SAMPLE POPULATION 95 serum samples submitted for various diagnostic assays and 20 samples from specific-pathogen-free cats tested as negative control samples. PROCEDURES The 7b gene from a virulent strain of FCoV was cloned into a protein expression vector. The resultant recombinant protein was produced and used in antibody detection assays via western blot analysis of serum samples. Results were compared with those of an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for FCoV-specific antibody and correlated with health status. RESULTS Healthy IFA-seronegative cats were seronegative for antibodies against the 7b protein. Some healthy cats with detectable FCoV-specific antibodies as determined via IFA were seronegative for antibodies against the 7b protein. Serum from cats with FIP had antibodies against the 7b protein, including cats with negative results via conventional IFA. However, some healthy cats, as well as cats with conditions other than FIP that were seropositive to FCoV via IFA, were also seropositive for the 7b protein. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Expression of the 7b protein, as indicated by detection of antibodies against the protein, was found in most FCoV-infected cats. Seropositivity for this protein was not specific for the FCoV virulent biotype or a diagnosis of FIP.","Kennedy, Melissa A; Abd-Eldaim, Mohamed; Zika, Sarah E; Mankin, Joseph M; Kania, Stephen A",American journal of veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.2460/ajvr.69.9.1179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18764691/,290

Generally causing mild clinical signs of persistent cough and nasal discharge, the virus is highly infectious and is most prevalent in rehoming shelters worldwide where dogs are often closely housed and infections endemic. As the world grapples with the current COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community is searching for a greater understanding of a novel virus infecting humans. Similar to other betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 appears to have crossed the species barrier, most likely from bats, clearly reinforcing the One Health concept. Veterinary pathologists are familiar with coronavirus infections in animals, and now more than ever this knowledge and understanding, based on many years of veterinary research, could provide valuable answers for our medical colleagues.

Although the one-on-one time duration with the mother and father increased (73.5% and 66.7%), reading books (40.6%), play (17.2%), and overall activity durations (25.7%) decreased. The median screen time increased from 1 to 3 hours. According to the families, there was a regression in development in 18.8% of children. Special education practices at home were ceased by 17.2% of families, and a significant difference was found between the groups with and without regression in development in terms of the frequency of continuing special education at home. The development of children with special needs is an ongoing urgent situation; thus, besides protecting and promoting physical health during the pandemic, families and children should also be supported for developmental needs.","Mete Yesil, Ayse; Sencan, Buse; Omercioglu, Emel; Ozmert, Elif N",Clinical pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1177/00099228211050223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636703/,290
139930,Toilet Hygiene - Review and Research Needs.,2021-04-26,"OBJECTIVES To investigate the diagnostic performance of deep transfer learning (DTL) to detect liver cirrhosis from clinical MRI. METHODS The dataset for this retrospective analysis consisted of 713 (343 female) patients who underwent liver MRI between 2017 and 2019. In total, 553 of these subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, while the remainder had no history of liver disease. T2-weighted MRI slices at the level of the caudate lobe were manually exported for DTL analysis. Data were randomly split into training, validation, and test sets (70%/15%/15%). A ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet archive was used for cirrhosis detection with and without upstream liver segmentation. Classification performance for detection of liver cirrhosis was compared to two radiologists with different levels of experience (4th-year resident, board-certified radiologist). Segmentation was performed using a U-Net architecture built on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder. Differences in classification accuracy were assessed by the χ2-test. RESULTS Dice coefficients for automatic segmentation were above 0.98 for both validation and test data. The classification accuracy of liver cirrhosis on validation (vACC) and test (tACC) data for the DTL pipeline with upstream liver segmentation (vACC = 0.99, tACC = 0.96) was significantly higher compared to the resident (vACC = 0.88, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.91, p = 0.01) and to the board-certified radiologist (vACC = 0.96, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.90, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of DTL for detecting cirrhosis based on standard T2-weighted MRI. The presented method for image-based diagnosis of liver cirrhosis demonstrated expert-level classification accuracy. KEY POINTS • A pipeline consisting of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on an extensive natural image database (ImageNet archive) enables detection of liver cirrhosis on standard T2-weighted MRI. • High classification accuracy can be achieved even without altering the pre-trained parameters of the convolutional neural networks. • Other abdominal structures apart from the liver were relevant for detection when the network was trained on unsegmented images.","Nowak, Sebastian; Mesropyan, Narine; Faron, Anton; Block, Wolfgang; Reuter, Martin; Attenberger, Ulrike I; Luetkens, Julian A; Sprinkart, Alois M",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-021-07858-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974149/,290
139995,Predicting Multivariate Responses of Sexual Dimorphism to Direct and Indirect Selection.,2020-10-01,"Importance Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains challenging to treat. Although several clinical and demographic variables have been found to predict poor antidepressant response, these markers have not been robustly replicated to warrant implementation in clinical care. Increased pretreatment rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) theta activity has been linked to better antidepressant outcomes. However, no prior study has evaluated whether this marker has incremental predictive validity over clinical and demographic measures. Objective To determine whether increased pretreatment rACC theta activity would predict symptom improvement regardless of randomization arm. Design, Setting, and Participants A multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolled outpatients without psychosis and with chronic or recurrent MDD between July 29, 2011, and December 15, 2015 (Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care [EMBARC]). Patients were consecutively recruited from 4 university hospitals: 634 patients were screened, 296 were randomized to receive sertraline hydrochloride or placebo, 266 had electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and 248 had usable EEG data. Resting EEG data were recorded at baseline and 1 week after trial onset, and rACC theta activity was extracted using source localization. Intent-to-treat analysis was conducted. Data analysis was performed from October 7, 2016, to January 19, 2018. Interventions An 8-week course of sertraline or placebo. Main Outcomes and Measures The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score (assessed at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8). Results The 248 participants (160 [64.5%] women, 88 [35.5%] men) with usable EEG data had a mean (SD) age of 36.75 (13.15) years. Higher rACC theta activity at both baseline (b = -1.05; 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.34; P = .004) and week 1 (b = -0.83; 95% CI, -1.60 to -0.06; P < .04) predicted greater depressive symptom improvement, even when controlling for clinical and demographic variables previously linked with treatment outcome. These effects were not moderated by treatment arm. The rACC theta marker, in combination with clinical and demographic variables, accounted for an estimated 39.6% of the variance in symptom change (with 8.5% of the variance uniquely attributable to the rACC theta marker). Conclusions and Relevance Increased pretreatment rACC theta activity represents a nonspecific prognostic marker of treatment outcome. This is the first study to date to demonstrate that rACC theta activity has incremental predictive validity.

This region, where hunting, butchering, and consumption of wild animal meat is frequent, represents a hotspot for disease emergence, and has experienced zoonotic disease spillover events, traced back to close human-animal contact with bats and non-human primates. Using a One Health approach, we conducted wildlife surveillance, human behavioral research, and concurrent human and animal biological sampling to identify and characterize factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. Research was conducted through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats program between 2010 and 2019 including qualitative studies of bushmeat markets, with selected study sites prioritized based on proximity to bushmeat markets. Sites included two hospitals where we conducted surveillance of individuals with syndromes of acute febrile illness, community sites where we enrolled actors of the animal value chain (ie. hunters, middlemen, transporters), and bushmeat markets, where we enrolled bushmeat vendors, butchers, market managers, cleaners, and shoppers. Mixed methods research was undertaken at these sites and included investigation of bushmeat market dynamics through observational research, focus group discussions, quantitative questionnaires, and interviews. Participants were asked about their risk perception of zoonotic disease transmission and specific activities related to bushmeat trade, local market conditions, and regulations on bushmeat trade in Cameroon. Risks associated with blood contact and animal infection were not well understood by most market actors. As bushmeat markets are an important disease interface, as seen with CoVID19, risk mitigation measures in markets and bushmeat alternative strategies are discussed.","Saylors, Karen E; Mouiche, Moctar M; Lucas, Ashley; McIver, David J; Matsida, Annie; Clary, Catherine; Maptue, Victorine T; Euren, Jason D; LeBreton, Matthew; Tamoufe, Ubald",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32992090/,290

Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared CEA to CAS in the treatment of carotid artery stenosis. These studies have suggested that CAS is more strongly associated with periprocedural stroke; however, CEA is more strongly associated with myocardial infarction. Published long-term outcomes report that CAS and CEA are similar. A reduction in complications associated with CAS has also been demonstrated over time.

A prospective multicenter observational study to investigate the interactions between ERAS program adherence and early outcomes after elective CRS was carried out. METHODS Prospective enrolment of patients submitted to elective CRS with anastomosis in 18 months. Adherence to 21 items of ERAS program was measured upon explicit criteria in every case. After univariate analysis, independent predictors of primary endpoints [major morbidity (MM) and anastomotic leakage (AL) rates] were identified through logistic regression analyses including all significant variables, presenting odds ratios (OR). RESULTS Institutional ERAS protocol was declared by 27 out of 38 (71.0%) participating centers. Median overall adherence to ERAS program items was 71.4%. Among 3830 patients included in the study, MM and AL rates were 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively. MM rates were independently influenced by intra- and/or postoperative blood transfusions (OR 7.79, 95% CI 5.46-11.10; p < 0.0001) and standard anesthesia protocol (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48-0.96; p = 0.028).

In this work authors want to share all technical aspects of 87 videobronchoscopies performed in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, from 3rd to 6th January 2020, describing the reason, the organizational and operational model and patients characteristics. Was also evaluated the impact of high-risk procedures such as bronchoscopy on the personnel involved. The disclosure of all technical details, represents, in the opinion of the authors, an important contribution, capable of providing support to all physicians engaged in bronchoscopy procedures in confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients.","Guarino, Carmine; Cesaro, Cristiano; Fiorentino, Giuseppe; Rossi, Francesco; Polverino, Benedetto Maria; Fragranza, Fiorentino; Monastra, Luca; Murino, Patrizia; Zamparelli, Enzo; La Cerra, Giuseppe",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.1744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666070/,290

METHODS Reviewed 50 articles referenced in 4 databases from 20 December 2019 to 16 September 2020. RESULTS Of the 50 articles reviewed, 26 met the criteria for analysis and were included in the study. Among them were 5 reviews, 6 case series, 7 case reports, 4 cross-sectional studies, 2 systematic reviews, 1 cohort study and 1 correspondence. We found that the prevalence of ocular manifestations in patients during the course of COVID-19 varied between 0.8% and 31.6%, depending on the study design. Symptoms of acute conjunctivitis were the most frequent clinical findings. Acute phase reactants were also correlated to ocular manifestations and the severity of the systemic disease in many reports. CONCLUSIONS Ocular manifestations are not uncommon in COVID-19 patients and have been associated with higher levels of acute phase reactants as well as a higher degree of severity of the systemic disease. We recommend that all physicians consider COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis in the presence of acute conjunctivitis with or without systemic symptoms.","Domínguez-Varela, Irving Armando; Rodríguez-Gutiérrez, Luis Alberto; Morales-Mancillas, Nallely Rubí; Barrera-Sánchez, Maximiliano; Macías-Rodríguez, Yolanda; Valdez-García, Jorge Eugenio",Infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2021.1882697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566704/,290

In pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, experiments using a variety of animal species are assumed. We have identified optimal multiple reaction monitoring transitions for signature candidate peptides of nivolumab in human, mouse, and rat plasma and developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify nivolumab (an anti-PD-1 antibody) using trastuzumab as the internal standard. Calibration curves were linear in the range of 1-200 µg/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy in human plasma fulfilled Food and Drug Administration guideline criteria for bioanalytical validation. There was no need to change the measurement method in mouse plasma. On the other hand, in rat plasma, an interference peak was observed at a retention time similar to that of the surrogate peptide ASGITFSNSGMHWVR (550.75 > 661.50) employed in human and mouse plasma. Therefore, we confirmed that ASQSVSSYLAWYQQKPGQAPR (785.0 > 940.2) can be used as an alternate nivolumab surrogate peptide in rat plasma at the same concentration range as used in human and mouse plasma. Using our method, the concentration range and a gradual increase in trough value were confirmed in clinical samples from two antibody-treated patients, including one with gastric cancer and one with non-small-cell lung cancer. The time course and blood concentration transition also were evaluated in nivolumab administration experiments in mouse and rat. The present study showed that the selection of the optimal peptide is essential for accurate LC-MS/MS measurement of nivolumab concentration in human, mouse, and rat plasma. The method developed here is expected to be of use in non-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic studies.","Ohuchi, Mayu; Yagishita, Shigehiro; Taguchi, Kazuaki; Goto, Yasushi; Fukahori, Masaru; Enoki, Yuki; Shimada, Takashi; Yamaguchi, Masakazu; Matsumoto, Kazuaki; Hamada, Akinobu","Journal of chromatography.

Phantom study.,2020-08-17,"The high-valent iron-oxo species formed in the non-heme diiron enzymes have high oxidative reactivity and catalyze difficult chemical reactions. Although the hydroxylation of inert methyl groups is an industrially promising reaction, utilizing non-heme diiron enzymes as such a biocatalyst has been difficult. Here we show a three-component monooxygenase system for the selective terminal hydroxylation of α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) into α-methyl-D-serine. It consists of the hydroxylase component, AibH1H2, and the electron transfer component. Aib hydroxylation is the initial step of Aib catabolism in Rhodococcus wratislaviensis C31-06, which has been fully elucidated through a proteome analysis. The crystal structure analysis revealed that AibH1H2 forms a heterotetramer of two amidohydrolase superfamily proteins, of which AibHm2 is a non-heme diiron protein and functions as a catalytic subunit. The Aib monooxygenase was demonstrated to be a promising biocatalyst that is suitable for bioprocesses in which the inert C-H bond in methyl groups need to be activated.","Hibi, Makoto; Fukuda, Dai; Kenchu, Chihiro; Nojiri, Masutoshi; Hara, Ryotaro; Takeuchi, Michiki; Aburaya, Shunsuke; Aoki, Wataru; Mizutani, Kimihiko; Yasohara, Yoshihiko; Ueda, Mitsuyoshi; Mikami, Bunzo; Takahashi, Satomi; Ogawa, Jun",Communications biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-020-01555-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398074/,290
143971,The burden and etiology of lower respiratory tract infections in children under five years of age in Indonesia.,2021-05-31,"BACKGROUND The balance between abdominal and perineal approaches for rectal prolapse is always the higher morbidity but better outcome in the former setting. Therefore, perineal approaches have been preferred for the treatment of full-thickness rectal prolapse (FTRP) in elderly patients. However, laparoscopic rectopexy with or without resection also may be used for elderly patients and may confer the same benefits. PURPOSE The objective of this study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of laparoscopic rectopexy compared with perineal rectosigmoidectomy for FTRP in elderly patients. METHODS Between July 2000 and June 2009, eight consecutive patients (8 women; mean age, 71 (range, 65-77) years) with FTRP underwent laparoscopic rectopexy (LAP group). During the same period, 143 patients underwent perineal rectosigmoidectomy (PRS group). A total of 123 patients were selected who underwent perineal rectosigmoidectomy (117 women; mean age, 80.7 (range, 66-98) years). RESULTS Three patients (37.5%) in the LAP group and 29 patients (23.6%) in the PRS group had undergone previous operations for rectal prolapse. The mean follow-up periods were 6.9 months and 12.8 months, respectively. In the LAP group, operative time was longer (166.5 vs. 73.5 minutes; p > 0.05) and bleeding loss was more (101.7 vs. 31.6; p < 0.05), whereas the length of hospitalization was same between the two groups (5.4 vs. 5.3 days; p > 0.05). Postoperative complications included an incisional hernia in the LAP group (12.5%) and urinary retention (4.8%), anastomotic disruption (2.4%), urinary tract infection (1.6%), and atelectasis (1.6%) in the PRS group (13.8%). Recurrences were 1 (12.5%) in the LAP group and 14 (11.4%) in the PRS group. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic rectopexy is a safe and feasible procedure in elderly patients with FTRP but results in increased operative time.","Lee, Seung-Hyun; Lakhtaria, Paryush; Canedo, Jorge; Lee, Yoon-Suk; Wexner, Steven D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-1632-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21479778/,290

OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence and clinical outcomes associated with supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) branch occlusion after deployment of PEDs for ICA aneurysms. METHODS We reviewed patients who underwent endovascular treatment with PEDs for ICA aneurysms between June 2011 and March 2013. Forty-nine patients (43 women, mean age 56.3±1.8 years, 68 aneurysms) in whom PEDs traversed the origin of supraclinoid ICA branches (ophthalmic [OA], posterior communicating [PcommA], and anterior choroidal artery [AChA]) were selected for this study. Follow-up angiograms (mean follow-up, 12.8±0.8 months) were studied to determine the location of PEDs and the patency of ICA branches. RESULTS PEDs were placed across the ostia of 49 OAs, 14 PcommAs, and 11 AChAs. Multiple PEDs were deployed in 16 patients. Rate of branch occlusion was 4% (2/49) for the OA, 7.1% (1/14) for the PcommA, and 0% for the AChA. Patients with branch occlusion did not endure new neurological deficits. ICA branch occlusion was not associated with the number of PEDs covering the ostia (P=.76) or the origin of ICA branches from the aneurysm (P=.24). CONCLUSION The incidence of major supraclinoid ICA branch occlusion after treatment with PEDs was low. These events were not associated with new neurological deficits nor were they related to the number of PEDs deployed or the origin of ICA branches from the aneurysm.","Vedantam, Aditya; Rao, Vikas Y; Shaltoni, Hashem M; Mawad, Michel E",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25549190/,290

However, only few studies researched the burnout status of healthcare professionals who care for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness. The aim of this study was to evaluate the level of burnout and related contributing personal and environment factors in healthcare professionals managing these patients. METHODS Institution-based cross-sectional study. Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey was used to evaluate burnout in professionals who specially care for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness in the neurorehabilitation department. RESULTS A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed, 121 were collected, among them 93 questionnaires could be used for further analysis. In this study, 61 participants (65.6%) showed burnout (55.2% physicians and 82.9% nurses). For the risks and Maslach Burnout Inventory scores, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were correlated with age, gender, occupation, marital status, years of practice, and education level. Reduced personal accomplishment was correlated with marital status. The variables of age (< 29 years old), occupation (nurses), marital status (unmarried), years of practice (< 5 years), and educational level (≤ Undergraduate) were associated with high levels of burnout. CONCLUSIONS Healthcare professionals who care for patients with disorders of consciousness experienced high levels of burnout. Especially those who were younger, nurse, unmarried, less practice experience or lower educational levels were more likely to experience high burnout.","Wang, Jing; Wang, Wenting; Laureys, Steven; Di, Haibo",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-020-05694-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894132/,290
145722,Understanding the US failure on coronavirus-an essay by Drew Altman.,2020-09-14,"To understand susceptibility of wild California sea lions and Northern elephant seals to influenza A virus (IAV), we developed an ex vivo respiratory explant model and used it to compare infection kinetics for multiple IAV subtypes. We first established the approach using explants from colonized rhesus macaques, a model for human IAV. Trachea, bronchi, and lungs from 11 California sea lions, 2 Northern elephant seals and 10 rhesus macaques were inoculated within 24 hours post-mortem with 6 strains representing 4 IAV subtypes. Explants from the 3 species showed similar IAV infection kinetics with peak viral titers 48-72 hours post-inoculation that increased by 2-4 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/explant relative to the inoculum. Immunohistochemistry localized IAV infection to apical epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that respiratory tissue explants from wild marine mammals support IAV infection. In the absence of the ability to perform experimental infections of marine mammals, this ex vivo culture of respiratory tissues mirrors the in vivo environment and serves as a tool to study IAV susceptibility, host-range, and tissue tropism. Importance Although influenza A virus can infect marine mammals, a dearth of marine mammal cell lines and ethical and logistical challenges prohibiting experimental infections of living marine mammals means that little is known about IAV infection kinetics in these species. We circumvented these limitations by adapting a respiratory tract explant model first to establish the approach with rhesus macaques and then for use with explants from wild marine mammals euthanized for non-respiratory medical conditions. We observed that multiple strains representing 4 IAV subtypes infected trachea, bronchi, and lungs of macaques and marine mammals with variable peak titers and kinetics. This ex vivo model can define infection dynamics for IAV in marine mammals. Further, use of explants from animals euthanized for other reasons reduces use of animals in research.","Liu, Hongwei; Plancarte, Magdalena; Ball, Erin E; Weiss, Christopher M; Gonzales-Viera, Omar; Holcomb, Karen; Ma, Zhong-Min; Allen, A Mark; Reader, J Rachel; Duignan, Pádraig J; Halaska, Barbie; Khan, Zenab; Kriti, Divya; Dutta, Jayeeta; van Bakel, Harm; Jackson, Kenneth; Pesavento, Patricia A; Boyce, Walter M; Coffey, Lark L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00403-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34037419/,290

For in-situ remediation of LEV-contaminated groundwater, there exists a main challenge of exploiting proper high efficient backfill medium in utilizing charming permeable reactive barriers (PRBs). Herein, three porous shapeable three-component hydrogen-bonded covalent organic aerogels (HCOA-1, HCOA-2 and HCOA-3) were fabricated based on a multiple-linking-site strategy to evaluate for adsorptive removal of LEV. The three HCOAs exhibited satisfactory performance in LEV adsorption that could integrate high adsorption capacity, good antiion interference, excellent recyclability and wide pH tolerance. The different regularity of kinetics and isotherms of three HCOAs signified that electrostatic effect, pore preservation, hydrogen bonding probably govern the adsorption process in combination, coupling with π-π electron-donor-acceptor (EDA), dipole-dipole and hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction besides. In addition, the response surface methodology (RSM) was employed for studying the single and synergetic effects of selected variables and optimizing operation conditions. Furthermore, a laboratory PRB column packed with processable HCOA-2 was set up to investigate the LEV removal, and the breakthrough data was explained by Adams-Bohart, Thomas, BDST and Yoon-Nelson models.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) and the occurrence and progression of VBD. METHODS Sixty (60) cases without VBD and ischemia stroke were considered as Group A, 100 cases with VBD were further divided into Group B (VBD without ischemic stroke, n = 54) and Group C (VBD with first ever acute posterior circulation ischemic stroke, n = 46). Demographic data (such as gender and age) and past medical history (such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking history) were collected. The levels of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), hypersensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), homocysteine (HCY), uric acid (UA), fibrinogen (Fib), and Lp-PLA2, etc. were measured. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the related factors of VBD and ischemic stroke secondary to VBD. RESULTS Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that only age and the level of serum Lp-PLA2 were significantly higher in group B than those in group A (P < 0.012, P < 0.001, respectively), however, only the level of serum Lp-PLA2 was significantly higher in group C than those in group B (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The serum marker Lp-PLA2 is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of VBD and the progression of VBD to posterior circulation ischemic stroke.

In May 2008-September 2014, 58 patients affected by early-stage RCC (renal cell carcinoma; T1a or T1b) were judged unsuitable for surgery and treated with percutaneous MWA. Follow-up was performed with contrast-enhanced computed tomography at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the procedure. Technical success (TS), primary technical effectiveness (PTE), secondary technical effectiveness (STE), the local tumour progression rate (LTPR), the cancer-specific survival rate (CSSR), disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and safety were recorded. All lesions were evaluated using RENAL and mRENAL scores, and complications were assessed with RENAL scores. The TS rate was 100%, PTE was 93%, STE was 100%, LTPR was 15.7% at 1 year, CSSR was 96.5%, DFS was 87.9% at 5 years, and OS was 80.6%. Mean follow-up was 25.7 months (range 3-72).

The damage and threat posed by this virus to nearly every country in the world have far exceeded those of the other six previous coronaviruses, including Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) combined. A comprehensive profile of the hematological and inflammatory biomarkers of COVID-19 is covered in this review. Significant hematological changes that have been reported in infected patients include the following biomarker candidates: lymphocyte counts (LYM), neutrophil counts (NØ), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to CD8+ T-cell ratio (N8R), eosinophil counts (EØ), platelet counts (PLT), and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR). Likewise, significant changes in soluble mediators include interleukin (IL)-2r, IL-2r to lymphocyte ratio (ILR), IL-6, interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-3), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).

148072,Conservative surgical treatment for caesarean scar pregnancy.,2014,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS To evaluate the correlation between surgical instrumentation and intraoperative surgical time, postoperative hemorrhage, and associated healthcare cost for pediatric adenotonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart analysis. METHODS Chart data were collected from pediatric patients who underwent adenotonsillectomy from 2011 to 2013. Monopolar electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation, and PlasmaBlade instruments were compared for intraoperative surgical time and postoperative hemorrhage rate. Univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and χ(2) analysis was utilized to evaluate differences between instrumentation and variables. Cost analysis examining instrumentation and intraoperative anesthesia was also reviewed. RESULTS A total of 1,280 patients who underwent adenotonsillectomy were evaluated. There was no significant overall difference in age, sex, or preoperative diagnosis identified between the three instrumentation groups. When examining the various instruments' effect on procedure time in minutes, univariate ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference overall among the three groups (F = 8.79; P < .001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons identified significantly faster surgical times for monopolar cautery than either PlasmaBlade (P = .03) or radiofrequency ablation (P < .001). The difference in the number of patients who experienced a postoperative bleed by instrument was not statistically significant (χ(2) = 2.36; P = .31). After instrumentation expenses were added to anesthesia cost, the overall average costs by instrument and surgical time were estimated to be $30.04 for monopolar cautery, $246.95 for PlasmaBlade, and $244.32 for radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSIONS The ideal surgical instrumentation should be cost and time efficient with a low complication rate. Monopolar cautery was associated with a statistically significant lower intraoperative surgical time, similar postoperative hemorrhage rates, and lower operative costs when compared to radiofrequency ablation and PlasmaBlade.

Limited data exist investigating whether same-day discharge can be successfully implemented in patients undergoing mastectomy with immediate implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR). METHODS Patients having mastectomy with IBR from 2013 to 2019 were reviewed. Enhanced recovery with same-day discharge was implemented in 2017. Patient characteristics, oncologic treatments, surgical techniques, and 90-day postoperative complications and reoperations were analyzed comparing enhanced recovery patients with historical controls. RESULTS A total of 363 patients underwent nipple-sparing (214, 59%) or skin-sparing (149, 41%) mastectomy with 1-stage (270, 74%) or tissue expander (93, 26%) IBR. Enhanced recovery was used for 151 patients, with 79 of these patients (52%) discharged same-day. Overall, enhanced recovery patients experienced a significantly lower rate of 90-day complications (21% vs 41%, P < 0.001), including hematoma (3% vs 11%, P = 0.002), mastectomy flap necrosis (7% vs 15%, P = 0.02), seroma (1% vs 9%, P < 0.001), and wound breakdown (3% vs 9%, P = 0.05). Postoperative complication rates did not significantly differ among enhanced recovery patients discharged same day. Postoperative admissions significantly decreased after enhanced recovery implementation (100% to 48%, P < 0.001), and admitted enhanced recovery patients experienced a lower length of stay (1.2 vs 1.8, P < 0.001).

148831,Effects of immune system diversity and physical variation of immunotypic mixing on the dynamics of rabies in bats.,2009,"BACKGROUND Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia. The development of resistance of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics is increasing globally due to the overuse of antibiotics. This article examines, retrospectively, the antibiotic resistance in patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa or multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa. METHODS Data from patients with community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa were collected from the hospital charts at the HELIOS Clinic, Witten/Herdecke University, Wuppertal, Germany, between January 2004 and August 2014. An antibiogram was created from all study patients with community-acquired and nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa or MDR P. aeruginosa. RESULTS A total of 168 patients with mean age 68.1 ± 12.8 (113 [67.3% males and 55 [32.7%] females) were identified; 91 (54.2%) had community-acquired and 77 (45.8%) had nosocomial-acquired pneumonia caused by P. aeruginosa. Patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial-acquired pneumonia had a mean age of 66.4 ± 13.8 vs. 70.1 ± 11.4 years [59 vs. 54 (64.8% vs. 70.1%) males and 32 vs. 23 (35.2% vs. 29.9%) females]. They included 41 (24.4%) patients with pneumonia due to MDR P. aeruginosa: 27 (65.9%) community-acquired and 14 (34.1%) nosocomial-acquired cases. P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa showed a very high resistance to fosfomycin (community-acquired vs. nosocomial-acquired) (81.0% vs. 84.2%; 0 vs. 85.7%). A similar resistance pattern was seen with ciprofloxacin (35.2% vs. 24.0%; 70.4% vs. 61.5%), levofloxacin (34.6% vs. 24.5%; 66.7% vs. 64.3%), ceftazidime (15.9% vs. 30.9; 33.3% vs. 61.5%), piperacillin (24.2% vs. 29.9%; 44.4% vs. 57.1%), imipenem (28.6% vs. 27.3%; 55.6% vs. 50.0%), piperacillin and tazobactam (23.1% vs. 28.6%; 44.4% vs. 50.0%), tobramycin (28.0% vs. 17.2%; 52.0% vs. 27.3%), gentamicin (26.4% vs. 18.2%; 44.4% vs. 21.4%), and meropenem (20.2% vs. 20.3%; 42.3% vs. 50.0%). An elevated resistance of P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa was found for cefepime (11.1% vs. 23.3%; 25.9% vs. 50.0%), and amikacin (10.2% vs. 9.1%; 27.3% vs. 9.1%). Neither pathogen was resistant to colistin (P = 0.574). CONCLUSION While P. aeruginosa and MDR P. aeruginosa were resistant to a variety of commonly used antibiotics, they were not resistant to colistin in the few isolates recovered from patients with pneumonia.","Yayan, Josef; Ghebremedhin, Beniam; Rasche, Kurt",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0139836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26430738/,290
148925,Bruce S. McEwen: the evolution of stress.,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND Understanding the relationships between physical fitness characteristics and sports injury may assist with the development of injury minimisation programs. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the association between physical fitness attributes and sports injury in female, team ball sport players. METHODS Four scientific databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus) and reference lists of relevant research were searched for eligible studies up to September 2, 2019. Full-text articles examining the relationship between physical fitness and sports injury in female, team ball sport players were included. A modified Downs and Black checklist was used to assess methodological quality. Data synthesis determined summary conclusions based on the number of significant relationships divided by the total relationships investigated and reported as a percentage. Level of certainty was identified for summary conclusions based on level of evidence. Sub-analyses regarding competition level, age, and single injury types were also conducted. RESULTS A total of 44 studies were included. Data synthesis revealed no associations (low to moderate certainty) between body composition (1/9; 11%), flexibility (18-20%), and balance (2/8; 25%) and 'any injury' classification. No associations (mostly of moderate certainty) were found between flexibility (0-27%), muscular strength (0-27%), and body composition (14-33%) and various body region injury classifications, whereas mixed summary conclusions were shown for balance (0-48%). Many associations between physical fitness and sports injury were deemed 'unknown' or with an insufficient level of certainty. Sub-analyses revealed no association between strength and noncontact ACL injuries (0/5; 0%) or ankle sprains (0/12; 0%), and between flexibility and ankle sprains (1/5; 20%); however, insufficient certainty of these results exists. Clear associations were concluded between balance and lower body injuries in female, non-elite (10/16; 63%) and junior (9/12; 75%) team ball sport players, with moderate and insufficient certainty of these results, respectively. CONCLUSION Limited evidence is available to demonstrate relationships between physical fitness and sports injury in female, team ball sport players. High-quality evidence investigating the multifactorial nature of sports injury, including the interactions physical fitness qualities have with other injury determinants, is needed to better understand the role of physical fitness in minimising sports injuries in female, team ball sport players.

148954,Optimizing conservation in species-specific agricultural landscapes.,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND Although laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is considered a technically demanding procedure with safety issues, it has been performed in several hospitals in Japan. Data from a nationwide web-based data entry system for surgical procedures (NCD) that started enrollment in 2011 are now available for analysis. METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from 32,144 patients who underwent total gastrectomy and were registered in the NCD database between January 2012 and December 2013. Mortality and morbidities were compared between patients who received LTG and those who underwent open total gastrectomy (OTG) in the propensity score-matched Stage I cohort and Stage II-IV cohort. RESULTS There was no significant difference in mortality rate between LTG and OTG in both cohorts. Operating time was significantly longer in LTG while the blood loss was smaller. In the Stage I cohort, LTG, performed in 33.6% of the patients, was associated with significantly shorter hospital stay but significantly higher incidence of readmission, reoperation, and anastomotic leakage (5.4% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.01). In the Stage II-IV cohort, LTG was performed in only 8.8% of the patients and was associated with significantly higher incidence of leakage (5.7% vs. 3.6%, p < 0.02) although the hospital stay was shorter (15 days vs. 17 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION LTG was more discreetly introduced than distal gastrectomy, but remained a technically demanding procedure as of 2013. This procedure should be performed only among the well-trained and informed laparoscopic team.","Kodera, Yasuhiro; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Kumamaru, Hiraku; Kakeji, Yoshihiro; Hiki, Naoki; Etoh, Tsuyoshi; Honda, Michitaka; Miyata, Hiroaki; Yamashita, Yuichi; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kitano, Seigo; Konno, Hiroyuki",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-018-0795-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29427039/,290

Respiratory system involvement is the most common manifestation in symptomatic patients. In this literature review, we describe the diagnosis, management, and implications of pulmonary hypertension (PH) among patients with COVID-19. We defined pulmonary hypertension as increasing mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of ≥ 25 mm Hg at rest. In our literature search, we identified 4 articles with details on pulmonary hypertension. Among these, two reported various echocardiographic details for diagnosing pulmonary hypertension. In 1 study evidence of pulmonary hypertension was noted in 13.4% of patients. Patients with severe COVID-19 were reported to have a higher proportion of pulmonary hypertension as compared to mild COVID-19 disease [22% vs 2%]. Elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was significant in predicting mortality. COVID-19 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial injury, pulmonary embolism, and prior pulmonary hypertension were at a higher risk of worsening pulmonary hypertension. Multiple mechanisms for developing pulmonary hypertension that have been postulated are i) concomitant worsening myocardial injury, ii) cytokine storm, endothelial injury, hypercoagulability attributing to development of venous thromboembolism, iii) and the presence of thrombotic microangiopathy. Among patients with severe COVID-19 disease and pulmonary hypertension, complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute myocardial injury, the requirement of intensive care unit admission, the requirement of mechanical ventilation, and mortality are higher.","Mishra, Ajay; Lal, Amos; Sahu, Kamal Kant; George, Anu Anna; Martin, Kevin; Sargent, Jennifer",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i4.10698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33525228/,290
150792,Déjà Vu - A New Coronavirus Challenge.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The WEB is an intrasaccular flow disrupter dedicated to EVT of IA. We report our initial experience in a series of patients treated with this device. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was approved by the authors' ethical committees. Nineteen patients with 20 unruptured wide-neck bifurcation IAs were treated by WEB placement. Technical issues, immediate posttreatment angiographic findings, and clinical and imaging follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months were assessed. RESULTS Failure of WEB placement occurred in 1 case because of unavailability of a suitably sized device. Embolization was successful in 18 patients with 19 IAs, and it required additional stent placement and/or coiling in 3 cases at the acute phase and in 1 case at follow-up. Two patients experienced a symptomatic complication, and 16 patients had normal neurologic examination findings at discharge. Immediate anatomic outcome showed 1 complete occlusion, 13 near-complete occlusions, and 5 incomplete occlusions. At follow-up, 17 patients had normal neurologic examination findings and 1 retained a hemiparesis. Angiographic controls were obtained in all patients (mean, 6 months), and they showed stable or improved results in all except 4 cases, including 2 complete occlusions, 15 near-complete occlusions, and 2 incomplete occlusions.

The understanding of patient's perceptions and dental services utilization can aid in modifying the pre-existing dental practices. The aim of the present study was to assess the awareness, perceptions and dental services utilization by patients visiting a tertiary care centre during COVID-19. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study on 437 patients was carried using a validated questionnaire consisting of 22 questions on three domains. Strict sterilization protocol and infection control measures were practiced to avoid any contact between the investigator and the patient. RESULTS Patients were aware of COVID -19 pandemic and were willing (76.7%) to inculcate preventive practices even post-pandemic. Concerns regarding the spread of infection (37.3%) and hygiene/cleanliness (28.6%) were most commonly reported. Patients visited the dental centre primarily for emergency management and preferred their queries being solved on the phone.

151620,Correction.,2020-03-01,"This retrospective study compares four different strategies for managing poor ovarian response (POR), namely, conventional stimulation (300 IUs) IVF-fresh embryo transfer (CONVF), mild stimulation (150 IUs) IVF-fresh embryo transfer (MILDF), mild stimulation embryo banking (MILDB), and embryo banking in natural cycles (NATB). In total, 796 POR patients were considered eligible. Statistical analysis revealed a shorter duration of stimulation and a lower required amount of gonadotropins in MILDF compared with CONVF (9.34 ± 1.17 versus 10.37 ± 1.14; 1402 ± 176 versus 3110 ± 343, P < 0.001). Comparing MILDF and MILDB, a higher number of available oocytes and embryos was observed in MILDB (2.36 ± 1.15 versus 6.58 ± 1.11; 1.72 ± 1.02 versus 3.51 ± 0.61, P < 0.001). Moreover, the MILDB presented with a lower number of required oocyte retrievals and a higher number of oocytes per oocyte retrieval compared with NATB (3.90 ± 1.56 versus 7.15 ± 1.80; 1.95 ± 0.74 versus 0.89 ± 0.20, P < 0.001). Data indicate that MILDF is equally efficient and associated with a shorter duration of stimulation and a lower required amount of gonadotropins compared with CONVF. Embryo accumulation may be more efficient compared with a fresh embryo transfer. MILDB may be a more efficient approach compared with NATB. To conclude, embryo accumulation following mild stimulation appears to form the optimal strategy for POR management. More studies are needed to verify these conclusions.","Pantou, Agni; Giannelou, Polina; Grigoriadis, Sokratis; Maziotis, Evangelos; Tzonis, Panagiotis; Koutsouni, Anastasia; Pappa, Charikleia; Philippou, Anastassios; Koutsilieris, Michael; Pantos, Konstantinos; Simopoulou, Mara; Sfakianoudis, Konstantinos",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.14614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046896/,290
152248,Real-Time In Vivo Characterization of Primary Liver Tumors With Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy During Percutaneous Needle Interventions: Feasibility Study in Woodchucks.,2015,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) often leads to persistent infection. Interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) are amplified during HCV infection but fail to eliminate virus from the liver in a large number of infected patients. We have observed previously that HCV infection induces IFN-β production in immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) as early as 24 h after infection, although virus replication is not inhibited. To gain insights on possible countermeasures of virus for the suppression of host antiviral response, the cellular transcriptional profiles of ISGs were examined after various treatments of IHH. The majority of ISGs were upregulated in IFN-treated IHH from the level for mock-treated cells. However, the comparison of ISG expression in IFN-treated IHH and IFN-pretreated, HCV genotype 2a-infected IHH indicated that virus infection suppresses the upregulation of a subset of effector molecules, including ISG56 and IFITM1. Similar results were observed for HCV-infected Huh7 cells. Subsequent study suggested that the exogenous expression of ISG56 or IFITM1 inhibits HCV replication in IHH or Huh7 cells, and the knockdown of these genes enhanced HCV replication. Further characterization revealed that the overexpression of these ISGs does not block HCV pseudotype entry into Huh7 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrated that ISG56 and IFITM1 serve as important molecules to restrict HCV infection, and they may have implications in the development of therapeutic modalities.","Raychoudhuri, Amit; Shrivastava, Shubham; Steele, Robert; Kim, Hangeun; Ray, Ranjit; Ray, Ratna B",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05633-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976647/,290

MATERIALS AND METHODS This study, approved by the respective institutional review board, included non-surgical candidates with 3 or fewer liver tumors of 3 cm or smaller, or a single lesion 5 cm or smaller. Percutaneous RFA was performed immediately after chemoembolization using DSM-MMC. Primary and secondary endpoints were the local tumor control rate, safety, and 2-year recurrence-free and overall survival rates. RESULTS This study examined 25 patients (22 males, 3 females) with 38 tumors of mean maximum diameter of 2.2 ± 0.9 cm (standard deviation) (range 1.0-4.2 cm). Their mean age was 70.2 ± 8.2 years (range 55-82 years). Local tumor progression developed in 3 tumors (7.9%, 3/38) of 3 patients (12%, 3/25) during the mean follow-up of 34.9 ± 9.2 months (range 18.3-50.1 months). The 2-year local tumor control rates were 92.0% [95% confidence interval (CI), 81.4-100%] on a patient basis and 94.6% (95% CI, 87.3-100%) on a tumor basis. The respective 2-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 88.0% (95% CI, 75.3-98.5%) and 63.3% (95% CI, 44.2-82.5%), with median survival time of 48.4 months.

153812,Injecting epidemiology into population viability analysis: avian cholera transmission dynamics at an arctic seabird colony.,2016,"Most cases of lymph node enlargement after completing tuberculosis (TB) treatment are due to paradoxical reaction (PR), not relapse, and therefore, do not require re-treatment. We herein report a case of a 28-year-old man who had developed cervical TB lymphadenitis and exhibited re-enlargement of the same lymph nodes one month after completing effective TB chemotherapy, which was microbiologically proven as relapse. The patient noticed painful cervical lymphadenopathy one month after completion of chemotherapy for TB lymphadenitis. Combination chemotherapy with multiple anti-TB drugs was resumed with suspicion of relapse. But, with his symptoms having worsened, surgical excision was performed.

153976,Suppressing the efficiency droop in the AlGaN-based UVB LED.,2021-02-10,"PURPOSE In radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it is difficult to assess the ablative margin (AM) precisely by comparing pre- and post-RFA CT images. We prospectively studied the AMs using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with pre-administered superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). SPIO is safe for kidney disease patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS Hepatocellular carcinoma patients were treated with RFA within 8 h of SPIO administration. On T2*-weighted MRI performed 4-7 days later, AM was visualized as a hypointense rim. The ablation status was classified as AM(+) if the rim completely surrounded the tumor, AM(0) if the rim was partly discontinuous without tumor protrusion, and AM(-) if the rim was partly discontinuous with tumor protrusion. The minimal thickness of AM was measured. AM(-) tumors were re-treated consecutively. RESULTS In total, 85 HCCs ablated in 76 patients were evaluated. The local recurrence rate at 3 years was 2% for AM(+) tumors and 34% for AM(0) tumors (p < 0.01). In addition, no local recurrence was seen in the tumors with an AM of ≥ 2 mm. CONCLUSION MRI with pre-administered SPIO is useful for determining the AM precisely, and an AM of ≥ 2 mm is recommended for curative RFA.

154905,What Is Anosmia?,2020-06-18,"Accessory genes occurring between the S and E genes of coronaviruses have been studied quite intensively during the last decades. In porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) the only gene at this location, ORF3, encodes a 224-residues membrane protein shown to exhibit ion channel activity and to enhance virus production. However, little is known about its intracellular trafficking nor about its function during PEDV infection. In this study, two recombinant PEDVs were rescued by targeted RNA recombination, one carrying the full-length ORF3 gene and one from which the gene had been deleted entirely. These viruses as well as a PEDV encoding a naturally truncated ORF3 protein were employed to study the ORF3 protein's subcellular trafficking. In addition, ORF3 expression vectors were constructed to study the protein's independent transport. Our results show that the ORF3 protein uses the exocytic pathway to move to and accumulate in the Golgi area of the cell, similarly in infected and transfected cells. Like the S protein, but unlike the other structural proteins M and N, the ORF3 protein was additionally observed at the surface of PEDV-infected cells. Also the C-terminally truncated ORF3 protein entered the exocytic pathway but it was unable to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Consistently, an YxxØ motif essential for ER exit was identified in the C-terminal domain. Finally, despite the use of sensitive antibodies and assays no ORF3 protein could be detected in highly purified PEDV particles, indicating that the protein is not a structural virion component.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses typically express several accessory proteins. They vary in number and nature, and only one is conserved among most of the coronaviruses, pointing at an important biological function for this protein. PEDV is peculiar in that it expresses just this one accessory protein, termed the ORF3 protein. While its analogues in other coronaviruses have been studied to different extents - indicating they share an ion channel property - little is still known about the features and functions of the PEDV ORF3 protein except for its association with virulence. Here we studied the intracellular trafficking of the ORF3 protein both in infected cells and when expressed independently. In addition, we analyzed the effects of mutations in five sorting motifs in its C-terminal domain and investigated whether the protein, found to follow the same exocytic route by which the viral structural membrane proteins travel, is also incorporated into virions.","Si, Fusheng; Chen, Bingqing; Hu, Xiaoxia; Yu, Ruisong; Dong, Shijuan; Wang, Ruiyang; Li, Zhen",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00808-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32554695/,290

Animal experiments, wherein each subject is considered to be nearly identical, can complement the limitations of epidemiological studies. Therefore, we conducted a joint analysis of previously published cancer mortality data in B6C3F1 female mice chronically and acutely irradiated with 137Cs γ rays to estimate the dose-rate effectiveness factor. In the chronically irradiated animal experiment conducted by the Institute for Environmental Sciences, mice received irradiation at dose rates of 0.05, 1.1 or 21 mGy per day for 400 days from 8 weeks of age. For the acutely irradiated animal experiment conducted by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, mice received irradiation at 35, 105, 240 or 365 days of age with 1.9, 3.8 or 5.9 Gy at a dose rate of 0.98 Gy per min. Because the preliminary analyses suggested that the risk was dependent on the age at exposure, a model was applied that considered risk differences depending on this factor. The model analysis revealed a three-fold, significantly decreased risk per Gy in mice exposed to 21 mGy per day compared to that in acutely irradiated mice. This resulted in a dose-rate effectiveness factor larger than that reported previously.","Doi, Kazutaka; Kai, Michiaki; Suzuki, Keiji; Imaoka, Tatsuhiko; Sasatani, Megumi; Tanaka, Satoshi; Yamada, Yutaka; Kakinuma, Shizuko",Radiation research,https://doi.org/10.1667/rade-19-00003.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991715/,290

Electrocautery for flap elevation can cause seromas and injure the lymph or vessels of the surrounding tissues. Positive effects of the LigaSure Small Jaw (Medtronic [formerly Covidien], Minneapolis, MN, USA) sealing device were examined. METHODS Forty-three latissimus dorsi flap breast reconstruction patients were included. Twenty-three underwent surgery with electrocautery and 21 underwent surgery with LigaSure. The seroma formation rate, total drain volume, drainage indwelling periods at the breast site and donor site, operative time, and hospital stay duration were retrospectively compared. Associations between patient characteristics and these variables were analyzed. RESULTS Seroma incidence rates were 9/23 (39.1%) and 3/21 (14.3%) for the control and experimental groups. One control group patient underwent surgical treatment; the rest underwent conservative treatment. A significant difference in latissimus dorsi flap elevation time was found between the control and experimental groups (105.6 minutes and 77.1 minutes; p = .026). A significant difference in the drainage indwelling periods of the latissimus dorsi donor site was found (13.1 days and 11 days; p = .006). Excised breast mass weight, latissimus dorsi flap weight, breast drain total volume/indwelling period, and latissimus dorsi drain volume/indwelling period showed statistically significant associations. Radiation and chemotherapy were not significantly associated with any variables. CONCLUSION The LigaSure device for latissimus dorsi flap breast reconstruction can reduce seromas, operative time, and hospital stay. It is a reliable and useful surgical sealing device that does not cause injury to the surrounding tissues.","Lee, Joon Seok; Kim, Do Gon; Lee, Jeong Woo; Choi, Kang Young; Chung, Ho Yun; Cho, Byung Chae; Yang, Jung Dug",Journal of plastic surgery and hand surgery,https://doi.org/10.1080/2000656x.2019.1612753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31062994/,290

Iloperidone antagonizes 5-HT-2a, D2, and alpha-1 receptors, which can have anti-aggressive effects. We examined iloperidone's safety and efficacy as an augmentation agent in outpatients with partially remitted major depressive disorder (MDD) with residual symptoms of anger and irritability. METHODS A total of 13 outpatients with partially remitted MDD [currently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)] received four weeks of iloperidone or placebo, followed by one week of washout. Patients were then crossed over to the other treatment arm for 4 weeks. Treatment arms were randomized and double blind; and two sites were used for the study. Analyses compared treatment response using the Symptom Questionnaire (SQ) Anger/Hostility Subscale as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS There was no significant differential effect of iloperidone × weeks on the SQ Anger/Hostility Subscore over the course of the study, compared with placebo × weeks, regardless of administration order (p = 0.77).

157033,"Comics in the Time of a Pan(dem)ic: COVID-19, Graphic Medicine, and Metaphors.",2021,"RNA interference (RNAi) is an important antiviral defense response in plants and invertebrates; however, evidences for its contribution to mammalian antiviral defense are few. In the present study, we demonstrate the anti-dengue virus role of RNAi in mammalian cells. Dengue virus infection of Huh 7 cells decreased the mRNA levels of host RNAi factors, namely, Dicer, Drosha, Ago1, and Ago2, and in corollary, silencing of these genes in virus-infected cells enhanced dengue virus replication. In addition, we observed downregulation of many known human microRNAs (miRNAs) in response to viral infection. Using reversion-of-silencing assays, we further showed that NS4B of all four dengue virus serotypes is a potent RNAi suppressor. We generated a series of deletion mutants and demonstrated that NS4B mediates RNAi suppression via its middle and C-terminal domains, namely, transmembrane domain 3 (TMD3) and TMD5. Importantly, the NS4B N-terminal region, including the signal sequence 2K, which has been implicated in interferon (IFN)-antagonistic properties, was not involved in mediating RNAi suppressor activity. Site-directed mutagenesis of conserved residues revealed that a Phe-to-Ala (F112A) mutation in the TMD3 region resulted in a significant reduction of the RNAi suppression activity. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis of the GFP-silenced line was considerably reduced by wild-type NS4B, while the F112A mutant abrogated this reduction. These results were further confirmed by in vitro dicer assays. Together, our results suggest the involvement of miRNA/RNAi pathways in dengue virus establishment and that dengue virus NS4B protein plays an important role in the modulation of the host RNAi/miRNA pathway to favor dengue virus replication.","Kakumani, Pavan Kumar; Ponia, Sanket Singh; S, Rajgokul K; Sood, Vikas; Chinnappan, Mahendran; Banerjea, Akhil C; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R; Malhotra, Pawan; Mukherjee, Sunil K; Bhatnagar, Raj K",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02774-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23741001/,290
157053,Cellulose nanocrystal research; A personal perspective.,2020-12-15,"Viral respiratory tract infections are the most common illness in humans. Infection of the respiratory viruses results in accumulation of viral replicative double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is one of the important components of infecting viruses for the induction of lung epithelial cell apoptosis and innate immune response, including the production of interferon (IFN). In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of dsRNA-induced airway epithelial cell apoptosis by IFN. We found that transcription factor Runx3 was strongly induced by type-II IFNγ, slightly by type-III IFNλ, but essentially not by type-I IFNα in airway epithelial cells. IFNγ-induced expression of Runx3 was predominantly mediated by JAK-STAT1 pathway and partially by NF-κB pathway. Interestingly, Runx3 can be synergistically induced by IFNγ with a synthetic analog of viral dsRNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) through both JAK-STAT1 and NF-κB pathways. We further found that dsRNA poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis of airway epithelial cells was mediated by dsRNA receptor toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and was markedly augmented by IFNγ through the enhanced expression of TLR3 and subsequent activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Last, we demonstrated that upregulation of Runx3 by IFNγ promoted TLR3 expression, thus amplifying the dsRNA-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells. These novel findings indicate that IFNγ promotes dsRNA-induced TLR3-dependent apoptosis via upregulation of transcription factor Runx3 in airway epithelial cells. Findings from our study may provide new insights into the regulation of airway epithelial cell apoptosis by IFNγ during viral respiratory tract infection.","Gan, Huachen; Hao, Qin; Idell, Steven; Tang, Hua",American journal of physiology.

158419,Corrigendum.,2021-07-01,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Is there a difference in the cerebral vascular response to rebreathing-induced hypercapnia between obese and lean individuals? What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding is that obese individuals have an attenuated increase in cerebral vascular conductance during hypercapnia relative to lean individuals. This finding suggests cerebral vascular dysfunction in this population, which might contribute to the greater prevalence of cerebral vascular and neurocognitive disease in this population. Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by >45%. Furthermore, obesity is a contributory factor to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms accounting for this increased disease risk have not been clarified. This study tested the hypothesis that the total range of change (a) in cerebral blood velocity (CBV) and cerebral vascular conductance (CVCI) and the maximal (y0) CBV and CVCI achieved during rebreathing-induced hypercapnia would be attenuated in obese individuals. Sixteen lean and 15 obese individuals participated. The magnitude of rebreathing-induced hypercapnia was similar between groups (lean, ∆15 ± 3 mmHg versus obese, ∆15 ± 2 mmHg; P = 0.82). The total range of change in CBV during rebreathing (a; expressed as a percentage) was similar between groups (lean, 91 ± 24% versus obese, 76 ± 19%, P = 0.07), whereas the total range of change in CVCI during rebreathing (a; expressed as a percentage) was attenuated in the obese individuals (lean, 71 ± 20% versus obese, 51 ± 15%, P < 0.01). Likewise, the maximal increase in CBV during rebreathing (y0; expressed as a percentage) was similar between groups (lean, 189 ± 22% versus obese, 179 ± 20%, P = 0.20), whereas the maximal increase in CVCI during rebreathing (y0; expressed as a percentage) was attenuated in the obese individuals (lean, 172 ± 19% versus obese, 155 ± 17 %, P = 0.01). These data indicate that the cerebral vascular response to rebreathing-induced hypercapnia is attenuated in obese individuals. This impairment might be a factor contributing to the elevated cerebral vascular and neurocognitive disease risk in this population.","Hurr, Chansol; Patik, Jordan C; Kim, KiYoung; Brothers, R Matthew",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep086446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28730593/,290

Physiological increase in endothelial or vascular permeability is transient, transpired by post-tissue injury during the initial phases of healing, whereas pathological permeability is persistent commonly witnessed in conditions such as atherosclerosis, chronic inflammation, tumor growth, and diabetic retinopathy. The in vivo or in situ use of animal models in the assessment of permeability not only raises inevitable ethical concerns but also confers difficulty to apply to high-throughput screening. Therefore, there is an ever-increasing dependency on in vitro studies to assess drug permeability, and various research programs have suffered to develop appropriate in vitro assays for measurement and prediction. In vitro models that both mimic in vivo microvascular endothelium and can be utilized to record changes in endothelial permeability are vital in delineating the mechanisms involved in the prevention and treatment of disorders related to vascular permeability. The Transwell® and the electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) assays are extensively used to assess the trans-endothelial permeability of solutes such as albumin, dextrans, and sucrose across endothelial monolayers and based on electrical resistance, etc. These models have several advantages such as the ease to perform and avoid the complexities of using a live animal.","Adil, Mir S; Somanath, Payaningal R",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/7651_2020_309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691355/,290

METHODS In an international clinical trial, we randomly assigned patients with very severe ARDS, as indicated by one of three criteria - a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 50 mm Hg for more than 3 hours; a Pao2:Fio2 of less than 80 mm Hg for more than 6 hours; or an arterial blood pH of less than 7.25 with a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide of at least 60 mm Hg for more than 6 hours - to receive immediate venovenous ECMO (ECMO group) or continued conventional treatment (control group). Crossover to ECMO was possible for patients in the control group who had refractory hypoxemia. The primary end point was mortality at 60 days. RESULTS At 60 days, 44 of 124 patients (35%) in the ECMO group and 57 of 125 (46%) in the control group had died (relative risk, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 1.04; P=0.09). Crossover to ECMO occurred a mean (±SD) of 6.5±9.7 days after randomization in 35 patients (28%) in the control group, with 20 of these patients (57%) dying. The frequency of complications did not differ significantly between groups, except that there were more bleeding events leading to transfusion in the ECMO group than in the control group (in 46% vs. 28% of patients; absolute risk difference, 18 percentage points; 95% CI, 6 to 30) as well as more cases of severe thrombocytopenia (in 27% vs. 16%; absolute risk difference, 11 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 21) and fewer cases of ischemic stroke (in no patients vs. 5%; absolute risk difference, -5 percentage points; 95% CI, -10 to -2). CONCLUSIONS Among patients with very severe ARDS, 60-day mortality was not significantly lower with ECMO than with a strategy of conventional mechanical ventilation that included ECMO as rescue therapy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated virtual care delivery at an unprecedented pace and scale. We conducted a scoping review to create an interactive Evidence and Gap Map (EGM) of virtual care solutions across a stepped care continuum (i.e., from self-directed to specialist care) for youth with chronic pain and their families. Review methodology was co-designed with 8 youth with chronic pain and 7 parents/caregivers. Data sources included peer-reviewed scientific literature, grey literature (app stores, websites), and a call for innovations. Records were independently coded and assessed for quality. Overall, 185 records were included (105 scientific records, 56 apps, 16 websites, and 8 innovations). Most virtual care solutions were applicable across pediatric chronic pain diagnoses, with the greatest proportion at lower levels of stepped care (i.e., >100 self-guided apps and websites). Virtual delivery of psychological strategies was common. Evidence gaps were noted at higher levels of stepped care (i.e., requiring more resource and health professional involvement), integration with health records, communication with health professionals, web accessibility, and content addressing social/family support, medications, school, substance use, sleep, diet, and acute pain flares or crises. EGMs are a novel visual knowledge synthesis tool that enable rapid evidence-informed decision-making by patients and families, health professionals, and policymakers. This EGM identified high quality virtual care solutions for immediate scale and spread, and areas with no evidence in need of prioritization. Virtual care should address priorities identified by youth with chronic pain and their families.","Birnie, Kathryn A; Pavlova, Maria; Neville, Alexandra; Noel, Melanie; Jordan, Isabel; Jordan, Evie; Marianayagam, Justina; Stinson, Jennifer; Lorenzetti, Diane L; Faulkner, Violeta; Killackey, Tieghan; Campbell, Fiona; Lalloo, Chitra",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002339; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34050111/,290

160250,Phenolic content of grapevine leaves (Vitis labrusca var. Bordo) and its neuroprotective effect against peroxide damage.,2010,"Streptococcus suis is an important zoonotic pathogen, which can infect humans and pigs worldwide, posing a potential risk to global public health. Suilysin, a pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin, is considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of S. suis infections. It is known that infection with influenza A viruses may favor the susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection resulting in more severe disease and increased mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these co-infections are incompletely understood. Applying highly differentiated primary porcine respiratory epithelial cells grown under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, we analyzed the contribution of swine influenza viruses (SIV) to the virulence of S. suis with a special focus on its cytolytic toxin suilysin. We found that during secondary bacterial infection, suilysin of S. suis contributes to the damage of well-differentiated respiratory epithelial cells in the early stage of infection, whereas cytotoxic effects induced by SIV became prominent at later stages of infection. Prior infection by SIV enhanced the adherence to and colonization of porcine airway epithelial cells by the wildtype S. suis strain (wt) and a suilysin-negative S. suis mutant in a sialic-acid dependent manner. A striking difference was observed with respect to bacterial invasion. After bacterial mono-infection, only wt S. suis showed an invasive phenotype whereas the mutant remained adherent. When the epithelial cells were pre-infected with SIV, also the suilysin-negative mutant showed invasion capacity. Therefore, we propose that co-infection with SIV may compensate for the lack of suilysin in the adherence and invasion process of suilysin-negative S. suis.","Meng, Fandan; Tong, Jie; Vötsch, Désirée; Peng, Ju-Yi; Cai, Xuehui; Willenborg, Maren; Herrler, Georg; Wu, Naihuei; Valentin-Weigand, Peter",Infection and immunity,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.00350-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138613/,290

161989,Is regulation preventing the development of therapeutics that may prevent future coronavirus pandemics?,2018,"Background Microwave ablation of lung nodules may provide a faster, larger and more predictable ablation zone than other energy sources, while bronchoscopic transbronchial ablation has theoretical advantage of fewer pleural-based complications than percutaneous approach. Our study aims to determine whether the novel combination of bronchoscopic approach and microwave ablation in management of lung nodules is technically feasible, safe and effective. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of a single center experience in electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy microwave ablation in hybrid operating room. Patients had high surgical risks while lung nodules were either proven malignant or radiologically suspicious. Primary endpoints include technical feasibility and safety. Results Total of 30 lung nodules from 25 patients were treated. Mean nodule size was 15.1 mm, and bronchus directly leads to the nodules (bronchus sign positive) in only half of them. Technical success rate was 100%, although some nodules required double ablation for adequate coverage. Mean minimal ablation margin was 5.51 mm. The mean actual ablation zone volume was -21.4% compared to predicted, likely due to significant tissue contraction ranging from 0-43%. There was no significant heat sink effect. Mean hospital stay was 1.73 days, and only 1 patient stayed for more than 3 days. Complications included pain (13.3%), pneumothorax requiring drainage (6.67%), post-ablation reaction (6.67%), pleural effusion (3.33%) and hemoptysis (3.33%). After median follow up of 12 months, none of the nodules had evidence of progression. Conclusions Bronchoscopic transbronchial microwave ablation is safe and feasible for treatment of malignant lung nodules. Prospective study on clinical application of this novel technique is warranted.","Chan, Joyce W Y; Lau, Rainbow W H; Ngai, Jenny C L; Tsoi, Carita; Chu, Cheuk Man; Mok, Tony S K; Ng, Calvin S H",Translational lung cancer research,https://doi.org/10.21037/tlcr-20-1231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012778/,290

Aside from a few papers focusing on HIV, the considerable progress in dose-finding methodology of the last 25 years has focused almost entirely on oncology. While adverse reactions to cytotoxic drugs may be life threatening, for anti-viral agents we anticipate something different: side effects that provoke the cessation of treatment. This would correspond to treatment failure. On the other hand, success would not be yes/no but would correspond to a range of responses, from small, no more than say 20% reduction in viral load to the complete elimination of the virus. Less than total success matters since this may allow the patient to achieve immune-mediated clearance. The motivation for this article is an upcoming dose-finding trial in chronic norovirus infection. We propose a novel methodology whose goal is twofold: first, to identify the dose that provides the most favorable distribution of treatment outcomes, and, second, to do this in a way that maximizes the treatment benefit for the patients included in the study.","Dehbi, Hakim-Moulay; Lowe, David M; O'Quigley, John",Statistics in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33053601/,290

In response to this, the Spanish government enacted a strict lockdown in late March 2020, that was gradually eased until June 2020. We explored differentials in mobility by area-level deprivation in the functional area of Madrid, before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown. We used cell phone-derived mobility indicators (% of the population leaving their area) from the National Institute of Statistics (INE), and a composite measure of deprivation from the Spanish Society of Epidemiology (SEE). We computed changes in mobility with respect to pre-pandemic levels, and explored spatial patterns and associations with deprivation. We found that levels of mobility before COVID-19 were slightly higher in areas with lower deprivation. The economic hibernation period resulted in very strong declines in mobility, most acutely in low deprivation areas. These differences weakened during the re-opening, and levels of mobility were similar by deprivation once the lockdown was completely lifted. Given the existence of important socioeconomic differentials in COVID-19 exposure, it is key to ensure that these interventions do not widen existing social inequalities.","Glodeanu, Adrián; Gullón, Pedro; Bilal, Usama",Health & place,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2021.102580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022543/,290

We fit Poisson regression and random forest models (RF) to 26 years of weekly ARD incidence data to explore the impact of the adenovirus vaccine and BPG prophylaxis on respiratory disease burden. Adenovirus vaccine availability was among the most important predictors of ARD in the RF, while BPG was the ninth most important. BPG was a significant protective factor against ARD (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67-0.70), but less so than either the old or new adenovirus vaccine (IRR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.38-0.39 and IRR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.11-0.11), respectively. These results suggest that BPG is moderately predictive of, and significantly protective against ARD, though to a lesser extent than either the old or new adenovirus vaccine.","Ball, Jacob D; Prosperi, Mattia A; Brown, Alfonza; Chen, Xinguang; Kenah, Eben; Yang, Yang; Cummings, Derek A T; Rivers, Caitlin M",Epidemiology and infection,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268818001838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974837/,290

Specific, rapid, and simple multiplex detection of these viruses is critical to enable prompt implementation of appropriate control measures. Conventional methods for molecular diagnosis require skilled personnel and relatively sophisticated equipment, restricting their use in centralized laboratories. We developed a low-cost, rapid, semi-quantitative, field deployable, 3D-printed microfluidic device for auto-distribution of samples and self-sealing and real-time and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), enabling the co-detection of PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV within 30 minutes. Our assay's analytical performance is comparable with a benchtop, real-time RT-LAMP assay and the gold standard quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay with limits of detection of 10 genomic copies per reaction for PEDV and PDCoV, and 100 genomic copies per reaction for TGEV. Evaluation of clinical specimens from diseased pigs with our microfluidic device revealed excellent concordance with both benchtop RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. Our portable RT-LAMP microfluidic chip will potentially facilitate simple, specific, rapid multiplexed detection of harmful infections in minimally equipped veterinary diagnostic laboratories and on-site in pigs' farms.","El-Tholoth, Mohamed; Bai, Huiwen; Mauk, Michael G; Saif, Linda; Bau, Haim H",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc01229g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527920/,290

Although the pharmacological properties of GAs have long been known, attention to them has greatly increased in recent times due to their cytotoxic activity. AREAS COVERED This review represents the patents granted about natural and synthetic glycyrrhetinic acid analogs from January 2010 to December 2017, the advances made by research groups in conjunction with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery of new natural or synthetic glycyrrhetinic acid analogs. EXPERT OPINION GAs demonstrate excellent cytotoxic, antimicrobial, enzyme inhibitory, antiinflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and antiviral effects. It is interesting to note that the C-3(OH) and C30-CO2H functional groups make GAs very attractive lead structures for medicinal scientists since these functionalities allow the generation of further chemical diversity for improved pharmacological effects. Moreover, various GA analogues have been prepared via modification of the C30-CO2H. It is noteworthy that the C-30 amide of GA demonstrated better cytotoxic effects compared to the parent compounds. In addition, GAs have the capability to conjugate with other anticancer drugs or be converted into their halo or amino analogs which is expected to stimulate medicinal chemist to synthesize new lead compounds in cancer drug discovery.","Hussain, Hidayat; Green, Ivan R; Shamraiz, Umair; Saleem, Muhammad; Badshah, Amin; Abbas, Ghulam; Rehman, Najeeb Ur; Irshad, Muhammad",Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,https://doi.org/10.1080/13543776.2018.1455828; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29558289/,290
163006,Enabling a Paradigm Shift in CryoEM Sample Preparation with chameleon,2021,"The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 lead to the most challenging pandemic in this century, posing major economic and health challenges worldwide. Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SASR-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitates the development of novel broad-spectrum host-directed therapeutics. Here, employing genome-scale CRISPR screens, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. These screens identified known and novel host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, the host metabolic pathways pertaining to mitochondrial activity as well as phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis processes appeared to have major anti-viral functions. Comparative analysis between the different VOCs revealed the receptor KREMEN2 as unique gene required only to the Alpha variant, providing a possible explanation for the increased infectivity of this variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential pro-viral gene for all variants inspected. We reveal that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and is accordingly, critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed an elevated level of GATA6, indicating the important role GATA6 may be playing in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 results in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 represents a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Israeli, Ma’ayan; Finkel, Yaara; Israeli, Ofir; Beth-Din, Adi; Cohen-Gihon, Inbar; Yahalom-Rone, Yfat; Paran, Nir; Israely, Tomer; Chitlaru, Theodor; Elia, Uri; Cohen, Ofer; Nemet, Ital; Kliker, Limor; Mandelboim, Michal; Stern-Ginossar, Noam; Bercovich-Kinori, Adi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.19.452809,290

Design/methodology/approach: Patient safety culture was assessed with the Chinese version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to validate the structure of the data (i.e. reliability and validity), and Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to identify relationships between safety-related dimensions. Findings: Safety climate was strongly associated with working conditions and teamwork climate. In addition, working conditions was highly correlated with perceptions of management and job satisfaction, respectively. It is worth noting that the stress and emotional exhaustion of the physicians and nurses during this epidemic were high and needed attention. Practical implications: For healthcare managers and practitioners, team-building activities, power of public opinions, IoT-focused service, and Employee Assistance Programs are important implications for inspiring the patient safety-oriented culture during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We chose children with initial wheezing before 3 years of age who were hospitalized for medical treatment. Wheezing frequency was determined by follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Information such as birth status, age, sex, preterm, mode of delivery, birth order, eczema history, personal allergy history, family allergy history, passive smoking, and place of residence (urban/rural) was collected. Total serum IgE level, serum allergen testing, routine blood tests, C-reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, respiratory pathogens tests, sputum culture, chest radiography or computed tomography were performed in all patients. The correlation between each factor and wheezing recurrence was evaluated. A total of 259 children were included in the study. They were divided into single recurrence, multiple recurrences, and no recurrence groups. The recurrence rate of wheezing was 56.8% (30.5% had a single recurrence and 26.3% had 2 or more recurrences). The percentage of children with a personal allergy history in the multiple recurrences group was significantly higher than in the single recurrence and no recurrence groups (P = 0.031 and 0.008, respectively). The age of the children in the multiple recurrences group was significantly lower than that in the single recurrence group (P < 0.001).

This paper attempts to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the future size, composition and distribution of Australia’s population by projecting a range of scenarios. Drawing on the academic literature, historical data and informed by expert judgement, four scenarios representing possible future courses of economic and demographic recovery. Results suggest that Australia’s population could be 6 per cent lower by 2040 in a Longer scenario than in the No Pandemic scenario, primarily due to a huge reduction in international migration. Impacts on population ageing will be less severe, leading to a one percentage point increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2040. Differential impacts will be felt across Australian States and Territories, with the biggest absolute and relative reductions in growth occurring in the most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales. Given the ongoing nature of the crisis at the time of writing, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the plausibility of the proposed scenarios.

165461,Low-cost measurement of facemask efficacy for filtering expelled droplets during speech,2020-06-22,"A major challenge for neuropsychological research arises from the fact that we are dealing with a limited resource: The patients. Not only is it difficult to identify and recruit these individuals, but their ability to participate in research projects can be limited by their medical condition. As such, sample sizes are small and considerable time (e.g., 2 yrs) is required to complete a study. To address limitations inherent to lab-based neuropsychological research, we developed a protocol for online neuropsychological testing (PONT). We describe the implementation of PONT and provide the required information and materials for recruiting participants, conducting remote neurological evaluations, and testing patients in an automated, self-administered manner. The protocol can be easily tailored to target a broad range of patient groups, especially those that can be contacted via support groups or multi-site collaborations. To highlight the operation of PONT and describe some of the unique challenges that arise in on-line neuropsychological research, we summarize our experience using PONT in a research program involving individuals with Parkinsons disease and spinocerebellar ataxia. In a 10-month period, by contacting 646 support group coordinators, we were able to assemble a participant pool with over 100 patients in each group from across the United States. Moreover, we completed six experiments (n>300) exploring their performance on a range of tasks examining motor and cognitive abilities. The efficiency of PONT in terms of data collection, combined with the convenience it offers the participants, promises a new approach that can increase the impact of neuropsychological research.","Saban, W.; Ivry, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.27.21257953v1?rss=1,290

In doing so, the manuscript attends to the ways in which human rights are constituted amidst labor and communicative rights, constituting the backdrop against which the pandemic outbreaks take place and the pandemic response is negotiated. Design/methodology/approach - The study is part of a long-term culture-centered ethnography conducted with low-wage migrant workers in Singapore, seeking to build communicative infrastructures for rights-based advocacy and interventions. Findings - The findings articulate the ways in which the outbreaks in dormitories housing low-wage migrant workers are constituted amidst structural contexts of organizing migrant work in Singapore. These structural contexts of extreme neoliberalism work catalyze capitalist accumulation through the exploitation of lowwage migrant workers. The poor living conditions that constitute the outbreak are situated in relationship to the absence of labor and communicative rights in Singapore. The absence of communicative rights and dignity to livelihood constitutes the context within which the COVID-19 outbreak emerges and the ways in which it is negotiated among low-wage migrant workers in Singapore. Originality/value - This manuscript foregrounds the interplays of labor and communicative rights in the context of the health experiences of low-wage migrant workers amidst the pandemic. Even as COVID-19 has made visible the deeply unequal societies we inhabit, the manuscript suggests the relevance of turning to communicative rights as the basis for addressing these inequalities. It contributes to the extant literature on the culture-centered approach by depicting the ways in which a pandemic as a health crisis exacerbates the challenges to health and well-being among precarious workers.","Dutta, M.

COVID Tracker app used in the Republic of Ireland was praised in general for the way it addressed privacy and was used as baseline for other contact tracing apps worldwide. The success of the app is dependent on the general public uptake, hence their voice and attitude is the one that really matters. This paper focuses on developing a survey and the methods aiming to examine the attitudes toward privacy during COVID-19 of the general public in the Republic of Ireland and their impact on the uptake of the COVID tracker app. Various privacy models are used and health belief model as well in this purpose. A pilot study with 286 participants show a change in attitude towards privacy during COVID-19 pandemic, with more people willing to share their data in the interest of saving lives. However, privacy attitudes are shown to have impacted the adoption of the app in Ireland. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Xie, G.; Lohar, P.; Florea, C.; Bendechache, M.; Trestian, R.; Brennan, R.; Connolly, R.; Tal, I.","16th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, ARES 2021",https://doi.org/10.1145/3465481.3470096,290

Additive manufacturing is in great demand because the products made by this technology require minimal post-processing, that too in the case of applications requiring high finishing. 3D printing is capable of producing complex shapes, as the technology uses layer by layer processing. Initially, the technology was developed to make the physical prototypes rapidly for an approximation of the real product, but now the real products are made using various 3D printing techniques which are classified according to the powder, solid, and liquid-based forms. The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, from the Hubei province of China, has challenged the pharmaceutical and related medical industries with the need arising for the various medical equipment and gadgets protecting the spread of the virus. Researchers from around the world suggested various solutions for tackling the problem, introducing new products that required instant manufacturing. 3D printing is a reliable technology that succored many research groups and industries to develop and produce the products which were proved to be vital in these hard times. The chapter talks about the various success stories of the researchers who fabricated various products using 3D printing technology to tackle the complications of the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Singh, H.; Bhattacharjee, S.; Bawa, P.",Lecture Notes in Bioengineering,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-33-6703-6_11,290

Due to the limited number of sleep medicine studies, most people were unaware and just ignored their sleep problems. The use of polysomnography (PSG) in sleep medicine is quite popular, but due to its disturbance towards the subjects, it may decrease the subjects' sleep quality and may affect the result accuracy since it needs to be attached to the subjects' body. This work proposed a smart alarm based on the sleep cycle using speech analysis that uses a non-contact device, which is an undirected microphone of the Google AIY Voice Kit with Raspberry Pi. The microphone will be used to record the subjects' sleep sounds and detect the subjects' sleep cycle. The system will trigger a speaker attached to the Google Voice Kit to produce a sound to wake up the subject when they complete a particular sleep cycle according to their preference. Results showed that the system could detect sounds when subjects were sleeping and show a subject's sleep pattern. Whenever the subject past specific minutes, the sound amplitude is increased by 3 dB. These results indicate that subject is likely having their REM stages, and after 10 minutes, the subject will complete a sleep cycle. © 2021 IEEE.","Anwar, Z.; Gunawan, T.

Design/methodology/approach: The author employs the events study methodology to examine this phenomenon. A sample of 49 listed cargo shipping companies in the container, dry bulk and tanker sub-sectors from Asia, North America, and Europe was selected and their daily closing stock prices from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2020 were utilized. Findings: The results reveal that there was an overall negative overreaction to the announcement by World Health Organization (WHO) that declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The approvals of USD 857 billion stimulus package by the European Union (EU) and Pfizer vaccine by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in USA received slight positive reactions. The Greek, Singaporean and Taiwanese shipping stocks were the least affected stocks as their respective shipping industries remained resilient during 2020. Research limitations/implications: This study provides evidence to confirm the fact that COVID-19 has affected stock markets;however the impact is un parallel among cargo shipping stocks of different countries. Originality/value: The majority of studies have conducted country level analyses of the COVID-19 and stock market performance phenomenon. However, there have been sectoral disparities in terms of their susceptibility to economic shocks from COVID-19. This study's focal point is on the cargo shipping sector which synonymous with other sectors has not been immune to the current pandemic.

167479,Post-correlation on-lamella cryo-CLEM reveals the membrane architecture of lamellar bodies,2020-08-14,"Intravenous (IV) ascorbic acid (AA) improves organ function and reduces inflammation in sepsis, an inflammatory state similar to the post-hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) milieu. This salutary effect is mediated by antioxidant activity as well transcriptional modulation by AA. HCT recipients are deficient in AA, therefore we evaluated the safety and efficacy of patients receiving parenteral AA after myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic HCT compared to similarly treated historical controls who did not receive AA. Methods: Patients with hematologic malignancies, AML (48% of patients), ALL (28%), and CML+MDS (25%) were enrolled in an IRB approved prospective phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03613727). IV AA 50 mg/kg/d divided in 3 doses was given on days 1-14 after HCT, followed by oral AA 500 mg bid from day 15 until 6 months post HCT (FDA-IND 138924). Conditioning regimens utilized included;fludarabine & melphalan (45%), cyclophosphamide with either busulfan (30%) or total body irradiation (25%). GVHD prophylaxis included calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate or cellcept along with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Primary endpoint was reduction in TRM at 1 year. Propensity score matching was used for matching study patients with similarly treated historical controls, matching for diagnosis, conditioning regimen, and CIBMTR disease risk category for comparison of clinical outcomes. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) between the time-to-event outcomes and study group, adjusted for patient age, donor type, stem cell source, diagnosis, conditioning regimen, and CIBMTR disease risk. Results of an interim analysis following a period of COVID 19 mandated suspension of study accrual are reported. Results: As of March 2020, 40 patients have received IV AA: these include HLA-matched related donor (MRD;n=11), and either 10/10 or 9/10 HLA- matched unrelated donor (MUD;n=22 & 7 respectively) recipients. Graft source was either peripheral blood (n=38) or bone marrow (n=2);88% patients had CIBMTR high risk disease. Median age was 55 years;males (19). All patients enrolled were deficient in AA at day 0, median AA level 0.3 mg/dL (range: 0.1-0.5);post AA infusion level was normal at 1.6 (1.2-5.7) on day 14. Median neutrophil and platelet recovery was by 12 days (range: 9-15 & 8-21 days respectively) with sustained donor engraftment. Median absolute CD3+ cell count at day 30 was 330 cells/microL. With a median follow up of 220 days in AA recipients, no statistically significant difference was observed in transplant related mortality between propensity matched historical controls and study patients (AHR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.5;p-value = 0.27);univariate survival analysis is depicted in Figure 1. Relapse was also similar (AHR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.3-4.5;p-value = 0.82), and despite a larger number of HLA mismatched unrelated donor recipients, acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) rates were similar in the two groups for both grade II-IV (AHR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-1.7;p-value = 0.65) and grade III-IV disease (AHR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.6;p-value = 0.32). Chronic GVHD rates were also similar (AHR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1-2.7;p-value = 0.74). There are no attributable grade 3 - 4 toxicities from AA;CMV and EBV reactivation rates were not different in the two groups. Conclusions: In patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT the administration of IV ascorbic acid is safe and does not negatively impact myeloid engraftment or immune reconstitution. In this interim analysis, transplant related mortality, relapse and GVHD are not increased in IV AA recipients compared to historical controls. Thus, given its safety and tolerability, and possible salutary impact on survival and relapse in these high-risk patients, we posit the feasibility of a randomized phase 3 trial with IV AA in the post-transplant setting to determine its effect on relapse and TRM.

The definition of Problematic Internet Use (PIU) refers to new behavioural patterns that can potentially affect in variable degree, from mild to extremely severe, both individual and social wellbeing. PIU is strongly increasing in people affected by different forms of mental disorders and personality disorders, often inducing substantial changes in their clinical phenomenology, with consequent emergence of new symptom and course profiles. On the other side, PIU represents itself with growing frequency as a factor with high potential of inducing progressive psychological and behavioural impairment, with possible negative outcome on personal and psychosocial wellbeing and adjustment, also potentially leading to the development of new specific forms of psychopathology. Among PIU patterns, Internet Addiction (IA) plays a central role, due to its wide diffusion and behavioural as well as interpersonal and social consequences. The worldwide COVID 19 epidemics induced limitations in direct social relationships, such as social distancing, appear to lead to changes of patterns of IA, for an increase of time spent in addictive behaviour and a further reduction of research of interpersonal contacts. Obsessive-compulsive and autistic-like behaviour are differently reinforced by the combined effect of compulsory self distancing and general health concern, but also possibly induced in previously not affected subjects. Anxiety and mood reactivity also contributes to maladjustment profiles.

167980,Transmission of one predicts another: Apathogenic proxies for transmission dynamics of a fatal virus,2021-01-19,"Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups (20 groups of 46-91 animals). We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P=0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P=0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.","Brajon, Sophie; Ahloy-Dallaire, Jamie; Devillers, Nicolas; Guay, Frédéric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.16.423029,290

A total of 822 matched questionnaires obtained from frontline employees of service firms provided useable data for hypothesis tests. A moderated mediation approach was employed to analyse the data.FindingsResults are as follows: (1) Deprivation sensitivity, joyous exploration and social curiosity have positive effects on knowledge collecting (KC) and knowledge donating (KD). (2) KD mediates the relationships between the three curiosity traits and service creativity. (3) Task autonomy enhances and suppresses the mediating effects of KC and KD, respectively, on the curiosity–service creativity relationship.Research limitations/implicationsThis study has two main research implications: First, as different types (traits) of employee curiosity have different effects on service creativity, a single-dimensional view of employee curiosity may mask the differences of individual dimension and lead to a oversimplified conclusion.

With nurses also becoming infected, the number of trained professionals who can perform tasks such as testing of patients along with providing care involving hooking up patients to ventilators continues to decrease as well. There is a need to explore the adoption of virtual computer-based training mediums which will enable new nurses and others to be trained in safe and efficient procedures involving patients during this pandemic period. In this paper, the design of a VR-based simulator based on Human-Centered Computing (HCC) principles are discussed. The role of HCC factors such as affordance and cognitive load on the comprehension and scene understanding of nurses during training and the acquisition of knowledge of safety procedures and detailed steps (pertaining to nasal sample collection and use of ventilators on patients) has been studied with the involvement of nurse and nurse trainee participants. Adoption of a participatory design approach involving experts (nurses, doctors involved in covid-19 testing and treatment) has provided a foundational basis for the design of the training environments and assessment activities. Formal information-centric process models of the nasal swabbing procedures and ventilator hookup tasks were created using the engineering Enterprise Modeling Language (eEML). The preliminary results from the assessment activities indicate the positive impact of such HCC based 3D simulators in such training of first responders. © 2021 IEEE.","Cecil, J.; Kauffman, S.; Gupta, A.; McKinney, V.; Miguel Pirela-Cruz, M.

Home lateral flow immune-antibody testing devices offer a very convenient way of doing this, but relatively little is known about how measurement and antibody variability will affect consistency in results over time. We examined consistency by looking at the outcome of two tests three months apart while COVID-19 infection rates were low (summer 2020 in the UK). Methods The KCL-Coronavirus Health and Experiences in Colleagues at King's is an occupational cohort of staff and postgraduate research students. Lateral flow immune-antibody testing kits were sent to participant's homes in late June 2020 and late September 2020. Participants also completed regular surveys that included asking about COVID-19 symptoms and whether they thought they had been infected. Results We studied 1489 participants returned valid results in both June and September (59% of those sent kits). Lateral flow immune-antibody test was positive for 7.2% in June and 5.9% in September, with 3.9% positive in both. Being more symptomatic or suspecting infection increased the probability of ever being positive. Of those positive in June, 46% (49/107) were negative in September (seroreversion), and this was similar regardless of symptom characteristics, suspicion, and timing of possible infection. A possible outlier was those aged over 55 years, where only 3 of 13 (23%) had seroreversion. Discussion These results do not follow the pattern reported from studies specifically designed to monitor seropositivity, which have found greater consistency over time and the influence of presence, timing and severity of symptoms on seroreversion. We suggest several factors that may have contributed to this difference: our low bar in defining initial seropositivity (single test); a non-quantitative test known to have relatively low sensitivity; participants carrying out testing. We would encourage other studies to use these real-world performance characteristics alongside those from laboratory studies to plan and analyse any antibody testing.","Davis, K. A.

Material and methods In this cross?sectional observational study, patients who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed between February and April 2021. The symptoms reported by patients were evaluated using a questionnaire developed by the authors based on the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to assess their depressive symptoms and anxiety. Results Of the 102 patients, 45 (44%) were men, and the mean age (± standard deviation – SD) was 52 ±13 years. The mean time interval (±SD) between COVID-19 diagnosis and the examination was 56 ±18 days. Seventy-eight (76%) patients were treated at home, while 24 (23.5%) were hospitalized. Fatigue, cognitive impairment (“brain fog”), breathlessness, and cough were the most frequently reported complaints. Median scores of the BDI, state-anxiety (STAI 1) and trait-anxiety (STAI 2) were 7 (interquartile range, IQR = 10), 38 (IQR = 13), and 40.5 (IQR = 14), respectively. Mild depressive symptoms were observed in almost 30% of patients. Women scored significantly higher than men. Conclusions Patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19 show increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, the intensity of which was more pronounced in women. From the clinical perspective, physicians should be aware of the anxiety and depressive symptoms of the post-COVID-19 syndrome.","Dankowski, Rafał Sacharczuk Wioletta Duszyńska Dominika Mikołajewska Weronika Szałek-Goralewska Anna Łojko-Dankowska Anna Szyszka Andrzej Łojko Dorota",Neuropsychiatria i Neuropsychologia,https://doi.org/10.5114/nan.2021.108028,290

This research develops a model that classifies unstructured data from data mining into labeled data, and builds an informational and decision-making support system (DMSS). We often have assortments of information collected by mining data from various sources, where the key challenge is to extract valuable information. We observe substantial classification accuracy enhancement for our datasets with both machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The highest classification accuracy (99% in training, 96% in testing) was achieved from a Covid corpus which is processed by using a long short-term memory (LSTM). Furthermore, we conducted tests on large datasets relevant to the Disaster corpus, with an LSTM classification accuracy of 98%. In addition, random forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, provides a reasonable 84% accuracy. This research’s main objective is to increase the application’s robustness by integrating intelligence into the developed DMSS, which provides insight into the user’s intent, despite dealing with a noisy dataset. Our designed model selects the random forest and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms’ F1 score, where the RF method outperforms by improving accuracy by 2% (to 83% from 81%) compared with a conventional method.","Islam, Azharul",Applied Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/app11136237,290

171402,One-shot analysis of translated mammalian lncRNAs with AHARIBO,2020-04-20,"Brand resonance is a marketing concept under-explored in the performing arts context. This paper responds by analysing focus group findings from a large Opera group, ""Big Opera([1])"" (For research integrity and anonymity requirements of focus group research, the company pseudonym is Big Opera) on how decision-makers can enhance brand resonance. Opera patronage was dwindling before the COVID-19 pandemic, which was further crystallized during the pandemic. As the performing arts sector tries to revive, it is useful to understand how brand resonance concepts can be used to reinvigorate patronage at the opera. A qualitative study of four opera focus groups, which included 24 participants with varying levels of attendance was conducted to examine brand resonance. The study reveals that when customers have brand attachment and love, developed through intense experiences at the opera, facilitated by engagement with the brand, and community, then brand loyalty develops for the opera by intention to re-purchase. The paper contributes to the literature by making recommendations on how to enhance brand resonance thereby increasing attendance. Intense experiences at the opera and engagement can be enhanced by offering packaged deals, such as accommodation and dinner, or drinks and canapes packages, backstage access, the development of a social club, social media brand community and loyalty programs to increase brand loyalty.","Hall, E.; Menzies, J.; Zutshi, A.; Creed, A.",International Journal of Consumer Studies,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcs.12743,290

Earlier studies concentrated a bit to analyze the influence of globalization and politico-administrative factors on the energy consumption-economic growth nexus in developing economies. The motivation for the current research is to scrutinize the energy consumption-economic growth nexus while accounting for the influence of globalization and country risk indicators—the politico-administrative factors in a panel of 4 South Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) during 1980–2018. To check the issues of heterogeneity and cross-sectional independence, the study employs the pooled mean group estimation method. The investigated results provide a nexus between energy consumption and economic growth where globalization - a long-run force positively affects this nexus in the long run and negatively in the short run. Besides, the politico-administrative factors have an adverse impact in the long run and an insignificant effect on this nexus in the short run. The Dumitrescu–Hurlin non-causality test establishes the feedback hypothesis concerning energy consumption-economic growth nexus in South Asian economies. The study results remain robust across the dynamic ordinary least square estimator. Therefore, this study suggests sustaining the energy-growth nexus to properly handle globalization and politico-administrative and the Covid-19 pandemic issues through institutional quality. Moreover, the objective-oriented policies are critical to strengthening the energy-growth nexus without decaying environmental quality in South Asian countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Islam, M.

In the absence of a universal vaccine or specific treatments, prevention relies on vector control and disease surveillance. Accurate and early forecasts can help reduce the spread of the disease. In this study, we develop a model to predict the number of Dengue Fever cases in Brazilian cities one month ahead. We compare different machine learning approaches as well as different sets of input features based on epidemiological and meteorological data. We find that different models work best in different cities, and a random forests model trained on data of historical Dengue cases performs best overall. It produces lower aggregate errors than a seasonal naïve baseline model, Gradient Boosting Regression, feed-forward Neural Networks, and Support Vector Regression. Predictions on an unseen test set are on average within 11.5 cases for the median city. Mean absolute errors on the hold-out test set are reduced to 10.8 for the median city when selecting the optimal combination of algorithm and input features for each city individually.","Roster, Kirstin; Connaughton, Colm; Rodrigues, Francisco A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.430949,290

In this study we measured antibodies anti-S1 and anti-RBD with two different methods both in patients and in vaccinated subjects. 108 specimens from 48 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 affected (time from the onset of symptoms from 3 to 368 days) and 60 specimens from 20 vaccinated subjects (collected after 14 days from the first dose, 14 days and 3 months after a second dose of Comirnaty) were evaluated. We used an ELISA method that measure IgG against anti-Spike 1 and a chemiluminescence immunoassays that measure IgG anti-RBD. In the patients, antibodies concentrations tend to decline after a few months with both methods, but persist relatively high up to nearly a year after symptoms. In vaccinated subjects, antibodies were already detectable after the first dose, but after the booster they show a significant increase. However, the decrease is rapid, given that after 3 months after the second vaccination they are reduced to less than a quarter. The conversion of the results into BAU units improves the relationship between the two methods. However, in vaccinated subjects there was no evidence of proportional error after the conversion, while in the patients the difference between the two methods remained significant.","Dittadi, R.; Seguso, M.; Isabella, B.; Afshar, H.; Carraro, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.28.21262543v1?rss=1,290
172330,"Shoring up shortfalls: women, retirement, and the growing gigsupp economy",2021,"Maintaining surveillance of emerging infectious diseases presents challenges for monitoring their transmission and burden. Incomplete observation of infections and imperfect diagnosis reduce the observed sizes of transmission chains relative to their true sizes. Previous studies have examined the effect of incomplete observation on estimates of pathogen transmission and burden. However, each study assumed that, if observed, each infection was correctly diagnosed. Here, I leveraged principles from branching process theory to examine how misdiagnosis could contribute to bias in estimates of transmission and burden for emerging infectious diseases. Using the zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi malaria as a case study, I found that, even when assuming complete observation of infections, the number of misdiagnosed cases within a transmission chain for every correctly diagnosed case could range from 0 (0 - 4) when R0 was 0.1 to 86 (0 - 837) when R0 was 0.9. Data on transmission chain sizes obtained using an imperfect diagnostic could consistently lead to underestimates of R0, the basic reproduction number, and simulations revealed that such data on up to 1,000 observed transmission chains was not powered to detect changes in transmission. My results demonstrate that misdiagnosis may hinder effective monitoring of emerging infectious diseases and that sensitivity of diagnostics should be considered in evaluations of surveillance systems.","Huber, J.

Current influenza diagnosis and treatment relies upon patient visits to healthcare facilities, which may lead to under-diagnosis and treatment delays. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of an at-home approach to influenza diagnosis and treatment via home testing, telehealth care, and rapid antiviral home delivery. Methods: We conducted a pilot interventional study of remote influenza diagnosis and treatment in Seattle-area households with children during the 2019-2020 influenza season using pre-positioned nasal swabs and home influenza tests. Home monitoring for respiratory symptoms occurred weekly; if symptoms were reported within 48 hours of onset, participants collected mid-nasal swabs and used a rapid home-based influenza immunoassay. An additional home-collected swab was returned to a laboratory for confirmatory influenza RT-PCR testing. Baloxavir antiviral treatment was prescribed and delivered to symptomatic and age-eligible participants, following a telehealth encounter. Results: 124 households comprising 481 individuals self-monitored for respiratory symptoms, with 58 home tests administered. 12 home tests were positive for influenza, of which 8 were true positives confirmed by RT-PCR. The sensitivity and specificity of the home influenza test was 72.7% and 96.2%, respectively. There were 8 home deliveries of baloxavir, with 7 (87.5%) occurring within 3 hours of prescription, and all within 48 hours of symptom onset. Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of self-testing combined with rapid home delivery of influenza antiviral treatment. This approach may be an important control strategy for influenza epidemics and pandemics.","Heimonen, J. T.; McCulloch, D. J.; O'Hanlon, J.; Kim, A.

In the context of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus infection, the course of viral pneumonia is often complicated by the addition of bacterial microflora due to a decrease in the body's immune status. The causative agents of such a co-infection can exhibit multiple drug resistance, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of etiotropic therapy. In this regard, it seems expedient to provide microbiological support to patients in order to select the most optimal treatment regimens. Aim. To study the composition of bacterial pathogens' species, that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in corona-positive (COVID-19+) and corona-negative (COVID-19-) patients and to determine the spectrum of their sensitivity/resistance to antibacterial drugs. Material and methods. The species composition of microorganisms in sputum samples from 723 patients with CAP, who were admitted from the healthcare facility in Rostov-on-Don in August and December 2020 were studied. The isolated cultures were identified using bacteriological and mass spectrometric methods. The sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. Results. It was shown that in August pneumococci and staphylococci prevailed in the spectrum of CAP pathogens, while in December the percentage of excretions of Acinetobacter spp. and S. haemolyticus increased. Various types of p. Candida yeast were found with a high degree of isolation, COVID-19 + patients showed a tendency towards greater contamination (>104 mcl/ml). Some pathogens (A.baumannii, S.haemolyticus, P.aeruginosa, S.maltophilia) are characterized by polydrug resistance, and some strains of these species are pan-resistant to all groups of antibiotics. Conclusion. The data obtained demonstrate that severe forms of community-acquired pneumonia can be caused by viral-bacterial and viral-bacterial-yeast combinations of pathogens, including bacteria with a narrow spectrum of sensitivity to antibacterial drugs. © Team of Authors, 2021.","Pavlovich, N.

However, the extent to which these findings apply in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic--rife with uncertainties--is unclear. In a large international survey experiment, (Study 1; N = 10,519) we report that communicating uncertainty around COVID-19 statistics in the form of a numeric range (vs. no uncertainty) may lead to slightly lower trust in the number presented but has no impact on trust in the source of the information. We also report the minimal impact of numeric uncertainty on trust is consistent across estimates of current or future COVID-19 statistics (Study 2) and figures relating to environmental or economic research, rather than the pandemic (Study 3). Conversely, we find imprecise statements about the mere existence of uncertainty without quantification can undermine both trust in the numbers and their source--though effects vary across countries and contexts. Communicators can be transparent about statistical uncertainty without concerns about undermining perceptions of their trustworthiness, but ideally should aim to use numerical ranges rather than verbal statements.","Kerr, J.

With limited diagnostic test resources, the early detection of symptoms and their specificity for Covid-19 are of great importance, so that a better understanding of their characteristics is necessary. Material and methods As part of secondary prophylaxis, employees (n = 1734) from retirement and nursing homes were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and asked about subjective restrictions on the sense of smell and any nasal co-symptoms. In addition, patients (n = 41) after confirmed and healed Covid-19 infection were questioned and examined with regard to hyp-/anosmia using a questionnaire and olfactory testing (Sniffin 'sticks with SDI rating). Results Approx. 1% of the employees surveyed reported subjective hyposmia. Acute hyposmias were accompanied by nasal obstruction, chronic hyposmias showed no co-symptoms. In the patients after Covid-19 infections, the identification (Imed = 14) and the discrimination (Dmed = 12) of the odors were only slightly limited, but there was a persistent pathologically increased threshold value for odor perception (Smed = 1.75) in the median 75 days after the onset of infection. Discussion Acute hyp-/anosmia without nasal co-symptoms rarely occurs in the SARS-CoV-2 negative population, so that its occurrence is currently suspicious of a Covid-19 infection and should be examined further e.g. via nasopharyngeal swab. In the further course the odor restrictions can regress again, the different odor qualities seem to do this with different latencies, whereby the increased odor threshold persists the longest.","Jungbauer, F.; Berkemann, M.; Huber, L.; Lammert, A.; Ludwig, S.; Rotter, N.; Zaubitzer, L.; Schell, A.",Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1727773,290

Our knowledge about the survival rate and prognostic factors of the disease is not established well. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictors of COVID-19 mortality in Hamadan province in western Iran. Methods: In this study, we included all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with known treatment outcomes in Hamadan province, Iran, between 20, 2020, to May 10, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and treatment outcomes were obtained from computerized medical records and compared between survived cases and patients with death outcomes. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors of death. Results: From 749 investigated patients, 77 patients (10.28%) died during the treatment. The Mean age of patients was 53.97±19.04 years. Multivariable logistic regression showed that males had 2.07 (95% CI: 1.73, 2.54) fold higher odds of death. Those with 60 years old and more had 6.49 (95% CI: 4.53, 7.93) fold higher odds of death. Patients with an underlying disease had 7.14 (95% CI: 6.94, 7.38) fold higher odds of death, and patients who were hospitalized in the ICU ward had 2.24 (95% CI: 1.75, 2.90) times higher odds of COVID-19 related mortality.

Background For doctoral students, the process of designing, implementing, and writing a culminating project is a key part of the learning experience. These projects typically require students to direct their own learning and to manage setbacks, obstacles, and challenges as they arise. During the COVID-19 pandemic, doctoral students around the globe had to undertake this key learning experience in the context of a global crisis. Methodology During August and September 2020, 235 doctoral students from around the world completed an online questionnaire consisting of demographic questions and three open-ended questions about their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis involved several cycles of In Vivo Coding of the data, which yielded codes, categories, and eventually themes. At each stage, the researchers collaborated to generate the codes, and the categories and themes arose through several rounds of discussion. Contribution Our study adds to the small body of knowledge on doctoral students’ experiences from around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic by identifying categories of experience through qualitative, open-ended survey questions. The study highlights doctoral students’ challenges and how these were either exacerbated or mitigated by pandemic-induced changes. Findings Our survey respondents described impacts on their culminating projects’ progress in five major categories: research design, access to resources, workload, mental health, and finances. Recommendations The five categories of impacts emerging from our participants’ responses may for Practitioners be useful for faculty and administrators of doctoral programs to consider in reviewing their programs’ responses to the pandemic and making future plans for providing academic continuity in crisis situations as well as re-evaluating the priorities and structures of doctoral program to better support students overall moving forward.

Neutrophils are extremely short-lived cells, which survive less than a day after reaching terminal differentiation. Thus, little is known about how organismal aging, rather than the daily cellular aging process, may impact neutrophil biology. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that both immunity and organismal aging are sex-dimorphic. Here, we describe a multi-omic resource of mouse primary bone marrow neutrophils from young and old female and male mice, at the transcriptomic, metabolomic and lipidomic levels. Importantly, we identify widespread age-related and sex-dimorphic regulation of ‘omics’ in neutrophils, specifically regulation of chromatin. Using machine-learning, we identify candidate molecular drivers of age-related and sex-dimorphic transcriptional regulation of neutrophils. We leverage our resource to predict increased levels/release of neutrophil elastase in male mice. To date, this dataset represents the largest multi-omics resource for the study of neutrophils across biological sex and ages. This resource identifies molecular states linked to neutrophil characteristics linked to organismal age or sex, which could be targeted to improve immune responses across individuals.","Lu, Ryan; Taylor, Shalina; Contrepois, Kévin; Ellenberger, Mathew; Sampathkumar, Nirmal K.; Benayoun, Bérénice A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.190595,290

Using this insight we argue that the observed cash management is consistent with COVID-19 increasing the fixed cost of withdrawing cash. We use detailed data on ATM cash disbursements in Argentina, Chile, and the US to estimate how much the pandemic has changed the transaction cost of using cash. This estimation shows that if the intensity of the virus doubles in a county, cash transaction cost increases by approximately 2%.

Global warming and resource depletion, poverty and economic inequality, as well as sudden shocks to the political system such as the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 will likely continue to set a large part of the political agenda for the remainder of this century. If Social Democrats continue to be part of a truly world-transforming labour movement, they must address and engage with these issues, and with the yet unknown political problems of tomorrow. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Thorsen, D.

177747,The structure of enteric human adenovirus 41 - a leading cause of diarrhea in children,2020-10-16,"Background: ECDC performs epidemic intelligence activities to systematically collate information from a variety of sources, including Twitter, to rapidly detect public health events. The lack of a freely available, customisable and automated early warning tool using Twitter data, prompted ECDC to develop epitweetr. The specific objectives are to assess the performance of the geolocation and signal detection algorithms used by epitweetr and to assess the performance of epitweetr in comparison with the manual monitoring of Twitter for early detection of public health threats. Methods: Epitweetr collects, geolocates and aggregates tweets to generate signals and email alerts. Firstly, we evaluated manually the tweet geolocation characteristics of 1,200 tweets, and assessed its accuracy in extracting the correct location and its performance in detecting tweets with available information on the tweet geolocation. Secondly, we evaluated signals generated by epitweetr between 19 October and 30 November 2020 and we calculated the positive predictive value (PPV). Then, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity and timeliness of epitweetr in comparison with Twitter manual monitoring. Findings: The epitweetr geolocation algorithm had an accuracy of 30.1% and 25.9% at national and subnational levels, respectively. General and specific PPV of the signal detection algorithm was 3.0% and 74.6%, respectively. Epitweetr and/or manual monitoring detected 570 signals and 454 events. Epitweetr had a sensitivity of 78.6% [75.2% - 82.0%] and PPV of 74.6% [70.5% - 78.6%]; and the manual monitoring had a sensitivity of 47.9% [43.8% - 52.0%] and PPV of 97.9% [95.8% - 99.9%]. The median validation time difference between sixteen common events detected by epitweetr and manual monitoring was -48.6 hours [(-102.8) - (-23.7) hours]. Interpretation: Epitweetr has shown to have sufficient performance as an early warning tool for public health threats using Twitter data. Having developed epitweetr as a free, open-source tool with several configurable settings and a strong automated component, it is expected to increase its usability and usefulness to public health experts.","Espinosa, L.; Wijermans, A.; Orchard, F.; Hoehle, M.; Czernichow, T.; Coletti, P.; Hermans, L.; Faes, C.; Kissling, E.; Mollet, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.25.21254342v1?rss=1,290
178802,Boundary convection during velocity sedimentation in the Optima analytical ultracentrifuge,2021-03-09,"AI plays an important role in COVID-19 identification. Computer vision and deep learning techniques can assist in determining COVID-19 infection with Chest X-ray Images. However, for the protection and respect of the privacy of patients, the hospital’s specific medical-related data did not allow leakage and sharing without permission. Collecting such training data was a major challenge. To a certain extent, this has caused a lack of sufficient data samples when performing deep learning approaches to detect COVID-19. Federated Learning is an available way to address this issue. It can effectively address the issue of data silos and get a shared model without obtaining local data. In the work, we propose the use of federated learning for COVID-19 data training and deploy experiments to verify the effectiveness. And we also compare performances of four popular models (MobileNet_v2, ResNet18, ResNeXt, and COVID-Net) with the federated learning framework and without the framework. This work aims to inspire more researches on federated learning about COVID-19. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Yan, B.; Wang, J.; Cheng, J.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Yang, Y.; Liu, L.; Zhao, H.; Wang, C.; Liu, B.","7th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Security, ICAIS 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-78618-2_4,290

Many countries face this as an acute public health issue that diminishes the efficacy of their vaccination campaigns. Epidemic modeling and simulation can be used to predict the effects of different vaccination strategies. In this work, we present an open-source particle-based COVID-19 simulator with a vaccination module capable of taking into account the vaccine hesitancy of the population. To demonstrate the efficacy of the simulator, we conducted extensive simulations for the province of Lecco, Italy. The results indicate that the combination of both high vaccination rate and low hesitancy leads to faster epidemic suppression.","Karabay, A.; Kuzdeuov, A.; Varol, H.

The disease affects a variety of coral species with differential outcomes, and in many instances results in whole-colony mortality. We employed untargeted metabolomic profiling of Montastraea cavernosa corals affected by stony coral tissue loss disease to identify metabolic markers of disease. Herein, extracts from apparently healthy, diseased, and recovered corals, Montastraea cavernosa, collected at a reef site near Ft. Lauderdale, Florida were subjected to liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Unsupervised principal component analysis reveals wide variation in metabolomic profiles of healthy corals of the same species, which differ from diseased corals. Using a combination of supervised and unsupervised data analyses tools, we describe metabolite features that explain variation between the apparently healthy corals, between diseased corals, and between the healthy and the diseased corals. By employing a culture-based approach, we assign sources of a subset of these molecules to the endosymbiotic dinoflagellates, Symbiodiniaceae. Specifically, we identify various endosymbiont-specific lipid classes, such as betaine lipids, glycolipids, and tocopherols, which differentiate samples taken from apparently healthy corals and diseased corals. Given the variation observed in metabolite fingerprints of corals, our data suggests that metabolomics is a viable approach to link metabolite profiles of different coral species with their susceptibility and resilience to numerous coral diseases spreading through reefs worldwide.","Deutsch, Jessica M; Jaiyesimi, Olakunle; Pitts, Kelly; Houk, Jay; Ushijima, Blake; Walker, Brian K.; Paul, Valerie J.; Garg, Neha",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.18.456681,290
179610,Measuring overtourism: A necessary tool for landscape planning,2021,"Purpose: Due to surge in COVID cases during the second wave of the COVID pandemic, the healthcare system collapsed in India with shortage of hospital beds, injudicious use of steroids and other immunomodulators, and poor glycaemic monitoring among a population with pre-existing risk of diabetes. Fungal epidemic was announced amid COVID pandemic with several cases of COVID-associated mucormycosis and aspergillosis being reported. But, there is no data regarding mixed fungal infections in COVID patients. Materials and Methods: The study presented a series of ten consecutive cases with dual invasive molds in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Among patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID in May 2021 at a tertiary care center in North India, ten microbiologically confirmed dual/mixed COVID-associated mucor-aspergillosis (CAMA) were evaluated. Results: All patients were diabetics with the majority having severe COVID pneumonia (6/10, 60%) either on admission or in the past one month, whilst two were each of moderate (20%) and mild (20%) categories of COVID. The patients were managed with amphotericin-B along with surgical intervention. In this case series, 70% of all CAMA (Rhizopus arrhizus with Aspergillus flavus in seven and Aspergillus fumigatus in three patients) patients survived, connoting the critical importance of a high index of clinical suspicion and accurate microbiological diagnosis for managing invasive molds. Conclusions: Mixed fungal infections i.e. CAMA during COVID and post-COVID periods may be an emerging disease. This outbreak is seen particularly in such patients with uncontrolled diabetes, on steroids, or cocktail therapy, or living in unhygienic environments. We believe that our findings would help gain a better insight into the risk and progression of invasive fungal mixed infections among COVID patients and thus play a pivotal role in diagnosing, classifying, and implementing an effective management strategy for treating similar cases in the future.","Singh, V.; Prasad, A.; Panda, P.

This study aims to investigate the published literature of OP related to COVID-19, estimates the prevalence of OP among COVID-19 patients, and assesses the risk or COVID-19 severity associated with OP. Methodology: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic electronic search through PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, EBSCO, and Google Scholar was conducted to include relevant and eligible literature. The authors used Review Manager 5.4 to perform quantitative data synthesis for the condition of interest analyses. Results: A total of 9 eligible study articles and 12 case reports were included in this study. The estimated pooled organizing pneumonia prevalence among COVID-19 patients was 45.6% [23.1%-68.2%]. The association between OP and severe COVID-19 infection revealed a pooled OR [95% CI] of 5.22 [-0.96-11.41]. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients had a rather high OP prevalence (43%). Surprisingly, cancer patients with COVID-19 infection had the lowest OP prevalence. OP was identified as a possible risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Alanazi, T. K.

In doing so, the analysis brings a deeper insight on the legal limits of these measures represented by fundamental rights and liberties, and by the constitutional conferral of powers between the central and the regional governments, as affirmed in the Italian Constitutional Court settled case-law. Then the essay analyses the consequences of the pandemic crisis in the economic dimension, considering the questions arising as symptoms of the reallocation of powers and competencies from the periphery to the center: the so-called authority migration implied by the economic crisis. In the last part of the work proposals for constitutional amendments are eventually considered, questioning the introduction of new state arrangements in order to adopt substitutive measures to let the national interest prevail on regional and local autonomy powers.

180100,At least seven distinct rotavirus genotype constellations in bats with evidence of reassortment and zoonotic transmissions,2020-10-26,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reduced family access to hospitals and created new barriers to home hospice care, raising concerns about how the pandemic has impacted cancer patients' place of death and end of life home hospice support. Hypothesizing that Medicaid-enrolled cancer patients may be at greater risk of disruptions in end-of-life care compared to commercially insured patients, we examined changes in place of death and home hospice support for Medicaid and Commercial enrollees following the pandemic. Methods: We linked WA State cancer registry records with claims from Medicaid and approximately 75% of commercially insured cancer patients in the state. Patients ages 18-64 with solid-tumor malignancies who died March-June 2020 (COVID) were compared to those who died March-June 2017-2019 (Pre-COVID). Place of death was categorized as hospital, home with hospice, and home without hospice;nursing home deaths were excluded. Given our sample size, we examined differences in the likelihood of place of death with Fisher's exact tests and multinomial logistic regressions stratified by payer and by COVID period, controlling for age, gender, race, stage, cancer type, and census tract-level neighborhood deprivation. We report marginal effects. Results: In Fisher's exact analyses, Medicaid but not commercial patients were significantly less like to die in hospital and more likely to die at home without hospice during COVID (Table). In pre-post adjusted analysis of Medicaid patients, the probability of dying in the hospital was 12.3% (p=0.03) percentage points lower during the pandemic versus before, while the probability of dying at home without hospice was 11.1% (p=0.04) greater. Place of death did not change significantly pre-post for commercial patients. In addition, Pre-COVID, the probability of dying in the hospital was 10.7% (p=0.03) greater for Medicaid than commercial patients. During COVID, the probability of dying at home without hospice was 15.8% (p=0.04) greater for Medicaid versus commercial patients but lower for women (ME=20.2%;p=0.01) and colorectal versus breast cancer patients (ME=39.2%;p=0.01). Conclusions: Following COVID, Medicaid patients place of death shifted from hospital to homes, but without an increase in the use of home hospice services. In contrast, place of death and hospice use among commercial patients did not significantly change. This widening disparity in home deaths without hospice services raises concerns that the pandemic disproportionately worsened end of life experience for low income patients with cancer.

180104,The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO),2020-12-04,"Abstract Background Some studies suggest worsening mental health in the early stages of the pandemic, for individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions the evidence is mixed. We examined whether different life-course trajectories of psychological distress from adolescence to midlife were associated with psychological distress, lower life satisfaction and feelings of loneliness at different stages during the pandemic. Methods This study is a secondary analysis of two nationally representative British Birth cohorts, the National Child Development Study (1958) and 1970 British Cohort Study, from birth to later mid-life. We used latent variable mixture models to identify pre-pandemic longitudinal trajectories of psychological distress and a modified poisson model with robust standard errors to estimate associations with mental health outcomes during the pandemic from May 2020 to March 2021. Findings Our analysis identified five distinct pre-pandemic trajectories of psychological distress in both cohorts. All trajectories with prior symptoms of psychological distress were associated with a greater relative risk of mental health outcomes during the pandemic. This was the case irrespective of age of onset, severity, longevity and proximal occurrence. Those who had experienced more than one prior episode of high psychological distress, and more recent occurrences, faced the greatest risk of poor mental health during the pandemic. Interpretation Whilst any prior episode of poor mental health put individuals at greater risk of severe mental health symptoms, those with chronic and more recent occurrence are likely to require greater mental health support.","Moulton, V.; Sullivan, A.; Patalay, P.; Fitzsimons, E.; Henderson, M.; Bann, D.; Ploubidis, G.

In this preliminary study, we examined how changes in distress from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with similar changes in feeding practices in a sample of mothers of preschool-aged children. In addition, we examined how pre-pandemic laboratory measures of maternal self-regulation moderated this association. A total of 36 mothers from an ongoing study on parent and child self-regulation completed surveys assessing parental distress (i.e., maternal depression, parenting stress) and child feeding practices during pandemic-related stay-at-home orders in May?June 2020. These mothers had completed the same measures approximately 2 years earlier, along with laboratory assessments of inhibitory and attentional control. Pre-pandemic laboratory measures of attentional control significantly moderated the association between increased maternal depression and use of controlling feeding practices, such that mothers with better attentional, but not inhibitory, control scores did not show an effect of increased depression on feeding practices. These results provide preliminary evidence that acute increases in parental distress associated with ?stay-at-home? orders affect feeding practices, specifically for mothers with lower levels of attentional control abilities.","Giuliani, Nicole R.; Kelly, Nichole R.",Journal of Prevention and Health Promotion,https://doi.org/10.1177/26320770211032346,290

182104,Innovation in the globalised world: educating future building professionals,2020,"The expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), known as heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells, is enhanced during several pathological conditions such as inflammatory or viral respiratory infections. It seems that the way MDSCs behave in infection depends on the type and the virulence mechanisms of the invader pathogen, the disease stage, and the infection-related pathology. Increasing evidence showing that in correlation with the severity of the disease, MDSCs are accumulated in COVID-19 patients, in particular in those at severe stages of the disease or ICU patients, contributing to pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection. Based on the involved subsets, MDSCs delay the clearance of the virus through inhibiting T-cell proliferation and responses by employing various mechanisms such as inducing the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated hampering of IFN-γ production, or forcing arginine shortage. While the immunosuppressive characteristic of MDSCs may help to preserve the tissue homeostasis and prevent hyperinflammation at early stages of the infection, hampering of efficient immune responses proved to exert significant pathogenic effects on severe forms of COVID-19, suggesting the targeting of MDSCs as a potential intervention to reactivate T-cell immunity and thereby prevent the infection from developing into severe stages of the disease. This review tried to compile evidence on the roles of different subsets of MDSCs during viral respiratory infections, which is far from being totally understood, and introduce the promising potential of MDSCs for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, especially against COVID-19 disease.","Koushki, Khadijeh; Salemi, Maryam; Miri, Seyed Mohammad; Arjeini, Yaser; Keshavarz, Mohsen; Ghaemi, Amir",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332221011306; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332221011306?v=s5,290

Basic ingredients of population dynamics models are typically a growth rate, a saturation term in the form of Verhulst’s logistic brake, and a functional response accounting for interspecific interactions. However intraspecific interactions are not usually included in the equations. The simplest models use linear terms to represent a simple picture of the nature, meanwhile to represent more complex landscapes, it is necessary to include more terms with higher order or analytically more complex. The problem to use a simpler or more complex model depends on many factors: mathematical, ecological, or computational. To address it, here we discuss a new model based on a previous logistic-mutualistic model. We have generalised the interspecific terms (for antagonistic and competitive relationships) and we have also included new polynomial terms to explain any intraspecific interaction. We show that by adding simple intraspecific terms, new free-equilibrium solutions appear driving a much richer dynamics. These new solutions could represent more realistic ecological landscapes by including a new high order term.","Stucchi, Luciano; Pastor, Juan Manuel; García-Algarra, Javier; Galeano, Javier",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.110916,290
183610,Science and Clinical Potpourri for Your Life and Your Practice.,2020-12-01,"Many brain imaging studies aim to measure structural connectivity with diffusion tractography. However, biases in tractography data, particularly near the boundary between white matter and cortical grey matter can limit the accuracy of such studies. When seeding from the white matter, streamlines tend to travel parallel to the convoluted cortical surface, largely avoiding sulcal fundi and terminating preferentially on gyral crowns. When seeding from the cortical grey matter, streamlines generally run near the cortical surface until reaching deep white matter. These so-called “gyral biases” limit the accuracy and effective resolution of cortical structural connectivity profiles estimated by tractography algorithms, and they do not reflect the expected distributions of axonal densities seen in invasive tracer studies or stains of myelinated fibres. We propose an algorithm that concurrently models fibre density and orientation using a divergence-free vector field within gyral blades to encourage an anatomically-justified streamline density distribution along the cortical white/grey-matter boundary while maintaining alignment with the diffusion MRI estimated fibre orientations. Using in vivo data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that this algorithm reduces tractography biases. We compare the structural connectomes to functional connectomes from resting-state fMRI, showing that our model improves cross-modal agreement. Finally, we find that after parcellation the changes in the structural connectome are very minor with slightly improved interhemispheric connections (i.e, more homotopic connectivity) and slightly worse intrahemispheric connections when compared to tracers.","Cottaar, Michiel; Bastiani, Matteo; Boddu, Nikhil; Glasser, Matthew; Haber, Suzanne; van Essen, David C.; Sotiropoulos, Stamatios N.; Jbabdi, Saad",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.222778,290
183731,Communicating risks.,2003,"Traditional contact tracing for COVID-19 tests the direct contacts of those who test positive even if the contacts do not show any symptom. But, by the time an infected individual is tested, the infection starting from the person may have infected a chain of individuals. Hence, why should the testing stop at direct contacts, and not test secondary, tertiary contacts or even contacts further down? One deterrent in testing long chains of individuals right away may be that it substantially increases the testing load, or does it? We investigate the costs and benefits of such multi-hop contact tracing for different number of hops. Considering a large number of contact topologies, spanning synthetic networks of divergent characteristics and those constructed from recorded interactions, we show that the cost-benefit tradeoff can be characterized in terms of a single measurable attribute, the initial epidemic growth rate. Once this growth rate crosses a threshold, multi-hop contact tracing substantially reduces the outbreak size compared to traditional contact tracing. Multi-hop even incurs a lower cost compared to the traditional contact tracing for a large range of values of the growth rate. The cost-benefit tradeoffs and the choice of the number of hops can be classified into three phases, with sharp transitions between them, depending on the value of the growth rate. The need for choosing a larger number of hops becomes greater as the growth rate increases or the environment becomes less conducive toward containing the disease.","Kim, J.; Chen, X.; Nikpey, H.; Rubin, H.; Bidokhti, S.

It is estimated that 3.5 million metric tonnes of masks (equivalent to 601 TIR containers) have been landfilled worldwide in the first year, with the potential to increase the share of the plastic on global municipal solid waste by 3.5%, alter biogas composition, and release 2.3 x 1021 microplastics to leachates or adjacent environments, in the coming years. This paper reviews the challenges raised in the pandemic scenario on landfills and discusses the potential environmental and health implications that might drive us apart from the 2030 U.N. sustainable goals. Also, it highlights some innovative technologies to improve waste management (from collection to disposal, waste reduction, sterilization) and mitigates plastic leakage (emission control approaches, application of biotechnological and monitoring/computational tools) that can pave the way to environmental recovery. COVID-19 will eventually subside, but if no action is taken in the short-term towards effective plastic policies, replacement of plastics for sustainable alternatives (e.g., biobased plastics), improvement of waste management streams (prioritising flexible and decentralized approaches), and a greater awareness and responsibility of the general public, stakeholders, industries;we will soon reach a tipping-point in natural environments worldwide.","Patrício Silva, Ana L.; Prata, Joana C.; Duarte, Armando C.; Barcelò, Damià Rocha-Santos Teresa",Chemical Engineering Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.131201,290

Handling this pandemic situation is a fundamental challenge to the concerned authorities. However, not all states of India have had the same position or spread counts. The significant impact was from Lockdown 1.0, which controlled the growth of the exponential curve. Here we have considered the Karnataka state data referring to the Ministry of Health and Family welfare department, GoK. This paper presents a case study on the state pandemic ""coronavirus""named ""COVID19""growth curves for 30 Karnataka state districts with deep insights using graph-based analytical techniques. The study also explores the reasons for the spread and deaths, considering the KaTrace dataset. In graph-based analytics, certain concepts that may be explored on their own and in combination with other attributes yield interestingness in the dataset. Interesting insights are derived considering key attributes and relationships like age, gender, duration with reason, and the district of origin. The COVI19 has resulted in the closing of border segments and made everyone stay-at-home for a certain amount of time as a preventive measures to control the spread.

There has been little guidance, however, on how to approach CBPR within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where physical distancing and closure of essential community organizations became the norm. This study discusses challenges and possibilities of using CBPR during a pandemic to address the needs of immigrant and racialized older adults in Alberta, Canada. Two case studies of active research projects that aim to engage immigrant and racialized older adults are presented. Three key challenges are identified related to research activities during the pandemic: (a) pivoting as new foci emerge, (b) recognizing inequity in research participation, and (c) reflecting on well-being in the research team. Approaches to addressing these challenges are highlighted with recommendations for future considerations in CBPR research within vulnerable communities.

185172,Science and Clinical Potpourri for Your Life and Your Practice.,2018,"Background: Trans Sodium Crocetinate (TSC) is a bipolar synthetic carotenoid under development as a drug to enhance oxygenation to hypoxic tissue in addition to standard of care. TSC acts via a novel mechanism of action, improving the diffusivity of oxygen in blood plasma. Thus, it is based on physical-chemical principles, unlike most drugs which are based on biochemistry-based mechanisms. We explored the use of escalating doses and multiple daily dosing of TSC as a potential therapeutic for patients suffering from hypoxemia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Individuals [≥]18 years who were hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypoxemia, defined as SpO2 < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, WHO ordinal scale 3 through 7 (exclusive of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation [ECMO]) were enrolled in cohorts of six subjects, each of whom received the same dose (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg) of TSC via intravenous bolus every 6 hours in addition to standard of care (SOC). This report describes the safety and efficacy results from the lead-in phase of the study and the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses. Safety was assessed as the number of serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed with each dose. Several efficacy parameters were examined in the lead-in phase and descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters are provided. No formal statistical analyses were performed. The population PK analyses were based on previous analyses and examination of the concentration profiles, and two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic models were evaluated and validated. Covariates, including body size, age, sex, organ function, and dose level, were evaluated for inclusion into the model. Results: TSC was well tolerated. There were no treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported. There were 2 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study, neither were considered treatment-related. A total of 24 (96%) subjects survived. One subject (4.0%) died during the study as a result of an SAE (respiratory failure), and that event was determined to be due to COVID-19 complications and not related to study drug. There was an observed reduction in the time to improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale with increasing dose. The median time to 1-point reduction in subjects receiving 0.25 mg/kg was 11.5 days versus 7.5 days in the 1.5 mg/kg treatment cohort. The overall range across all doses was 1 day to 28 days. A total of 36.0% of subjects had a 1-point improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale to Day 7. The 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in observed superior outcomes for multiple secondary clinical outcomes: time to 1-point WHO Ordinal Score improvement through Day 29/discharge, 1-point improvement by Day 7, days to return to room air, and hospital length of stay. The PK results showed that the two-compartment model fit the data well. Clearance decreased with increasing dose level and there was no evidence that clearance was affected by covariates other than dose level. Conclusions: These findings suggest that TSC administration every 6 hours at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg for up to 15 days is safe and well tolerated with predictable pharmacokinetics and demonstrated an observed clinical benefit in the treatment of COVID-19-related hypoxemia.","Streinu-Cercel, A.; Sandulescu, O.; Miron, V.

186020,WHO inquiry into SARS leaves questions unanswered.,2003,"The DA rat is highly susceptible to induction of arthritis after immunization with homologous type II collagen (CII) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA), resulting in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The DA rat also develops arthritis after injection of FIA alone (oil-induced arthritis (OIA)). This finding allows a direct comparison of two different models for rheumatoid arthritis; one induced with a defined auto-immunogen and one with a pure adjuvant. Both CIA and OIA develop approximately 2 weeks after induction but OIA is a self-limited acute disease whereas CIA induced with homologous CII follows a chronic disease course. Immunization with CII leads to a strong autoantibody response to CII while injection of FIA leads to no or very limited anti-CII antibody response. The Lewis rat develops neither CIA nor OIA while F1 (DA x Lewis) rats develop CIA but not OIA. Olive oil or CII emulsified in olive oil does not induce arthritis in DA rats. Pretreatment with CII in olive oil vaccinates against CIA but not OIA whereas pretreatment with FIA vaccinates against OIA but not CIA. These findings demonstrate that inclusion of CII in the adjuvant leads to a disease distinct from OIA which is characterized by a CII autoimmune response and chronicity of the disease course.","Holmdahl, R; Kvick, C",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1554355/,290
186087,Ethics and SARS: lessons from Toronto.,2003,"Brefeldin A (BFA) was shown in earlier studies of numerous cell types to inhibit secretion, induce enzymes of the Golgi stacks to redistribute into the ER, and to cause the Golgi cisternae to disappear. Here, we demonstrate that the PtK1 line of rat kangaroo kidney cells is resistant to BFA. The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtK1 cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58- (58K) and 110-kD (beta-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV- infected PtK1 cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtK1 cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G- protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nucleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtK1 origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of beta-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTP. In perforated cell models of the BFA-sensitive MA104 line, BFA caused beta- COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK1 cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtK1 cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, beta-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtK1 cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2289003/,290

186937,Conformalized Survival Analysis.,2021-03-17,"The sequences involved in the replication and packaging of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) RNA have been studied. The structure of a TGEV defective interfering RNA of 9.7 kb (DI-C) was described previously (A. Mendez, C. Smerdou, A. Izeta, F. Gebauer, and L. Enjuanes, Virology 217: 495-507, 1996), and a cDNA with the information to encode DI-C RNA was cloned under the control of the T7 promoter. The molecularly cloned DI-C RNA was replicated in trans upon transfection of helper virus-infected cells and inhibited 20-fold the replication of the parental genome. A collection of 14 DI-C RNA deletion mutants (TGEV minigenomes) was synthetically generated and tested for their ability to be replicated and packaged. The smallest minigenome (M33) that was replicated by the helper virus and efficiently packaged was 3.3 kb. A minigenome of 2.1 kb (M21) was also replicated, but it was packaged with much lower efficiency than the M33 minigenome, suggesting that it had lost either the sequences containing the main packaging signal or the required secondary structure in the packaging signal due to alteration of the flanking sequences. The low packaging efficiency of the M21 minigenome was not due to minimum size restrictions. The sequences essential for minigenome replication by the helper virus were reduced to 1,348 nt and 492 nt at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. The TGEV-derived RNA minigenomes were successfully expressed following a two-step amplification system that couples pol II-driven transcription in the nucleus to replication supported by helper virus in the cytoplasm, without any obvious splicing. This system and the use of the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) allowed minigenome detection at passage zero, making it possible to distinguish replication efficiency from packaging capability. The synthetic minigenomes have been used to design a helper-dependent expression system that produces around 1.0 microgram/10(6) cells of GUS.","Izeta, A; Smerdou, C; Alonso, S; Penzes, Z; Mendez, A; Plana-Durán, J; Enjuanes, L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882359/,290

MATERIAL AND METHODS Retrospective observational study on the daily calls made to the emergency call center of Castilla La Mancha, both calls to 112 and those made to COVID line, in the period between March 1 and October 14, 2020. The data were analyzed by codes ""diarrhea"", ""dyspnea"", ""fever"" and ""general discomfort"" that were used as predictor variables, and their relationship with hospital admissions and ICU admissions. RESULTS A total of 831,943 calls were received at the CLM emergency call center through 112, with a maximum on March 13, 2020 with 10,582 calls. On COVID line, a total of 208,803 calls were received in that period, with a maximum on March 15 with 23,744. A statistically significant relationship was found between the regulation codes studied (specific symptoms) and the number of calls with hospital admissions and ICU admissions, with a predictive capacity of 2 weeks in relation to occupancy peaks.

DESIGN Cases and controls were interviewed 1-3 months after patients were diagnosed. We used matched multivariate logistic regression to compare cases with controls for poverty status using household income, household assets and relative wealth within the village. We conducted follow-up interviews of patients 10-12 months later to assess economic effects by collecting data on treatment costs, income losses, coping strategies and treatment completion. RESULTS Poverty is strongly associated with TB incidence even after controlling for smoking and other risk factors. Excluding income losses, direct out-of-pocket treatment costs (medical and non-medical) accounted for 55.5% of average annual household income, and most TB cases fell into heavy debt. The DOTS cure rate was 91%. When DOTS was incomplete or not done, mortality was high. CONCLUSIONS Poverty is both a cause and a devastating outcome of TB.

In addition, disaster situations are related with public health ethics more than medical ethics, and accordingly may require stronger effort to achieve a balance between individual and collective rights. This paper aims to review some ethical dilemmas that arise in disasters and mainly focuses on health services. Disasters vary considerably with respect to their time, place and extent; therefore, ethical questions may not always have `one-size-fits-all` answers. On the other hand, embedding ethical values and principles in every aspect of health-care is of vital importance. Reviewing legal and organizational regulations, developing health-care related guidelines, and disaster recovery plans, establishing on-call ethics committees as well as adequate in-service training of health-care workers for ethical competence are among the most critical steps. It is only by making efforts before disasters, that ethical challenges can be minimized in disaster responses.","Ozge Karadag, C; Kerim Hakan, A",Iranian Red Crescent medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23285411/,290

After challenge exposure with either strain, fecal shedding of DBA was detected in 1 of 4 calves and nasal shedding of DB2 was detected in 2 of 4 calves. Immunoglobulin M was the principal coproantibody to BCV early, followed predominantly by IgA. Immunoglobulin G1 coproantibody titers to BCV were low, but increased after challenge exposure. Immunoglobulin G1 antibodies were predominant in serum. After challenge exposure, all serum antibody isotype titers increased except IgG2. The VN antibody responses paralleled serum IgG1 antibody responses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Immunoglobulin A coproantibodies at challenge exposure were associated with protection against diarrhea. Nasal shedding of BCV after challenge exposure confirmed field data documenting reinfection of the respiratory tract of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory tract infections constitute a source of BCV transmission to cows (WD) or young calves.","El-Kanawati, Z R; Tsunemitsu, H; Smith, D R; Saif, L J",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8720237/,290

MATERIALS AND METHODS At the stage of outpatient therapy of ARI 49 pregnant women at the gestational term of 14 - 26 weeks were examined: group 1--27 individuals consulting at day 1 and receiving Viferon (gel) intranasally for 10 days, group 2--22 individuals consulting at day 2 - 3 and receiving Viferon (gel and suppositorium). Respiratory viral infection was diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Bacteriologic study of discharge from the middle section of the pharynx was performed by the standard technique. RESULTS ARI in group 1 of pregnant women were regarded as mild severity and persisted for an average of 3 days. In group 2 in 13 (59%) of patients ARI of moderate severity was noted and the recovery occurred at day 6. Pyo-inflammatory diseases of ENT organs appeared in 10 (45.4%) of patients. Respiratory infections were determined in 16 (32.7%) of them: coronaviruses--in 5 (10.2%), rhinoviruses--in 3 (6.2%), respiratory syncytial viruses--in 6 (12.3%), parainfluenza (type 2) and influenza A viruses--1 (2%) both, without significant differences between the observed groups. Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mitis, Moraxella catarrhalis, Corynebacterium spp., Streptococcus pyogenes with the predominance of the latter in 36.7% and 60% of cases, respectively, in pregnant women of the group 2 (p < 0.01), were detected in the microflora of the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION Viferon preparation therapy prescribed at day 1 of outpatient visit of pregnant women may promote mild course o fARI and prophylaxis of complications of upper respiratory tract.","Kostinov, M P; Meshcheriakova, A K; Foshina, E P; Tarbaeva, D A; Savis'ko, A A; Zaĭtseva, E V","Zhurnal mikrobiologii, epidemiologii, i immunobiologii",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23163028/,290

192066,New Technique: Acute Minced Expansion Graft of Traumatic Wound Tissue.,2016,"Coronaviruses are the enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with the largest RNA genomes known. Several features make these viruses attractive as vaccine and therapeutic vectors: (i) deletion of their nonessential genes is strongly attenuating; (ii) the genetic space thus created allows insertion of foreign information; and (iii) their tropism can be modified by manipulation of the viral spike. We studied here their ability to serve as expression vectors by inserting two different foreign genes and evaluating systematically the genomic position dependence of their expression, using a murine coronavirus as a model. Renilla and firefly luciferase expression cassettes, each provided with viral transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs), were inserted at several genomic positions, both independently in different viruses and combined within one viral genome. Recombinant viruses were generated by using a convenient method based on targeted recombination and host cell switching. In all cases high expression levels of the foreign genes were observed without severe effects on viral replication in vitro. The expression of the inserted gene appeared to be dependent on its genomic position, as well as on the identity of the gene. Expression levels increased when the luciferase gene was inserted closer to the 3' end of the genome. The foreign gene insertions generally reduced the expression of upstream viral genes. The results are consistent with coronavirus transcription models in which the transcription from upstream TRSs is attenuated by downstream TRSs. Altogether, our observations clearly demonstrate the potential of coronaviruses as (multivalent) expression vectors.","de Haan, Cornelis A M; van Genne, Linda; Stoop, Jeroen N; Volders, Haukeline; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14557617/,290

193576,The changing world of biocontainment and biosecurity.,2007,"OBJECTIVE An epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) hit Beijing, China, between March and July 2003 with an attack rate of 1.9 per 10 thousand. (2,521 cases). To control the epidemic of SARS, a total of 30,173 residents were quarantined either in their residence or in quarantine sites. In order to understand the personal need of being quarantined and to estimate the risk of developing SARS during the quarantine period, a survey on the quarantined residents of Haidian District, Beijing, China was carried out. METHODS 33 precincts in Haidian District divided into five groups (7 in north, 6 in south, 7 in west, 6 in east and 7 in central of Haidian District) according to the location of the precincts were involved. The director of Center of Disease Control and Prevention of Haidian District was asked to select 1 precinct from each group according to the workload of the precinct quarantine officers. From those 5 precincts we obtained lists of all quarantined persons from the precinct quarantine officers. All quarantinees were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. The SARS patients were diagnosed and verified according to the diagnosis criteria released by Chinese Ministry of Health which was equivalent to the SARS 'probable case' definition of WHO. All SARS cases had been reported to the relative authorities. RESULTS By May 23, 2003, 5,186 persons had been quarantined in Haidian district, accounting for 0.23% of all residents. 1,028 of sampled quarantined residents completed the questionnaire. Of those who completed the questionnaire, 2.3% (95% CI: 1.5% - 3.5%) developed SARS while under quarantine. The median quarantine period was 14 days (range 1 day to 28 days). 61% of the quarantinees had a direct contact history with SARS patients, and all secondary SARS patients developed through contact to these quarantinees. The remaining 39% quarantinees who did not have a direct contact history with SARS patients had not developed SARS during the period under quarantine. 37% of the quarantees had direct contact during original patients' symptomatic period with an AR of 6.3%. Persons who looked after the illed SARS patient(s) during their symptomatic period, had an highest attack rate of 31% (95% CI: 20% - 44%). 63% (95% CI: 60% - 66%) of the total quarantined persons did not have direct contact with a SARS patient during his/her symptomatic period, with an attack rate of 0% (95% CI: 0% - 0.73%). CONCLUSION Only those persons having direct contact with ill SARS patients need to be under quarantine. The overall cost for quarantine on SARS prevention could be reduced by as much as 63% if the quarantine program was limited to this group. No evidence was found that SARS patient was infective during the incubation period.","Ou, Jian-ming; Dun, Zhe; Li, Qin; Qin, An-li; Zeng, Guang",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14761622/,290

A definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 is made after a positive result is obtained on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. In Singapore, rigorous contact tracing was practised to contain the spread of the virus. Nasal swabs and chest radiographs (CXR) were also taken from individuals who were suspected to be infected by COVID-19 upon their arrival at a centralised screening centre. From our experience, about 40% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had initial CXR that appeared ""normal"". In this case series, we described the temporal evolution of COVID-19 in patients with an initial ""normal"" CXR. Since CXR has limited sensitivity and specificity in COVID-19, it is not suitable as a first-line diagnostic tool. However, when CXR changes become unequivocally abnormal, close monitoring is recommended to manage potentially severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Zhou, Joel C; Hui, Terrence Ch; Tan, Cher Heng; Khoo, Hau Wei; Young, Barnaby E; Lye, David C; Lee, Yeong Shyan; Kaw, Gregory Jl","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33000108/,290

Improved investigative and diagnostic tools-necessary to understand disease processes and to identify subclinical infection-are much sought after. Here, we describe the production of single-chain antibodies with defined specificity for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis surface proteins. Single-chain antibodies (scFv) were generated from sheep with Johne's disease by cloning heavy-chain and lambda light-chain variable regions and expressing these in fusion with gene III of filamentous phages. Two scFv clones (designated SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2) were shown to be immunoreactive against M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis surface targets by flow cytometry, and immunoblotting identified specificity for a 34-kDa proteinase-susceptible determinant. Both antibodies were cross-reactive against Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium but nonreactive against Mycobacterium bovis or Mycobacterium phlei cells and were shown to be capable of enriching M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells by a factor of approximately 10(6)-fold when employed in magnetic bead separation of mixed Mycobacterium sp. cultures. Further, magnetic bead separation using SurfS1.2 and SurfS2.2 was capable of isolating as few as 10(3) M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells from ovine fecal samples, indicating the diagnostic potential of these reagents. Finally, inclusion of SurfS1.2 or SurfS2.2 in in vitro broth culture with M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis indicated that surface binding activity did not impede bacterial growth, although colony clumping was prevented. These results are discussed in terms of the potential use of single-chain phage display monoclonal antibodies as novel diagnostic reagents.","Berger, Sven; Hinz, Dominik; Bannantine, John P; Griffin, J Frank T",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16960114/,290
195170,Combined laparoscopic excisional surgery for synchronous endometrial and rectal adenocarcinoma in an obese woman.,2016,"We have previously identified a functionally essential bulged stem-loop in the 3' untranslated region of the positive-stranded RNA genome of mouse hepatitis virus. This 68-nucleotide structure is composed of six stem segments interrupted by five bulges, and its structure, but not its primary sequence, is entirely conserved in the related bovine coronavirus. The functional importance of individual stem segments of this stem-loop was characterized by genetic analysis using targeted RNA recombination. We also examined the effects of stem segment mutations on the replication of mouse hepatitis virus defective interfering RNAs. These studies were complemented by enzymatic and chemical probing of the stem-loop. Taken together, our results confirmed most of the previously proposed structure, but they revealed that the terminal loop and an internal loop are larger than originally thought. Three of the stem segments were found to be essential for viral replication. Further, our results suggest that the stem segment at the base of the stem-loop is an alternative base-pairing structure for part of a downstream, and partially overlapping, RNA pseudoknot that has recently been shown to be necessary for bovine coronavirus replication.","Hsue, B; Hartshorne, T; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10888630/,290

Serial RT-PCRs for SARS-CoV were performed in the nasopharyngeal aspirate, stool and urine of 45 SARS patients who survived until discharge. All patients had at least one site that was positive for SARS-CoV on presentation. Time to RT-PCR conversion was studied in all patients. There were 15 males (33.3%) and 30 females (66.7%), with a mean+/- SD age of 40.7+/-14.7 yrs. The median (range) time of RT-PCR conversion was 30 days (2-81). On discharge from the hospital, 18 (40%) remained RT-PCR positive in at least one site. For patients with positive RT-PCR on discharge, the median (range) time to RT-PCR conversion after discharge was 13 days (2-60). A significant proportion of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients remained RT-PCR positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus for a substantial duration after discharge. The clinical significance is unknown and this finding merits further study.

195584,Transgenesis for the study and the control of lactation.,2002,"Outbreaks of an unexplained acute neurologic illness affecting young children and associated with high case-fatality rates have been reported in the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar state in India since 1995. The outbreaks generally peak in June and decline weeks later with the onset of monsoon rains. There have been multiple epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of this syndrome, leading to a wide spectrum of proposed causes for the illness, including infectious encephalitis and exposure to pesticides. An association between illness and litchi fruit has been postulated because Muzaffarpur is a litchi fruit-producing region. To better characterize clinical and epidemiologic features of the illness that might suggest its cause and how it can be prevented, the Indian National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and CDC investigated outbreaks in 2013 and 2014. Clinical and laboratory findings in 2013 suggested a noninflammatory encephalopathy, possibly caused by a toxin. A common laboratory finding was low blood glucose (<70 mg/dL) on admission, a finding associated with a poorer outcome; 44% of all cases were fatal. An ongoing 2014 investigation has found no evidence of any infectious etiology and supports the possibility that exposure to a toxin might be the cause. The outbreak period coincides with the month-long litchi harvesting season in Muzaffarpur. Although a specific etiology has not yet been determined, the 2014 investigation has identified the illness as a hypoglycemic encephalopathy and confirmed the importance of ongoing laboratory evaluation of environmental toxins to identify a potential causative agent, including markers for methylenecyclopropylglycine (MCPG), a compound found in litchi seeds known to cause hypoglycemia in animal studies. Current public health recommendations are focused on reducing mortality by urging affected families to seek prompt medical care, and ensuring rapid assessment and correction of hypoglycemia in ill children.","Shrivastava, Aakash; Srikantiah, Padmini; Kumar, Anil; Bhushan, Gyan; Goel, Kapil; Kumar, Satish; Kumar, Tripurari; Mohankumar, Raju; Pandey, Rajesh; Pathan, Parvez; Tulsian, Yogita; Pappanna, Mohan; Pasi, Achhelal; Pradhan, Arghya; Singh, Pankaj; Somashekar, D; Velayudhan, Anoop; Yadav, Rajesh; Chhabra, Mala; Mittal, Veena; Khare, Shashi; Sejvar, James J; Dwivedi, Mayank; Laserson, Kayla; Earhart, Kenneth C; Sivaperumal, P; Kumar, A Ramesh; Chakrabarti, Amit; Thomas, Jerry; Schier, Joshua; Singh, Ram; Singh, Ravi Shankar; Dhariwal, A C; Chauhan, L S",MMWR.

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a swift adoption of telehealth to avoid patient and provider exposure. This study analyzed patient and surgeon satisfaction with telehealth within the department of orthopedic surgery during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS All orthopedic surgery patients who partici-pated in telehealth from March 30 to April 30, 2020, were sent a 14-question survey via e-mail. Orthopedic surgeons who used telehealth were sent a separate 14-question survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using univariate proportional odds and multivariate partial proportional odds models. RESULTS Three hundred and eighty-two patients and 33 surgeons completed the surveys. On average, patients were ""satisfied"" with telehealth (4.25/5.00 ± 0.96), and 37.0% preferred future visits to be conducted using telehealth. Multivariate partial proportional odds modeling determined that patients who found it easiest to arrange the telehealth visit had greater satisfaction (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-3.00/5.00: OR = 3.058; 95% CI = 1.621 to 5.768, p < 0.001), as did patients who believed they were able to communicate most effectively (5.00/5.00 vs. 1.00-4.00/5.00: OR = 20.268; 95% CI = 5.033 to 81.631, p < 0.001). Surgeons were similarly ""satisfied"" with telehealth (3.94/5.00 ± 0.86), and while their physical examinations were only ""moderately effec-tive"" (2.64/5.00 ± 0.99), they were ""fairly confident"" in their diagnoses (4.03/5.00 ± 0.64). Lastly, 36.7% ± 24.7% of surgeons believed that their telehealth patients required an in-person visit, and 93.9% of surgeons will continue using telehealth in the future. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth emerged as a valuable tool for the delivery of health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. While both patients and surgeons were satisfied with its use, this study identifies areas that can improve the patient and surgeon experience. The effectiveness and satisfaction with telehealth should inform regulatory and reimbursement policy.","Buchalter, Daniel; Moses, Michael; Azad, Ali; Kirby, David; Huang, Shengnan; Bosco Iii, Joseph; Yang, S Steven",Bulletin of the Hospital for Joint Disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207143/,290

A number of immunologic and molecular studies of the clinical samples led to the conclusion that a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was associated with the outbreak. Later, a SARS resequencing GeneChip was developed by Affymetrix to characterize the complete genome of SARS-CoV on a single GeneChip. The present study was carried out to evaluate the performance of SARS resequencing GeneChips. Two human SARS-CoV strains (CDC#200301157 and Urbani) were resequenced by the SARS GeneChips. Five overlapping PCR amplicons were generated for each strain and hybridized with these GeneChips. The successfully hybridized GeneChips generated nucleotide sequences of nearly complete genomes for the two SARS-CoV strains with an average call rate of 94.6%. Multiple alignments of nucleotide sequences obtained from SARS GeneChips and conventional sequencing revealed full concordance. Furthermore, the GeneChip-based analysis revealed no additional polymorphic sites. The results of this study suggest that GeneChip-based genome characterization is fast and reproducible. Thus, SARS resequencing GeneChips may be employed as an alternate tool to obtain genome sequences of SARS-CoV strains pathogenic for humans in order to further understand the transmission dynamics of these viruses.","Sulaiman, Irshad M; Liu, Xin; Frace, Michael; Sulaiman, Nikhat; Olsen-Rasmussen, Melissa; Neuhaus, Elizabeth; Rota, Paul A; Wohlhueter, Robert M",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16391044/,290

Furthermore, nuclear translocation of activated STAT1 and a range of interferon-stimulated genes could be demonstrated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected macaques. In line with these observations, plasmacytoid dendritic cells have been shown to produce interferons upon SARS-CoV infection in vitro. Given the pivotal role of interferons during viral infections, (differential) induction of interferons may affect the outcome of the infection.

As the spread of COVID-19 infection continues worldwide, measures to protect frontline doctors have been in the spotlight on international biosecurity discussions especially in countries with weak health system and infrastructure. AIM The study was aimed at describing the drivers, barriers, benefits and perceived dangers of utilization of COVID-19 biosecurity protective items at the point of care among frontline doctors in non-COVID-19 hospitals in Abia State. METHODS This was a cross-sectional study on 220 frontline doctors in Abia State. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaire that elicited information on utilization of COVID-19 biosecurity items (face masks, face shields, hand sanitizers, disinfectant sprays, hand gloves). The drivers, barriers, benefits, and perceived dangers of utilization of biosecurity items were also studied. Utilization was assessed in the preceding 7 days and graded using utilization ordinal scoring system of 0-4 as follows: Always=4 points; most times=3 points; occasional=2 points, rarely=1 point and never=0 point. Those that scored 1 and above were graded as users while 0 score was graded as non-user. RESULTS The study participants were aged 24-68 years (mean=32±8.4 years). There were 162(73.6%) males. All the respondents (100%) had used at least one of the biosecurity protective items in the previous 7 days. The most commonly used biosecurity items were face masks (100%) and hand-gloves (100%). Others included hand sanitizers (90.0%), face shields (55.5%) and disinfectant sprays (43.2%). The most common driver was availability of biosecurity items (100.0%). The commonest barrier was physical discomfort and fatigue (100.0%). The commonest benefits were self-protection from contracting COVID-19 (100.0%) and prevention of transmission to patients, colleagues and significant others (100.0%). The most commonly perceived dangers were suffocation (87.7%) and skin irritation (76.4%) for face masks and hand sanitizers respectively.

The objective of this work is to investigate the action plan on breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 and her newborn. METHODS A literature search has been conducted through the Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, BVS, and Cuiden databases. The methodological quality of the articles has been assessed using the ""Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation"" (GRADE). This study has not been registered in PROSPERO. RESULTS A total of 14 documents have been found, of which 9 are observational empirical studies. Most of the studies were conducted in China, Italy, the USA, and Australia. A total of 114 mothers infected with coronavirus with their respective newborns have been assessed. The analyzed investigations state that it is best for the newborn to be breastfed; given that mother's milk samples were analyzed, detecting the presence of antibodies of the coronavirus in them, being a protective factor against infection. CONCLUSIONS Breastfeeding in postpartum women with SARS-CoV-2 is highly recommended for the newborn, if the health of the mother and newborn allow it. When direct breastfeeding is favoured, the appropriate respiratory hygiene measures always have to be considered. Whether the mother's health does not permit direct breastfeeding, her breast milk should be previously extracted and kept unpasteurized. To secure the newborn feeding, milk banks are also an appropriate option.","Fernández-Carrasco, Francisco Javier; Vázquez-Lara, Juana María; González-Mey, Urbano; Gómez-Salgado, Juan; Parrón-Carreño, Tesifón; Rodríguez-Díaz, Luciano",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32458823/,290

There is a requirement for sensitive and rapid diagnostic techniques in order to improve both the diagnosis of infections and the quality of surveillance systems. A new three-dimensional biochip platform (Flow-Thru Chip; MetriGenix) was used to develop a rapid and reliable molecular method for the typing and subtyping of influenza viruses. Oligonucleotide probes immobilized in microchannels of a silicon wafer were selected to recognize multiple fragments of the influenza A virus matrix protein gene; the influenza B virus NS gene; the H1, H3, and H5 hemagglutinin genes; and the N1 and N2 neuraminidase genes. Biotinylated amplicons resulting from either multiplex or random reverse transcription-PCR were hybridized to arrayed oligonucleotides on the influenza virus chip before they were stained with horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin and were imaged by use of a chemiluminescent substrate. The chip analysis procedure, from the time of pipetting of the sample into the chip cartridge to the time of analysis of the results, was performed in less than 5 h. The random PCR exhibited a higher level of performance than the multiplex PCR in terms of the specificity of product hybridization to the influenza virus chip. Analysis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H1N2, and H5N1) and influenza B viruses showed that this microarray-based method is capable of the rapid and unambiguous identification of all types and subtypes of viruses by use of random PCR products. The redundancy of the probes designed for each gene selected yielded an additional criterion of confidence for the subtyping of viruses which are known for antigenic variations in some of their components.","Kessler, Nicole; Ferraris, Olivier; Palmer, Kevin; Marsh, Wayne; Steel, Adam",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15131186/,290
201043,Fighting the first wave. Why the Coronavirus was tackled so differently across the globe,2021,"An isolate of SARS coronavirus (strain 2003VA2774) was obtained from a patient and used to infect Vero E6 cells. The replication cycle of the virus was followed from 1 to 30 h post-infection (p.i.). It was surprising to observe the swift growth of this human virus in Vero cells. Within the first hour of infection, the most obvious ultrastructural change was the proliferation of the Golgi complexes and related vesicles accompanied by swelling of some of the trans-Golgi sacs. Extracellular virus particles were present by 5 h p.i. in about 5 % of the cells and this increased dramatically to about 30 % of the cell population within an hour (6 h p.i.). Swollen Golgi sacs contained virus nucleocapsids at different stages of maturation. These virus precursors were also in large vacuoles and in close association with membrane whorls. The membrane whorls could be the replication complexes, since they appeared rather early in the replication cycle. As infection progressed from 12 to 21 h p.i., the cytoplasm of the infected cells was filled with numerous large, smooth-membraned vacuoles containing a mixture of mature virus and spherical cores. Several of these vacuoles were close to the cell periphery, ready to export out the mature progeny virus particles via exocytosis. By 24 to 30 h p.i., crystalline arrays of the extracellular virus particles were seen commonly at the cell surface.","Ng, M-L; Tan, S-H; See, E-E; Ooi, E-E; Ling, A-E",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14645910/,290

In the Czech Republic, the proportional representation of orofacial tumors ranges around 2% of the total number of malignancies. Rational treatment of these tumors is complex and long. In the course of therapeutic planning, you have to consider the age of the patient and the stage of the disease including the presence of distant metastases. Removal of the tumor with a sufficient safety margin and an eventual treatment of the relevant lymphatic system according to the type of the tumor is an important prerequisite for the success of the surgical therapy. Reconstructive procedures in maxillofacial oncosurgery presume good interdisciplinary cooperation and a high professional preparedness of the surgical and nursing team. Selection of the right patient is also very important with regard to the risks of both local and systemic postoperative complications. Use of the free flap techniques is currently the gold standard, but it is also necessary to master pedicled flap techniques, whose advantages lie in simpler technique and often better aesthetic results. At the same time, we have to realize that even traditional, classical reconstructive procedures using prosthetic replacements can still represent the ideal solution in many cases.","Pink, R; Dvořák, Z; Heinz, P; Michl, P; Tvrdý, P",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911940/,290

201905,Next-generation COVID-19 vaccines: here come the proteins,2021,"The viral membrane proteins M and E are the minimal requirements for the budding of coronavirus particles. Since the E protein occurs in particles only in trace amounts, the lateral interactions between the M proteins apparently generate the major driving force for envelope formation. By using coimmunoprecipitation and envelope incorporation assays, we provide extensive evidence for the existence of such M-M interactions. In addition, we determined which domains of the M protein are involved in this homotypic association, using a mutagenetic approach. Mutant M proteins which were not able to assemble into viruslike particles (VLPs) by themselves (C. A. M. de Haan, L. Kuo, P. S. Masters, H. Vennema, and P. J. M. Rottier, J. Virol. 72:6838-6850, 1998) were tested for the ability to associate with other M proteins and to be rescued into VLPs formed by assembly-competent M proteins. We found that M proteins lacking parts of the transmembrane cluster, of the amphipathic domain, or of the hydrophilic carboxy-terminal tail, or M proteins that had their luminal domain replaced by heterologous ectodomains, were still able to associate with assembly-competent M proteins, resulting in their coincorporation into VLPs. Only a mutant M protein in which all three transmembrane domains had been replaced lost this ability. The results indicate that M protein molecules interact with each other through multiple contact sites, particularly at the transmembrane level. Finally, we tested the stringency with which membrane proteins are selected for incorporation into the coronavirus envelope by probing the coassembly of some foreign proteins. The observed efficient exclusion from budding of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and the equine arteritis virus M protein indicates that envelope assembly is indeed a highly selective sorting process. The low but detectable incorporation of CD8 molecules, however, demonstrated that this process is not perfect.","de Haan, C A; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10799570/,290
202126,Pandemic planning: plotting a course through the coronawars,2020,"Recent studies suggest that infectious viruses and particularly persisting viral RNAs often exist as diverse populations or ""quasispecies"". We have developed an approach to characterize populations of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) generated during persistent infection which has allowed us to begin to address the role of the viral quasispecies in MHV pathogenesis. We analyzed the population of persisting viral RNAs using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification (RT-PCR) of the S1 ""hypervariable"" region of the spike gene followed by differential colony hybridization to identify spike deletion variants (SDVs) from acute and persistently infected mice. Sequence analysis revealed that mice with the most severe chronic paralysis harbored the most complex quasispecies. Mapping of the SDVs to the predicted RNA secondary structure of the spike RNA revealed that an isolated stem loop structure is frequently deleted. Overall, these results are consistent with high frequency recombination at sites of RNA secondary structure contributing to expansion of the viral quasispecies and persisting viral pathogenesis.","Rowe, C L; Baker, S C; Nathan, M J; Sgro, J Y; Palmenberg, A C; Fleming, J O",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782355/,290
202188,Convergence of Digital Pathology and Artificial Intelligence Tools in Anatomic Pathology Practice: Current Landscape and Future Directions,2020,"CONTEXT In the United States, 10% of the population was born outside of its borders. Immigrants and their children frequently return to visit their homeland, referred to as visiting friends and relatives (VFRs). They account for a disproportionately high volume of international travel. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Searches of MEDLINE, World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, International Society of Travel Medicine, and American Society of Tropical Medicine computerized databases, conference proceedings and abstracts, US Census Bureau, bibliographies of pertinent articles, and travel medicine texts. Priority was given to recent (1996-2003) evidence, addressing VFR travelers. General sources including travel medicine and immigrant health were also used. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Immigrants visiting friends and relatives experience excessive rates of travel-related morbidity and mortality. Lack of pretravel care is common due to patient and clinician barriers to care, preexisting health beliefs, and incomplete childhood vaccinations. Travel patterns increase risk with VFRs traveling to high-risk destinations. Susceptibility to infectious and noninfectious illnesses is often increased because of multiple preexisting medical problems and extremes of age. Infectious diseases differ in etiology and magnitude from those of traditional travelers. For example with malaria, VFRs are frequently prescribed inappropriate prophylaxis or take none at all, have longer stays, spend time in high-risk areas, and do not appropriately adhere to chemoprophylaxis regimens. Effective pretravel health advice, guidelines, and services for this high-risk population are essential. There are already a number of useful and readily available databases that may aid clinicians in providing optimal travel-related preventive and therapeutic care. CONCLUSIONS Immigrants who are visitors of friends and relatives in other countries account for a high volume of international travelers and are at markedly increased risk of travel-related illness. New strategies are needed to properly address the needs of VFR travelers. Pretravel services should be convenient, accessible, affordable, culturally competent, and if possible, located within clinics serving immigrant populations. Clinicians caring for VFRs should be knowledgeable about their travel-related risks and have access to regularly updated, detailed pretravel health information.","Bacaner, Nina; Stauffer, Bill; Boulware, David R; Walker, Patricia F; Keystone, Jay S",JAMA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15199037/,290

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe and 880 non-severe cases. All patients were followed up for 3 months after discharge. The symptomatic features and follow-up data of the patients in both groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60.0%), cough (50.8%) and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms. In total, 32.7% of the severe cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, which was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group (P = 0.0015). The incidence of olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia was only 3.1% and 6.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for over 5 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.26-5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (OR 14.19, 95% CI 7.01-28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19. During the follow-up, cough (6.2%), dyspnea (7.2%), fatigue (1.8%), olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia (1.5%) were the significant remaining symptoms.

204594,Disinfection of corona virus in histopathology laboratories,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid dissemination of scientific and medical discoveries. Current platforms available for the distribution of scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journals. In recent times, social media has emerged as a helpful platform to share scientific and medical discoveries. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively analyze activity on social media (specifically, Twitter) and that related to publications in the form of preprint and peer-reviewed journal articles in the context of COVID-19 and gastroenterology during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: COVID-19-related data from Twitter (tweets and user data) and articles published in preprint servers (bioRxiv and medRxiv) as well as in the PubMed database were collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ-specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationship between Twitter activity and preprint articles published and that between Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system, and by geographic location were identified using Spearman's rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7164 journal publications, and 4702 preprint publications were retrieved. Twitter activity (ie, number of tweets) peaked in March 2020, whereas preprint and publication activity (ie, number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between trends in Twitter activity and preprint and publication activity (P<.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the three platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology or critical care, but when analyzing the field of gastroenterology specifically, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal gastroenterology. Furthermore, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter and publication activity for all gastroenterology topics (luminal gastroenterology: P=.009; hepatology and inflammatory bowel disease: P=.006; gastrointestinal endoscopy: P=.007), except pancreatology (P=.20), suggesting that Twitter activity did not correlate with publication activity for this topic. Finally, Twitter activity was the highest in the United States (7331 tweets), whereas PubMed activity was the highest in China (1768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the potential of social media as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading information on COVID-19 in a timely manner during the pandemic has been paramount; this was achieved at a much faster pace on social media, particularly on Twitter. Future investigation could demonstrate how social media can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity, especially as the world begins to increasingly rely on digital or virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of social media in augmenting public awareness regarding their scholarly pursuits.","Taneja, Sonia L; Passi, Monica; Bhattacharya, Sumona; Schueler, Samuel A; Gurram, Sandeep; Koh, Christopher",J Med Internet Res,,290

205309,Checklist of african soapy saponin—rich plants for possible use in communities’ response to global pandemics,2021,"This paper studies the dynamics of human mobility during the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries around the world. The main goal of the analysis is to empirically separate voluntary reductions in mobility driven by the information about the location-specific pandemic trends from the effects of the government-imposed social distancing mandates. Google human mobility dataset is used to track the dynamics of mobility across a wide range of categories (e.g. workplace, retail and recreational activities, etc), while information on country-specific counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths is used as a proxy for the information about the spread of the pandemic available to the population. A detailed index of stringency of the government-imposed social distancing policies in around 100 countries is used as a measure of government response. We find that human mobility does respond in a significant way to the information about the spread of the pandemic. This channel can explain about 15 percentage points of the overall reduction in mobility across the affected countries. At the same time, our results imply that government-imposed policies account for the majority of the reduction in the mobility observed during this period.","Mendolia, Silvia; Stavrunova, Olena; Yerokhin, Oleg",Journal of economic behavior and organization,,290

Here we identify novel variants and sub-types of SARS-CoV-2 by clustering sequences in adapting methods originally designed for haplotyping intra-host viral populations. We asses our results using clustering entropy -- the first time it has been used in this context. Our clustering approach reaches lower entropies compared to other methods, and we are able to boost this even further through gap filling and Monte Carlo based entropy minimization. Moreover, our method clearly identifies the well-known Alpha variant in the UK and GISAID datasets, but is also able to detect the much less represented (< 1% of the sequences) Beta (South Africa), Epsilon (California), Gamma and Zeta (Brazil) variants in the GISAID dataset. Finally, we show that each variant identified has high selective fitness, based on the growth rate of its cluster over time. This demonstrates that our clustering approach is a viable alternative for detecting even rare subtypes in very large datasets.","Melnyk, Andrew; Mohebbi, Fatemeh; Knyazev, Sergey; Sahoo, Bikram; Hosseini, Roya; Skums, Pavel; Zelikovskiy, Alexandr; Patterson, Murray D",,,290

In these tough times of COVID-19 it is necessary to build a model that detects people with and without mask in real-time as it works as a simple precautionary measure to prevent the spread of virus. If deployed correctly, this machine learning technique helps in simplifying the work of frontline warriors and saving their lives. A basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built using TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn and OpenCV to make the algorithm as accurate as possible. Javascript API helps in accessing webcam for real-time face mask detection. Since Google Colab runs on web browser it can't access local hardware like a camera without APIs. The proposed work contains three stages: (i) pre-processing, (ii) Training a CNN and (iii) Real-time classification. The first part is the Pre-processing section, which can be divided into 'Grayscale Conversion' of RGB image, 'image resizing and normalization' to avoid false predictions. Then the proposed CNN, classifies faces with and without masks as the output layer of proposed CNN architecture contains two neurons with Softmax activation to classify the same. Categorical cross-entropy is employed as loss function. The proposed model has Validation accuracy of 96%.

212591,Clare Gerada: A problem shared,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel envelope virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hallmarks of COVID-19 are a puzzling form of thrombophilia that has elevated D-dimer but only modest effects on other parameters of coagulopathy. This is combined with severe inflammation, often leading to acute respiratory distress and possible lethality. Coagulopathy and inflammation are interconnected by the transmembrane receptor, tissue factor (TF), which initiates blood clotting as a cofactor for factor VIIa (FVIIa)-mediated factor Xa (FXa) generation. TF also functions from within the nascent TF/FVIIa/FXa complex to trigger profound changes via protease-activated receptors (PARs) in many cell types, including SARS-CoV-2–trophic cells. Therefore, aberrant expression of TF may be the underlying basis of COVID-19 symptoms. Evidence suggests a correlation between infection with many virus types and development of clotting-related symptoms, ranging from heart disease to bleeding, depending on the virus. Since numerous cell types express TF and can act as sites for virus replication, a model envelope virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), has been used to investigate the uptake of TF into the envelope. Indeed, HSV1 and other viruses harbor surface TF antigen, which retains clotting and PAR signaling function. Strikingly, envelope TF is essential for HSV1 infection in mice, and the FXa-directed oral anticoagulant apixaban had remarkable antiviral efficacy. SARS-CoV-2 replicates in TF-bearing epithelial and endothelial cells and may stimulate and integrate host cell TF, like HSV1 and other known coagulopathic viruses. Combined with this possibility, the features of COVID-19 suggest that it is a TFopathy, and the TF/FVIIa/FXa complex is a feasible therapeutic target.","Pryzdial, Edward L.

The globally concerted effort to characterize viral genomic mutations across different clades has revealed several changes in the coding and also non-coding regions which might lead to a violent presentation or re-infection occurrence. Here, we studied a COVID-19 subject who represented the symptoms following the full recovery of the first infection. COVID-19 specific IgM and IgG were evaluated in both steps. The viral samples from oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal were subjected to RT-PCR and full sequencing was done in both incidences. The sequencing data was fully investigated with the reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the changes were detected. The obtained data is in favor of re-infection with 128 days of interval. SARS-CoV-2 presented more severely in the second episode of the disease and the specific antibodies against COVID-19 were not detectable. Both infections were caused by the same clade 20G, however, the mutation rates were higher in the second incidence including 10 nucleotide substitutions which had rarely been reported before. In the present study, the nucleotide mutations in various regions of the viral genome have been presented. The re-infection could have significant effect on clinical implications as well as vaccination.","Salehi-Vaziri, Mostafa; Omrani, Mir Davood; Pouriayevali, Mohammad Hassan; Fotouhi, Fatemeh; Banifazl, Mohammad; Farahmand, Behrokh; Sadat Larijani, Mona; Ahmadi, Zahra; Fereydouni, Zahra; Tavakoli, Mahsa; Jalali, Tahmineh; Ramezani, Amitis",Virus Res,,290

214171,Open Educational Resource Exercises for Fisheries Classes,2020,"Although many deem intermittent fasting (IF) a healthy dietary regimen, there is a paucity of scientific evidence to corroborate IF health benefits in human studies. However, its comparative ease and the emphasized benefits in the light of COVID-19 (e.g., weight loss and immunization improvement) have led to the increase of IF adoption. A vast number of intermittent fasters have not sought consultation from health professionals, which can bring adverse health effects. Most intermittent fasters use mobile apps to get assistance for IF. Types of assistance offered by the IF mobile applications may range from tracking (e.g., fasting periods, calorie intake) to obtaining knowledge about IF. However, it is unclear how much people are using the features for learning more about IF which is crucial to making healthier decisions in the IF adoption process. Thus, we organized our study into two stages for establishing design implications that further encourage a safety-conscious and user-friendly IF experience. We first investigated how IF app users who have chosen apps that provide extensive IF-specific knowledge acquire the said knowledge via (i) topic modeling of user app reviews, (ii) detecting modularity in co-word maps drawn from reviews specific to IF information acquisition, (iii) locating the position of keywords indicating information acquisition in the reviews. Then, we examined how users judge the effectiveness of knowledge provision interfaces in obtaining information. We investigated this aspect with an interface ranking user task for information tabs and organized user rationale using manual coding and co-word mapping. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Ryu, H.; Hong, S.",Lect.

Aim of the StudyThis study aimed to assess the prevalence and possible association between COVID-19 and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Patients and methodsA 9-item questionnaire was sent to 120 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with a response rate of 66.67%. This cross-sectional observational study included 80 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who did not require hospitalization or steroid therapy. ResultsOne or more HSV infections were observed in 28 patients (35%) with COVID-19 infection, including 10 males (35.7%) and 18 females (64.29%). Of the 28 patients, fever was reported in 17 patients (75%) during COVID-19. Most of the respondents (78%) described a single HSV reactivation, 14.29% had 2 attacks, and 7.14% experienced 3 attacks. Compared to previous non-COVID-19 related HSV reactivation, the COVID-19 related attacks were more severe in 12 patients (42.85%), equally severe in 5 patients (17.85%) and less severe in 1 patient (3.57%). Interestingly, 10 patients (35.71%) developed an initial symptomatic HSV attack during COVID-19 infection. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated a possible association between COVID-19 infection and primary HSV infection and/or reactivation. The COVID-19 direct neuronal effect in addition to COVID-19 related psychological stress, fever and immunological dysregulation could play a potential role.","Shanshal, Mohammed; Ahmed, Hayder Saad",,,290
214512,Investigating 3D printed Cartesian Divers,2021-07-02,"In medical imaging procedures for the detection of coronavirus, apart from medical tests, approval of diagnosis has special significance. Imaging procedures are also useful for detecting the damage caused by COVID-19. Chest X-ray imaging is frequently used to diagnose COVID-19 and different pneumonias. This paper presents a task-specific framework to detect coronavirus in X-ray images. Binary classification of three different labels (healthy, bacterial pneumonia, and COVID-19) was performed on two differentiated data sets in which corona is stated as positive. First-order statistics, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray level run length matrix, and gray level size zone matrix were analyzed to form fifteen sub-data sets and to ascertain the necessary radiomics. Two normalization methods are compared to make the data meaningful. Furthermore, five feature ranking approaches (Bhattacharyya, entropy, Roc, t-test, and Wilcoxon) are mentioned to provide necessary information to a state-of-the-art classifier based on Gauss-map-based chaotic particle swarm optimization and neural networks. The proposed framework was designed according to the analyses about radiomics, normalization approaches, and filter-based feature ranking methods. In experiments, seven metrics were evaluated to objectively determine the results: accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, g-mean, precision, and f-measure. The proposed framework showed promising scores on two X-ray-based data sets, especially with the accuracy and area under the ROC curve rates exceeding 99% for the classification of coronavirus vs. others.","Koyuncu, Hasan Barstuğan Mücahid",Signal Processing: Image Communication,,290
214641,The 38th Manfred Donike workshop on doping analysis,2020,"Background: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II characterized by monocytes CD14+ expression of human leukocyte antigen receptors (HLA-DR), is essential for the synapse between innate and adaptive immune response in infectious disease. Its reduced expression is associated with a high risk of secondary infections in septic patients and can be safely corrected by Interferon-y (IFNy) injection. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) induces an alteration of Interferon (IFN) genes expression potentially responsible for the observed low HLA-DR expression in circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR). Methods: We report a case of one-time INFy injection (100 mcg s.c.) in a superinfected 61-year-old man with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with monitoring of mHLA-DR expression and clinical tolerance. Observations: Low mHLA-DR pretreatment expression (26.7%) was observed. IFNy therapy leading to a rapid increase in mHLA-DR expression (83.1%). Conclusions: Severe ARDS in a COVID-19 patient has a deep reduction in mHLA-DR expression concomitantly with secondary infections. The unique IFNy injection was safe and led to a sharp increase in the expression of mHLA-DR. Based on immune and infection monitoring, more cases of severe COVID-19 patients with low mHLA-DR should be treated by IFNy to test the clinical effectiveness.","Dickel, Steffen; Grimm, Clemens; Amschler, Katharina; Schnitzler, Sebastian Uwe; Schanz, Julie; Moerer, Onnen; Payen, Didier; Tampe, Bjoern; Winkler, Martin Sebastian",Front Immunol,,290
214762,A Fluids Experiment for Remote Learners to Test the Unsteady Bernoulli Equation Using a Burette,2021-08-01,"The emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused a COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes a generally mild, but sometimes severe and even life-threatening infection, known as COVID-19. Currently, there exist no effective vaccines or drugs and, as such, global public authorities have so far relied upon non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Since COVID-19 symptoms are aspecific and may resemble a common cold, if it should come back with a seasonal pattern and coincide with the influenza season, this would be particularly challenging, overwhelming and straining the healthcare systems, particularly in resource-limited contexts, and would increase the likelihood of nosocomial transmission. In the present study, we devised a mathematical model focusing on the treatment of people complaining of influenza-like-illness (ILI) symptoms, potentially at risk of contracting COVID-19 or other emerging/re-emerging respiratory infectious agents during their admission at the health-care setting, who will occupy the detection kits causing a severe shortage of testing resources. The model is used to assess the effect of mass influenza vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory pathogens in the case of a coincidence of the outbreak with the influenza season. Here, we show that increasing influenza vaccine uptake or enhancing the public health interventions would facilitate the management of respiratory outbreaks coinciding with the peak flu season, especially, compensate the shortage of the detection resources. However, how to increase influenza vaccination coverage rate remains challenging. Public health decision- and policy-makers should adopt evidence-informed strategies to improve influenza vaccine uptake.","Li, Qian; Tang, Biao; Bragazzi, Nicola Luigi; Xiao, Yanni; Wu, Jianhong",Math Biosci,,290
216730,Understanding Factors that Influence Upskilling,2021-03-22,"BACKGROUND Hypertension is one of the most widespread health conditions in the world, and the molecular mechanism of it is still unclear. In this study, we identified the hub genes (hub miRNA genes) associated with hypertension and explored the relationship between hypertension miRNA-gene by constructing a mRNA co-expression network and a miRNA co-expression network, which can help to reveal the mechanism and predict the prognosis of hypertension progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS Based on gene expression profile data of hypertensive samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, WGCNA was used to detect hypertension-related biomarkers and key mRNA and miRNA modules. Then, DAVID was used to perform gene-annotation enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and miRPath were used for pathway analysis of mRNA and miRNAs genes. RESULTS We identified 3 key modules relating to hypertension, 2 mRNA modules named Msaddlebrown and Mgreenyellow and 1 miRNA module named Msalmon. In addition, 12 hub genes (RPL21, RPS28, LOC442727/PTGAP10, LOC100129599/RPS29P14, TBXAS1, FCER1G, CFP, FURIN, PECAM1, IGSF6, NCF1C, and LOC285296/UNC93B3) and 7 hub miRNAs (hsa-miR-1268a/b, hsa-miR-513c-3p, hsa-miR-4799-5p, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-miR-5195-5p, hsa-miR-219-2-3p, and hsa-miR-548d-5p) relating to hypertension were identified. HIF-1 signaling pathway and insulin signaling pathway were closely related to the 3 key modules. We also discovered 4 miRNAs (hsa-miR-548am-3p, hsa-miR-513c-3p, hsa-miR-182-5p, and hsa-miR-548d-5p) and 6 genes (IGF1R, GSK3B, FOXO1, PRKAR2B, HIF1A, and PIK3R1) were the core nodes in the hypertension-related miRNA-gene network, and hsa-miR-548am-3p was at the center of the network. CONCLUSIONS These findings will help improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of hypertension, and the discovered genes can serve as signatures for early diagnosis of hypertension.","Li, Zongjin; Chyr, Jacqueline; Jia, Zeyu; Wang, Lina; Hu, Xi; Wu, Xiaoming; Song, Changxin",Med Sci Monit,,290

However, an information-based solution for industry reopening is ineffective when the necessary operational information is locked up in disparate real-time data silos. There is a lot of ongoing effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic using different combinations of low-cost, location-based contact tracing, and sensing technologies. These ad hoc Internet of Things (IoT) solutions for COVID-19 were developed using different data models and protocols without an interoperable way to interconnect these heterogeneous systems and exchange data on people and place interactions. This research aims to design and develop an interoperable Internet of COVID-19 Things (IoCT) architecture that is able to exchange, aggregate, and reuse disparate IoT sensor data sources in order for informed decisions to be made after understanding the real-time risks in workplaces based on person-to-place interactions. The IoCT architecture is based on the Sensor Web paradigm that connects various Things, Sensors, and Datastreams with an indoor geospatial data model. This paper presents a study of what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first real-world integrated implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) and IndoorGML standards to calculate the risk of COVID-19 online using a workplace reopening case study. The proposed IoCT offers a new open standard-based information model, architecture, methodologies, and software tools that enable the interoperability of disparate COVID-19 monitoring systems with finer spatial-temporal granularity. A workplace cleaning use case was developed in order to demonstrate the capabilities of this proposed IoCT architecture. The implemented IoCT architecture included proximity-based contact tracing, people density sensors, a COVID-19 risky behavior monitoring system, and the contextual building geospatial data.","Liang, Steve H L; Saeedi, Sara; Ojagh, Soroush; Honarparvar, Sepehr; Kiaei, Sina; Mohammadi Jahromi, Mahnoush; Squires, Jeremy",Sensors (Basel),,290

We used multiple linear regression and predictive models to assess the correlations between antibody responses and demographic and clinical characteristics. IgG titers were greater than either IgM or IgA titers for S1, full-length S, and S-RBD in the overall population. Of the 126 plasma samples, 101 (80%) had detectable neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers. Using nAb titers as the reference, the IgG ELISAs confirmed 95%-98% of the nAb-positive samples, but 20%-32% of the nAb-negative samples were still IgG ELISA positive. Male sex, older age, and hospitalization for COVID-19 were associated with increased antibody responses across the serological assays.

We find that social capital differentials in COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations depend on the dimension of social capital and the timeframe considered. Communities with higher levels of relational and cognitive social capital were especially successful in lowering COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations than communities with lower social capital between late March and early April. A difference of one standard deviation in relational social capital corresponded to a reduction of 30% in the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded. After April 2020, differentials in COVID-19 deaths related to relational social capital persisted although they became progressively less pronounced. By contrast, the period of March-April 2020, our estimates suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths recorded in areas with different levels of cognitive social capital. In fact, from late June-early July onwards the number of new deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 was higher in communities with higher levels of cognitive social capital. The overall number of deaths recorded between January 2020 and January 2021 was lower in communities with higher levels of relational social capital.

Multiple treatment protocols have been proposed worldwide with no definitive answer for acure. A prior retrospective study showed association between bitter taste receptor 38 (T2R38) phenotypes and the severity of COVID-19. Based on this, we proposed assessing the different T2R38 phenotypes response towards a targeted treatment protocol. Starting July 2020 till December 2020, we tested subjects for T2R38 phenotypic expression (supertasters, tasters, and nontasters). Subjects who were subsequently infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (diagnosed via PCR) were included. Based on their taster status, supertasters were given dexamethasone for 4 days; tasters were given azithromycin and dexamethasone +/- hydroxychloroquine for 7 days; and nontasters were given azithromycin and dexamethasone for 12 days. Subjects were followed prospectively and their outcomes were documented. Seven hundred forty-seven COVID-19 patients were included, with 184 (24.7%) supertasters, 371 (49.6%) tasters, and192 (25.7%) nontasters. The average duration of symptoms with the treatment protocol was 5 days for supertasters, 8.1 days for tasters, and 16.2 days for nontasters. Only three subjects (0.4%) required hospitalization (3/3 nontasters). Targeted treatment protocol showed significant correlation (p < 0.05) based on patients' T2R38 phenotypic expression.

SoMe offers a unique and partially untapped potential to supplement formal medical education. OBJECTIVE: We detail a summary of the incentives, applications, challenges, and pitfalls of SoMe based medical education for both trainees and educators. METHODS: We performed a literature review via PubMed on medical research involving social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and podcasts. Papers were reviewed for inclusion based on the integrity and power of the study. RESULTS: The unique characteristics of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube. WhatsApp, and podcasts endow them with unique communication capabilities that serve different educational purposes in both the formal and informal education setting. However contemporary medical education curricula lack widespread guidance on meaningful use, application and deployment of social media in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and institutions must evolve to embrace the use of SoMe platforms for medical education. Healthcare professionals can approach SoMe engagement in the same ethical manner that they would with patients in real life but healthcare institutions ultimately must enable their healthcare professionals to do so by enacting realistic social media policies. Institutions should appoint clinicians with strong social media experience to leadership roles in order to spearhead these generational and cultural changes. Further studies are needed to better understand how healthcare professionals can best utilize social media as educational tools most effectively. Ultimately social media is here to stay influencing lay public knowledge and trainee knowledge. Clinicians and institutions must embrace this complementary modality of trainee education and champion social media as a novel distribution platform that can also help propagate truth in a time of misinformation.","Katz, Marc Neill; Nandi, Neilanjan",,,290

During this pandemic, the urgent surgical requirements will not stop. As an example, the most recent Centers of Disease Control and Prevention reports estimate that there are 2.8 million trauma patients hospitalized in the United States. These data illustrate an increase in the likelihood of encountering urgent surgical patients with either clinically suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the near future. Preparation for a pandemic involves considering the different levels in the hierarchy of controls and the different phases of the pandemic. Apart from the fact that this pandemic certainly involves many important health, economic, and community ramifications, it also requires several initiatives to mandate what measures are most appropriate to prepare for mitigating the occupational risks. This article provides evidence-based recommendations and measures for the appropriate personal protective equipment for different clinical and surgical activities in various settings. To reduce the occupational risk in treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 urgent orthopaedic patients, recommended precautions and preventive actions (triage area, emergency department consultation room, induction room, operating room, and recovery room) are reviewed.","Awad, Mohamed E; Rumley, Jacob C L; Vazquez, Jose A; Devine, John G",J Am Acad Orthop Surg,,290

236426,A fractional complex network model for novel corona virus in China,2021,"BACKGROUND: In times of pandemics, social distancing, isolation and quarantine have precipitated depression, anxiety and substance misuse. Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with Peer Support Workers (PSWs) will not only feel the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences, but that this interaction also fosters hope in the possibility of a recovery. However, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs where there are PSWs that has been evaluated. Data will be collected for a future Randomized Controlled Trial by determining an effect size that would be specifically attributable to PSWs. OBJECTIVE: The five principal research questions are whether this online intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery , (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users, beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. METHODS: Intervention: During the transitional and controlled online peer support groups, PSWs will simulate a typical unformal peer support group. They will have a personal-civic recovery focus, and they will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be two experimental sub-groups: patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10), and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10), compared to a control group (n=10). Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Allocation: Randomized Ratio: 2:1. RESULTS: Measures: Several instruments have been developed by clinicians and academics to assess clinical recovery. Based on their life narratives and to assess personal-civic recovery, measurement tools have also been developed through community-based participatory research; for instance the Recovery Assessment Scale and the Citizenship Measure questionnaires (personal-civic recovery). This pre-post research feasibility study of a trial is proposed to evaluate the outcomes on personal-civic recovery (primary outcome); and to assess its effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to the COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). The COVID Stress Scales and the measures of personal-civic recovery will be repeated, along with the following measures of clinical recovery: (i) Anxiety State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y6, (ii) Depression Patient Health Questionnaire, (iii) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, (iv) Drug Abuse Screening Test, (v) Psychosis Screening Questionnaire, and (vi) World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Change will be compared between groups from baseline to intervention vs. control group in the study outcome measures using the Student paired sample t test. Results are expected for December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated Knowledge Translation: Study results will provide reliable evidence on a web-based intervention provided by Peer Support Workers. The investigators, with key decision makers and patient partners, will ensure knowledge translation throughout and the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) on the Fundamentals of Recovery will be updated with the evidence and new knowledge generated by this feasibility study.

240778,President's Message,2020,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective measures to contain a pandemic. Yet, such control measures commonly have a negative effect on the economy. Here, we propose a macro-level approach to support resolving this Health-Economy Dilemma (HED). First, an extension to the well-known SEIR model is suggested which includes an economy model. Second, a bi-objective optimization problem is defined to study optimal control policies in view of the HED problem. Next, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are applied to perform a study on the health-economy performance trade-offs that are inherent to the obtained optimal policies. Finally, the results from the applied algorithms are compared to select a preferred algorithm for future studies. As expected, for the proposed models and strategies, a clear conflict between the health and economy performances is found. Furthermore, the results suggest that the guided usage of NPIs is preferable as compared to refraining from employing such strategies at all. This study contributes to pandemic modeling and simulation by providing a novel concept that elaborates on integrating economic aspects while exploring the optimal moment to enable NPIs.","Salgotra, Rohit; Seidelmann, Thomas; Fischer, Dominik; Mostaghim, Sanaz; Moshaiov, Amiram",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12279v1.pdf,290

This dynamic is likely complicated when graduates are transitioning to practice during a pandemic. Purpose The purpose of this study was to describe recent nurse graduates’ perceptions of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their transition from education to practice. Methods We conducted an online survey of BSN, RN-BSN, and DNP students who graduated between December 2019 and April 2020 (n=82), including demographics, employment information, and free-response questions about the impact of the pandemic on their transition experiences, post-graduation plans, and perceptions of nursing. We used a qualitative descriptive approach to content analysis to synthesize and summarize the data. Results Participants expressed three overarching concerns: 1) altered plans such as difficulty finding employment;2) logistical, system-related stressors including licensing delays and chaotic onboarding;and 3) feeling pride in profession despite perceiving ambivalence in public discourse. Conclusion COVID-19 exacerbated challenges often experienced by new graduates. Common stressors, intensified during the pandemic, could exert long-term effects on the workforce.

Although some studies have suggested higher viral loads and clinical sensitivity when testing saliva, studies have been relatively small and have given rise to contradictory results. To better understand the relative performance characteristics of saliva and upper airway samples, I performed a rapid systematic review (registered on PROSPERO as CRD42020205035), focusing on studies that included at least 20 subjects who provided diagnostic saliva and upper airway samples on the same day, which were tested by nucleic acid amplification methods and for which a confusion matrix could be constructed for based on a composite reference standard. Nineteen studies comprising 21 cohorts that met predetermined acceptance criteria were identified following a search of PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv. Seven of these cohorts were incorporated into a meta-analysis using a random effects model, which suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs are somewhat more sensitive than saliva samples for the diagnosis of early disease in ambulatory patients, such as in drive-through centers or community health centers. Nevertheless, the difference is modest, and the reduced need for personal protective equipment for saliva sampling may justify the difference. Conclusions are limited by the significant heterogeneity of disease prevalence in the study populations and variation in the approaches to saliva sample collection.","O039,; Leary, Timothy J",J. mol. diagn,,290

In this work we investigated an epidemic spread scenario in the Lombardy region by using the origin–destination matrix with information about the commuting flows among 1450 urban areas within the region. We performed a large-scale simulation-based modeling of the epidemic spread over the networks related to three main motivations, i.e., work, study and occasional transfers to quantify the potential contribution of each category of travellers to the spread of the epidemic process.

Data on specific job duties, living conditions, contact history, and clinical course were gathered. Environmental sampling was carried out to explore any association with infection. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with infection. RESULTS: Forty-seven mortuary workers provided an NPS and seven (14.9%) were PCR positive; 32 provided a blood sample and eight (25%) were antibody positive, six (75%) who were seropositive were also PCR positive. Among the 81 cemetery workers, 76 provided an NPS and five (6.6%) were PCR positive; 64 provided a blood sample and 22 (34.4%) were antibody positive, three (13.6%) who were seropositive were also PCR positive. Three (22.2%) and 20 (83.3%) of the infected mortuary and cemetery workers were asymptomatic, respectively. Age <30 years (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7-14.6), community exposure with a known case (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.7-13.3), and presence of symptoms in the preceding 2 weeks (OR 9.0, 95% CI 1.9-42.0) were independently associated with an increased risk of infection (PCR or antibody positive). Of the 46 environmental and surface samples, all were negative or had a Ct value of >35. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of mortuary and cemetery workers had evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was incidentally detected upon serologic testing. These data are most consistent with community acquisition rather than occupational acquisition.","Alishaq, Moza; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Nafady-Hego, Hanaa; Al Ajmi, Jameela Ali; Elgendy, Mohamed; Fadel, Rayyan Abdulaziz Attya; Thomas, Anil George; Alahmed, Mohammed A A; Ammar, Adham; Bensaad, Meryem; Al-Barghouthi, Bayan; Coyle, Peter; Elgendy, Hamed; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi; Butt, Adeel A",Int J Infect Dis,,290

A betegségnek három nagy szakasza van, melyek alapvetoen meghatározzák a kezelést. Az I-IIA fázisban az antivirális, míg a IIB-III. fázisban a gyulladásgátló kezelés áll elotérben, melyhez intenzív terápiás, szupportív kezelés csatlakozik. A jelen ajánlás kizárólag a gyógyszeres kezelésre vonatkozik, és a rendelkezésre álló bizonyítékok alapján foglalja össze a terápiás lehetoségeket. Emellett egy javasolt kezelési algoritmust is tartalmaz. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(17): 643-651. Summary. The novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) places a heavy burden on the health care system and our society. There are three major stages in the disease that fundamentally determine treatment approaches. Phases I-IIA require primarily antiviral treatment. In phases IIB-III, anti-inflammatory treatment is needed accompanied by intensive and supportive care. This recommendation applies only to pharmacotherapy and summarizes the therapeutic options based on the available evidence. It also includes a proposed treatment algorithm.

245007,Vaccination Is the Only Acceptable Path to Herd Immunity,2020,"The ongoing COVID-19 has precipitated a major global crisis, with 968,117 total confirmed cases, 612,782 total recovered cases and 24,915 deaths in India as of July 15, 2020. In absence of any effective therapeutics or drugs and with an unknown epidemiological life cycle, predictive mathematical models can aid in understanding of both coronavirus disease control and management. In this study, we propose a compartmental mathematical model to predict and control the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India with epidemic data up to April 30, 2020. We compute the basic reproduction number R 0, which will be used further to study the model simulations and predictions. We perform local and global stability analysis for the infection free equilibrium point E 0as well as an endemic equilibrium point E* with respect to the basic reproduction number R 0. Moreover, we showed the criteria of disease persistence for R 0&gt; 1. We conduct a sensitivity analysis in our coronavirus model to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission. We compute the sensitivity indices of the reproduction number R 0(which quantifies initial disease transmission) to the estimated parameter values. For the estimated model parameters, we obtained R 0=1.6632, which shows the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in India. Our model simulation demonstrates that the disease transmission rate β sis more effective to mitigate the basic reproduction number R 0. Based on estimated data, our model predict that about 60 days the peak will be higher for COVID-19 in India and after that the curve will plateau but the coronavirus diseases will persist for a long time.","Samui, Piu; Mondal, Jayanta; Khajanchi, Subhas",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,290

Healthcare systems have been forced to rapidly change practices in order to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers and preserve scare resources. Patients with acute myeloid leukemia are at increased risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2 not only due to immune compromise related to the malignancy but also due to the acuity of the disease and intensity of treatment. These issues have created unique challenges during this difficult time. In this article, we present the approaches taken by two groups of hematologist/oncologists, one in the United States and one in Italy, who have been caring for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients in the face of the pandemic.","Wilde, Lindsay; Isidori, Alessandro; Keiffer, Gina; Palmisiano, Neil; Kasner, Margaret",Front.

245402,Controlling COVID-19 via test-trace-quarantine,2021,"Background: Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light devices are effective in reducing contamination on N95 filtering facepiece respirators. However, limited information is available on whether UV-C devices meet the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) microbiological requirements for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for respirator bioburden reduction. Methods: We tested the ability of 2 UV-C light boxes to achieve the 3-log10 microorganism reductions required for EUA for reuse by single users. Whole 3M 1860 or Moldex 1513 respirators were inoculated on the exterior facepiece, interior facepiece, and internal fibers with bacteriophage MS2 and/or 4 strains of bacteria and treated with UV-C cycles of 1 or 20 minutes. Colorimetric indicators were used to assess penetration of UV-C through the respirators. Results: For 1 UV-C box, a 20-minute treatment achieved the required bioburden reduction for Moldex 1513 but not 3M 1860 respirators. For the second UV-C box, a 1-minute treatment achieved the required bioburden reduction in 4 bacterial strains for the Moldex 1513 respirator. Colorimetric indicators demonstrated penetration of UV-C through all layers of the Moldex 1513 respirator but not the 3M 1860 respirator. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that UV-C box technologies can achieve bioburden reductions required by the FDA for EUA for single users but highlight the potential for variable efficacy for different types of respirators. © 2021 Pathogens and Immunity.","Cadnum, J.

We collected kidney biopsies from COVID-19 AKI patients within 30 min after death in order to examine the histopathology and perform mRNA expression analysis of genes associated with renal injury. METHODS: This study involved histopathology and mRNA analyses of postmortem kidney biopsies collected from patients with COVID-19 (n = 6) and bacterial sepsis (n = 27). Normal control renal tissue was obtained from patients undergoing total nephrectomy (n = 12). The mean length of ICU admission-to-biopsy was 30 days for COVID-19 and 3-4 days for bacterial sepsis patients. RESULTS: We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in kidney biopsies from COVID-19-AKI patients yet lung tissue from the same patients was PCR positive. Extensive acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and peritubular thrombi were distinct histopathology features of COVID-19-AKI compared to bacterial sepsis-AKI. ACE2 mRNA levels in both COVID-19 (fold change 0.42, p = 0.0002) and bacterial sepsis patients (fold change 0.24, p < 0.0001) were low compared to control. The mRNA levels of injury markers NGAL and KIM-1 were unaltered compared to control tissue but increased in sepsis-AKI patients. Markers for inflammation and endothelial activation were unaltered in COVID-19 suggesting a lack of renal inflammation. Renal mRNA levels of endothelial integrity markers CD31, PV-1 and VE-Cadherin did not differ from control individuals yet were increased in bacterial sepsis patients (CD31 fold change 2.3, p = 0.0006, PV-1 fold change 1.5, p = 0.008). Angiopoietin-1 mRNA levels were downregulated in renal tissue from both COVID-19 (fold change 0.27, p < 0.0001) and bacterial sepsis patients (fold change 0.67, p < 0.0001) compared to controls. Moreover, low Tie2 mRNA expression (fold change 0.33, p = 0.037) and a disturbed VEGFR2/VEGFR3 ratio (fold change 0.09, p < 0.0001) suggest decreased microvascular flow in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In a small cohort of postmortem kidney biopsies from COVID-19 patients, we observed distinct histopathological and gene expression profiles between COVID-19-AKI and bacterial sepsis-AKI. COVID-19 was associated with more severe ATN and microvascular thrombosis coupled with decreased microvascular flow, yet minimal inflammation. Further studies are required to determine whether these observations are a result of true pathophysiological differences or related to the timing of biopsy after disease onset.","Volbeda, Meint; Jou-Valencia, Daniela; van den Heuvel, Marius C; Knoester, Marjolein; Zwiers, Peter J; Pillay, Janesh; Berger, Stefan P; van der Voort, Peter H J; Zijlstra, Jan G; van Meurs, Matijs; Moser, Jill",Crit Care,,290

A total of 336 non-duplicated residual serum samples that were obtained from COVID-19 confirmed patients (n=173) on PCR and negative controls (n=163) obtained pre-December 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic were used for the study. These were concurrently analysed on the different immunoassay platforms and correlated with clinical characteristics. Our results showed all assays had specificity ranging from 99.3% to 100.0%. Overall sensitivity across all days of symptoms, in descending order were OCD (49.1%, 95% CI 41.8-56.5%), cPass (44.8%, 95% CI 37.5-52.3%), Roche (41.6%, 95% CI 34.5-49.0%), Siemens (39.9%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%), Abbott (39.8%, 95% CI 32.9-47.3%) and Beckman (39.6%, 95% CI 32.5-47.3%). Testing after at least 14 days from symptom onset is required to achieve AUCs greater than 0.80.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of clinical characteristics and concomitant symptoms of chronic cough in predicting its cause. METHODS: We recruited adult patients with chronic cough as a primary presenting symptom and identified those with a single underlying cause. Clinical features of cough were recorded with a custom-designed questionnaire and the relationships between clinical features and cause of cough were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1162 patients with a single underlying cause were enrolled. Nocturnal cough alone was a predictor of cough variant asthma (odds ratio [OR], 2.037; 95% CI, 1.003-4.139) with high specificity (97.6%) and low sensitivity (8.1%). Heartburn (OR, 2.671; 95% CI, 1.544-4.620), belching (OR, 2.536; 95% CI, 1.620-3.971), and acid regurgitation (OR, 2.043; 95% CI, 1.299-3.212) indicated gastroesophageal reflux-related cough with high specificity (85.5%-94.9%) and low sensitivity (22.8%-40.7%). Cough after meals had a high specificity (91.2%) and a low sensitivity (24.8%) for gastroesophageal reflux-related cough. Postnasal dripping (OR, 2.317; 95% CI, 1.425-3.767) and history of sinusitis (OR, 4.137; 95% CI, 2.483-6.892) were indicators for upper airway cough syndrome with high specificity (80.8% and 90.2%, respectively). Rhinitis/sinusitis-related symptoms showed moderate sensitivity (72.9%); however, they showed mild specificity (46.1%) for upper airway cough syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Cough timing, several concomitant symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux or rhinitis/sinusitis, and medical history are useful to indicate common causes of chronic cough.","Lai, Kefang; Zhan, Wenzhi; Li, Hu; Yi, Fang; Peng, Wen; Zhou, Jianmeng; Tang, Jiaman; Zhang, Liting; Long, Li; Chen, Ruchong; Luo, Wei; Chen, Qiaoli; Jiang, Mei; Zhong, Nanshan",J.

During SARS period in 2003, fever clinics emerged in many cities in mainland China with the purpose to screen the suspected SARS patients and to transfer the confirmed cases to designated hospitals for professional management. Shanghai city has reserved the fever clinics and the designated hospitals since then. Hence, clinicians in the front line are able to respond quickly to the emerging COVID-19 outbreak with their accumulated knowledge and experiences from the past. One hundred seventeen fever clinics distributed in various district areas in Shanghai have played a vital 'sentinel' role to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. Most of suspected patients were identified in fever clinics and thereafter among these suspected patients the COVID-19 cases were confirmed and were isolated quickly to avoid the spread. We would like to share the sentinel roadmap for screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 to medical healthcare workers around the world, especially countries who are facing great challenges to cope with COVID-19 and meanwhile with limited medical resources. These sentinel surveillance strategies will certainly provide insight into the early detection and timely isolation of suspected cases from the others.","Lai, Rongtao; Chen, Erzhen; Gao, Weiyi; Cheng, Chengwei; Xie, Qing",Epidemiol Infect,,290

The semantics was built on the modeling tradition of distributed systems. As we show here, this can sometimes lead to counterintuitive interpretation of formulas when reasoning about the outcome of strategies. First, the semantics disregards finite paths, and thus yields unnatural evaluation of strategies with deadlocks. Secondly, the semantic representations do not allow to capture the asymmetry between proactive agents and the recipients of their choices. We propose how to avoid the problems by a suitable extension of the representations and change of the execution semantics for asynchronous MAS. We also prove that the model reduction scheme still works in the modified framework.","Jamroga, Wojciech; Penczek, Wojciech; Sidoruk, Teofil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03867v4.pdf,290

Health authorities around the world have been implementing preventive health measures, including quarantine and self-isolation, to mitigate the COVID-19 outbreak. This period is characterized by cessation of outdoor exercising. During this period of lockdown, PA has been one of the rare reasons for going out in some countries. To avoid the harmful effects of periods of exercise cessation, PA could be prescribed to older adults, which is of great importance for breaking their sedentary lifestyle and improving their immunity. The present review discusses the potential impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on sedentary behavior and physical inactivity in older adults.

The disease transmits mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosol. Although models for the evaporation and trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed, how the environment impacts the transmission of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the propagation of respiratory droplets and aerosol particles generated by speech under a wide range of temperatures (0-40 °C) and relative humidity (0-92%) conditions. We show that droplets can travel three times farther in low-temperature and high-humidity environment, whereas the number of aerosol particles increases in high-temperature and low-humidity environments. The results also underscore the importance of proper ventilation, as droplets and aerosol spread significantly farther in airstreams. This study contributes to the understanding of the environmental impact on COVID-19 transmission.","Zhao, Lei; Qi, Yuhang; Luzzatto-Fegiz, Paolo; Cui, Yi; Zhu, Yangying",Nano Lett,,290

Eight weeks after the second injection of vaccine, volunteers showed high levels of IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) and receptor-binding-domain (RBD) binding titre. Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity and relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells of vaccinated volunteers were equivalent to those of individuals who had recovered from natural infection5,6. However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants that encode E484K-, N501Y- or K417N/E484K/N501-mutant S was reduced by a small-but significant-margin. The monoclonal antibodies elicited by the vaccines potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, and target a number of different RBD epitopes in common with monoclonal antibodies isolated from infected donors5-8. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most-potent monoclonal antibodies that we tested was reduced or abolished by the K417N, E484K or N501Y mutation. Notably, these mutations were selected when we cultured recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S in the presence of the monoclonal antibodies elicited by the vaccines. Together, these results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid a potential loss of clinical efficacy.","Wang, Zijun; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Muecksch, Frauke; Barnes, Christopher O; Finkin, Shlomo; Schaefer-Babajew, Dennis; Cipolla, Melissa; Gaebler, Christian; Lieberman, Jenna A; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Yang, Zhi; Abernathy, Morgan E; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Hurley, Arlene; Turroja, Martina; West, Kamille A; Gordon, Kristie; Millard, Katrina G; Ramos, Victor; Da Silva, Justin; Xu, Jianliang; Colbert, Robert A; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Unson-O039,; Brien, Cecille; Shimeliovich, Irina; Gazumyan, Anna; Caskey, Marina; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Casellas, Rafael; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bieniasz, Paul D; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature (Lond.),,290
259940,Academia against New Coronavirus,2020,"The functional adaptability and conformational plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins allow for the efficient modulation of complex phenotypic responses to the host receptor and antibodies. In this study, we combined atomistic simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning approaches to examine binding mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with three different classes of antibodies. The ensemble-based profiling of binding and allosteric propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues showed that these proteins can work as functionally adaptable and allosterically regulated machines. Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417, E484, and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations can modulate collective motions, alter the global allosteric response, and elicit binding resistance. We suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit the plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter the response to antibody binding without compromising the activity of the spike protein.","Verkhivker, Gennady; Agajanian, Steve; Oztas, Deniz; Gupta, Grace",J Chem Theory Comput,,290

262710,The contribution of hypochondria resulting from Corona virus on the occupational productivity loss through increased job stress and decreased resilience in the central workshop of an oil refinery: A path analysis,2021,"Many organisms encapsulate their embryos in hard, protective shells. While birds and reptiles largely rely on mineralized shells, plants often develop highly robust lignocellulosic shells. Despite the abundance of hard plant shells, particularly nutshells, it remains unclear which fundamental properties drive their mechanical stability. This multiscale analysis of six prominent (nut)shells (pine, pistachio, walnut, pecan, hazelnut, and macadamia) reveals geometric and structural strengthening mechanisms on the cellular and macroscopic length scales. The strongest tissues, found in walnut and pistachio, exploit the topological interlocking of 3D-puzzle cells and thereby outperform the fiber-reinforced structure of macadamia under tensile and compressive loading. On the macroscopic scale, strengthening occurs via an increased shell thickness, spherical shape, small size, and a lack of extended sutures. These functional interrelations suggest that simple geometric modifications are a powerful and resource-efficient strategy for plants to enhance the fracture resistance of entire shells and their tissues. Understanding the interplay between structure, geometry, and mechanics in hard plant shells provides new perspectives on the evolutionary diversification of hard seed coats, as well as insights for nutshell-based material applications.","Huss, Jessica C; Antreich, Sebastian J; Bachmayr, Jakob; Xiao, Nannan; Eder, Michaela; Konnerth, Johannes; Gierlinger, Notburga",Adv Mater,,290

263041,Deployment Options for the Future Royal Navy’s Long-Range Land-Attack Fires,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on psychological health. Mindfulness training, which helps individuals attend to the present moment with a non-judgmental attitude, improves sleep and reduces stress in regular times, and may be relevant in mitigating harmful health consequences during acute crises. However, restrictions may necessitate this training being delivered online, rather than in in-person group settings. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to examine the effect of mindfulness interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as evaluate the effectiveness of online interventions. METHODS: Data from an ongoing study were used for this retrospective equivalence analysis. Participants were recruited (with no exclusion criteria) from enrollees in mindfulness courses at a local charity organization promoting mental wellness. Three groups were created, two that received their training during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic (in-person (N = 36) and videoconferencing (N = 38)), and a second control group of participants tested before the pandemic (N = 86). Primary outcomes were self-reported stress and sleep quality. Baseline levels, and changes in these variables due to mindfulness training were compared among the groups using analysis of covariance and two one-sided t-tests. RESULTS: Perceived stress and sleep quality did not differ significantly between groups at baseline. Mindfulness training significantly reduced stress in all three groups (P < .001), and this effect was statistically equivalent for videoconferencing compared to in-person training (P = .002). Sleep quality improved significantly in the pre-pandemic group (P < .001), but in neither of the groups during the pandemic. Participants reported shorter times to initiate sleep following mindfulness training pre-pandemic (P < .001), but not during the pandemic. Course attendance was high and equivalent across the online and comparison groups (P = .02), and participants engaged in marginally more daily practice in the online condition. CONCLUSIONS: Online mindfulness training via videoconferencing may be a useful intervention for stress reduction but not sleep improvement during times when traditional in-person training is not feasible.","Lim, Julian; Leow, Zaven; Ong, Jason; Pang, Ly-Shan; Lim, Eric",,,290

264058,Coronavirus infection status in Uganda and research activities in Kalinzu Forest,2021,"BACKGROUND: More than 100 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development since the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was published in January 2020. The uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine among children will be instrumental in limiting the spread of the disease as herd immunity may require vaccine coverage of up to 80% of the population. Prior history of pandemic vaccine coverage was as low as 40% among children in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. PURPOSE: To investigate predictors associated with global caregivers' intent to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, when the vaccine becomes available. METHOD: An international cross sectional survey of 1541 caregivers arriving with their children to 16 pediatric Emergency Departments (ED) across six countries from March 26 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: 65% (n = 1005) of caregivers reported that they intend to vaccinate their child against COVID-19, once a vaccine is available. A univariate and subsequent multivariate analysis found that increased intended uptake was associated with children that were older, children with no chronic illness, when fathers completed the survey, children up-to-date on their vaccination schedule, recent history of vaccination against influenza, and caregivers concerned their child had COVID-19 at the time of survey completion in the ED. The most common reason reported by caregivers intending to vaccinate was to protect their child (62%), and the most common reason reported by caregivers refusing vaccination was the vaccine's novelty (52%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of caregivers intend to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, though uptake will likely be associated with specific factors such as child and caregiver demographics and vaccination history.

The implementation of infection control measures and antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP) has been shown to reduce healthcare-related infections caused by multidrug resistance (MDR) germs. Since 2016, in our teaching hospital of Terni, an ASP has been implemented in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, with the “daily-ICU round strategy” and particular attention to infection control measures. We performed active surveillance for search patients colonized by Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). In March 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) arrived and the same ICU was reserved only for COVID-19 patients. In our retrospective observational study, we analyzed the bimonthly incidence of CRE colonization patients and the incidence of CRE acquisition in our ICU during the period of January 2019 to June 2020. In consideration of the great attention and training of all staff on infection control measures in the COVID-19 era, we would have expected a clear reduction in CRE acquisition, but this did not happen. In fact, the incidence of CRE acquisition went from 6.7% in 2019 to 50% in March–April 2020. We noted that 67% of patients that had been changed in posture with prone position were colonized by CRE, while only 37% of patients that had not been changed in posture were colonized by CRE. In our opinion, the high intensity of care, the prone position requiring 4–5 healthcare workers (HCWs), equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) in a high risk area, with extended and prolonged contact with the patient, and the presence of 32 new HCWs from other departments and without work experience in the ICU setting, contributed to the spread of CR-Kp in our ICU, determining an increase in CRE acquisition colonization.","Tiri, Beatrice; Sensi, Emanuela; Marsiliani, Viola; Cantarini, Mizar; Priante, Giulia; Vernelli, Carlo; Martella, Lucia Assunta; Costantini, Monya; Mariottini, Alessandro; Andreani, Paolo; Bruzzone, Paolo; Suadoni, Fabio; Francucci, Marsilio; Cirocchi, Roberto; Cappanera, Stefano",J.

One of the reasons for this major success is better use of big data analytics in efficient contact tracing and management and surveillance of those who require quarantine and isolation. OBJECTIVE: We present here a unique application of big data analytics among Taiwanese people who had contact with more than 3000 passengers that disembarked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan for a 1-day tour on January 31, 2020, 5 days before the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the Diamond Princess cruise ship on February 5, 2020, after an index case was identified on January 20, 2020. METHODS: The smart contact tracing-based mobile sensor data, cross-validated by other big sensor surveillance data, were analyzed by the mobile geopositioning method and rapid analysis to identify 627,386 potential contact-persons. Information on self-monitoring and self-quarantine was provided via SMS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were offered for symptomatic contacts. National Health Insurance claims big data were linked, to follow-up on the outcome related to COVID-19 among those who were hospitalized due to pneumonia and advised to undergo screening for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: As of February 29, a total of 67 contacts who were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were all negative and no confirmed COVID-19 cases were found. Less cases of respiratory syndrome and pneumonia were found after the follow-up of the contact population compared with the general population until March 10, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Big data analytics with smart contact tracing, automated alert messaging for self-restriction, and follow-up of the outcome related to COVID-19 using health insurance data could curtail the resources required for conventional epidemiological contact tracing.","Chen, Chi-Mai; Jyan, Hong-Wei; Chien, Shih-Chieh; Jen, Hsiao-Hsuan; Hsu, Chen-Yang; Lee, Po-Chang; Lee, Chun-Fu; Yang, Yi-Ting; Chen, Meng-Yu; Chen, Li-Sheng; Chen, Hsiu-Hsi; Chan, Chang-Chuan",J Med Internet Res,,290

METHODS: Between March 8, 2020, and May 26, 2020, the data of 503 neonates born to 497 mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy or at the time of delivery were collected by 79 hospitals throughout Spain. RESULTS: Maternal symptoms were similar to that of the general population, with 5% of severe forms. In 45.8% of asymptomatic women at the time of delivery, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection was detected because of recommendations established in Spain to perform COVID-19 screening in all women admitted to the hospital for labor. The rate of preterm deliveries was 15.7% and of cesarean deliveries, 33%. The most common diagnostic test was detection of viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs at a median age of 3 hours after delivery (1-12 hours). Almost one-half of neonates were left skin-to-skin after delivery, and delayed clamping of umbilical cords was performed in 43% of neonates. Also, 62.3% of asymptomatic neonates were managed with rooming-in. Maternal milk was received by 76.5% of neonates, 204 of them as exclusive breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicates that there is no need for separation of mothers from neonates, allowing delayed cord clamping and skin-to-skin contact along with maintenance of breastfeeding in a high percentage of newborns from mothers with COVID-19.","Sánchez-Luna, Manuel; Fernández Colomer, Belén; de Alba Romero, Concepción; Alarcón Allen, Ana; Baña Souto, Ana; Camba Longueira, Fátima; Cernada Badía, María; Galve Pradell, Zenaida; González López, María; López Herrera, M Cruz; Ribes Bautista, Carmen; Sánchez García, Laura; Zamora Flores, Elena",Pediatrics,,290

The deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been widely reported in TBI patients and animal models, and certain miRNAs have been identified as the emerging biomarkers of TBI. However, the role of miRNAs in the regulatory mechanism of TBI remains unclear. To demonstrate the effect of miR-146a mimic on TBI-induced neural damages, TBI mouse model was constructed by cortical impact injury (CCI). The chemokine levels were examined by ELISA assays. Behavioral experiments were used to estimate the impact of miR-146a mimics on neurological functions in mice. Western blot assays were performed to demonstrate the protein levels. qRT-PCR assays were utilized to investigate the expression alteration of RNA levels. It was found that miR-146a was upregulated both in brain and serum in TBI mice. miR-146a mimic downregulated inflammatory cytokines secretion in mouse brain. The NF-&#954;B signaling pathway was inhibited by miR-146a mimic. miR-146a treatment attenuated the impact caused by TBI to mouse brain and improve the long-term neurological function. In conclusion, miR-146a mimics ameliorate TBI-related injuries via JNK and NF-&#954;B signaling pathway.","Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Li; Zhu, Wei; Ding, Yuexia; Chen, Hongguang; Chi, Nan",,,290
277116,Deterministic and Randomized Actuator Scheduling With Guaranteed Performance Bounds,2018-05-02,"PURPOSE: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has almost stopped all elective surgical treatment throughout the world. As operating room (OR) capacities are reduced everywhere to ensure availability of intensive care capacities, especially low-complex surgical procedures are often postponed. These include totally implantable central-venous access ports which are important for the oncologic treatment of cancer patients. METHODS: In our study, we investigated the potential of an outpatient surgical centre (OSC) in terms of workflow effectiveness compared to the central operating room complex (COR) of a university hospital using low-complex surgical procedures as an example. Data of 524 consecutive patients who received a Port-a-cath procedure (422 implantations (80.5%) and 102 explantations (19.5%)) in our department between February 2019 and February 2020 were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 277 patients were operated in outpatient surgical centre (OSC), and 247 patients received the procedure in the central OR (COR) complex. Grade II and III complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification occurred in 5.2% (OSC) and 7.3% (COR) of patients. Incision-to-suture time was significantly quicker in the OSC group (36 vs. 42 min., p < 0.032). Total OR time (01:08 vs. 01:20 h) and preparation-to-incision time were also shorter in the OSC group (12 vs. 17 min., p < 0.002). CONCLUSION: In order to ensure effective OR utilization especially in times of the corona pandemic, the use of smaller decentralized OR units, e.g., outpatient surgical centres, for performing low-complex surgical cases is beneficial. Our study revealed shorter total OR and preparation-to-incision times.","Vogel, Thomas; Schippers, Dina; Aldarweesh, Balqees; Pergolini, Ilaria; Stollreiter, Martina; Wagner, Klaus; Wilhelm, Dirk; Friess, Helmut; Kranzfelder, Michael",Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg,,290

280887,Perceptually Based Approaches to Understanding Early Categorization,2000,"PURPOSE: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the outcome of symptomatic Covid-19 infection occurring early after elective operations is reportedly associated with fatalities. Incidence is unknown and data on bariatric practice is scarce. Covid-19 exposure status and outcomes of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between the first two peaks of the pandemic are prospectively evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During our ""opening-phase,"" candidates for SG were enrolled after written informed consent was obtained which specifically emphasized the additional risks of the Covid-19. Viral exposure history and swab/RNA testing were obtained from all. Preoperative antibody testing was also performed, once became available. Preoperative workout, definitions, and surgical technique were standard. Patients were followed up with video-calls. All perioperative data is prospectively recorded. RESULTS: Between June 23 and November 20, 87 consecutive SGs were performed without mortality and conversion with a 1.2% major early complication rate. Single complication was due to Covid-19, acutely becoming symptomatic one day following the SG. During the first year of the pandemic, a minimum of 13.8% of the patients had encountered the virus and the rate of developing postoperative symptomatic Covid-19 was 6.3% including a patient with full-blown Covid-19 pneumonia 1 day after SG. Results on weight loss matched expectations. CONCLUSION: Currently, differing from the first peak of pandemic, vaccines are underway although a more serious surge continues. Given the high rate of morbidity and mortality of Covid-19 infection early after elective operations, caution is warranted when balancing the expected benefit from an elective procedure against the risk of acquiring perioperative Covid-19 infection.","Yerdel, Mehmet Ali; Özgen, Görkem",Obes. surg,,290

METHODS: A random sample of 6085 individuals in Italy who died in-hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between February and December 2020 were included. Observed to expected (O/E) ratios of disease pairs were computed and logistic regression models were used to determine the association between disease pairs with O/E values &#8805; 1.5. RESULTS: Six pairs of diseases exhibited O/E values &#8805; 1.5 and statistically significant higher odds of co-occurrence in the crude and adjusted analyses: (1) ischemic heart disease and atrial fibrillation, (2) atrial fibrillation and heart failure, (3) atrial fibrillation and stroke, (4) heart failure and COPD, (5) stroke and dementia, and (6) type 2 diabetes and obesity. CONCLUSION: In those deceased in-hospital due to COVID-19 in Italy, disease combinations defined by multiple cardio-respiratory, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric diseases occur more frequently than expected.

282639,PDA Responds to the Novel Coronavirus Situation,2020,"Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy associated with numerous viral infections. Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and GBS, but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID-19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDx) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59 years), gender (65% male), and COVID-19 features appeared to reflect those of hospitalized COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non-COVID-19 GBS. The EDx pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all cases. Serum antiganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most cases. GBS-associated COVID-19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDx patterns to GBS before the pandemic. Future studies should compare patients with COVID-19-associated GBS to those with contemporaneous non-COVID-19 GBS and determine whether the incidence of GBS is elevated in those with COVID-19.","Caress, James B; Castoro, Ryan J; Simmons, Zachary; Scelsa, Stephen N; Lewis, Richard A; Ahlawat, Aditi; Narayanaswami, Pushpa",Muscle nerve,,290

283358,Nanoscale pathogens treated with nanomaterial-like peptides: a platform technology appropriate for future pandemics,2021,"BACKGROUND: The traditional approach to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is to construct the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs within the inframesocolic space. This requires reflecting the greater omentum, transverse colon, and mesocolon superiorly. This maneuver can be challenging in patients with a robust omentum, hepatomegaly, or significant omental adhesions. The inability to fully reflect the omentum superiorly prevents an appropriate view of the posterior transverse mesocolon and the inframesocolic space from being obtained. This can make it difficult to construct the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs. In order to circumvent the difficult situations described above, a supramesocolic approach to constructing the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs can be performed. This approach avoids the need to reflect the omentum and transverse colon. METHODS: Key steps include entering the lesser sac by transecting the gastrocolic ligament and, next, an aperture in the transverse mesocolon made exposing the ligament of Treitz. The small bowel is then eviscerated into the supramesocolic space. The biliopancreatic and Roux limbs are then created in the usual fashion. All of the small bowel except the Roux limb is then returned through the mesocolon to the inframesocolic space. Peterson's space and the mesocolic defect are then closed using permanent suture. The remainder of the procedure is then performed in the usual fashion. RESULTS: No complications were reported immediately postoperatively or at a 12-month follow-up in all 3 cases. CONCLUSION: The supramesocolic approach to a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is a safe and effective technique when an inframesocolic approach proves difficult.","Dugan, Nicholas; Nimeri, Abdelrahman",Obes. surg,,290

A safe and timely response is required for patients exhibiting escalating behaviours (e.g., responsive, agitated and/or aggressive behaviours) to prevent harm to the patient, nearby patients and staff. In this paper, we report on a new protocol that has been implemented throughout our institution to address Code White calls for escalating behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. This procedure uses a least restraint-based philosophy for the management of an escalating situation, involves the use of an interprofessional team of healthcare providers (including mental health clinicians) and security team members and accounts for the need for personal protective equipment. We believe that other hospitals could benefit from knowing about this approach as a strategy to improve patient care and diminish disease transmission.","Lucchese, Stephanie; Bellicoso, Daniela; Dang, Kien; Witz, Ifat",Healthc Q,,290

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively collected consecutive cases of community-managed COVID-19 pneumonia from March 1 to April 20, 2020, in the province of Bergamo and evaluated the association of overweight (25 kg/m2 &#8804; BMI <30 kg/m2) and obesity (&#8805;30 kg/m2) with time to hospitalization (primary end point), low-flow domiciliary oxygen need, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, intubation, and death due to COVID-19 (secondary end points) in this cohort. We analyzed the primary end point using multivariable Cox models. RESULTS: Of 338 patients included, 133 (39.4%) were overweight and 77 (22.8%) were obese. Age at diagnosis was younger in obese patients compared with those overweight or with normal weight (P<.001), whereas diabetes, dyslipidemia, and heart diseases were differently distributed among BMI categories. Azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, and prednisolone use were similar between BMI categories (P>.05). Overall, 105 (31.1%) patients were hospitalized, and time to hospitalization was significantly shorter for obese vs over- or normal-weight patients (P<.001). In the final multivariable analysis, obese patients were more likely to require hospitalization than nonobese patients (hazard ratio, 5.83; 95% CI, 3.91 to 8.71). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Low-flow domiciliary oxygen need, hospitalization with noninvasive mechanical ventilation, intubation, and death were significantly associated with obesity (P<.001). CONCLUSION: In patients with community-managed COVID-19 pneumonia, obesity is associated with a higher hospitalization risk and overall worse outcomes than for nonobese patients.","Cottini, Marcello; Lombardi, Carlo; Berti, Alvise",Mayo Clin Proc,,290

We assessed the feasibility and impact of telehealth visits on the time-in-range (TIR) of paediatric individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS: An observational multicentre real-life study. Patients scheduled for an in-clinic visit during the lockdown were offered to participate in a telehealth visit. Sociodemographic, clinical, continuous glucose monitor and pump data were recorded 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks after telehealth visit. The primary endpoint was change in relative-TIR, i.e. change in TIR divided by the percent of possible change (&#8710;TIR/(100-TIRbefore)*100). RESULTS: The study group comprised 195 individuals with T1D (47.7% males), mean±SD age 14.6 ± 5.3 years, and diabetes duration 6.0 ± 4.6 years. Telehealth was accomplished with 121 patients and their parents (62.0%); 74 (38.0%) did not transfer complete data. Mean TIR was significantly higher for the two-week period after the telehealth visit than for the two-week period prior the visit (62.9 ± 16.0, p < 0.001 vs. 59.0 ± 17.2); the improvement in relative-TIR was 5.7±26.1%.

290227,ACMQ President's Message: Update on ACMQ's Annual Meeting Medical Quality 2020,2020,"BACKGROUND: Background: Technology has become the most critical approach to maintain social connectedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults (over age 65) are perceived as most physiologically vulnerable to COVID-19 and at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to social isolation imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias we used a random sampling of older adults to understand uptake and acceptance of technologies to support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in technology use for virtual socialization amongst older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based regionally representative survey using random-digit dialing to participants over age 65 living in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with open-text responses analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults with an average age of 72 years old and 63.7% female. Most respondents (89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others and slightly more than half (56%) reported using technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. 55.9% of respondents reported adopting new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported key barriers to using technology including: (1) lack of access (including finance, knowledge, and age); (2) lack of interest (including a preference for telephone, and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults reported numerous facilitators, including: (1) knowledge of technologies (whether self-taught or via external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searching); (3) technology accessibility (including environments, user-friendly technology, and receiving clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (because everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology is limited by sampling biases, but the current study that used random sampling demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Virtual socialization is most promising to mitigate potential mental health effects related to virus containment strategies. Addressing barriers by mobilizing telephone training and task lists, and mobilizing facilitators described by participants such as facilitated socialization activities are important strategies that can be implemented within and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","Haase, Kristen R; Cosco, Theodore; Kervin, Lucy; Riadi, Indira; O039,; Connell, Megan E",,,290

291059,Meeting the challenge of long COVID,2020,"ABSTRACT The aim of this article was to discuss biosafety measures described in the main protocols for minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission during dental care. COVID-19 appeared in China in late 2019 and quickly spread to other countries. Factors inherent to dental practice, such as proximity to the patient, transmission through saliva and breath, and the generation of aerosols during procedures, place the dental team at the top of the list among the most vulnerable healthcare providers. Health authorities initially recommended only maintaining urgent and emergency care and suspending elective dental procedures. Currently, elective care is gradually being resumed and requires numerous adjustments to the environment and professional routine in terms of biosafety. Several methods had been recommended to prevent the spread of other infectious diseases prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. However, further modifications are needed for the waiting room, patient screening and flow, procedures, garments, and even in dental office itself. Thus, dental professionals need to be prepared to adopt the new recommendations in order to reduce the chance of disease transmission.","SILVEIRA, Manuela Gonçalves de Souza e Silva; FERNANDEZ, Matheus dos Santos; TILLMANN, Thais Freitas Formozo; DANIGNO, Júlia Freire; ECHEVERRIA, Mariana Silveira; SILVA, Alexandre Emidio Ribeiro",RGO (Porto Alegre),,290

In this paper, we first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted for the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical interactions between \textit{human discretion}, \textit{bureaucratic processes}, and \textit{algorithmic decision-making} by synthesizing disparate bodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA). We then applied the ADMAPS framework to conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth, eight-month ethnographic case study of the algorithms in daily use within a child-welfare agency that serves approximately 900 families and 1300 children in the mid-western United States. Overall, we found there is a need to focus on strength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks. In addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic processes and augment human discretion, rather than replace it. Finally, collective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes at both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we propose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making tools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector. We empirically validate the theoretically derived ADMAPS framework to demonstrate how it can be useful for systematically making pragmatic decisions about the design of algorithms for the public sector.","Saxena, Devansh; Badillo-Urquiola, Karla; Wisniewski, Pamela; Guha, Shion",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03487v3.pdf,290

294711,Art and research: A portrait of a humanities faculty as an inclusive workspace,2021,"Oncology health-care workers (HCWs) are facing substantial stressors during the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, resulting in a wide range of acute stress responses. To appropriately meet the growing mental health needs of HCWs, it is imperative to differentiate expectable stress responses from posttraumatic stress disorder and mental illness, because traditional mental health interventions may pathologize healthy stress reactions and risk retraumatizing HCWs under acute duress. Further, HCWs are experiencing protracted forms of acute stress as the pandemic continues, including moral injury, and require mental health interventions that are flexible and can adapt as the acuity of stressors changes. Previously developed frameworks to support people experiencing acute stress, such as Psychological First Aid, are particularly relevant for HCWs in the ongoing pandemic. Acute stress interventions like Psychological First Aid are guided by the Stress Continuum Model, which conceptualizes stress reactions on a continuum, from a zone of normal readiness and expectable consequences to a zone of more persistent and extreme reactions such as posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. Key principles of the Stress Continuum Model include the expectation that emotional reactivity does not lead to psychiatric problems, that interventions need to be appropriately targeted to symptoms along the stress continuum, and that people will return to normal recovery. Various core actions to reduce acute stress include delivering practical assistance, reducing arousal, mobilizing support, and providing targeted collaborative services. This nonpathologizing approach offers a valuable framework for delivering both individual and organizational-level interventions during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Major, A.; Recklitis, C.

This observational study examined practitioners of psychiatric rehabilitation and therapeutic communities, focusing on the emotional aspects of patient care, in particular the fatigue of compassion, empathy and lack of hope, aspects that could be directly linked to the burnout of health professionals, as found in other similar studies. METHOD: In this study, self-administered scale data was collected in 87 healthcare professionals recruited from 3 different psychiatric rehabilitation communities. In particular, we assessed the fatigue of compassion, vicarious trauma, burnout and hope (hopeless), empathy and depressive symptoms in the two months of May and June 2021. RESULTS: The results obtained after the administration of the following rating scales, ProQOL, BHS, SAVE-9, BDI-II and BEES, showed an overall increase in scores in all professional figures, a significant fatigue of compassion, while the percentage burnout is not present in several groups. The presence of high levels of hope, satisfaction of compassion is indicative of a moderate level of empathy in some professional figures;these high levels can protect workers from the risk of developing work-related stress and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained with this study are not similar to those of previous studies, although they may indicate the importance of factors such as hope, empathy in the care of the patient with psychic disorders in rehabilitation communities, underlining the need for interventions aimed at the emotional management of the care relationship as a tool to improve care and prevent burnout even during times of high stress, such as managing a pandemic.","Vacca, A.; Mino, M.

The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight-related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: As part of an online cross-sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well-being. Results: Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. Conclusions: Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased risk.","Robinson, Eric; Gillespie, Steven; Jones, Andrew",Obes.

296055,"2020 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research Virtual Event September 11-15, 2020",2020,"There is growing concern for the wide use ofperfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) because of its toxic effects on the environment and on human health. A new compound - the so called C6O4 (perfluoro ([5-methoxy-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl]oxy) acetic acid) - was recently introduced as one of the alternative to traditional PFOA, however this was done without any scientific evidence of the effects of C6O4 when dispersed into the environment. Recently, the Regional Agency for the Protection of the Environment of Veneto (Italy) detected high levels of C6O4 in groundwater and in the Po river, increasing the alarm for the potential effects of this chemical into the natural environment. The present study investigates for the first time the effects of C6O4 on the Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to environmental realistic concentrations of C6O4 (0.1 µg/L and 1 µg/L) for 7 and 21 days. Furthermore, in order to better understand if C6O4 is a valid and less hazardous alternative to its substitute, microbial and transcriptomic alterations were also investigated in clams exposed to 1 µg/L ofPFOA. Results indicate that C6O4 may cause significant perturbations to the digestive gland microbiota, likely determining the impairment of host physiological homeostasis. Despite chemical analyses suggest a 5 times lower accumulation potential of C604 as compared to PFOA in clam soft tissues, transcriptional analyses reveal several alterations of gene expression profile. A large part of the altered pathways, including immune response, apoptosis regulation, nervous system development, lipid metabolism and cell membrane is the same in C6O4 and PFOA exposed clams. In addition, clams exposed to C6O4 showed dose-dependent responses as well as possible narcotic or neurotoxic effects and reduced activation of genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism. Overall, the present study suggests that the potential risks for marine organism following environmental contamination are not reduced by replacing PFOA with C6O4. In addition, the detection of both C6O4 and PFOA into tissues of clams inhabiting the Lagoon of Venice - where there are no point sources of either compounds - recommends a similar capacity to spread throughout the environment. These results prompt the urgent need to re-evaluate the use of C6O4 as it may represent not only an environmental hazard but also a potential risk for human health.","Bernardini, Ilaria; Matozzo, Valerio; Valsecchi, Sara; Peruzza, Luca; Rovere, Giulia Dalla; Polesello, Stefano; Iori, Silvia; Marin, Maria Gabriella; Fabrello, Jacopo; Ciscato, Maria; Masiero, Luciano; Bonato, Marco; Santovito, Gianfranco; Boffo, Luciano; Bargelloni, Luca; Milan, Massimo; Patarnello, Tomaso",Environ Int,,290
297126,A hybrid method for overcoming thermal shock of non-contact infrared thermometers,2021-04-21,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Many pediatric providers serving adolescents are not trained to offer comprehensive contraceptive services, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, despite high safety and satisfaction among adolescents. This study assessed an initiative to train providers at school-based health centers (SBHCs) to offer students the full range of contraceptive methods. DESIGN: Surveys were administered at baseline pre-training and at follow-up three months post-training. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations for clustered data to examine clinical practice changes. SETTING: Eleven contraceptive trainings across the US from 2016-2019 PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred-sixty providers from 158 SBHCs serving 135,800 students INTERVENTIONS: On-site training to strengthen patient-centered counseling and equip practitioners to integrate IUDs and implants into contraceptive services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes included counseling experience on IUDs and implants, knowledge of patient eligibility, and clinician method skills. RESULTS: At follow-up, providers were significantly more likely to report having enough experience to counsel on IUDs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.62-6.36]) and implants (aOR: 3.06; 95% CI, 2.05 - 4.57). Provider knowledge about patient eligibility for IUDs, including for adolescents, increased (p<0.001). Providers were more likely to offer same-visit IUD (aOR: 2.10; 95% CI, 1.41 - 3.12) and implant services (aOR: 1.66; 95% CI, 1.44 - 1.91). Clinicians' skills with contraceptive devices improved, including for a newly available low-cost IUD (aOR:2.21; 95% CI, 1.45-3.36). CONCLUSIONS: Offering an evidence-based training is a promising approach to increase counseling and access to comprehensive contraceptive services at SBHCs.","Comfort, Alison B; Rao, Lavanya; Goodman, Suzan; Barney, Angela; Glymph, Angela; Schroeder, Rosalyn; McCulloch, Charles; Harper, Cynthia C",J. pediatr. adolesc. gynecol,,290

297564,Connecting Landscapes for Conservation in a Changing World,2021,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the basis of treatments and diagnostics for pathogens and other biological phenomena. We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs' flexibility and how this flexibility affects the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the antigen-binding fragments is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we show that rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices, which are critical for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.","Hodge, Curtis D; Rosenberg, Daniel J; Grob, Patricia; Wilamowski, Mateusz; Joachimiak, Andrzej; Hura, Greg L; Hammel, Michal",MAbs,,290

We discuss a selection of theoretical and experimental key results of weakest-link games and interpret them in the light of the corona-pandemic. First, we highlight that experimental evidence does not support the assumption that coordination can be trivially solved, even among symmetric players. Second, we argue that for asymmetric countries the weakest-link game does not only pose a problem of coordination, but also a problem of cooperation. Third, we show how and under which conditions self-enforcing treaties can foster coordination and cooperation. We account for the possibility that countries make mistakes when choosing their actions. Our discussion shows that North-South cooperation is relevant and likely to be self-enforcing and that regional cooperation, e.g., within the EU, will also be important.","Caparrós, Alejandro; Finus, Michael",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,290

In this study, realtime reverse transcription quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were used to identify Human respiratory coronaviruses (HCoV). infections in patients below 10 years of age with respiratory infections who visited Dankook University Hospital in Cheonan, South Korea, from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Out of the 9010 patients who underwent respiratory virus real-time reverse transcription qPCR test, 364 tested positive for HCoV infections. Among these 364 patients, 72.8% (n = 265) were below 10 years of age. Data regarding the frequency of infections was used to uncover the seasonal pattern of the two viral strains, which was then compared with local meteorological data for the same time period. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 showed high infection rates in patients below 10 years of age. There was a negative relationship between HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infections with air temperature and wind-chill temperatures. Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 rates of infection were positively related to atmospheric pressure, while HCoV-229E was also positively associated with particulate matter concentrations. Our results suggest that climatic variables affect the rate in which children below 10 years of age are infected with HCoV. These findings may help to predict when prevention strategies may be most effective.","Kim, Jang Mook; Jeon, Jae Sik; Kim, Jae Kyung",J Microbiol Biotechnol,,290

Many countries have implemented tracking applications or other surveillance systems, which may raise concerns about privacy and civil rights violations but may be also perceived by citizens as a way to reduce threat and uncertainty. Our research examined whether feelings evoked by the pandemic (perceived threat and lack of control) as well as more stable ideological views predict the acceptance of such technologies. In two studies conducted in Poland, we found that perceived personal threat and lack of personal control were significantly positively related to the acceptance of surveillance technologies, but their predictive value was smaller than that of individual differences in authoritarianism and endorsement of liberty. Moreover, we found that the relationship between the acceptance of surveillance technologies and both perceived threat and lack of control was particularly strong among people high in authoritarianism. Our research shows that the negative feelings evoked by the unprecedented global crisis may inspire positive attitudes towards helpful but controversial surveillance technologies but that they do so to a lesser extent than ideological beliefs.","Wnuk, Anna; Oleksy, Tomasz; Maison, Dominika",PLoS One,,290

One strategy that attracted significant attention was the use of digital contact-tracing apps to quickly alert users of possible exposure to the virus, and to direct them into quarantine. The initially high expectations placed upon this strategy were not met-despite the implementation of a digital contact-tracing app in Germany, further restrictions have been placed on the general population in response to further waves of the virus. We consider how digital contact tracing might have been made more effective. Arguments: We argue that there is a conflict between collecting as little data as possible, and more effective epidemic control. In contrast to the ""Corona-Warn-App"" that was implemented in Germany, an app that stored more information on a central server (a so-called ""centralized"" app) had the potential to significantly decrease viral spread. We then look at the privacy-based arguments against the centralized storage of information, suggesting that ""decentralized"" systems have privacy problems of their own. Results: The German debate on digital contact tracing apps was quickly dominated by privacy concerns, to the detriment of other ethical factors such as enhancing potential effectiveness. Furthermore, the potential problems with privacy inherent in decentralized apps were obscured in the discussion. Once we recognize these two aspects, we can see that there is an argument to be made for preferring centralized digital contact-tracing apps.","van Basshuysen, Philippe; White, Lucie",Ethik Med,,290

303840,"Webinar zur S2k-Leitlinie ""Operative Therapie von Nebennierentumoren""",2020,"INTRODUCTION: Vaccination means the injection of a killed microbe to stimulate the immune system against the microbe, which prevents communicable diseases. It's the most important and cost-effective public health intervention to reduce child mortality and morbidity. Ethiopian national full vaccination coverage is 43%. This research aimed to assess full vaccination coverage and associated factors among 12-to-23-month children at Assosa Town. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among children aged of 12 to 23 months from November to December 2020. Assosa town has two woredas. Each woreda has five kebeles. By using lottery method, five kebeles were selected from two woredas. Systematic sampling technique was used for sampling. The total sample size was 372. It was calculated by the proportionate allocation method. Questioners were used to collect data by the observation of vaccination caring and mother interviewing. Data were entered into SPSS and analyzed. Multivariance analysis was used by considering a 95% confidence interval. Variables whose p-value less than 0.05 were identified as significant. RESULTS: The respondent rate of this study was 372 (100%). Of the total respondents, 338 (90.8%) were females and 34 (9.1%) of them were males. The coverage of full, partial, and non-vaccination is 71.77%, 16.67%, and 11.56%, respectively. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, child age [AOR=2.7, 95% CI: (1.36, 5.4)], no antenatal care visit [AOR=0.41, 95% CI: (0.24, 0.71)] and fear of covid 19 at health institutions [AOR=3.5, 95% CI: (2, 6)] were identified as significant variables. There are major identified factors for partial and non-vaccination. CONCLUSION: Coverage of full, partial, and non-vaccination was 71.77%, 16.67%, and 11.56%, respectively. Child age, no antenatal care visit, and fear of covid 19 at health institutions were significant variables. Fear of covid-19 is the commonest factor for partial and non-vaccination.","Jimma, M.

304212,The Limitations of the Expert,2020,"A key unknown for SARS-CoV-2 is how asymptomatic infections contribute to transmission. We used a transmission model with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states, calibrated to data on disease onset and test frequency from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. The model estimated that 74% (70-78%, 95% posterior interval) of infections proceeded asymptomatically. Despite intense testing, 53% (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. The data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, however low ranges (0-25%) required a net reproduction number for individuals progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of at least 15. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission. Control measures, and models projecting their potential impact, need to look beyond the symptomatic cases if they are to understand and address ongoing transmission.","Emery, Jon C; Russell, Timothy W; Liu, Yang; Hellewell, Joel; Pearson, Carl Ab; Atkins, Katherine E; Klepac, Petra; Endo, Akira; Jarvis, Christopher I; Davies, Nicholas G; Rees, Eleanor M; Meakin, Sophie R; Rosello, Alicia; van Zandvoort, Kevin; Munday, James D; Edmunds, W John; Jombart, Thibaut; Auzenbergs, Megan; Nightingale, Emily S; Jit, Mark; Abbott, Sam; Simons, David; Bosse, Nikos I; Leclerc, Quentin J; Procter, Simon R; Villabona-Arenas, C Julian; Tully, Damien C; Deol, Arminder K; Sun, Fiona Yueqian; Hué, Stéphane; Foss, Anna M; Prem, Kiesha; Medley, Graham; Gimma, Amy; Lowe, Rachel; Clifford, Samuel; Quaife, Matthew; Diamond, Charlie; Gibbs, Hamish P; Quilty, Billy J; OReilly, Kathleen; Knight, Gwenan M; Eggo, Rosalind M; Kucharski, Adam J; Funk, Sebastian; Flasche, Stefan; Houben, Rein Mgj",eLife (Cambridge),,290

311973,"Breaking all the rules, at lightning speed",2020,"INTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 has restricted access to face-to-face delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Evidence suggests that telehealth-PR is non-inferior to outpatient PR. However, it is unknown whether patients who have been referred to face-to-face programmes can feasibly complete an online-PR programme. METHODS: This service evaluation used a mixed-methods approach to investigate a rapid PR service remodelling using the University of Gloucestershire eLearn Moodle platform. Quantitative baseline demographic and PR outcome data were collected from online-PR participants, and semistructured interviews were completed with PR staff and participants. RESULTS: Twenty-five individuals were eligible from a PR waiting list. Thirteen declined participation and 14 completed PR. Significant pre-post online PR improvements were achieved in 1 min sit-to-stand (CI 2.1 to 9 (p=0.004)), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (CI -0.3 to -2.6 (p=0.023)), Primary Health Questionnaire-9 (CI -0.3 to -5.1 (p=0.029)), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire dyspnoea (CI 0.5 to 1.3 (p=0.001)), fatigue (CI 0.7 to 2 (p=0.0004)), emotion (CI 0.7 to 1.7 (p=0.0002)), mastery (CI 0.4 to 1.3 (p=0.001)). Interviews indicated that patient PR inclusion was made possible with digital support and a PR introduction session improved participant engagement and safety. Incremental progression of exercise was perceived as more successful online compared with face-to-face PR. However, perceptions were that education sessions were less successful. Online-PR required significant staff time resource. DISCUSSION: Online-PR improves patient outcomes and is feasible and acceptable for individuals referred for face-to-face PR in the context of a requirement for social distancing. Face-to-face programmes can be adapted in a rapid fashion with both staff and participants perceiving benefit. Future pragmatic trials are now warranted comparing online-PR including remote assessments to centre-based PR with suitably matched outcomes, and patient and staff perceptions sought regarding barriers and facilitators of online delivery.","Lewis, Adam; Knight, Ellena; Bland, Matthew; Middleton, Jack; Mitchell, Esther; McCrum, Kate; Conway, Joy; Bevan-Smith, Elaine",,,290

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify when and how American adults might feel comfortable about resuming in-person research and health care visits. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire data were collected from 135 adults (age: median 48 years; women: n=113, 83.7%; White participants: n=92, 68.2%) who were engaged in health-related research. RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (65/122, 53.3%) felt that the COVID-19 pandemic positively affected their desire to participate in research. Although 73.6% (95/129) of respondents also indicated a willingness to attend in-person health care visits while Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines are implemented, 85.8% (109/127) indicated a willingness to attend in-person, outdoor visits, and 92.2% (118/128) reported a willingness to attend drive-through visits (with CDC guidelines implemented during both visit types). Videoconferencing was the most preferred format for intervention visits; however, adults over the age of 65 years preferred this format less than younger adults (P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: Researchers and clinicians should continue to provide opportunities for continuing the conduction of remote-based interventions while enforcing CDC guidelines during in-person visits.","Ross, Kathryn M; Hong, Young-Rock; Krukowski, Rebecca A; Miller, Darci R; Lemas, Dominick J; Cardel, Michelle I",JMIR Form Res,,290

METHODS: Tocilizumab (TCZ) efficacy on mortality and length of hospital stay was retrospectively evaluated in patients who received TCZ and compared with that in controls with a similar severity of COVID-19. The primary endpoint was survival probability on day 28. The secondary endpoints included survival at day 14 and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 148 patients included in the study, 62 received TCZ and standard of care, whereas 86 served as a control group and received only standard of care. The two groups were similar, although TCZ-treated patients were more likely to exhibit hypertension (46.7% vs. 29.8%), chronic kidney disease (14.5% vs. 1.1%), and high Charlson score (1.18 vs. 1.00; p = 0.006) and less likely to receive corticosteroid treatment (48.5% vs. 93.0%). TCZ was associated with lower mortality on both day 28 (16.1% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.004) and day 14 (9.7% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.022). The hospital stay was longer in the TCZ-treated than in the control group (15.6 ± 7.59 vs.17.7 ± 7.8 days, p = 0.103). Ten patients (16.0%) in the TCZ-treated group developed infections. CONCLUSION: TCZ was associated with a lower likelihood of death despite resulting in higher infection rates and a non-significant longer hospital stay.","Al-Baadani, Abeer; Eltayeb, Nazik; Alsufyani, Eid; Albahrani, Salma; Basheri, Shareefah; Albayat, Hawra; Batubara, Enas; Ballool, Sulafa; Al Assiri, Ayed; Faqihi, Fahad; Musa, Ali B; Robert, Asirvatham A; Alsherbeeni, Nisreen; Elzein, Fatehi",J Infect Public Health,,290

315537,Offline: Why President Trump is wrong about WHO,2020,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes. This happens, at least in part, because TLR4 modulates the enzyme NADPH oxidase, a primary source of ROS in vascular structures. Increased oxidative stress disrupts key vascular signaling mechanisms and drives the progression of diabetes, elevating the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it has been shown that patients with diabetes are also at a higher risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Given the importance of the interaction between TLR4 and NADPH oxidase to the disrupted diabetic vascular system, we put forward the hypothesis that TLR4-mediated NADPH oxidase-derived ROS might be a critical mechanism to help explain why this disparity appears in diabetic patients, but unfortunately, conclusive experimental evidence still lacks in the literature. Herein, we focus on discussing the pathological implications of this signaling communication in the diabetic vasculature and exploring this crosstalk in the context of diabetes-associated severe COVID-19.","de Oliveira, Amanda Almeida; Nunes, Kenia Pedrosa",Vascul Pharmacol,,290

The training is based on the method of video analysis, involving simulated patients, making online implementation extremely challenging. AIM: The study aims to present our experiences with the online training and to analyse the students' evaluations. METHOD: We used the free version of Zoom for small groups of five students, a trainer and a simulated patient. All students participated in a situation that we recorded. The viewing of the recordings was followed by group discussion. Then, the students evaluated the course using an online questionnaire. We used descriptive statistics and content analysis. RESULTS: 74.4% of the students (n = 64) completed the questionnaire. 78.1-100% of them gave a good (4) or excellent (5) evaluation for the questions. The highest average score (4.95 ± 0.21) was given to the professionalism of the trainers, the lowest was given to the choice of topic of the theoretical part (4.06 ± 1.02). The majority of the students were satisfied with the course, they would be happy to attend it again; however, in-person learning still seems to be the preferred option. CONCLUSION: The online practice was a success. In many ways, it proved to be an adequate replacement for the traditional form. The students evaluated the training similarly to those of previous years. The lack of personal contact is a limiting factor, thus, online practice should not be seen as an alternative to personal communication trainings; however, as an independent form of training, it can make a significant contribution to effective, modern education.

While policymakers and donors often look at available options for increasing public spending for health in the medium-term, examining trends and drivers of past growth can help countries elucidate important lessons and to anticipate changes in the future. This note analyzes trends in inflation-adjusted per capita public spending for health vis-à-vis economic growth within and across a sample of 150 countries over the 2000-2017 period. Since 2000, per capita public spending for health across low- and middle-income countries has more than doubled. Less than one-fifth of this increase, however, resulted from a higher priority for health in government budgets. The remainder was largely due to conducive macroeconomic conditions such as economic growth and increases in total public spending. Furthermore, across most countries, a single time trend does not adequately capture the evolution either of economic growth or of per capita public spending on health. Instability in growth rates is large for both indicators, revealing distinct episodic patterns.","Tandon, Ajay; Cain, Jewelwayne; Kurowski, Christoph; Dozol, Adrien; Postolovska, Iryna",Soc Sci Med,,290

BACKGROUND: Nurses are on the front lines of disaster and emergency response; however, they report not feeling confident about their disaster preparedness. METHODS: Participants included 234 nurses working at a general hospital in Korea. Emergency code awareness was measured by recognition of and self-confidence in eight emergency codes, and disaster nursing competencies were measured using the Disaster Nursing Preparedness Response Competency Scale. Data were collected from 17 to 23 October 2019. RESULTS: The recognition rate of emergency codes was 87.4%, whereas the level of self-confidence was 3.30 out of 5. Nurses scored 2.98 out of 5 on disaster preparedness competencies and 3.37 out of 5 on disaster response competencies. Emergency code recognition was positively correlated with self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies (p < .05). CONCLUSION: Higher recognition of emergency codes among clinical nurses was associated with higher self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies. Further studies need to develop strategies to improve nurses' awareness and confidence concerning emergency codes. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers should pay attention to provide more opportunities for disaster education to improve nurses' self-confidence and disaster nursing competencies.","Jeong, Suhee; Lee, Ogcheol",J. nurs. manag,,290

Our main objective was to develop a core outcome set (COS) for use in trials aimed at improving AMS in care homes. METHODS: A refined inventory of outcomes for AMS interventions in care homes, compiled from a previous study, was rated in a three-round international Delphi survey with 82 participants, using a nine-point Likert scale (from 1, unimportant, to 9, critical). This was followed by an online consensus exercise with 12 participants from Northern Ireland to finalise the COS content. Subsequently, a suitable outcome measurement instrument (OMI) was selected for each outcome in the COS by: identifying existing OMIs through a literature search and experts' suggestions, assessing the quality of OMIs, and selecting one OMI for each core outcome via a two-round international Delphi survey with 59 participants. RESULTS: Of 14 outcomes initially presented, consensus was reached for inclusion of five outcomes in the COS after the three-round Delphi survey and the online consensus exercise, comprising the total number of antimicrobial courses prescribed, appropriateness of antimicrobial prescribing, days of therapy per 1000 resident-days, rate of antimicrobial resistance, and mortality related to infection. Of 17 potential OMIs identified, three were selected for the two-round Delphi exercise after the quality assessment. Consensus was reached for selection of two OMIs for the COS.

In January 2020, a new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in these patients. The disease caused by this virus has been given the name of COVID-19. During the initial stages of the pandemic, and given the scarcity of studies published about this, it was believed that this coronavirus only caused respiratory symptoms. However, as the number of patients increased, it was observed that cardiovascular disease had a fundamental role in the development and prognosis of the infection. The most important risk factors associated with mortality are age and the presence of comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular ones. The increase in the levels of troponin, natriuretic peptides, and D-dimer are of prognostic values in patients with an infection due to SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 have an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis, heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, and sudden death, in relation to the systematic response to the virus and to the treatments needed in the acute phase. A review is presented in this article of the cardiovascular involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).","Figueroa Triana, Juan Francisco; Salas Márquez, Diego Alfredo; Cabrera Silva, Juan Sebastián; Alvarado Castro, Cristian Camilo; Buitrago Sandoval, Andrés Felipe",Rev.

However, at higher doses, rhBMP-2 does not necessarily increase bone formation but rather increases the incidence of adverse side effects. Here, we investigated whether umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UCMSC)-derived nanovesicles (NVs) further increase the in vivo bone formation at high doses of rhBMP-2. In the presence of UCMSC-derived NVs, proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated in vitro. Furthermore, migration and osteogenesis of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells were stimulated. To examine the efficacy of UCMSC-derived NVs on in vivo bone formation, collagen sponges soaked with rhBMP-2 and UCMSC-derived NVs were used in athymic nude mice with calvarial defects. At a high rhBMP-2 dosage (500 ng/mL), UCMSC-derived NVs significantly promoted bone formation in calvarial defects; however, the UCMSC-derived NVs alone did not induce in vivo bone formation. Our results indicate that UCMSC-derived NVs can potentiate the bone formation efficacy of rhBMP-2 at a high dosage.","Lim, Songhyun; Lyu, Hao-Zhen; Lee, Ju-Ro; Han, Shi Huan; Lee, Jae Hyup; Kim, Byung-Soo",,,290

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all patients undergoing surgery at the pediatric surgery department in the pandemic period, from the beginning of the state of emergency in Spain until the first restrictions were removed, was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients underwent surgery in 58 days vs. 406 patients in the same 2019 period (p < 0.00001). 59.01% of surgeries were urgent. 5.1% of patients had a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. 30 different procedures were carried out, with appendectomy being the most frequent one (n = 13, 19.6% of patients). 61.5% of appendicitis cases were complicated vs. 42.4% in the non-COVID period (p = 0.17). Surgical approach was open in 46.1% of patients vs. 6.1% in the non-COVID period (p = 0.004). No statistically significant differences were found in terms of complication rate or hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a significant decrease in the number of daily procedures was noted, with more than half being urgent. Appendicular pathologies were in a more advanced stage than usual, with a clear trend towards open surgery vs. laparoscopy.","Bada-Bosch, I; de Agustín, J C; de la Torre, M; Ordóñez, J; Blanco, M D; Pérez-Egido, L; Fanjul, M; Del Cañizo, A",Cir Pediatr,,290

Ebselen reacts with a multitude of protein thiols, forming a selenosulfide bond, which results in pleiotropic effects of antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory nature. The main protease (Mpro) of the corona virus SARS-CoV-2 is a potential drug target, and a screen with over 10,000 compounds identified ebselen as a particularly promising inhibitor of Mpro (Jin, Z. et al. (2020) Nature 582, 289-293). We discuss here the reaction of ebselen with cysteine proteases, the role of ebselen in infections with viruses and with other microorganisms. We also discuss effects of ebselen in lung inflammation. In further research on the inhibition of Mpro in SARS-CoV-2, ebselen can serve as a promising lead compound, if the inhibitory effect is confirmed in intact cells in vivo. Independently of this action, potential beneficial effects of ebselen in COVID-19 are ascribed to a number of targets critical to pathogenesis, such as attenuation of inflammatory oxidants and cytokines.","Sies, Helmut; Parnham, Michael J",Free Radic Biol Med,,290

We describe the epidemiology, clinical course, experience of non-invasive ventilation and intensive care, mortality and short-term sequelae of patients admitted to two large District General Hospitals across a large East London National Health Service Trust during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out on a cohort of 1946 patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19, including descriptive statistics and survival analysis. A more detailed analysis was undertaken of a subset of patients admitted across three respiratory units in the trust. RESULTS: Increasing age, male sex and Asian ethnicity were associated with worse outcomes. Increasing severity of chest X-ray abnormalities trended with mortality. Radiological changes persisted in over 50% of cases at early follow-up (6 weeks). Ongoing symptoms including hair loss, memory impairment, breathlessness, cough and fatigue were reported in 70% of survivors, with 39% of patients unable to return to work due to ongoing symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding the acute clinical features, course of illness and outcomes of COVID-19 will be crucial in understanding the effect of differences in risk, as well as the effectiveness of new interventions and vaccination between the successive waves of the pandemic.","Cheng, Daryl; Calderwood, Claire; Skyllberg, Erik; Ainley, Adam",,,290

The government imposed a general lockdown, combined with social protection measures--mainly cash transfers and the distribution of food parcels. This was an attempt to mitigate the impact of the lockdown, in a country where 70% of the population works in the informal sector. Yet despite this, the transmission rate remained high, and as of early June Peru's COVID-19 mortality rates were amongst the highest worldwide. The pandemic has shed a stark light on Peru's failure to guarantee the right to health and the limits of the tools used to assess the health system's performance. Over the past two decades Peru has been praised for introducing a series of reforms aimed at achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), primarily through the expansion of health insurance across low-income groups. Nevertheless, reforms have failed to overcome the historical fragmentation of the system, where access to services is determined by income, gender, and geographical location.","Gianella, Camila Iguiñiz-Romero Ruth Romero María José Gideon Jasmine",Health and Human Rights,,290

The current study aims to investigate the use of web-based videoconferencing for teaching in the post-COVID-19 landscape. The study proposes and evaluates a model to predict continuance intention to use videoconferencing systems, from the perspective of University teachers. The proposed model combines constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Expectancy Confirmation Model (ECM). Sixty-six academic staff members filled out a survey questionnaire about their attitudes towards continuing using videoconferencing systems for teaching in the post-Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) period. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to test the measurement and the structural model. The model explains and predicts 73% of the total variance in continuance intention to use.

There have been limited published studies to date documenting the performance of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. METHODS: We compared the DiaSorin Liaison SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG and Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays using 228 samples spanning patients with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, patients with compatible symptoms but negative PCR, pre-COVID specimens, and potential cross-reactives. RESULTS: Both assays detected antibodies in 18/19 samples collected at least one week after a positive PCR result. Neither method consistently detected antibodies in specimens collected within one week of a positive PCR result (sensitivity < 50%), but antibodies were detected by only Roche in four samples in this time frame. Using 139 pre-COVID and 35 PCR-negative samples, the Roche and DiaSorin assays demonstrated specificities of 100.0% and 98.9%, respectively. Neither assay demonstrated cross-reactivity from other coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43), respiratory pathogens (adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus), or antibodies to other viruses (HIV, EBV, CMV, HBV, HCV, HAV). DISCUSSION: Overall, the qualitative interpretations afforded by the Roche and DiaSorin assays agreed for 97% of samples evaluated. Minor discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity were observed between methods, with the differences in specificity more clinically significant for our low-prevalence population. For the DiaSorin assay, all disagreements with the Roche assay occurred in samples with quantitative signals near the cut-off determining positivity.","Merrill, Anna E; Jackson, J Brooks; Ehlers, Alexandra; Voss, Dena; Krasowski, Matthew D",J Appl Lab Med,,290

Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate reported by previous studies conducted in South Korea prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, three household surveys were carried out on May 14-21, June 4-7, and June 21-24, 2020 in 133 Brazilian urban areas. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 250 individuals in each city to undergo a rapid antibody test. Subjects answered a questionnaire on household assets, schooling and self-reported skin color/ethnicity using the standard Brazilian classification in five categories: white, black, brown, Asian or indigenous. Principal component analyses of assets was used to classify socioeconomic position into five wealth quintiles. Poisson regression was used for the analyses. Results: 25 025 subjects were tested in the first, 31 165 in the second, and 33 207 in the third wave of the survey, with prevalence of positive results equal to 1.4%, 2.4%, and 2.9% respectively. Individuals in the poorest quintile were 2.16 times (95% confidence interval 1.86; 2.51) more likely to test positive than those in the wealthiest quintile, and those with 12 or more years of schooling had lower prevalence than subjects with less education. Indigenous individuals had 4.71 (3.65; 6.08) times higher prevalence than whites, as did those with black or brown skin color. Adjustment for region of the country reduced the prevalence ratios according to wealth, education and ethnicity, but results remained statistically significant. Conclusions: The prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil shows steep class and ethnic gradients, with lowest risks among white, educated and wealthy individuals.","Horta, Bernardo L; Silveira, Mariângela F; Barros, Aluísio J D; Barros, Fernando C; Hartwig, Fernando P; Dias, Mariane S; Menezes, Ana M B; Hallal, Pedro C; Victora, Cesar G",Rev Panam Salud Publica,,290

We integrate the Ethereum blockchain with off-chain storage to manage non-critical and large-sized data. We present algorithms and discuss their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We evaluate the proposed solution by performing cost and security analysis as well as comparing it with the existing non-blockchain and blockchain-based solutions. Performance evaluation results reveal that the proposed solution is low-cost, and our smart contracts are secure enough against possible attacks and vulnerabilities.

Rapid antigen tests have received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in symptomatic persons (2), but data are lacking on test performance in asymptomatic persons to inform expanded screening testing to rapidly identify and isolate infected persons (3). To evaluate the performance of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, it was used along with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing to analyze 3,419 paired specimens collected from persons aged &#8805;10 years at two community testing sites in Pima County, Arizona, during November 3-17, 2020. Viral culture was performed on 274 of 303 residual real-time RT-PCR specimens with positive results by either test (29 were not available for culture). Compared with real-time RT-PCR testing, the BinaxNOW antigen test had a sensitivity of 64.2% for specimens from symptomatic persons and 35.8% for specimens from asymptomatic persons, with near 100% specificity in specimens from both groups. Virus was cultured from 96 of 274 (35.0%) specimens, including 85 (57.8%) of 147 with concordant antigen and real-time RT-PCR positive results, 11 (8.9%) of 124 with false-negative antigen test results, and none of three with false-positive antigen test results. Among specimens positive for viral culture, sensitivity was 92.6% for symptomatic and 78.6% for asymptomatic individuals. When the pretest probability for receiving positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 is elevated (e.g., in symptomatic persons or in persons with a known COVID-19 exposure), a negative antigen test result should be confirmed by NAAT (1). Despite a lower sensitivity to detect infection, rapid antigen tests can be an important tool for screening because of their quick turnaround time, lower costs and resource needs, high specificity, and high positive predictive value (PPV) in settings of high pretest probability. The faster turnaround time of the antigen test can help limit transmission by more rapidly identifying infectious persons for isolation, particularly when used as a component of serial testing strategies.","Prince-Guerra, Jessica L; Almendares, Olivia; Nolen, Leisha D; Gunn, Jayleen K L; Dale, Ariella P; Buono, Sean A; Deutsch-Feldman, Molly; Suppiah, Suganthi; Hao, LiJuan; Zeng, Yan; Stevens, Valerie A; Knipe, Kristen; Pompey, Justine; Atherstone, Christine; Bui, David P; Powell, Tracy; Tamin, Azaibi; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Shewmaker, Patricia L; Medrzycki, Magdalena; Wong, Phili; Jain, Shilpi; Tejada-Strop, Alexandra; Rogers, Shannon; Emery, Brian; Wang, Houping; Petway, Marla; Bohannon, Caitlin; Folster, Jennifer M; MacNeil, Adam; Salerno, Reynolds; Kuhnert-Tallman, Wendi; Tate, Jacqueline E; Thornburg, Natalie J; Kirking, Hannah L; Sheiban, Khalilullah; Kudrna, Julie; Cullen, Theresa; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Villanueva, Julie M; Rose, Dale A; Neatherlin, John C; Anderson, Mark; Rota, Paul A; Honein, Margaret A; Bower, William A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,290

331033,Voices,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a rapidly emerging respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many health care systems are at risk of exceeding their health care capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on health care systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalized, or admitted to the ICU. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop, study, and evaluate clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or require hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: Using a systematic approach to model development and optimization, we trained and compared various types of machine learning models, including logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting. To evaluate the developed models, we performed a retrospective evaluation on demographic, clinical, and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. In addition, we determined which clinical features were predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks using causal explanations. RESULTS: Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identified patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 67%-81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI 46%-51%), patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require hospitalization with 0.92 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI 0.81-0.98), and patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI 0.95-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that predictive models trained on routinely collected clinical data could be used to predict clinical pathways for COVID-19 and, therefore, help inform care and prioritize resources.","Schwab, Patrick; DuMont Schütte, August; Dietz, Benedikt; Bauer, Stefan",J Med Internet Res,,290

We review literature on the transmission and control of SARS-CoV-2 and discuss the challenges of focusing on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) as critical control measures in low-income countries. A significantly higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 related deaths has been reported for the United States of America and other high-income countries in Europe and Asia, regardless of advanced medical facilities in those countries. In contrast, much lower COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality rates have been documented in many low-income countries, despite having comparatively higher socioeconomic burdens and suboptimal medical facilities. By September 29, 2020 over one million deaths have been reported. On the same day, the cumulative total of COVID-19 related morbidity for Africa was 35,954 with 3.5% of the global COVID-19 related deaths. We present arguments for the relatively low COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates in many low-income countries and discuss the critical importance of WASH for preventing the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. We observe that the key recommendations put forward by the World Health Organization to effectively control the pandemic have been difficult to implement in low-income countries. We conclude that the pandemic reinforces previous pronouncements that adequate and effective WASH measures are crucial for public health and recommend closer coordination between public health and WASH sectors.","Donde, Oscar Omondi; Atoni, Evans; Muia, Anastasia Wairimu; Yillia, Paul T",Water Res,,290

333682,Letters to the Editor,2021,"BACKGROUND: In late March 2020, South Africa implemented a 5-stage COVID-19 Risk Adjusted Strategy, which included a lockdown that required all residents to remain home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Due to this lockdown, individuals have been forced to find and use alternatives for accomplishing tasks including shopping, socializing, working, and finding information, and many have turned to the internet and their mobile devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe how South Africans consume and internalize information surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak in order to determine whether the COVID-19 lockdown and social isolation have influenced technology behavior, particularly in terms of health communication and information. METHODS: From June 24 to August 24, 2020, people in South Africa were invited to complete a survey through the Upinion mobile app, an online data collection resource. The survey collected information on demographics, and technology use during the lockdown, and COVID-19 knowledge. RESULTS: There were 405 participants, of which 296 (73.06%) were female. A total of 320 (79.01%) participants had a tertiary school education, 242 (59.75%) were single, and 173 (42.72%) had full-time employment. The lockdown forced 363 (89.63%) participants to use more technology, especially for work (n=140, 24.05%) and social media/communication (n=133, 22.85%). Security or privacy issues (n=46, 38.98%) and unfamiliarity with technology (n=32, 27.12%) were identified as the most common issues faced by the 127 (31.36%) participants who were unsure about using technology prior to the lockdown. Almost all participants (n=392, 96.79%) stated that they would continue using technology after the lockdown. Multimedia (n=215, 53.09%), mobile phone content (n=99, 24.44%), and health organizations and professionals (n=91, 22.47%) were the main sources of COVID-19 information. Most participants (n=282, 69.63%) felt that they had enough information. Two-thirds (n=275, 67.90%) of participants stated that they had used their mobile phones for health information before the lockdown, with web searches (n=109, 26.91%), social media (n=58, 14.32%), and government and institutional websites (n=52; 12.84%) serving as their main sources of information. Overall, the mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 8.8 (out of 10), and 335 (82.72%) had adequate knowledge (scored &#8805;8). Males were less likely to identify the correct transmission routes, and single participants were less likely to identify the signs and symptoms of the coronavirus. Tertiary school graduates were 4 times more likely to correctly identify the routes and 2 times more likely to identify how to stop the spread of the virus. People aged 43-56 years were 4 times more likely to identify how the coronavirus can be prevented, and participants &#8805;57 years were 2.6 times more likely to obtain a knowledge score of 10 when compared to those under 29 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that the COVID-19 lockdown has forced people to increase technology use, and people plan to continue using technology after the lockdown is lifted. Increased technology use was seen across a variety of fields; however, barriers including privacy, unfamiliarity, and data costs were identified. This population showed high COVID-19 knowledge, although the use of web searches and social media, instead of government and institutional websites, increases the potential for health misinformation to be spread.","Fischer, Alex Emilio; Van Tonder, Tanya; Gumede, Siphamandla B; Lalla-Edward, Samanta T",JMIR Form Res,,290

We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and risk factors affecting the prognosis of PD patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Clinical data of severe COVID-19 patients admitted at the Union Hospital, Wuhan between 28th January and 29th February 2020 were collected and analyzed. 10 patients (1.96%) had a medical history of PD with a mean (SD) age of 72.10 (± 11.46) years. The clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe COVID-19 with and without PD patients were then compared. There was no significant difference in overall mortality between the PD and non-PD patients with severe COVID-19 (p > 0.05). In PD patients with severe COVID-19, the proportion of patients with critical type, disturbance of consciousness, incidence of complications, white blood cells count and neutrophils counts on admission seem higher in the non-survivors. PD patients with older age, longer PD duration, and late stage PD may be highly susceptible to critical COVID-19 infection and bad outcome. The PD patients with consciousness disorders and complications that progressed rapidly are at increased risk of death.","Zhai, Heng; Lv, Yinzhang; Xu, Yu; Wu, Yi; Zeng, Weiqi; Wang, Tao; Cao, Xuebing; Xu, Yan",J Neural Transm (Vienna),,290
336036,Peruvian research: striving for the highest standards,2021,"In this article, we report on the results of an experimental study to estimate the effects of delivering information about racial disparities in COVID-19-related death rates. On the one hand, we find that such information led to increased perception of risk among those Black respondents who lacked prior knowledge; and to increased support for a more concerted public health response among those White respondents who expressed favorable views towards Blacks at baseline. On the other hand, for Whites with colder views towards Blacks, the informational treatment had the opposite effect: it led to decreased risk perception and to lower levels of support for an aggressive response. Our findings highlight that well-intentioned public health campaigns spotlighting disparities might have adverse side effects and those ought to be considered as part of a broader strategy. The study contributes to a larger scholarly literature on the challenges of making and implementing social policy in racially-divided societies.","Harell, Allison; Lieberman, Evan",Soc Sci Med,,290

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of nurses working in pediatric, obstetric, and internal wards of two medical centers in Israel between February and October 2018. METHODS: Participants completed anonymous questionnaires about genomic knowledge, SEA, perceived importance of genomics, and the performance of genomic skills in nursing practice. Associations between variables were analyzed using Pearson correlations, and a hierarchical regression model was used to determine which variables explained the performance of genomic practices among participants. FINDINGS: Altogether 423 nurses participated in the study. The mean genomic knowledge was low (55.05 ± 14.82%). Nurses reported a low integration of genomic skills in their practice (M = 1.90, SD = 0.71), although their overall perceived importance of genomics was positive (M = 2.88, SD = 0.68). Positive correlations were found between SEA and the integration of genomic skills in nursing practice. Obstetric nurses had more genomic knowledge, more positive perceptions about genomics, and performed more genomic skills in their nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS: Although nurses realized the importance of genomics to their practice, and genomics is part of the Israeli nursing core curriculum, we found disappointingly low levels of knowledge and performance of genomic skills in nursing practice. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results call for action to establish ongoing education programs in genomics for nurses, which would lead to the inclusion of genomic skills into routine nursing practice, and prepare nurses for providing personalized medicine.","Dagan, Efrat; Amit, Yulia; Sokolov, Libi; Litvak, Patricia; Barnoy, Sivia",J. nurs. scholarsh,,290

Currently, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are the only RCTs routinely conducted during the pandemic. Information about efficacy and safety of different vaccines represents a fertile ground for nocebo phenomena. Individual and contextual factors will be emphasized in order to understand the presence of a refusal of immunization associated with a specific vaccine considered less effective and safe. Critical aspects and some guidelines will be presented in order to counteract the nocebo effects and to improve adherence to drug treatments and the vaccination campaign.Expert opinion: The nocebo effect could explain the presence of strong resistance in European countries to immunization with a vaccine perceived as less effective, compared to others. Increased awareness of the nocebo effect would be relevant as it could lead to a greater participation in the vaccination campaign and in protecting individuals against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Amanzio, Martina; Cipriani, Giuseppina Elena; Bartoli, Massimo",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,,290

A total of 170 adult patients were enrolled and all-cause mortality was found to be 39% (67/170). Most non-survivors were above 60 years of age (64%) while gender distribution was quite similar in both groups (males: 77% vs 78%). Most (80.6%) non-survivors came with peripheral oxygen saturation less than 93% while 95% of them had critical disease on arrival. Use of non-invasive ventilation in emergency room was higher among non-survivors (56.7%) versus survivors (26.2%). Median Interleukin-6 levels were higher among non-survivors (78.6: IQR = 33.8-49.0) compared to survivors (21.8: IQR = 12.6-36.3). Most patients in the non-survivor group (86.6%) required invasive ventilator support during hospital stay compared to 7.8% in the survivors. The median duration of ICU stay was longer for non-survivors (9: IQR = 6-12) compared to survivors (5: IQR = 3-7) days. Univariable binary logistic regression showed that age above 60 years, oxygen saturation below 93%, Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio above 5, procalcitonin above 2ng/ml, unit increase in SOFA score and arterial lactate levels were associated with mortality. We also found that a unit decrease in Pao2/FiO2 ratio and serum albumin were associated with mortality in our patients. Multivariable regression showed that age above 60 years (aOR = 3.4: 95% CI = 1.6-6.9), peripheral oxygen saturation below 93% (aOR = 3.5:95% CI = 1.6-7.7) and serum pro-calcitonin above 2ng/ml (aOR = 4.8; 95% CI = 1.9-12.2) were associated with higher odds of mortality when adjusted by month of admission. Most common cause of death was multisystem organ failure in 35 (56.6%) non-survivors while 22 (35.5%) died due to respiratory failure. Larger prospective studies are needed to further strengthen these findings.","Sarfaraz, Samreen; Shaikh, Quratulain; Saleem, Syed Ghazanfar; Rahim, Anum; Herekar, Fivzia Farooq; Junejo, Samina; Hussain, Aneela",PLoS One,,290

No statistically significant difference was observed between the animals weight in both groups before the performance of the procedure. It was possible to observe, after the use of tenoxicam with its diluent or the isolated diluent, that the nuclei diameter of the cells of the venous endothelium showed a dimension, markedly smaller when compared to the Control Group, in which was injected 0,9% sodium chloride. The results found allow to conclude that tenoxicam with its commercial or its isolated diluent reduce the nuclei diameter of the cells of the venous endothelium, where they were injected.","Brandão Schnaider, Taylor; Henrique Vianna de Andrade, Carlos; Juliano, Yara; Ferreira Novo, Neil; de Fátima Brasil Engelman, Miriam; Sormanti Schnaider, Gabrielle; Sormanti Schnaider, Caroline",Acta cir. bras.,,290

We investigated the effectiveness of the vaccines in a large community-based survey of randomly selected households across the UK. We found that the effectiveness of BNT162b2 and ChAd0x1 against any infections (new PCR positives) and infections with symptoms or high viral burden is reduced with the Delta variant. A single dose of the mRNA-1273 vaccine had similar or greater effectiveness compared to a single dose of BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. Effectiveness of two doses remains at least as great as protection afforded by prior natural infection. The dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly between BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1, with greater initial effectiveness against new PCR-positives but faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection with BNT162b2. There was no evidence that effectiveness varied by dosing interval, but protection was higher among those vaccinated following a prior infection and younger adults. With Delta, infections occurring following two vaccinations had similar peak viral burden to those in unvaccinated individuals. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with Delta.","Pouwels, Koen B; Pritchard, Emma; Matthews, Philippa; Stoesser, Nicole B; Eyre, David W; Vihta, Karina-Doris; House, Thomas; Hay, Jodie; Bell, John; Newton, John; Farrar, Jeremy; Crook, Derrick W; Cook, Duncan; Rourke, Emma; Studley, Ruth; Peto, Tim E; Diamond, Ian; Walker, Sarah; Team, - COVID-19 Infection Survey",,,290

344069,Safe Blues: The case for virtual safe virus spread in the long-term fight against epidemics,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has limited daily activities and even contact between patients and primary care providers. This makes it more difficult to provide adequate primary care services, which include connecting patients to an appropriate medical specialist. A smartphone-compatible artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot that classifies patients' symptoms and recommends the appropriate medical specialty could provide a valuable solution. OBJECTIVE: In order to establish a contactless method of recommending the appropriate medical specialty, this study aimed to construct a deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and to develop an AI chatbot that can be used on a smartphone. METHODS: We collected 118,008 sentences containing information on symptoms with labels (medical specialty), conducted data cleansing, and finally constructed a pipeline of 51,134 sentences for this study. Several deep learning models, including 4 different long short-term memory (LSTM) models with or without attention and with or without a pretrained FastText embedding layer, as well as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for NLP, were trained and validated using a randomly selected test data set. The performance of the models was evaluated on the basis of the precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). An AI chatbot was also designed to make it easy for patients to use this specialty recommendation system. We used an open-source framework called ""Alpha"" to develop our AI chatbot. This takes the form of a web-based app with a frontend chat interface capable of conversing in text and a backend cloud-based server application to handle data collection, process the data with a deep learning model, and offer the medical specialty recommendation in a responsive web that is compatible with both desktops and smartphones. RESULTS: The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model yielded the best performance, with an AUC of 0.964 and F1-score of 0.768, followed by LSTM model with embedding vectors, with an AUC of 0.965 and F1-score of 0.739. Considering the limitations of computing resources and the wide availability of smartphones, the LSTM model with embedding vectors trained on our data set was adopted for our AI chatbot service. We also deployed an Alpha version of the AI chatbot to be executed on both desktops and smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: With the increasing need for telemedicine during the current COVID-19 pandemic, an AI chatbot with a deep learning-based NLP model that can recommend a medical specialty to patients through their smartphones would be exceedingly useful. This chatbot allows patients to identify the proper medical specialist in a rapid and contactless manner, based on their symptoms, thus potentially supporting both patients and primary care providers.","Lee, Hyeonhoon; Kang, Jaehyun; Yeo, Jonghyeon",J Med Internet Res,,290

Using the global COVID-19 data of 188 countries extracted from the Our World in Data between January 22, 2020-January 18, 2021, this study attempts to explore the potential determinants of the number of days to reach the first and second peak of COVID-19 cases for all 188 countries. MethodsA semi-parametric Cox proportional hazard (PH) model has been used to explore the covariates that are associated with the number of days to reach the first and second peak of global COVID-19 cases. ResultsAs of January 18, 2021, the first and second peak were found in 175 and 59 countries, out of 188 countries, respectively. The median number of days to hit the first peak was 60 days for countries which have median age above 40 while the median number of days to hit the second peak was 267 days for countries which have population density above 500 per square kilometer. Countries having population density between 250 and 500 were 2.25 times more likely to experience the first peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 1.15-4.45, P < 0.05) than countries which have population density below 25. Countries having population density between 100 and 250 were 67% less likely to get the second peak (95% CI: 0.119-0.908, P < 0.05) compared to countries which have population density below 25. Countries having cardiovascular death rates above 350 were 2.94 times more likely to get the first peak (95% CI: 1.59-5.43, P < 0.001). In contrast, countries having diabetes prevalence rate 3 to 12 were 85% less likely to experience the second peak of COVID-19 cases (95% CI: 0.036-0.680, P < 0.05) than countries which have diabetes prevalence rate below 3. Besides, highly significant difference is found in the Kaplan-Meier plots of the number of days to reach both peaks across different categories of the countrys Human Development Index. ConclusionsThe number of days to the first peak was considerably small in Asian & European countries but that to the second peak in the countries where diabetes prevalence was very higher. Countrys life expectancy had a significant effect on determining the first peak and so was the case for two other variables-the cardiovascular death rate and hospital beds per thousand. A contrast result was found for Human Development Index factor under the second peak. Additionally, it was found that the second peak was more likely to occur in more densely populated countries.","Oshan, Yesar Ahmed; Zainab, Begum; Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar; Khan, Hasinur Rahaman",,,290

The contributions of the implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies and the COVID-19 pandemic to major air pollutant emission reductions were studied, and their impacts on the regional air quality under adverse meteorological conditions were simulated using an air quality model. The results showed that from the 'New Year Haze' in Dec 2016-Jan 2017 to the 'Pandemic Haze' in Jan-Feb 2020, the major air pollutant emissions in the region had dropped by approximately 50%, and the average concentration of PM2.5 was potentially reduced by more than 40% under adverse meteorological conditions. The most effective emission reduction measures included the clean heating project and raising the standards in key industrial sectors, such as the iron and steel industry, coal-fired boilers, and power plants, which contributed 67.1% and 53.4% of the emission reductions in SO2 and PM2.5, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic predominantly affected the mobile sources and light industry, which contributed 71.9% and 68.2% of the emission reductions in NOx and VOCs, respectively. The implementation of air pollution prevention and control policies contributed substantially to the improvement of regional air quality, which effectively reduced the intensity and extent of the heavy pollution process under unfavorable meteorological conditions. The regional average PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 26%, and the number of days experiencing heavy pollution decreased by 44%. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the average PM2.5 concentration in the region was reduced by an additional 24%, and the duration and extent of heavy pollution decreased even further.","Tang, Qian; Zheng, Bo; Xue, Wen-Bo; Zhang, Qiang; Lei, Yu; He, Ke-Bin",Huan Jing Ke Xue,,290

348483,20/20 Vision,2020,"A novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has emerged in Wuhan, China since the end of December 2019 and has quickly spread all over the world in a matter of two months. To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the rapid increase of infected patients and deaths, it is urgent to explore an effective treatment for COVID-19. Current studies suggest that there exists cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patient, some of the patients will develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction, even death. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess the property of immunomodulation. Given the previous preclinical and clinical studies, MSCs therapy has been shown safety and efficacy in the treatment of respiratory failure or ARDS. Based on similar principles, MSCs therapy may also be an effective therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we summarized the clinical outcomes of MSCs for ARDS patients in some preclinical and clinical studies, and discussed the application of MSCs for patients with COVID-19 in China and the related important issues with MSCs use during the outbreak.","Xiong, Jing; Bao, Lei; Qi, Hongbo; Feng, Zhichun; Shi, Yuan",Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,,290

348650,A Unified Concept of Acne in the PAPA Spectrum Disorders,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells mainly through the interaction between the virus's Spike protein and the viral receptors namely Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). Both are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, in the nasal and bronchial epithelium, as well as in the type II alveolar epithelial cells. The aim of this review is to report the evidences from the scientific literature on the pathophysiology and the available treatments for olfactory-gustatory disorders in patients with COVID-19. The mechanisms involved in these disorders are still unclear and studies on specific therapies are scarce. However, it has been hypothesized that a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory neurons as well as the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the alveolar epithelial cells are the main causes of olfactory-gustatory disorders. The possible mechanisms described in the literature for changes in taste perception in patients with COVID-19 include olfactory disorders and a competitive activity of COVID-19 on ACE2 receptors in the taste buds. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 can bind to sialic acid receptors in the taste buds. In general, evidences show that there is no specific treatment for olfactory-taste disorders induced by SARS-CoV-2, even though some treatments have been used and have shown some promising results, such as olfactory training, intranasal application of sodium citrate and vitamin A, as well as systemic use of omega-3 and zinc. Corticosteroids have also been used as a pharmacological approach to treat patients with olfactory dysfunction with some contradictory results. The knowledge of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 influences the sensory systems and how effective therapies can treat the loss of smell and taste will have important implications on the understanding and clinical management of olfactory-taste disorders.","Neta, Francisca Idalina Fernandes Amélia Carolina Lopes Vale Adson José Martins Pinheiro Francisco Irochima Cobucci Ricardo Ney Azevedo Eduardo Pereira de Guzen Fausto Pierdoná",Current Research in Pharmacology and Drug Discovery,,290
348657,"Approaching environmental human thermophysiological thresholds for the case of Ankara, Turkey",2020,"Multiple viral pathogens can pose a significant health risk to individuals. As a recent example, the ß-coronavirus family virion, SARS-CoV-2, has quickly evolved as a pandemic leading to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. To date, no definitive treatment or vaccine application exists for COVID-19. Although new investigations seek to repurpose existing antiviral treatments for COVID-19, innovative treatment strategies not normally considered to have antiviral capabilities may be critical to address this global concern. One such avenue that may prove to be exceedingly fruitful and offer exciting potential as new antiviral therapy involves the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its associated pathways of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2), and AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK). Recent work has shown that mTOR pathways in conjunction with AMPK may offer valuable targets to control cell injury, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and the onset of hyperinflammation, a significant disability associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, pathways that can activate mTOR may be necessary for anti-hepatitis C activity, reduction of influenza A virus replication, and vital for type-1 interferon responses with influenza vaccination. Yet, important considerations for the development of safe and effective antiviral therapy with mTOR pathways exist. Under some conditions, mTOR can act as a double edge sword and participate in virion replication and virion release from cells. Future work with mTOR as a potential antiviral target is highly warranted and with a greater understanding of this novel pathway, new treatments against several viral pathogens may successfully emerge.","Maiese, Kenneth",Curr Neurovasc Res,,290
349469,Congress Calendar,2020,"The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic is demanding rapid action of the authorities and scientific community in order to find new antimicrobial solutions that could inactivate the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 that causes this disease. Gram-positive bacteria contribute to severe pneumonia associated with COVID-19, and their resistance to antibiotics is increasing at an alarming rate. In this regard, non-woven fabrics are currently used for the fabrication of infection prevention clothing such as face masks, caps, scrubs, shirts, trousers, disposable gowns, overalls, hoods, aprons and shoe covers as protective tools against viral and bacterial infections. However, these non-woven fabrics are made of materials that do not possess antimicrobial activity. Thus, we have developed here non-woven fabrics with antimicrobial coatings of cranberry extracts capable of inactivating enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and the phage phi 6, and two multidrug-resistant bacteria: the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. The non-toxicity of these advanced technology was ensured using a Caenorhabditis elegans in vivo model. These results open up a new prevention path using natural and biodegradable compounds for the fabrication of infection prevention clothing in the current COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Tunon-Molina, Alberto; Cano-Vicent, Alba; Marti, Miguel; Muramoto, Yukiko; Noda, Takeshi; Takayama, Kazuo; Serrano-Aroca, Angel",,,290

Here we develop a suite of comprehensive machine learning methods and tools spanning different computational models, molecular representations, and loss functions for molecular property prediction and drug discovery. Specifically, we represent molecules as both graphs and sequences. Built on these representations, we develop novel deep models for learning from molecular graphs and sequences. In order to learn effectively from highly imbalanced datasets, we develop advanced loss functions that optimize areas under precision-recall curves. Altogether, our work not only serves as a comprehensive tool, but also contributes towards developing novel and advanced graph and sequence learning methodologies. Results on both online and offline antibiotics discovery and molecular property prediction tasks show that our methods achieve consistent improvements over prior methods.

This paper presents a medical stance on research studies of COVID-19, wherein we estimated a time-series data-based statistical model using prophet to comprehend the trend of the current pandemic in the coming future after July 29, 2020 by using data at a global level. Prophet is an open-source framework discovered by the Data Science team at Facebook for carrying out forecasting based operations. It aids to automate the procedure of developing accurate forecasts and can be customized according to the use case we are solving. The Prophet model is easy to work because the official repository of prophet is live on GitHub and is open for contributions and can be fitted effortlessly. The statistical data presented on the paper refers to the number of daily confirmed cases officially for the period January 22, 2020, to July 29, 2020. The estimated data produced by the forecast models can then be used by Governments and medical care departments of various countries to manage the existing situation, thus trying to flatten the curve in various nations as we believe that there is minimal time to do this. The inferences made using the model can be clearly comprehended without much effort. Furthermore, it tries to give an understanding of the past, present, and future trends by showing graphical forecasts and statistics. Compared to other models, prophet specifically holds its own importance and innovativeness as the model is fully automated and generates quick and precise forecasts that can be tunable additionally. © 2021 Lavoisier.

The objective of this study is to present characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to medical departments of the Hospital of Piacenza during the first wave of the epidemic. METHODS: A total of 218 patients with confirmed or suspect COVID-19 and severe pneumonia were included from February 21st to May 15th, 2020. Routinely-collected clinical and laboratory data were retrospectively retrieved from electronic medical files. A Cox proportional-hazards model was fit to assess the association of treatment and other variables with death. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 68 years; 150 patients (69%) had comorbidities, mainly hypertension (107, 49%). Overall, 185 (85%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on admission, including 103 (47%) with moderate or severe ARDS. Chest computed tomography scan showed bilateral disease in 201 (98%) and extensive lung involvement in 79 (50%) patients. Most patients received antiviral treatment (187, 86%) and corticosteroids (134, 61%). All patients received respiratory support and 64 (29%) were admitted to intensive care unit. As of June 30th, 100 patients (46%) died, 109 patients (50%) were discharged, and 9 patients (4%) were still hospitalized. In multivariable Cox analysis, age above 65 years, having more than one comorbidity, severe ARDS, low platelet counts, and high LDH levels at admission were associated with mortality, while having diarrhea at admission was associated with survival. The use of antivirals or corticosteroids was not associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Overall case fatality rates were high and associated with comorbidities, extensive lung involvement, ARDS at admission, and advanced age. The use of antivirals was not associated with increased survival.","Guglielmetti, Lorenzo; Kontsevaya, Irina; Leoni, Maria C; Ferrante, Patrizia; Fronti, Elisa; Gerna, Laura; Valdatta, Caterina; Donisi, Alessandra; Faggi, Alberto; Paolillo, Franco; Ratti, Giovanna; Ruggieri, Alessandro; Scotti, Marta; Sacchini, Daria; Taliani, Gloria; Codeluppi, Mauro",J Infect Public Health,,290

Compound 5 crystallizes in a monoclinic system P21 /c space group with four chemical formulas in a unit cell; molecules of compound 5 are self-assembled into a two-dimensional supramolecular structure by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and Câ¯C &#960; stacking. The potential anticancer effects of these compounds on HeLa (cervical carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast), A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), and human umbilical vein (HUVEC) cells were examined. Compared with compounds 1-8 and 10-11, compound 9 exhibits potent in vitro cytotoxicity against HeLa cells and lower cytotoxicity against normal cells. Therefore, further in-depth investigations of compound 9 were performed. Absorption titration experiments and fluorescence spectroscopy studies suggested that compound 9 binds to DNA through the intercalation mode.","Shi, Jiuzhou; Lu, Wen; Chen, Jichao; Sun, Lu; Yang, Shilong; Zhou, Mengyi; Xu, Li; Ma, Ying; Yu, Long",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),,290
355970,Home Monitoring for Glaucoma: Current Applications and Future Directions,2021,"Little is known about the features and outcomes of Brazilian patients with pancreatic cancer. We sought to describe the socio-economic characteristics, patterns of health care access, and survival of patients diagnosed with malignant pancreatic tumors from 2000 to 2014 in São Paulo, Brazil. We included patients with malignant exocrine and non-classified pancreatic tumors according to the International Classifications of Disease (ICD)-O-2 and -O-3, diagnosed from 2000 to 2014, who were registered in the FOSP database. Prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in the subgroup of patients with ductal or non-specified (adeno)carcinoma were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard model. The study population consists of 6855 patients. Median time from the first visit to diagnosis and treatment were 13 (Interquartile range [IQR] 4-30) and 24 (IQR 8-55) days, respectively. Both intervals were longer for patients treated in the public setting. Median OS was 4.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 4.7-5.2). Increasing age, male gender, lower educational level, treatment in the public setting, absence of treatment, advanced stage, and treatment from 2000 to 2004 were associated with inferior OS. From 2000-2004 to 2010-2014, no improvement in OS was seen for patients treated in the public setting. Survival of patients with malignant pancreatic tumors remains dismal. Socioeconomical variables, especially health care funding, are major determinants of survival. Further work is necessary to decrease inequalities in access to medical care for patients with pancreatic cancer in Brazil.","de Jesus, Victor Hugo Fonseca; da Costa, Wilson Luiz; Claro, Laura Carolina Lopez; Coimbra, Felipe José Fernandez; Dettino, Aldo Lourenço Abbade; Riechelmann, Rachel P; Curado, Maria Paula",Sci Rep,,290

358720,The Challenges and Future Perspective of Woven Kenaf Reinforcement in Thermoset Polymer Composites in Malaysia: A Review,2021,"Background: Supplemental oxygen is commonly administered to patients in acute care. It may cause harm when used inappropriately. Guidelines recommend prescription of acute oxygen, yet adherence is poor. We aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to practicing in accordance with the evidence-based Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand (TSANZ) oxygen guideline, and to determine the beliefs and attitudes relating to acute oxygen therapy. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted. The survey consisted of 3 sections: (1) introduction and participant characteristics; (2) opinion/beliefs, knowledge and actions about oxygen therapy and other drugs; and (3) barriers and facilitators to use of the TSANZ guideline. Convenience sampling was employed. A paper-based survey was distributed at the TSANZ Annual Scientific Meeting. An online survey was emailed to the TSANZ membership and to John Hunter Hospital's clinical staff. Results: Responses were received from 133 clinicians: 52.6% nurses, 30.1% doctors, and 17.3% other clinicians. Over a third (37.7%) were unaware/unsure of the oxygen guideline's existence. Most (79.8%) believe that oxygen is a drug and should be treated as one. Most (92.4%) stated they only administered it based on clinical need. For four hypothetical cases, there was only one where the majority of participants identified the optimal oxygen saturation. A number of barriers and facilitators were identified when asked about practicing in accordance with the TSANZ guideline. Lack of oxygen equipment, getting doctors to prescribe oxygen and oxygen being treated differently to other drugs were seen as barriers. The guideline itself and multiple clinician characteristics were considered facilitators. Conclusion: There is discordance between clinicians' beliefs and actions regarding the administration of oxygen therapy and knowledge gaps about optimal oxygen therapy in acute care. Identified barriers and facilitators should be considered when developing evidence-based guidelines to improve dissemination and knowledge exchange.","Cousins, Joyce L; Wark, Peter A B; Hiles, Sarah A; McDonald, Vanessa M",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,,290

It is frequently related to trauma and idiopathic causes, and the pain is mostly chronic. Percutaneous vertebroplasty and sacroplasty are the methods that are widely used for treating compression fractures and sacral insufficiency fractures, respectively. However, the success of polymethylmethacrylate injection in the treatment of osteoporotic coccyx fractures and coccydynia is still unknown. Case Report: A 68-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with complaints of pain in the sacrococcygeal and perianal regions. In the imaging studies, a fracture line in the fifth sacral and first coccygeal segments was observed as evidenced by a bony edema. Since the patient's pain did not improve with conservative methods, we treated him with coccygeoplasty. No complication was encountered. The day after the operation, he was discharged from the hospital with complete pain relief. The patient confirmed having no pain on the third postoperative month and so did not need any analgesics. Conclusion: Coccyceoplasty may be a good treatment option for retractable pain in patients with acute or subacute osteoporotic coccygeal fractures and coccydinia with edema.","Akar, Ezgi; Koban, Orkun; Ögrenci, Ahmet; Yilmaz, Mesut; Dalbayrak, Sedat",Balkan Med J,,290
359878,Comment,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged as a serious jolt to human life and economy. Initial knowledge established pulmonary complications as the chief symptom, however, the neurological aspect of the disease is also becoming increasingly evident. Emerging reports of encephalopathies and similar ailments with the detection of the virus in the CSF has elicited an urgent need for investigating the possibility of neuroinvasiveness of the virus, which cannot be ruled out given the expression of low levels of ACE2 receptors in the brain. Sensory impairments of the olfactory and gustatory systems have also been reported in a large proportion of the cases, indicating the involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Hence, the possibility of neurological damage caused by the virus demands immediate attention and investigation of the mechanisms involved, so as to customize the treatment of patients presenting with neurological complications.","Khan, Shumayila; Gomes, James",eLife (Cambridge),,290
360725,Prioritizing an oncologic approach to endoscopic resection of pedunculated colorectal polyps,2021,"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an anionic phospholipid that is usually localized in the inner leaflets of the plasma membrane. However, the enzyme scramblase catalyzes the externalization of PS on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane during apoptosis or cellular stress. This event prompts the recognition of PS displaying cells by phagocytes leading to ""apoptotic clearance."" Multiple PS receptors (PSRs) mediate this process including members from the TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mertk) receptor Tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by interacting with PS via bridging proteins like Gas6 and ProS1. Ironically, this network (PS/TAM) that evolved for boosting cellular health through clearance of apoptotic and necrotic cells, has been manoeuvred by pathogens and tumor cells using ""apoptotic mimicry."" Enveloped viruses, responsible for most of the lethal epidemics and pandemics including the current SARS-CoV2 outbreak, have employed apoptotic mimicry to their advantage. In the current chapter, we summarize the existing knowledge regarding the involvement of PS/Gas6, ProS1/TAM in facilitating infectivity in a diverse set of cell lines, animals as well as organoids. This network executes a largely proviral role in facilitating infection as seen with Zika, Ebola, Influenza and Dengue viruses. However, this response varies with strains and the cells infected, and in some cases, this same signaling displays an antiviral function. We also report multiple studies that have used neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors in successfully reducing viral replication and ameliorating pathogenicity. Knowledge about this unique signaling pathway and measures that can be taken to inhibit it is most valuable now given how enveloped viruses lead to plagues on the entire globe.","Ghosh Roy, Sounak",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,,290

362174,The effect of singers masks on the impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing,2021,"Hypercoagulability and thrombosis remain a challenge to diagnose and treat in severe COVID-19 infection. The ability of conventional global coagulation tests to accurately reflect in vivo hypo- or hypercoagulability is questioned. The currently available evidence suggests that markedly increased D-dimers can be used in identifying COVID-19 patients who may need intensive care unit (ICU) admission and close monitoring or not. Viscoelastic methods (VMs), like thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM), estimate the dynamics of blood coagulation. The evaluation of coagulopathy by VMs in severe COVID-19 infection seems an increasingly attractive option. Available evidence supports that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure suffer from severe hypercoagulability rather than consumptive coagulopathy often associated with fibrinolysis shutdown. However, the variability in definitions of both the procoagulant profile and the clinical outcome assessment, in parallel with the small sample sizes in most of these studies, do not allow the establishment of a clear association between the hypercoagulable state and thrombotic events. VMs can effectively provide insight into the pathophysiology of coagulopathy, detecting the presence of hypercoagulability in critically ill COVID-19 patients. However, it remains unknown whether the degree of coagulopathy can be used in order to predict the outcome, establish a diagnosis or guide anticoagulant therapy.","Tsantes, Argirios E; Tsantes, Andreas G; Kokoris, Styliani I; Bonovas, Stefanos; Frantzeskaki, Frantzeska; Tsangaris, Iraklis; Kopterides, Petros",,,290

Design/methodology/approach: This study was done by taking data from 166 different countries from the Economist Intelligence Unit, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Bank, Johns Hopkins University and United Nations Population Division (UNPD). After conducting all the necessary standard econometric tests, the study was analyzed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Findings: The finding of the study indicated that COVID-19 tests per million people (LTT/PM), Population Size (LPOP), Civil Liberty Index (CLI) are statistically significant and positively affect the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases;on the other hand, the Health Security Index (HSI) negatively affects the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Practical implications: In emergency circumstances, the government ought to have a special responsibility to align civil rights with the protection of public health cautiously. However, measures to restrict civil liberties must be proportionate.

The detrimental effect of underweight on reproduction complicates the safety evaluation of anti-obesity drugs, making it challenging to distinguish pathological changes mediated through the intended drug-induced weight loss from direct drug effects on reproductive organs. Four-weeks dosing of normal weight Sprague Dawley rats with a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)/glucagon receptor co-agonist induced a robust weight loss, accompanied by histological findings in prostate, seminal vesicles, mammary glands, uterus/cervix and vagina. Characterization of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in male rats revealed reduced hypothalamic Kiss1 mRNA levels and decreased serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone concentrations following co-agonist dosing. These alterations resemble hypogonadotropic hypogonadism typically seen in adverse energy deprived conditions, like chronic food restriction. Concomitant daily administration of kisspeptin-52 from day 21 to the end of the four-week co-agonist dosing period evoked LH and testosterone responses without normalizing histological findings. This incomplete rescue by kisspeptin-52 may be due to the rather short kisspeptin-52 treatment period combined with a desensitization observed on testosterone responses. Concomitant leptin treatment from day 21 did not reverse co-agonist induced changes in HPG axis activity. Furthermore, a single co-agonist injection in male rats slightly elevated LH levels but left testosterone unperturbed, thereby excluding a direct acute inhibitory effect on the HPG axis. Our data suggest that the reproductive phenotype after repeated co-agonist administration was driven by the intended weight loss, however, we cannot exclude a direct organ related effect in chronically treated rats.","Bolze, Florian; Williams, Hannah; Bhuwania, Ridhirama; Egecioglu, Emil; Bloem, Esther; Paulsson, Johan F; Pedersen, Marie Ø; Broadmeadow, Alan; Chesher, Clare J; Moore, Emma L; Skydsgaard, Mikala; Galle, Pia Søndergaard; Dalgaard, Majken; Wulff, Birgitte S; Tena-Sempere, Manuel; Andersen, Lærke W",Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,,290

Direct contact with contaminated surfaces has been among the virus sources, as it remains infective up to days. Several disinfectants have been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, but they rapidly evaporate, are flammable or toxic and may be scarce or inexistent for vulnerable populations. Therefore, we are proposing simple, easy to prepare, low-cost and efficient antiviral films, made with a widely available dishwashing detergent, which can be spread on hands and inanimate surfaces and is expected to maintain virucidal activity for longer periods than the current sanitizers. Avian coronavirus (ACoV) was used as model of the challenge to test the antivirus efficacy of the proposed films. Polystyrene petri dishes were covered with a thin layer of detergent formula. After drying, the films were exposed to different virus doses for 10 min and virus infectivity was determined using embryonated chicken eggs, and RNA virus quantification in allantoic fluids by RT-qPCR. The films inactivated the ACoV (ranging from 103.7 to 106.7 EID50), which is chemically and morphologically similar to SARS-CoV-2, and may constitute an excellent alternative to minimize the spread of COVID-19.","Colnago, Luiz Alberto; Trevisol, Iara Maria; Voss Rech, Daiane; Forato, Lucimara Aparecida; Igreja do Nascimento Mitre, Cirlei; Gagliardi Leite, José Paulo; Giglioti, Rodrigo; Okino, Cintia Hiromi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,290

Common features of COVID-19 pneumonia were bilateral posterior basal consolidations, Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) and air bronchograms. Findings were worse in patients scanned 5-9 days after onset of symptoms. Conclusion: Adequate knowledge of chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia, proves a valuable resource in triaging of symptomatic patients and consequent containment of the disease in the hospital setting.

369763,Patients could share virtual medical appointments for better access to telemedicine,2021,"Given trends in local, national, and global demographics, a need exists for educators in fields that serve older adults to provide innovative and engaging assignments that are relevant and applicable to the diverse contexts in which students are likely to find themselves as they pursue their careers. This article discusses a novel ""elevator pitch"" assignment that could be implemented in a number of ways to fit a variety of pedagogical methods and courses and further tailored to serve the needs of diverse student populations. For those working to actively and successfully recruit, train, and retain students in fields that serve older adults, such flexibility of assignments and delivery are likely to be acutely important as institutions, instructors, and students continue to adapt to rapidly changing developments such as those imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Goedereis, Eric A; Gray-Graves, Amy",Int J Aging Hum Dev,,290

Cycle threshold (CT ) values generated by some of these assays provide inversely proportional proxy measurements of viral load. The clinical implications of CT values are incompletely characterized, particularly in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 25 adult SOT recipients admitted to the Yale New Haven Health System between March 1 and May 15, 2020, analyzing 50 test results to investigate the clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2 CT values in this population. Initial CT values from upper respiratory tract samples were significantly higher in patients on tacrolimus, but were not associated with admission severity nor highest clinical acuity. Viral RNA was detected up to 38 days from symptom onset with a gradual increase in CT values over time. In five patients with serial testing, CT values <35.0 were detected >21 days after symptom onset in 4/5 and &#8805;27 days in 2/5, demonstrating prolonged RNA detection. These data describe SARS-CoV-2 viral dynamics in SOT patients and suggest that CT values may not be useful to predict COVID-19 severity in SOT patients. SARS-CoV-2 CT values may be more useful in informing infection prevention measures.","Gaston, David C; Malinis, Maricar; Osborn, Rebecca; Peaper, David R; Landry, Marie; Juthani-Mehta, Manisha; Azar, Marwan M",Am. j. transplant,,290
371872,The 2020 coronavirus lockdown and seismic monitoring of anthropic activities in Northern Italy,2020,"Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic brought unprecedented changes leading to ‘business unusual’ in all facets of life and livelihood on a global scale. The restrictions on gathering, social distancing and lockdown measures necessitated by the need to curtail its spread, had, and still have an enormous impact on the educational sector as indeed all spheres of life. These measures implied a change in the traditional modus operandi of curriculum and delivery options for educational institutions in South Africa in the bid to continue academic sessions. Hence, a transition of educational institutions from physical interactions to virtual meetings and the need to evolve curriculum contents and delivery. Aim: With the peculiarity of the South African socioeconomic and political space, this article assessed the viability of curriculum change and delivery options (e-teaching and learning) for both students and instructors in the higher institution and the varied implications. It drew from discourses around the theory of localisation within educative context to create a more student-centred approach especially with the situation of less physical contact. Setting: The discourse is set within the South African educational space. Method: Considering the novelty of Covid-19 research and the challenge of contact, the study adopted a participatory action desktop research method to collect and analyse secondary data. The article vividly discussed how institutions transitioned to a localisation of frameworks and policies to ensure successful academic sessions. Results: The educational landscape in South Africa is still plagued with historical antecedents of social injustice, funding, and resource allocation as well as the ever-present pressure of making education affordable to majority of local students. Also, the weakness of the online teaching methods to the physical contact method for learners and practitioners could be summed up into the issues of connectivity, technical knowledge, and attention span. Conclusion: The conclusion enumerated the need for the implementation of policies and frameworks on proper utilisation of online systems to adjust to the demands of less contact-based approaches in favour of virtual approaches. The study called for adequate consideration to issues around the localisation of teaching and learning techniques considering the peculiarities of South Africa with focus on the opportunities, feasibility, and challenges of online measures especially for those in economically disadvantaged spaces.","Patrick, Hosea O.; Abiolu, Rhoda T.

Ocular effects may occur because of the ACE-2 receptor in the retina. BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the retinal layers and optic disc parameters in previously confirmed COVID-19 patients using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). METHODS: This study included 60 eyes of 60 subjects; 35 of them were in the COVID-19 group and the remaining 25 were in the control group. Patients with the diagnosis of COVID-19 that had a negative result after treatment were included in the study. Macular and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements, each retinal layer thickness of all participants were done 14-30 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, following the negative result of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test using SD-OCT. RESULTS: The mean value of central macular thickness was significantly higher in the COVID-19 group than the control group (p = 0.02). The mean values of the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer thickness in the COVID-19 group were signiï¬cantly thinner than control group (p = 0.04 and p = 0.04, respectively). Even though mean RNFL thickness measurements in all sections in the COVID-19 group was thinner than controls, there were no significant differences between groups (p > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: In the early recovery phase, changes in the macula, ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer could be seen. These patients should be followed up closely for the recognition of new pathologies that could be seen in the late recovery phase.","Oren, Burak; Aksoy Aydemir, Gozde; Aydemir, Emre; Atesoglu, Halil Ibrahim; Goker, Yasin Sakir; Kiziltoprak, Hasan; Ozcelik, Kazim Caglar",Clin Exp Optom,,290
372643,Characterization and antiinflammatory properties of fractionated pyroligneous acid from palm kernel shell,2020,"Italy is one of the most affected countries by the new coronavirus (CoViD-19) pandemic. In the country, there are an estimated 49,000-52,000 homeless people. People experiencing homelessness are among the potentially most vulnerable groups to the CoViD-19. Despite this, in Italy there is a worrying delay in implementation of a national coordinated strategy to protect homeless people from the potentially devastating effects caused by CoViD-19. In order to contain the epidemic among the most vulnerable people, we propose a short operational agenda based on the field experience of the medical-humanitarian organization Medici per i Diritti Umani (Doctors for Human Rights, Italy - MEDU) as well as on the example of initiatives taken by other countries.","Barbieri, Alberto",Recenti Prog Med,,290

373751,Experts' request to the Spanish Government: move Spain towards complete lockdown,2020,"The current outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected people around the world. Typically, COVID-19 originates in the lung, but lately it can extend to other organs and lead to tissue injury and multiorgan failure in severe patients, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), kidney failure and sepsis or systemic inflammation. Given that COVID-19 has been detected in a range of other organs, the COVID-19-associated disease is an alert of aberrant activation of host immune response which drives un-controlled inflammation that affects multiple organs. Complement is a vital component of innate immunity where it forms the first line of defense against potentially harmful microbes, but its role in COVID-19 is still not clear. Notably, the abnormal activation and continuous deposits of complement components were identified in the pre-clinical samples from COVID-19 patients, which have been confirmed in animal models. Recent evidence has revealed that the administration of complement inhibitors leads to relieve inflammatory response in ARDS. Hence, we speculate that the targeting complement system could be a potential treatment option for organ damage in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Qin; Chen, Zi",Med Microbiol Immunol,,290

The basis of the paper form hypotheses focused on the use of the concept of Balanced Scorecard, controlling, benchmarking, and talent management within the tourism enterprises. Based on the p-value (0.576) in the case of first hypothesis, we can confirm that there is no statistically significant relationship between the openness of hotels to change, innovation, and the willingness to introduce controlling into management. The p-value (0.004) achieved in the case of the second hypothesis confirmed a statistically significant relationship between the hotel classification category and the use of the modern methods in plan design. In the third hypothesis, we examined whether hotels focusing on the sales maximization tend to use their capital for modernization. Based on the validity of the inequality p-value (0.080), we confirm that there is no statistically significant relationship between the pricing approach and the use of capital. Searching strategic tool in management of a business in tourism is still an actual issue. Businesses are especially managed by financial indicators, but modern methods show the growing significance of non-financial indicators.","Gallo, Peter Dobrovič Ján Čabinová Veronika Pártlová Petra Straková Jarmila Mihalčová Bohuslava",Social Sciences,,290
374507,An Another Protocol to Make Sulfur Embedded Ultrathin Sections of Extraterrestrial Small Samples,2020,"In epidemiology, the effective reproduction number $R_e$ is used to characterize the growth rate of an epidemic outbreak. In this paper, we investigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and high-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations is characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to include the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without regard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target value for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value. This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease. The model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain point greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective reproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining cost-effective control strategies.","Thron, Christopher; Mbazumutima, Vianney; Tamayo, Luis Vargas; Todjihounde, Leonard",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10678v1.pdf,290

Reconsidering Ethnic Integration,2020,"BACKGROUND: Our study aimed to analyze differential microRNA expression between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and normal bone marrow, and to identify novel microRNAs relevant to MDS pathogenesis. METHODS: MiRNA microarray analysis was used to profile microRNA expression levels in MDS and normal bone marrow. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to verify differentially expressed microRNAs. RESULTS: MiRNA microarray analysis showed 96 significantly upregulated (eg, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-125b-5p) and 198 significantly downregulated (eg, miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, miR-550a-3p) microRNAs in MDS compared with normal bone marrow. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction confirmed the microarray analysis: expression of six microRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-151a-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-125b-5p, and miR-10a-5p) was significantly higher in MDS, while 3 microRNAs (miR-181a-2-3p, miR-124-3p, and miR-550a-3p) were significantly downregulated in MDS. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed microRNAs might participate in MDS pathogenesis by regulating hematopoiesis, leukocyte migration, leukocyte apoptotic process, and hematopoietic cell lineage. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that differentially expressed microRNAs might play a key role in MDS pathogenesis by regulating potential relevant functional and signaling pathways. Targeting these microRNAs may provide new treatment modalities for MDS.","Wan, Chengyao; Wen, Jing; Huang, Ying; Li, Hongying; Wu, Wenqi; Xie, Qiongni; Liang, Xiaolin; Tang, Zhongyuan; Zhao, Weihua; Cheng, Peng; Liu, Zhenfang",Medicine (Baltimore),,290

388786,The role of structure in dietary approaches for the treatment of pediatric overweight and obesity: A critical review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory disease; approximately 5% of patients developing severe COVID-19. It is known that cytokine release is associated with disease severity, but the relationship between the different clinical phenotypes and inflammatory endotypes is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the association between inflammatory biomarker-based endotypes and severe COVID-19 phenotypes. METHODS: Interleukin (IL) -6, C-reactive protein (CRP), C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL) 9, IL-18, C-C motif chemokine (CCL) 3, CCL17, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured in 57 COVID-19 patients, and their association with clinical characteristics was examined using a cluster analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher blood levels of the eight inflammatory markers were noted in patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) than in those who did not develop ARDS (non-ARDS). Using a cluster analysis, the patient groups were classified into four clusters, of which two had patients with high IL-6 and CRP levels. In the cluster with high levels of Type 1 (T1) inflammatory markers such as CXCL9 and IL-18, 85% of the patients had ARDS, 65% of the patients developed acute kidney injury (AKI), and 78% of the patients developed pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: In the cluster with high levels of T1 inflammatory markers, the patients frequently suffered from tissue damage, manifested as ARDS and AKI.

In this context, countries within Latin America have used their armed forces for an array of tasks to serve citizens. But how militarized is the response to COVID-19 in Latin America? This paper proposes a typology of tasks provided by the armed forces as a response to COVID-19. The descriptive findings allow us to map these tasks, attributing scores to the fourteen Latin American democracies. We also show evidence for the potential consequences of some tasks. Policing the streets to enforce stay-at-home orders may lead to the military committing human rights violations, assuming eminently civilian posts to manage the public health crisis can result in long term implications for the civil-military balance that are detrimental to the democratic control over the military.","Passos, Anaís Medeiros; Acácio, Igor",Rev. adm. pública (Online),,290

METHODS: We searched Google Trends for 118 search queries within the United States. We compared two timeframes of 2020 (March 15-July 4 and July 5-October 31) to similar timeframes over the four prior years (2016-2019). RESULTS: In the early pandemic, March 15-July 4, a statistically significant decrease in relative search volume of the majority of queries (60%) was detected, with a significant increase in only 2 queries (i.e. myalgia and toe swelling). In the phase July through October, a statistically significant decrease was detected in only 22% of search queries; there was no difference for 60% of search queries between 2020 and 2016-2019 suggesting a return to their prior levels for most of search queries. Interestingly, the search volume of 18% of search queries (i.e. fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, myalgia, spondylosis, radiculopathy, myelopathy, neck pain, neck strain, lower back strain, sciatica, shoulder pain, frozen shoulder, elbow pain, lateral epicondylitis, wrist pain, carpal tunnel, hand pain, finger pain, trigger finger, and Morton's neuroma) was significantly increased compared with the four prior years. CONCLUSION: Public interest focused on COVID-19 and sought online information for COVID-19 symptoms in the early pandemic. In the period July through October, there was an upward trend in musculoskeletal symptoms and some colloquial terms/well-known musculoskeletal conditions coupled with a downward trend in general musculoskeletal disorder terms and certain specific diagnoses. This information may help rheumatologists understand public interest in musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders and address the needs of patients to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on outcomes.","Kardes, Sinan; Erdem, Anil; Gürdal, Hatice",Z. rheumatol,,290

In this paper, we formulate a new methodology called Latent Assimilation that combines Data Assimilation and Machine Learning. We use a Convolutional neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, a Long-Short-Term-Memory to build a surrogate model of the dynamic system and an Optimal Interpolated Kalman Filter to incorporate real data. Experimental results are provided for CO2 concentration within an indoor space.

METHODS: The present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software. RESULTS: Ten patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe COVID-19.

395920,Guillain-Barré syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis,2020,"Histology, a pillar of anatomical sciences for both health professional and graduate students, requires sufficient time and practice to develop the necessary visual literacy and skills in synthesis to achieve competency. However, histology contact hours in medical and graduate education have reduced significantly in the past decades due to disseminated curricular changes emphasizing integration of basic sciences, clinical content and self-directed learning. In turn, adjunct online resources have been in steady incline and in the past year, in response to COVID-19, quickly became an essential component of anatomical sciences education following campus closures. Self-directed learning is challenging in normal circumstances as success is impacted by the level of student preparedness and engagement, which in turn can be dependent on the quality of the asynchronous learning resources. Although many online histology resources are available, few are comprehensive and provide step-by-step instruction in identification of structures in tissue slides. In this pilot project, the efficacy of using a commercial online histology (COH) course (DaVinci Academy, Cleveland, OH) as a primary preparatory resource in a graduate histology curriculum implementing a flipped-classroom pedagogy was assessed. During fall 2020 (F2020), first-year graduate students enrolled in a hybrid histology course were required to review learning objectives, read textbook sections, and complete the COH lessons, consisting of complete lectures, lab videos, and quizzes as a set of pre-work to prepare for on-campus and virtual classes. The synchronous class sessions had minimal didactic lectures, but instead had a series of small group active learning tasks. In a COMIRB exempt retrospective study (#20-2891), the assessment outcomes of the F2020 cohort (n=26) were compared to a fall 2019 (F2019) cohort of students (n=25) who completed the identical histology curriculum delivered in a flipped-class style by the same instructor, but without the commercial online histology course. All course quiz and exam scores were compared across the F2019 and F2020 cohorts using a Kruskal Wallis test for non-parametric data. There were no significant differences in assessment outcomes between F2019 and F2020 cohorts (p&gt;0.05). Survey of the F2020 cohort throughout the course revealed consistently high rating of the COH with 80% of students believing the resource improved their ability to read and interpret histology slides. Interestingly, students perceived the lecture and lab videos in the COH delivered by the same in-class instructor to be more valuable than those delivered by a third-party instructor, although the assessment performance was independent of the online instructor (p&gt;0.05). The results suggest that the online histology course can be an effective asynchronous learning resource for a histology course, allowing for more efficient use of synchronous class time to support a higher taxonomy of learning.","MacDonald, Alexis Cooper Maxwell Cooper Charlie Salcedo Ernesto Lee Lisa",The FASEB Journal,,290

METHODS: A retrospective single-center study of 301 COVID-19 patients referred to our Emergency Department (ED) from February 25 to March 29, 2020. At presentation, patients underwent chest CT and clinical and laboratory examinations. Outcomes included discharge from the ED after improvement/recovery (positive outcome), or admission to the intensive care unit or death (poor prognosis). A visual quantitative analysis was formed using two scores: the Pulmonary Involvement (PI) score based on the extension of lung involvement, and the Pulmonary Consolidation (PC) score based on lung consolidation. The prognostic value of CT alone or integrated with other parameters was studied by logistic regression and ROC analysis. RESULTS: The impact of the CT PI score [&#8805;15 vs. &#8804; 6] on predicting poor prognosis (OR 5.71 95 % CI 1.93-16.92, P = 0.002) was demonstrated; no significant association was found for the PC score. Chest CT had a prognostic role considering the PI score alone (AUC 0.722) and when evaluated with demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory data (AUC 0.841). We, therefore, developed a nomogram as an easy tool for immediate clinical application.

METHOD: In this work, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has been predicted based on the pattern of China using a machine learning approach. The model is built to predict the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases based on the data available between January 22, 2020, and April 3, 2020. The time series forecasting method is used for prediction models. RESULTS: The COVID-19 effects are predicted to be at peak between the third and fourth weeks of April 2020 in India. This outbreak is predicted to be controlled around the end of May 2020. The total number of predicted confirmed cases of COVID-19 might reach around 68 978, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 are predicted to be 1557 around April 25, 2020, in India. If this outbreak is not controlled by the end of May 2020, then India will face a severe shortage of hospitals, and it will make this outbreak even worse. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if the Government of India takes proactive steps to aggressively implement a lockdown in the country and extend it further. This presented epidemiological model is an effort to predict the future forecast of COVID-19 spread, based on the present scenario, so that the government can frame policy decisions, and necessary actions can be initiated.","Tiwari, Sunita; Kumar, Sushil; Guleria, Kalpna",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,290

402352,Scenarios for Global Aquaculture and Its Role in Human Nutrition,2020,"State and local governments imposed social distancing measures in March and April of 2020 to contain the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These included large event bans, school closures, closures of entertainment venues, gyms, bars, and restaurant dining areas, and shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs). We evaluated the impact of these measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases across US counties between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020. An event-study design allowed each policy's impact on COVID-19 case growth to evolve over time. Adoption of government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 percentage points after 1-5 days, 6.8 after 6-10 days, 8.2 after 11-15 days, and 9.1 after 16-20 days. Holding the amount of voluntary social distancing constant, these results imply 10 times greater spread by April 27 without SIPOs (10 million cases) and more than 35 times greater spread without any of the four measures (35 million). Our paper illustrates the potential danger of exponential spread in the absence of interventions, providing relevant information to strategies for restarting economic activity.

Jordan was among countries which enforced early lock-down for most non-vital services. Health care was mainly directed to cope with COVID-19 cases. The pandemic posed challenges for all patients, including dermatology patients especially those on systemic treatments. This resulted in interruption of medical care and exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases for many patients. Material and methods: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study of dermatology patients on systemic treatment prior to corona pandemic. After lockdown was lifted, patients taking systemic treatments were evaluated for continuity of care during lockdown period and how that affected their skin condition. Demographic data, details of skin condition, continuity of care and impact on skin condition data were collected and analyzed. Results: 154 patients (120 males, 34 females) were included. The majority (around 80%) of patients were unable to attend to dermatology clinics or do the needed lab monitoring. Around one fifth of patients had drug interruption mostly due to no access to hospital pharmacy. Most patients were using oral isotretinoin for acne, others include methotrexate and other immune suppressive agents. Patients with acne and oral isotretinoin treatment were more likely to continue their treatment during lockdown period. Amongst those who stopped treatment, around 42% had flare up of their disease. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact on various aspects of care for dermatology patients especially those on systemic therapy. This study demonstrated limited access to specialist care, inability to do lab tests and discontinuation of treatment during lockdown. Some patients (42%) had flare up of their skin condition as a result.","Alshiyab, Diala M; Al-Qarqaz, Firas A; Muhaidat, Jihan M",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,290

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with 2019 new-type coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) who were hospitalized in Hainan Provincial People's Hospital from January 15, 2020 to February 18, 2020. Compare the clinical characteristics of elderly with Young and Middle-aged patients. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were enrolled 18 elderly patients (32.14%), and 38 young and middle-aged patients (67.86%). The most common symptoms in both groups were fever, followed by cough and sputum. Four patients in the elderly group received negative pressure ICU for mechanical ventilation, and five patients in the young and middle-aged group. One patient died in the elderly group (5.56%), and two patients died in the young and middle-aged group (5.26%). The PSI score of the elderly group was higher than that of the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with PSI grades IV and V was significantly higher in the elderly group than in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.05). The proportion of multiple lobe involvement in the elderly group was higher than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and there was no difference in single lobe lesions between the two groups. The proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (P < 0.001), and the C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the young group (P < 0.001).

The remaining populations are struggling with increased rate of infection due to beta and delta variants. Although this uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic did not leave even the immunized group because of immune escaping capacity of those new variants. MethodsA total of 4718 nasopharygeal samples were collected from 1st March until 15th April, 2021, of which, 834 (18%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Randomly generated 135 positive cases were selected for telephone interview and 108 were available and provided consent. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity among both immunized and unimmunized group was measured. A total of 63 spike protein sequence and 14 whole genome sequences were performed from both groups and phylogenetic reconstruction and mutation analysis were compared. ResultsA total of 40 respondents (37%, N=108) received single-dose and 2 (2%) received both doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine which significantly reduce dry cough, loss of appetite and difficulties in breathing compared to none. There was no significant difference in hospitalization, duration of hospitalization or reduction of other symptoms like running nose, muscle pain, shortness of breathing or generalized weakness between immunized and unimmunized group.

408648,"Dear, Viroj Wiwanitkit",2020,"More than 190 vaccines are currently in development to prevent infection by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Animal studies suggest that while neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein may correlate with protection, additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection. Previously, we reported early immunogenicity and safety outcomes of a viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), in a single-blinded phase 1/2 randomized controlled trial of healthy adults aged 18-55 years ( NCT04324606 ). Now we describe safety and exploratory humoral and cellular immunogenicity of the vaccine, from subgroups of volunteers in that trial, who were subsequently allocated to receive a homologous full-dose (SD/SD D56; n = 20) or half-dose (SD/LD D56; n = 32) ChAdOx1 booster vaccine 56 d following prime vaccination. Previously reported immunogenicity data from the open-label 28-d interval prime-boost group (SD/SD D28; n = 10) are also presented to facilitate comparison. Additionally, we describe volunteers boosted with the comparator vaccine (MenACWY; n = 10). In this interim report, we demonstrate that a booster dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is safe and better tolerated than priming doses. Using a systems serology approach we also demonstrate that anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers, as well as Fc-mediated functional antibody responses, including antibody-dependent neutrophil/monocyte phagocytosis, complement activation and natural killer cell activation, are substantially enhanced by a booster dose of vaccine. A booster dose of vaccine induced stronger antibody responses than a dose-sparing half-dose boost, although the magnitude of T cell responses did not increase with either boost dose. These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials.","Barrett, Jordan R; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Dold, Christina; Ewer, Katie J; Folegatti, Pedro M; Gilbride, Ciaran; Halkerston, Rachel; Hill, Jennifer; Jenkin, Daniel; Stockdale, Lisa; Verheul, Marije K; Aley, Parvinder K; Angus, Brian; Bellamy, Duncan; Berrie, Eleanor; Bibi, Sagida; Bittaye, Mustapha; Carroll, Miles W; Cavell, Breeze; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth A; Edwards, Nick; Flaxman, Amy; Fuskova, Michelle; Gorringe, Andrew; Hallis, Bassam; Kerridge, Simon; Lawrie, Alison M; Linder, Aline; Liu, Xinxue; Madhavan, Meera; Makinson, Rebecca; Mellors, Jack; Minassian, Angela; Moore, Maria; Mujadidi, Yama; Plested, Emma; Poulton, Ian; Ramasamy, Maheshi N; Robinson, Hannah; Rollier, Christine S; Song, Rinn; Snape, Matthew D; Tarrant, Richard; Taylor, Stephen; Thomas, Kelly M; Voysey, Merryn; Watson, Marion E E; Wright, Daniel; Douglas, Alexander D; Green, Catherine M",Nat. med,,290

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 30 treatment-naïve patients with confirmed COVID-19 after informed consent at Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The patients were randomized 1ï¼1 to HCQ group and the control group. Patients in HCQ group were given HCQ 400 mg per day for 5 days plus conventional treatments, while those in the control group were given conventional treatment only. The primary endpoint was negative conversion rate of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on days 7 after randomization. This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and registered online (NCT04261517). RESULTS: One patient in HCQ group developed to severe during the treatment. On day 7, nucleic acid of throat swabs was negative in 13 (86.7%) cases in the HCQ group and 14 (93.3%) cases in the control group (P>0.05). The median duration from hospitalization to virus nucleic acid negative conservation was 4 (1,9) days in HCQ group, which is comparable to that in the control group [2 (1,4) days, Z=1.27, P>0.05]. The median time for body temperature normalization in HCQ group was 1 (0,2) day after hospitalization, which was also comparable to that in the control group [1 (0,3) day]. Radiological progression was shown on CT images in 5 cases (33.3%) of the HCQ group and 7 cases (46.7%) of the control group, and all patients showed improvement in follow-up examinations. Four cases (26.7%) of the HCQ group and 3 cases (20%) of the control group had transient diarrhea and abnormal liver function (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis of COVID-19 moderate patients is good. Larger sample size study are needed to investigate the effects of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19.

412309,NewsCAP: Roughly 40% of U.S. coronavirus deaths could have been prevented,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While chest x-rays (CXRs) represent a cost-effective imaging modality for developing countries like Pakistan, their utility for the prognostication of COVID-19 has been minimally explored. Thus, we describe the frequency and distribution of CXR findings, and their association with clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: All adult (&#8805; 18 years) patients presenting between 28th February-31st May to the emergency department of a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan, who were COVID-19 positive on RT-PCR with CXR done on presentation, were included. A CXR Severity Score (CXR-SS) of 0-8 was used to quantify the extent of pulmonary infection on CXR, with a score of 0 being negative and 1-8 being positive. The patients' initial CXR-SS and their highest CXR-SS over the hospital course were used for analysis, with cut-offs of 0-4 and 5-8 being used to assess association with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients, with 76.7% males and mean age 56.1 years, were included in this study. Initial CXR was positive in 80% of patients, and 30.7% of patients had an initial CXR-SS between 5-8. The mortality rate was 16.7% and 30.6% patients underwent ICU admission with intubation (ICU-Int). On multivariable analysis, initial CXR-SS (1.355 [1.136-1.616]) and highest CXR-SS (1.390 [1.143-1.690]) were predictors of ICU-Int, and ICU-Int was independently associated with both initial CXR-SS 5-8 (2.532 [1.109-5.782]) and highest CXR-SS 5-8 (3.386 [1.405-8.159]). Lastly, age (1.060 [1.009-1.113]), initial CXR-SS (1.278 [1.010-1.617]) and ICU-Int (5.047 [1.731-14.710]), were found to be independent predictors of mortality in our patients. CONCLUSION: In a resource-constrained country like Pakistan, CXRs may have valuable prognostic utility in predicting ICU admission and mortality. Additional research with larger patient samples is needed to further explore the association of CXR findings with clinical outcomes.","Kaleemi, Raima; Hilal, Kiran; Arshad, Ainan; Martins, Russell Seth; Nankani, Avinash; Tu, Haq; Basharat, Sundas; Ansar, Zeeshan",PLoS One,,290

413902,Upcoming Events,2021,"We study the collective decay of two-level emitters coupled to a nonlinear waveguide, for example, a nanophotonic lattice or a superconducting resonator array with strong photon-photon interactions. Under these conditions a new decay channel into bound photon pairs emerges, through which spatial correlations between emitters are established by regular interference as well as interactions between the photons. We derive an effective Markovian theory to model the resulting decay dynamics of an arbitrary distribution of emitters and identify collective effects beyond the usual phenomena of super- and subradiance. Specifically, in the limit of many close-by emitters, we find that the system undergoes a super-correlated decay process where either all the emitters are in the excited state or in the ground state, but not in any of the intermediate states. The predicted effects can be probed in state-of-the-art waveguide QED experiments and provide a striking example of how the dynamics of open quantum systems can be modified by many-body effects in a non-harmonic environment.","Wang, Zhihai; Jaako, Tuomas; Kirton, Peter; Rabl, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04315v1.pdf,290

ACE-2 is present in many cell types including endothelial cells, where it functions to protect against oxidative damage. Reports suggest that COVID-19 patients also showed symptoms related to endothelial damage. We hypothesized that these vascular symptoms might be associated with disrupted endothelial barrier integrity. We investigated this in vitro using endothelial cell culture and recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 Receptor-Binding Domain (S1RBD). Materials and Methods Mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells from normal (C57BL/6 mice) and diabetic (db/db) mice were used. The expression of VE-Cadherin, PECAM-1, JAM-A and Connexin 43, was probed by Western blot in normal and diabetic cells, before and after treatment with S1RBD. Results The expression of VE-Cadherin, an endothelial adherens junction protein, was not affected by diabetes or by S1RBD treatment. PECAM-1 expression showed a small but significant (~15%) decrease after S1RD treatment in control cells. Junctional Adhesion Molecule (JAM-A), a tight junction protein, and the gap junction protein, Connexin-43, decreased by ~50 and 80% respectively in the presence of S1RBD when compared to untreated controls. Expression of PECAM-1, JAM-A and connexin-43 were significantly lower in untreated diabetic endothelial cells, compared to untreated control cells. This expression level further decreased significantly in the presence of S1RBD, with maximal effects observed with JAM-A and Connexin-43 expression (~80 and 90% decrease, respectively). These results indicate that healthy and diabetic endothelial cells respond differently when challenged with SARS-CoV-2 S1RBD. Conclusion S1RBD-induces degradation of endothelial junctional proteins that likely affects endothelial barrier function and causes vascular damage.","Raghavan, Somasundaram Kenchappa Divya Leo M.",The FASEB Journal,,290

420981,Vaccine- and natural infection-induced mechanisms that could modulate vaccine safety,2020,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: A significant number of reported COVID-19 cases can be traced back to superspreader events (SSEs), where a disproportionally large number of secondary cases relative to the standard reproductive rate, R0, are initiated. Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs. METHODS: We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.","Majra, Dasha; Benson, Jayme; Pitts, Jennifer; Stebbing, Justin",J. infect,,290

421493,EFORT Open Reviews: Turbulence,2020,"There has been a dramatic increase in remote psychotherapy since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis. There is also expected to be an increase in mental health problems in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in severe health anxiety (SHA) is particularly anticipated, for which cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is a frontline treatment. However, it is unclear what interaction types are associated with outcome-improvement in remote-CBT (rCBT) for SHA. This study aimed to identify interaction types that predict outcomes and sudden gains in rCBT for SHA using initial therapy session content. Forty-eight participants in rCBT for SHA had interactions at their first sessions categorized and rated in terms of patient activation: an individual's confidence and ability to manage their health. Multilevel modelling assessed whether early interaction types predicted session-by-session wellbeing. For participants experiencing sudden gains (n = 12) interactions at the session directly prior to the gain were similarly categorized and rated. The scores were then compared with ratings for the preceding session. A smaller proportion of early sessions was taken up with problem descriptions among those with greater outcome improvements. There was also a significant reduction in the proportion of the session spent describing problems in the session directly prior to a sudden gain, as compared with the previous session. Conversely, clients with better outcomes made more positive evaluations of themselves and therapy, noticed more positive changes and made more contributions to structuring interactions at initial sessions. Specific early interaction types predict session-by-session outcomes and precede sudden gains in rCBT for SHA.","Malins, Sam; Moghaddam, Nima; Morriss, Richard; Schröder, Thomas; Brown, Paula; Boycott, Naomi",,,290

422508,In the Midst of Two Realities,2021,"A population can be immune to epidemics even if not all of its individual members are immune to the disease, so long as sufficiently many are immune-this is the traditional notion of herd immunity. In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemicseven if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease-a notion we call 'digital herd immunity', which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel 'contact-tracing phase transition' to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission.","Bulchandani, Vir B; Shivam, Saumya; Moudgalya, Sanjay; Sondhi, S L",Phys. biol,,290

With implementation of telehealth, a cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacist was able to incorporate a virtual medication tour during appointments. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to describe the uptake and impact of pharmacist-led virtual medication tours during telehealth visits in the CF clinic setting. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a CF pharmacist participated in in-person multidisciplinary team visits to complete medication history reconciliation, assess adherence, assess efficacy and address possible adverse effects of medications, and work collaboratively with the CF care team and patient to create therapeutic plans. The virtual medication tour described in this study was completed in addition or as a complement to these pre-existing pharmacist roles and responsibilities. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Patients seen via telehealth visit were asked to provide a virtual tour of their medications. A pharmacist completed medication history and evaluated whether storage conditions were appropriate in regard to temperature, humidity, light exposure, and accessibility to children. EVALUATION METHODS: A pharmacist recorded findings from the virtual medication tours and made interventions when appropriate. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Of 20 patients seen via telehealth for a quarterly visit during the first 3 months after implementation, 13 were willing to participate in a virtual medication tour. Before the visit, 25% had information missing from their medication list. Virtual medication tour allowed for resolution of this information 80% of the time. Three of the 4 participating patients with a child under 12 years old had medications stored in a location accessible to children. CONCLUSION: A virtual medication tour led by a pharmacist can be successfully incorporated into telehealth visits and was accepted by a majority of patients. Most patients stored medications appropriately but might benefit from education on poison prevention practices.","Warda, Nicole; Rotolo, Shannon M",,,290

Using search terms salient to NSSI and SA, we screened 555 studies to identify 17 that presented temporal data about NSSI and SA. Much of the evidence indicates that NSSI predates SA, especially among females and individuals with depressive symptoms, or diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or mood disorders. However, in some studies, associated risk factors likely accounted for the effect. Greater NSSI frequency to a threshold increases risk for later SA. Findings suggest that the behaviors have common predisposing factors, but that there is also a potent gateway effect whereby NSSI precedes SA.","Griep, Stephanie K; MacKinnon, Dean F",Arch Suicide Res,,290

To understand the acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation and HIVST, we conducted a web-based study during social distancing period (April-May, 2020) among men who have sex with men and transgender/non-binary individuals using social media. Out of the 2375 HIV negative respondents, 680 reported PrEP use and were included in this analysis. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 28-40), 98% cisgender men, 56% white, 74% high education, and 72% middle/high income. Willingness to use HIVST was 79% and 32% received an HIVST during social distancing period. The majority reported preference for PrEP/HIVST home delivery instead of collecting at the service. PrEP teleconsultation was experienced by 21% and most reported feeling satisfied with the procedures. High acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation was reported by 70%. In ordinal logistic model, having higher education was associated with high aceptability of PrEP teleconsultation (aOR:1.62; 95%CI: 1.07-2.45). Our results point out that PrEP teleconsultation and HIVST/PrEP home delivery could be implemented by PrEP services in Brazil to avoid PrEP shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter as an option to increase retention and adherence.","Hoagland, Brenda; Torres, Thiago S; Bezerra, Daniel R B; Benedetti, Marcos; Pimenta, Cristina; Veloso, Valdilea G; Grinsztejn, Beatriz",Braz. j. infect. dis,,290

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients who were admitted to our hospital with the suspicion of COVID-19 between 1 April 2020 and 30 April 2020 and tested negative after RT-PCR test, and underwent CT for further diagnosis. Initial CT findings were classified as typical, indeterminate, and atypical for COVID-19, and negative for pneumonia. Incidental findings on CT were noted. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients with a mean age of 57 years (min 18 years-max 96 years), 168 (49.70%) were male and 170 (50.29%) were female. The most common symptoms were cough (58.87%), fever (40.82%), and dyspnea (39.34%). The CT findings were typical for COVID-19 in 109 (32.24%) patients, indeterminate in 47 (13.90%) patients, and atypical in 77 (22.78%) patients. The CT findings of 105 (31.06%) patients were negative for pneumonia. Incidental lung nodules suspicious of malignancy were identified in seven patients. Seventy-seven patients (22.78%) had extrapulmonary incidental findings CONCLUSION: The diagnostic value of CT in RT-PCR-negative patients with suspected COVID-19 is not very high.

431060,"DISCOVER: much accomplished, but not yet for all",2020,"Numerical simulations have become an essential design tool in the field of photonics, especially for nanophotonics. In particular, 3D finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations are popular for their powerful design capabilities. Increasingly, researchers are developing or using inverse design tools to improve device footprints and performance. These tools often make use of 3D FDTD simulations and the adjoint optimization method. We implement a commercial inverse design tool with these features for a simple plasmonic logic circuit design that has complex requirements. Without modifying underlying code, we find ways to use this tool to implement a design that incorporates phase encoded inputs in a dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton waveguide. The complexity of the requirements in conjunction with limitations in the inverse design tool force us to make concessions regarding the density of encoding and to use on-off keying to encode the outputs. We compare the performance of the inverse-designed device to a conventionally-designed device with the same operational behavior. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the inverse design tools for realizing complex device designs and comment on what is possible at present and where improvements can be made.","Narayan, Krishna; Harrison, Mark C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01738v1.pdf,290

One of the most popular solutions that have emerged is the use of video conferencing applications to replace face-to-face meetings with virtual meetings. This resulted in unprecedented growth in the number of video conferencing users. In this study, we explored privacy issues that may be at risk by attending virtual meetings. We extracted private information from collage images of meeting participants that are publicly posted on the Web. We used image processing, text recognition tools, as well as social network analysis to explore our web crawling curated dataset of over 15,700 collage images, and over 142,000 face images of meeting participants. We demonstrate that video conference users are facing prevalent security and privacy threats. Our results indicate that it is relatively easy to collect thousands of publicly available images of video conference meetings and extract personal information about the participants, including their face images, age, gender, usernames, and sometimes even full names. This type of extracted data can vastly and easily jeopardize people's security and privacy both in the online and real-world, affecting not only adults but also more vulnerable segments of society, such as young children and older adults. Finally, we show that cross-referencing facial image data with social network data may put participants at additional privacy risks they may not be aware of and that it is possible to identify users that appear in several video conference meetings, thus providing a potential to maliciously aggregate different sources of information about a target individual.","Kagan, Dima; Alpert, Galit Fuhrmann; Fire, Michael",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.01059v1.pdf,290

METHODS: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset of dental caries was obtained from the UK Biobank. A TWAS of dental caries was conducted with the FUSION tool using the gene expression reference weights of musculoskeletal, whole blood, and peripheral blood genes. The dental caries-associated genes identified by the TWAS were further subjected to gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses to explore dental caries-related gene sets. Finally, the TWAS results of dental caries were compared with genome-wide mRNA expression profiling of dental caries to detect common genes and gene sets. RESULTS: The TWAS identified 165 musculoskeletal genes, 110 whole blood genes, and 228 peripheral blood genes. GO analysis of the genes identified by the TWAS detected 57 GO terms. For pathway enrichment analysis, we detected 12 candidate pathways. After comparing the TWAS-identified genes with the mRNA expression profiling data, we detected 6 common genes. Further comparing the GO results of the TWAS and mRNA expression profiling identified 5 common GO terms. CONCLUSION: We identified a group of dental caries-associated genes and GO terms, providing novel clues for understanding the genetic mechanisms of dental caries.","Tong, Xiangyao; Hou, Siyu; Ma, Mei; Zhang, Lu; Zou, Rui; Hou, Tiezhou; Niu, Lin",Arch Oral Biol,,290

Due to a lack of epidemiological data and clinical experience, it was feared that children with respiratory diseases were a risk group for particularly severe courses of COVID-19, as has been reported for adults. Objective: The currently available (epidemiological) data on this patient group are presented as well as a description of our own experiences based on three selected cases. Material and methods: A review of the literature was carried out and three selected case reports and a discussion of current recommendations are presented. Results: The incidence of COVID-19 is significantly lower in children than in adults. Furthermore, the known risk factors in adults cannot be simply transferred to pediatric patients. In the majority of cases, children and adolescents with chronic lung diseases show a milder course of SARS-CoV­2 infections. Conclusion: Although the hitherto available data show that children and adolescents have a lower risk for COVID-19 courses than adults, it should not be ignored that fatal outcomes have also been reported in pediatric patients. Moreover, late effects, such as the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS) can sometimes lead to a fatal outcome.

442631,Restraining respiratory droplets,2020,"At the end of 2020, policy responses to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have been shaken by the emergence of virus variants, impacting public health and policy measures worldwide. The emergence of these strains suspected to be more contagious, more severe, or even resistant to antibodies and vaccines, seem to have taken by surprise health services and policymakers, struggling to adapt to the new variants constraints. Anticipating the emergence of these mutations to plan ahead adequate policies, and understanding how human behaviors may affect the evolution of viruses by coevolution, are key challenges. In this article, we propose coevolution with genetic algorithms (GAs) as a credible approach to model this relationship, highlighting its implications, potential and challenges. Because of their qualities of exploration of large spaces of possible solutions, capacity to generate novelty, and natural genetic focus, GAs are relevant for this issue. We present a dual GA model in which both viruses aiming for survival and policy measures aiming at minimising infection rates in the population, competitively evolve. This artificial coevolution system may offer us a laboratory to""debug""our current policy measures, identify the weaknesses of our current strategies, and anticipate the evolution of the virus to plan ahead relevant policies. It also constitutes a decisive opportunity to develop new genetic algorithms capable of simulating much more complex objects. We highlight some structural innovations for GAs for that virus evolution context that may carry promising developments in evolutionary computation, artificial life and AI.","Vie, Aymeric",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12365v1.pdf,290
442939,The Sample Complexity of Best-$k$ Items Selection from Pairwise Comparisons,2020-07-06,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has induced negative emotions among people. These emotions are expressed by the public on social media and are rapidly spread across the internet, which could cause high levels of panic among the public. Understanding the changes in public sentiment on social media during the pandemic can provide valuable information for developing appropriate policies to reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on the public. Previous studies have consistently shown that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a devastating negative impact on public sentiment. However, it remains unclear whether there has been a variation in the public sentiment during the recovery phase of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aim to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China by continuously tracking public sentiment on social media throughout 2020. METHODS: We collected 64,723,242 posts from Sina Weibo, China's largest social media platform, and conducted a sentiment analysis based on natural language processing to analyze the emotions reflected in these posts. RESULTS: We found that the COVID-19 pandemic not only affected public sentiment on social media during the initial outbreak but also induced long-term negative effects even in the recovery period. These long-term negative effects were no longer correlated with the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases both locally and nationwide during the recovery period, and they were not attributed to the postpandemic economic recession. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic induced long-term negative effects on public sentiment in mainland China even as the country recovered from the pandemic. Our study findings remind public health and government administrators of the need to pay attention to public mental health even once the pandemic has concluded.","Tan, Hao; Peng, Sheng-Lan; Zhu, Chun-Peng; You, Zuo; Miao, Ming-Cheng; Kuai, Shu-Guang",J Med Internet Res,,290

446863,Efficient numerical computation of the basic reproduction number for structured populations,2020-04-27,"While there are various kinds of drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus at present, in this review article, we focus on metformin which is an insulin sensitizer and is often used as a first-choice drug worldwide. Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic ß-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19). Taken together, metformin is an old drug, but multifaceted mechanisms of action of metformin have been unraveled one after another in its long history.","Kaneto, Hideaki; Kimura, Tomohiko; Obata, Atsushi; Shimoda, Masashi; Kaku, Kohei",Int. j. mol. sci.

In spring of 2020, elective surgery including most joint replacement was suspended and much of the public asked to stay at home. As elective surgery resumes, it is unknown how the public will respond. Questions/Purposes: We sought to describe public interest in knee replacement during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Google Trends was used to obtain the daily number of searches for ""knee replacement,"" ""coronavirus,"" and ""knee pain"" from December 19, 2019, to May 14, 2020. The number is on a term-specific scale weighted to the highest number of daily searches for that term. Seven-day weighted averages were used to smooth the data. Results: The number of daily searches for ""knee replacement"" was stable until around March 8, 2020, after which it decreased through late March, plateauing at less than half the number of searches. At the same time, searches for ""coronavirus"" spiked. By early May, searches for ""knee replacement"" had not meaningfully increased, though at the end of the search period the slope turned positive and coronavirus searches decreased. Searches for ""knee pain"" initially followed a similar pattern to ""knee replacement,"" though the decline was not as steep, and by late April searches for ""knee pain"" had meaningfully increased. Conclusion: Public interest in knee replacement, assessed through internet search queries, decreased during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While interest in pain has returned, the continued decreased level of interest in surgery may represent a fear of surgery among the general public in the setting of COVID-19. Surgeons may wish to focus outreach and education efforts on the safety and efficacy of knee replacement.","Landy, David C; Chalmers, Brian P; Utset-Ward, Thomas J; Ast, Michael P",HSS J,,290

However, a lack of computer literacy and knowledge of software choices, and concerns regarding patient safety and potential infringement of regulations can make venturing into this new technology intimidating. In this article, various types of teledentistry systems for orthodontic practices, implementation guidelines, and important regulatory considerations on the use of teledentistry for orthodontic purposes are discussed. A thorough evaluation of the intended use of the software should precede commitment to a service. Selected service should be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant at minimum and a Business Associate Agreement should be in place for protection of privacy. Ensuring the compatibility of the designated clinic computer with the system's requirements and installation of all safeguards must follow. Appointments should be documented in the same manner as in-office visits and teledentistry patients must be located within the clinician's statutory license boundary. Informed consent forms should include teledentistry or a supplemental teledentistry consent form should be used.

448250,COVID-19 transmission in group living environments and households,2021,"Introduction Lemierre's syndrome (LS) refers to infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) developed as a complication of an oropharyngeal infection. It is a serious condition which may lead to septicemia and septic embolization. LS is most frequently caused by the anaerobic Fusobacterium necrophorum. In the current post-antibiotic era, it is rare (annual incidence of 0.8 cases/million). Many clinicians are unaware of LS, leading it to be termed ""the forgotten disease."" Signs and symptoms include odynophagia, fever and easy fatigue simulating, among others, infection by COVID-19. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should be started promptly. If a deep abscess is present, drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent sepsis or embolization, surgical ligation/excision of the IJV may be considered. Currently, the most controversial role in LS management is anticoagulation. Compared with pre-antibiotic era mortality has much improved (0-18%). Since 2004 there are only four cases of LS reported in Portugal (Medline). Objectives To report a case of late diagnosis and highlight the pitfalls due to initial suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods Case report. A 37-year-old female presented to our institution with left-sided neck pain, odynophagia and fever. A diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and the patient was discharged. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal-swab-test was negative. One week later, due to persistent fever, dyspnea, thoracalgia and easy fatigue the patient returned. Blood samples showed increased white-cell-count (17.150/µL) and C-reactive-protein (378 mg/L). On CT, areas of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient was transferred to COVID-19 area and started ceftriaxone, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. On day 4, considering 3 negative tests hydroxychloroquine was abandoned. Diagnosis of an atypical pneumonia was made and antibiotherapy was changed to doxycycline and ceftazidime. Due to moderate size pleural effusion a thoracentesis was performed. On day 7, as cervical pain and tumefaction were persisting, a contrast-enhanced cervical CT was ordered, showing peritonsillar thickening and thrombosis of the left IJV with emphysema (Figure 1). Antibiotherapy was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and anticoagulation was started. Results After 2 weeks, inflammatory markers were normal and a reduction in pulmonary opacities was observed. All microbiological cultures were negative. The patient completed the last 3 weeks of antibiotherapy under ambulatory hospitalization. Screening for thrombophilia was negative. Anticoagulation was kept for 3 months. Conclusions In a patient with former oropharyngeal infection presenting with pneumonia, LS should be suspected. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should include anaerobic coverage. Anticoagulation may hasten local infection control and prevent septic embolization, optimizing pneumonia resolution.","Bernardes, Francisco; Soares, Diogo; Ribeiro, Ana; Ferreira, Vítor; Vasconcelos, João; Maia, Miguel; Vidoedo, José; Pinto, João Almeida",Rev Port Cir Cardiotorac Vasc,,290

This study was designed to contribute to the existing knowledge on how risk communication (RC) and risk perception (RP) affect protective and preventive behaviors (PPB) during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: The required data were extracted from a national online survey of Iranian adults aged 15 and older during March 15-19, 2020 (n=3213). Data analysis was performed using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The study findings reveal that RC has direct and indirect positive effects on PB. Furthermore, this study also provides new evidence indicating that RP mediates the relationship between RC and PB and there is a two-way relationship between RC and RP. These interactions may have impact on risk communication strategies which should be adopted during this pandemic. CONCLUSION: The study findings have remarkable implications for informing future communications as well as interventions during this ongoing outbreak and subsequent national risk events.","Heydari, Seyed Taghi; Zarei, Leila; Sadati, Ahmad Kalateh; Moradi, Najmeh; Akbari, Maryam; Mehralian, Gholamhossin; Lankarani, Kamran Bagheri",BMC Public Health,,290

A virtual ward model delivers clinical care remotely to patients in isolation. We report on an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the safety and efficacy of a virtual ward model of care for an Australian cohort of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective clinical assessment was performed for 223 patients with confirmed COVID-19 treated in a virtual ward in Brisbane, Australia, from March 25 to May 15, 2020. Statistical analysis was performed for variables associated with the length of stay and hospitalization. RESULTS: Of 223 patients, 205 (92%) recovered without the need for escalation to hospital care. The median length of stay in the virtual ward was 8 days (range 1-44 days). In total, 18 (8%) patients were referred to hospital, of which 6 (33.3%) were discharged after assessment at the emergency department. Furthermore, 12 (5.4%) patients were admitted to hospital, of which 4 (33.3%) required supplemental oxygen and 2 (16.7%) required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were recorded. Factors associated with escalation to hospital care were the following: hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% CI 1.28-9.87; P=.01), sputum production (OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.74-15.49; P=.001), and arthralgia (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.21-11.71; P=.02) at illness onset and a polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold of &#8804;20 on a diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.25-19.63; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a virtual ward model of care to treat patients with COVID-19 is safe and efficacious, and only a small number of patients would potentially require escalation to hospital care. Further studies are required to validate this model of care.","Ferry, Olivia R; Moloney, Emma C; Spratt, Owen T; Whiting, Gerald F M; Bennett, Cameron J",J Med Internet Res,,290

Methods: 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Results: Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Conclusion: Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.","Liu, Xuebing; Lin, Hong; Jiang, Haifeng; Li, Ruihua; Zhong, Na; Su, Hang; Li, Yi; Zhao, Min",General Psychiatry,,290

458256,Economic implications of coronavirus,2020,"Introduction: To face the CoViD-19 pandemic, the Italian government has approved regulations which state, with no exceptions, that it is considered offence for people tested positive to the virus to leave their house, whereas other people are allowed to leave their house for proven needs such as work, health or emergencies. Methods: The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. Objectives: Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. Results and discussion: Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. Conclusions: As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary;b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case. In order to distinguish suitable subjects from those not suitable for home isolation, the reference criterion cannot be the only diagnostic element, but it will be necessary to take into account above all the severity of the condition. In the absence of such a qualitative assessment, there would be a risk of unfounded infringements of the obligation to stay at home. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Italian) Introduzione: Per fronteggiare la pandemia da CoViD-19, il governo italiano ha approvato normative per cui e sempre reato, senza eccezioni, per le persone positive al virus allontanarsi dalla propria abitazione, mentre per tutte le altre persone e possibile uscire solo per comprovati motivi di lavoro, di salute o altre urgenze. Metodi: Gli autori contestualizzano queste norme con il quadro di principi europei e internazionali alla luce delle particolarita che alcune patologie psichiatriche possono presentare. Obiettivi: Valutare se tali principi europei rendano necessarie per alcuni malati di mente ulteriori e specifiche deroghe all'obbligo di permanenza domiciliare. Risultati e discussione: Il divieto di uscire puo aggravare la malattia mentale, comportando il rischio concreto di atti lesivi, in particolare nei casi di pazienti psicotici, bipolari in fase di anche modesto eccitamento, depressi o nei casi di condizioni deliranti conseguenti all'ininterrotta coabitazione con figure emotivamente significative. Anche la salute di soggetti con patologie ansiose o con diverse forme di ritardo mentale puo essere pregiudicata dalla forzata permanenza domiciliare. Da numerose norme della Convenzione europea dei diritti dell'uomo e della Carta dei diritti dell'Unione Europea emerge che la salute collettiva deve essere bilanciata con la salute individuale e la dignita della persona. Conclusioni: Poiche le disposizioni europee e internazionali sono gerarchicamente superiori rispetto a quelle nazionali, queste ultime dovrebbero essere interpretate nel senso che la violazione dell'obbligo di permanenza domiciliare: a) non costituisca reato per la persona positiva al virus, se sono necessari trattamenti terapeutici in regime di degenza;b) non costituisca neppure illecito amministrativo se il soggetto dimostra, sulla base di circostanze cliniche e fattuali documentate, che quell'uscita e necessaria per evitare la recrudescenza di una malattia psichica. Inoltre, ai fini valutativi, sara necessario tenere in particolare considerazione la gravita della malattia psichiatrica nel caso concreto. Per distinguere i soggetti idonei da quelli non idonei all'isolamento domiciliare il criterio di riferimento non puo essere il solo elemento diagnostico, ma bisognera tener conto soprattutto della gravita della condizione. In assenza di una tale valutazione qualitativa si configurerebbe il rischio di violazioni non motivate dell'obbligo di isolamento domiciliare.

458452,Epilepsy control during an epidemic: Emerging approaches and a new management framework,2020,"BACKGROUND: Stark gaps exist between projected health needs in a pandemic situation and the current capacity of health care and medical countermeasure systems. Existing pandemic ethics discussions have advocated to engage the public in scarcity dilemmas and attend the local contexts and cultural perspectives that shape responses to a global health threat. This public engagement study thus considers the role of community and culture in the ethical apportionment of scarce health resources, specifically ventilators, during an influenza pandemic. It builds upon a previous exploration of the values and preferences of Maryland residents regarding how a finite supply of mechanical ventilators ought to be allocated during a severe global outbreak of influenza. An important finding of this earlier research was that local history and place within the state engendered different ways of thinking about scarcity. OBJECTIVE: Given the intrastate variation in the themes expressed by Maryland participants, the project team sought to examine interstate differences by implementing the same protocol elsewhere to answer the following questions. Does variation in ethical frames of reference exist within different regions of the United States? What practical implications does evidence of sameness and difference possess for pandemic planners and policymakers at local and national levels? METHODS: Research using the same deliberative democracy process from the Maryland study was conducted in Central Texas in March 2018 among 30 diverse participants, half of whom identified as Hispanic or Latino. Deliberative democracy provides a moderated process through which community members can learn facts about a public policy matter from experts and explore their own and others' views. RESULTS: Participants proposed that by evenly distributing supplies of ventilators and applying clear eligibility criteria consistently, health authorities could enable fair allocation of scarce lifesaving equipment. The strong identification, attachment, and obligation of persons toward their nuclear and extended families emerged as a distinctive regional and ethnic core value that has practical implications for the substance, administration, and communication of allocation frameworks. CONCLUSIONS: Maryland and Central Texas residents expressed a common, overriding concern about the fairness of allocation decisions. Central Texas deliberants, however, more readily expounded upon family as a central consideration. In Central Texas, family is a principal, culturally inflected lens through which life and death matters are often viewed. Conveners of other pandemic-related public engagement exercises in the United States have advocated the benefits of transparency and inclusivity in developing an ethical allocation framework; this study demonstrates cultural competence as a further advantage.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Gwon, Howard; Regenberg, Alan; Toner, Eric S; Daugherty-Biddison, Elizabeth L",J Particip Med,,290

POC have been differentially affected by COVID-19, reflecting the disproportionate burden of ongoing chronic health challenges associated with socioeconomic inequalities and unhealthy behaviors, including a lack of physical activity. Clear and well-established benefits link daily physical activity to health and well-being-physical, mental, and existential. Despite these benefits, POC face additional barriers to participation. Thus, increasing physical activity among POC requires additional considerations so that POC can receive the same opportunities to safely participate in physical activity as Americans who are White. Framed within the Ecologic Model of Physical Activity, this commentary briefly describes health disparities in COVID-19, physical activity, and chronic disease experienced by POC; outlines underlying putative mechanisms that connect these disparities; and offers potential solutions to reduce these disparities.

Since it was first recognized in December 2019, it has resulted in the ongoing worldwide pandemic. Although acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the main features of the disease, the involvement of other organs needs to be explored. There has been a growing concern regarding the association between acute kidney injury (AKI) and poor outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Based on current observational data, AKI is the 2nd most common cause of morbidity and mortality behind ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor has been shown to be the cornerstone of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly plays a significant role in the occurrence of renal injury. The pathogenesis of AKI is likely multifactorial that involves not only direct viral invasion but also dysregulated immune response in the form of cytokine storm, ischemia to kidneys, hypercoagulable state, and rhabdomyolysis, among others. We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence. Any cited references were reviewed to identify relevant literature. The purpose of this review is to discuss, explore, and summarize the relationship between AKI in SARS-CoV-2 patients, with a focus on its epidemiology, association with ACE2 receptors, and pathophysiology of AKI.","Chong, Woon H; Saha, Biplab K",Am. j. med. sci,,290

462076,The Great Exhale: Using Breath Analysis to Detect Disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory syndrome with high rates of mortality, and there is a need for easily obtainable markers to provide prognostic information. We sought to determine whether the electrocardiogram (ECG) on hospital presentation provides prognostic information, specifically related to death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with COVID-19 who had an ECG at or near hospital admission. Clinical characteristics and ECG variables were manually abstracted from the electronic health record and first ECG. Our primary outcome was death. THERE WERE: 756 patients who presented to a large New York City teaching hospital with COVID-19 who underwent an ECG. The mean age was 63.3 ± 16 years, 37% were women, 61% of patients were nonwhite, and 57% had hypertension; 90 (11.9%) died. In a multivariable logistic regression that included age, ECG, and clinical characteristics, the presence of one or more atrial premature contractions (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.36, Pâ¯=â¯.01), a right bundle branch block or intraventricular block (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.32-5.18, Pâ¯=â¯.002), ischemic T-wave inversion (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.56-7.80, Pâ¯=â¯.002), and nonspecific repolarization (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27-4.21, Pâ¯=â¯.006) increased the odds of death. ST elevation was rare (nâ¯=â¯5 [0.7%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with ECG findings of both left-sided heart disease (atrial premature contractions, intraventricular block, repolarization abnormalities) and right-sided disease (right bundle branch block) have higher odds of death.

The process of requesting pathological investigations is usually handled manually through paper-based forms. This study evaluated the potential for paper-based request forms to transmit severe acute respiratory virus coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to laboratory staff in order to make recommendations for dealing with hospital paperwork in a post-COVID-19 world. Methods: Paper-based forms were tracked from the time of test ordering until the release of the pathology report by calculating the time taken for the forms to reach the laboratory, and the exposure of each staff group to forms received from both high and moderate COVID-19 risk areas. Results: Four hundred and thirty-two (83%) of 520 forms were received in the laboratory within 24 h. The remaining 88 (17%) forms took ≥24 h to be handled by laboratory personnel. The mean daily exposure time to the paperwork for various laboratory staff was as follows: receptionists, 2.7 min; technicians, 5.5 min; and pathologists, 54.6 min. Conclusion: More than 80% of the forms were handled by laboratory personnel within 24 h, carrying a high potential risk for viral transmission. It is recommended that paper-based request forms should be replaced by electronic requests that could be printed in the laboratory if required. Another option would be to sterilize received paperwork to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel.

464259,Changing the Game on Testing,2020,"BACKGROUND: In Brazil, a substantial number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases and deaths have been reported. It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. RESULTS: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazil's epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million.","Veiga E Silva, Lena; de Andrade Abi Harb, Maria Da Penha; Teixeira Barbosa Dos Santos, Aurea Milene; de Mattos Teixeira, Carlos André; Macedo Gomes, Vitor Hugo; Silva Cardoso, Evelin Helena; S da Silva, Marcelino; Vijaykumar, N L; Venâncio Carvalho, Solon; Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho, André; Lisboa Frances, Carlos Renato",J Med Internet Res,,290

We report a case series of 8 patients with COVID-19 and PRES diagnosed at two academic medical centers between March and July of 2020. The clinical, laboratory and radiographic data, treatment, and short-term outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. The mean age was 57.9 ± 12 years, and 50% were women. Four patients had previous vascular comorbidities. All the patients suffered from severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care unit admission. Five patients were not hypertensive at presentation (all SBP < 127 mmHg). Neurologic symptoms included seizures in 7 patients; impaired consciousness in 5 patients; focal neurological signs in 3 patients; and visual disturbances in 1 patient. All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging which indicated asymmetric T2 prolongation or diffusion changes (50%), extensive fronto-parieto-occipital involvement (25%), vascular irregularities (12.5%) and intracranial hemorrhage (25%). Four patients were treated with tocilizumab. Three patients were discharged without neurologic disability, 2 patients had persistent focal neurologic deficits and 2 expired. One patient's prognosis remains guarded. Together, these data support the relationship between PRES and endothelial dysfunction associated with severe COVID-19. In patients with severe COVID-19, PRES can be triggered by uncontrolled hypertension, or occur independently in the setting of systemic illness and certain medications. Like other infectious processes, critically ill patients with COVID-19 may be at greater risk of PRES because of impaired vasoreactivity or the use of novel agents like Tocilizumab.","Lallana, Sofía; Chen, Austin; Requena, Manuel; Rubiera, Marta; Sanchez, Anna; Siegler, James E; Muchada, Marián",J Clin Neurosci,,290

Data were from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United States Renal Data System. Based on 2019 OPTN reports, annualized reduction in kidney transplantation of 25%-100% could result in excess deaths of wait-listed (deceased donor) transplant candidates from 84 to 337 and living donor candidate excess deaths from 35 to 141 (total 119-478 potentially preventable deaths of transplant candidates). Changes in transplant activity due to COVID-19 varied with some centers shutting down while others simply heeded known or suspected pandemic risks. Understanding potential excess mortality for ESRD transplant candidates when circumstances compel curtailment of transplant activity may inform policy and procedural aspects of organ transplant systems allowing ways to best inform patients and families as to potential risks in shuttering organ transplant activity. Considering that more than 700 000 Americans have ESRD with 100 000 awaiting a kidney transplant, our highest annual estimate of 478 excess total deaths from postponing kidney transplantation seems modest.","Peters, Thomas G; Bragg-Gresham, Jennifer L; Klopstock, Annie C; Roberts, John P; Chertow, Glenn; McCormick, Frank; Held, Philip J",Clin Transplant,,290

471465,"""Self-Portrait as Exit Wounds"": A Graphic Story",2021,"OBJECTIVES: Since the beginning of the novel coronavirus outbreak, different strategies have been explored to stem the spread of the disease and appropriately manage patient flow. Triage, an effective solution proposed in disaster medicine, also works well to manage Emergency Department (ED) flow. The aim of this study was to describe the role of an ED Triage Center for patients with suspected novel coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and characterize the patient flow. METHODS: In March 2020, we established a Covid-19 triage center close to the Liège University EDs. From March 2 to March 23, we planned to analyze the specific flow of patients admitted to this triage zone and their characteristics in terms of inner specificities, work-up and management. During this period, all patients presented to the ED with symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total amount of 1071 patients presented to the triage center during the study period. 41.50% of the patients presented with flu-like symptoms. In 82.00% of the cases, no risk factor of virus transmission was found. The SARS-Cov2 positive patients represented 29.26% of the screened patients. 83.00% of patients were discharged home while 17.00% were admitted to the hospital. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that triage centers for the assessment and management of Covid-19 suspected patients is an essential key strategy to prevent the spread of the disease among non-symptomatic patients who present to the EDs for care. This allows for a disease-centered work-up and safer diversion of Covid-19 patients to specific hospital units.","Gilbert, Allison; Brasseur, Edmond; Petit, Mérédith; Donneau, Anne Françoise; Diep, AnhNguyet; Hetzel Campbell, Suzanne; Servotte, Jean-Christophe; Piazza, Justine; Ancion, Aurore; Gensburger, Mathieu; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",Acta Clin Belg,,290

Therefore, during the last few months, the great importance and efficacy of a variety of engineering techniques that have greatly contributed in curbing the spread of the COVID-19, and evenly help to eliminate it according to recent scientific studies was highly prominent. Among these promising technologies in this field we mention, but not limited to, the use of ultraviolet (UV) rays to disinfection of air and surfaces. In addition, thermal imaging technology, which was employed using infrared radiation for monitoring people in crowded areas and human groups to determine who have abnormal temperatures, so that all preventive measures are taken. Robots have also been used and harnessed to perform many tasks that limit the spread of the virus and maintain the integrity of the human element. Last but not least, facial recognition techniques have also been used to limit the spread of this pandemic. Ultraviolet radiation is one of physical therapy modalities that can be used to increase the efficiency of human immune system to fight the virus.

With reference to COVID-19, exemplars sourced from social media platforms and relevant organisations demonstrate the remarkable creative brilliance of young people. During these difficult times, young people used song, dance, storytelling, and art to express themselves, (re)connect with others, champion social change, and promote health and wellbeing. This article demonstrates the power of positive organisational arts-based youth scholarship to understand how young people use art to redress negativity via a positive lens of agency, peace, collectedness, and calm.","Dadich, Ann; Boydell, Katherine M; Habak, Stephanie; Watfern, Chloe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,290

Through November 20, 2020, 51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.","A, Ruhan; Wang, Huijuan; Wang, Wenling; Tan, Wenjie",Virol Sin,,290

In this work, a horticultural collaborative production system is addressed, inspired by the community-supported agriculture (CSA) model. In a highly industrialised area of Northern Italy, with significant wild land consumption, an alternative bottom-up experience is described for the provision of vegetables in a short and cooperative not-for-sale supply chain. Local organic farming and just labour conditions seek ecological sustainability and social equity beyond market dynamics. This CSA project contributes to the resilience of a territory currently affected by health and economic plights. Its claims, limits, and potentials of a project of this kind are investigated for the first time by means of the Emergy Assessment (EMA). The socio-ecological and economic inputs in the system at issue are identified and quantified, partly eased by the transparent process of the target community, and some key indicators are calculated. The new specific emergy values for the organic horticultural produce at hand are 3.15E+12 sej/kg (without labour and services), with organic manure as a leading input (37%) and 1.02E+13 sej/kg (with L&S), with labour as a leading input (38% paid, 8% voluntary) as key inputs;their calculation corrects underestimations present in some biased studies. This EMA provides fruitful insights of a single replicable and/or scalable project, thus offering current barrier and future opportunities for local improvement and exportability to crisis and post-crisis scenarios, and anyway for pursuing sustainability goals.","Cristiano, S.",Journal of Cleaner Production,,290

The interaction between the two variables is also analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: Online survey data were obtained from 522 faculty members and staff at three public universities in the Philippines. The data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The results show that both workplace rumors and organizational formalization are associated positively with role ambiguity and emotional exhaustion, and role ambiguity mediates workplace rumors' effect on emotional exhaustion. Moreover, the moderating effect analysis shows that workplace rumors and organizational formalization interact and intensify the degree of role ambiguity and emotional exhaustion that employees experience. Originality/value: This study extends previous research by showing that employees who work in a highly formal structure can be extremely sensitive to workplace rumors during a period of uncertainty. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Puyod, J.

On the basis of O3 isopleths from a series of air quality simulations under different levels of NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission reductions, we found that such concerns are not necessary. As NOx emissions have been reduced in recent years for particulate matter control, future NOx reductions are generally favorable for summertime maximum daily average 8-h (MDA8) O3 reductions. Decreases in summertime O3 due to NOx reductions will also lead to lower atmospheric oxidation capacity, characterized by decreased OH and NO3 concentrations, resulting in further reduction of secondary inorganic aerosols (nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium ion, NSA) formation. VOC emission reductions help to further reduce MDA8 O3 and are needed to control HCHO and primary air toxics simultaneously, but they are ineffective in reducing NSA. This study indicates that a nationwide NOx emission reduction policy has great potential in controlling O3 and PM2.5 simultaneously.

RECENT FINDINGS: The rate of good treatment adherence in PsA can be as low as 57.7% and successful patient education can help improve treatment adherence. Also, 78.7% of patients who stopped their disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic did so without the advice of their clinician. In delivering educational needs, the aspects of disease process, treatment, self-help measures, managing pain, movement, psychological and social needs should all be addressed, whilst at the same time, recognising that PsA patients with multidomain disease, are likely to be dealing with more than just pain. Arthritis self-care management education is potentially beneficial, but up to 11% of educational YouTube videos may contain misleading patient opinion and many existing apps do not meet the needs of the patients with PsA. SUMMARY: Significant room for improvement exists in treatment adherence in PsA and patient education addressing the relevant educational needs could assist with this issue.

482739,Coronavirus-related cyberattacks sure [sic] 192K in one week,2020,"Investigation into the role of vitamin C in the prevention and treatment of pneumonia and sepsis has been underway for many decades. This research has laid a strong foundation for translation of these findings into patients with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Research has indicated that patients with pneumonia and sepsis have low vitamin C status and elevated oxidative stress. Administration of vitamin C to patients with pneumonia can decrease the severity and duration of the disease. Critically ill patients with sepsis require intravenous administration of gram amounts of the vitamin to normalize plasma levels, an intervention that some studies suggest reduces mortality. The vitamin has pleiotropic physiological functions, many of which are relevant to COVID-19. These include its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and immuno-modulatory functions. Preliminary observational studies indicate low vitamin C status in critically ill patients with COVID-19. There are currently a number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) registered globally that are assessing intravenous vitamin C monotherapy in patients with COVID-19. Since hypovitaminosis C and deficiency are common in low-middle-income settings, and many of the risk factors for vitamin C deficiency overlap with COVID-19 risk factors, it is possible that trials carried out in populations with chronic hypovitaminosis C may show greater efficacy. This is particularly relevant for the global research effort since COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting low-middle-income countries and low-income groups globally. One small trial from China has finished early and the findings are currently under peer review. There was significantly decreased mortality in the more severely ill patients who received vitamin C intervention. The upcoming findings from the larger RCTs currently underway will provide more definitive evidence. Optimization of the intervention protocols in future trials, e.g., earlier and sustained administration, is warranted to potentially improve its efficacy. Due to the excellent safety profile, low cost, and potential for rapid upscaling of production, administration of vitamin C to patients with hypovitaminosis C and severe respiratory infections, e.g., COVID-19, appears warranted.","Carr, Anitra C; Rowe, Sam",Nutrients,,290
483133,CORONAVIRUS 最大の脅威は中国政府の隠蔽工作 : 新型肺炎,2020,"OBJECTIVES: End-of-outbreak declarations are an important component of outbreak response because they indicate that public health and social interventions may be relaxed or lapsed. Our study aimed to assess end-of-outbreak probabilities for clusters of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases detected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. METHODS: A statistical model for end-of-outbreak determination, which accounted for reporting delays for new cases, was computed. Four clusters, representing different social contexts and time points during the first wave of the epidemic, were selected and their end-of-outbreak probabilities were evaluated. RESULTS: The speed of end-of-outbreak determination was most closely tied to outbreak size. Notably, accounting underascertainment of cases led to later end-of-outbreak determinations. In addition, end-of-outbreak determination was closely related to estimates of case dispersionk and the effective reproduction number Re. Increasing local transmission (Re>1) leads to greater uncertainty in the probability estimates. CONCLUSIONS: When public health measures are effective, lowerRe (less transmission on average) and larger k (lower risk of superspreading) will be in effect, and end-of-outbreak determinations can be declared with greater confidence. The application of end-of-outbreak probabilities can help distinguish between local extinction and low levels of transmission, and communicating these end-of-outbreak probabilities can help inform public health decision making with regard to the appropriate use of resources.","Linton, Natalie M; Akhmetzhanov, Andrei R; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Int J Infect Dis,,290

488248,Statistical methods for comparing test positivity rates between countries: Which method should be used and why?,2021,"BACKGROUND: AKI is common among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is an independent risk factor for mortality. Although there are numerous potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated AKI, our current knowledge of kidney pathologic findings in COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: We examined the postmortem kidneys from 42 patients who died of COVID-19. We reviewed light microscopy findings in all autopsies and performed immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and in situ hybridization studies for SARS-CoV-2 on a subset of samples. RESULTS: The cohort had a median age of 71.5 years (range, 38-97 years); 69% were men, 57% were Hispanic, and 73% had a history of hypertension. Among patients with available data, AKI developed in 31 of 33 patients (94%), including 6 with AKI stage 1, 9 with stage 2, and 16 with stage 3. The predominant finding correlating with AKI was acute tubular injury. However, the degree of acute tubular injury was often less severe than predicted for the degree of AKI, suggesting a role for hemodynamic factors, such as aggressive fluid management. Background changes of hypertensive arterionephrosclerosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis were frequent but typically mild. We identified focal kidney fibrin thrombi in 6 of 42 (14%) autopsies. A single Black patient had collapsing FSGS. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were largely unrevealing, and in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 showed no definitive positivity. CONCLUSIONS: Among a cohort of 42 patients dying with COVID-19, autopsy histologic evaluation revealed acute tubular injury, which was typically mild relative to the degree of creatinine elevation. These findings suggest potential for reversibility upon resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Santoriello, Dominick; Khairallah, Pascale; Bomback, Andrew S; Xu, Katherine; Kudose, Satoru; Batal, Ibrahim; Barasch, Jonathan; Radhakrishnan, Jai; D039,; Agati, Vivette; Markowitz, Glen",J Am Soc Nephrol,,290

With the advent and spread of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Learning from the experiences of various countries and the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, social distancing, use of sanitizers, thermal screening, quarantining, and provision of lockdown in the cities being the effective measure that can contain the spread of the pandemic. Though complete lockdown helps in containing the spread, it generates complexity by breaking the economic activity chain. Besides, laborers, farmers, and workers may lose their daily earnings. Owing to these detrimental effects, the government has to open the lockdown strategically. Prediction of the COVID-19 spread and analyzing when the cases would stop increasing helps in developing a strategy. An attempt is made in this paper to predict the time after which the number of new cases stops rising, considering the strong implementation of lockdown conditions using three different techniques such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Process Regression algorithm are used to project the number of cases. Thus, the projections are used in identifying inflection points, which would help in planning the easing of lockdown in a few of the areas strategically. The criticality in a region is evaluated using the criticality index (CI), which is proposed by authors in one of the past of research works.

490811,Legal regulation of surrogate motherhood,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several research efforts have evaluated the impact of various factors including a) socio-demographics, (b) health indicators, (c) mobility trends, and (d) health care infrastructure attributes on COVID-19 transmission and mortality rate. However, earlier research focused only on a subset of variable groups (predominantly one or two) that can contribute to the COVID-19 transmission/mortality rate. The current study effort is designed to remedy this by analyzing COVID-19 transmission/mortality rates considering a comprehensive set of factors in a unified framework. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We study two per capita dependent variables: (1) daily COVID-19 transmission rates and (2) total COVID-19 mortality rates. The first variable is modeled using a linear mixed model while the later dimension is analyzed using a linear regression approach. The model results are augmented with a sensitivity analysis to predict the impact of mobility restrictions at a county level. Several county level factors including proportion of African-Americans, income inequality, health indicators associated with Asthma, Cancer, HIV and heart disease, percentage of stay at home individuals, testing infrastructure and Intensive Care Unit capacity impact transmission and/or mortality rates. From the policy analysis, we find that enforcing a stay at home order that can ensure a 50% stay at home rate can result in a potential reduction of about 33% in daily cases. CONCLUSIONS: The model framework developed can be employed by government agencies to evaluate the influence of reduced mobility on transmission rates at a county level while accommodating for various county specific factors. Based on our policy analysis, the study findings support a county level stay at home order for regions currently experiencing a surge in transmission. The model framework can also be employed to identify vulnerable counties that need to be prioritized based on health indicators for current support and/or preferential vaccination plans (when available).","Bhowmik, Tanmoy; Tirtha, Sudipta Dey; Iraganaboina, Naveen Chandra; Eluru, Naveen",PLoS One,,290

491027,DANTE: Predicting Insider Threat using LSTM on system logs,2021-02-10,"Naturally-occurring autoantibodies to certain components of autophagy processes have been described in a few autoimmune diseases, but their fine specificity, their relationships with clinical phenotypes, and their potential pathogenic functions remain elusive. Here, we explored IgG autoantibodies reacting with a panel of cytoplasmic endosomal/lysosomal antigens and individual heat-shock proteins, all of which share links to autophagy. Sera from autoimmune patients and from MRL/lpr and NZB/W lupus-prone mice reacted with the C-terminal residues of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)2A. No cross-reaction was observed with LAMP2B or LAMP2C variants, with dsDNA or mononucleosomes, or with heat-shock protein A8. Moreover, administering chromatography-purified LAMP2A autoantibodies to MRL/lpr mice accelerated mortality. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed elevated cell-surface expression of LAMP2A on MRL/lpr B cells. These findings reveal the involvement of a new class of autoantibodies targeting the C-terminus of LAMP2A, a receptor for cytosolic proteins targeted for degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. These autoantibodies could affect the autophagy process, which is abnormally upregulated in lupus. The data presented support a novel connection between autophagy dysregulation, autoimmune processes and pathophysiology in lupus.","Wilhelm, Maud; Bonam, Srinivasa Reddy; Schall, Nicolas; Bendorius, Mykolas; Korganow, Anne-Sophie; Lumbroso, Catherine; Muller, Sylviane",J Autoimmun,,290

492056,Listening and falling silent: Towards technics of collectivity,2020,"Importance: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide since December 2019. However, information on cardiac injury in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. Objective: To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020, in a single center at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China; the final date of follow-up was February 15, 2020. All consecutive inpatients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical laboratory, radiological, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of patients with and without cardiac injury were compared. The association between cardiac injury and mortality was analyzed. Results: A total of 416 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were included in the final analysis; the median age was 64 years (range, 21-95 years), and 211 (50.7%) were female. Common symptoms included fever (334 patients [80.3%]), cough (144 [34.6%]), and shortness of breath (117 [28.1%]). A total of 82 patients (19.7%) had cardiac injury, and compared with patients without cardiac injury, these patients were older (median [range] age, 74 [34-95] vs 60 [21-90] years; P < .001); had more comorbidities (eg, hypertension in 49 of 82 [59.8%] vs 78 of 334 [23.4%]; P < .001); had higher leukocyte counts (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 9400 [6900-13â¯800] vs 5500 [4200-7400] cells/µL) and levels of C-reactive protein (median [IQR], 10.2 [6.4-17.0] vs 3.7 [1.0-7.3] mg/dL), procalcitonin (median [IQR], 0.27 [0.10-1.22] vs 0.06 [0.03-0.10] ng/mL), creatinine kinase-myocardial band (median [IQR], 3.2 [1.8-6.2] vs 0.9 [0.6-1.3] ng/mL), myohemoglobin (median [IQR], 128 [68-305] vs 39 [27-65] µg/L), high-sensitivity troponin I (median [IQR], 0.19 [0.08-1.12] vs <0.006 [<0.006-0.009] µg/L), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (median [IQR], 1689 [698-3327] vs 139 [51-335] pg/mL), aspartate aminotransferase (median [IQR], 40 [27-60] vs 29 [21-40] U/L), and creatinine (median [IQR], 1.15 [0.72-1.92] vs 0.64 [0.54-0.78] mg/dL); and had a higher proportion of multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity in radiographic findings (53 of 82 patients [64.6%] vs 15 of 334 patients [4.5%]). Greater proportions of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (38 of 82 [46.3%] vs 13 of 334 [3.9%]; P < .001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (18 of 82 [22.0%] vs 14 of 334 [4.2%]; P < .001) than those without cardiac injury. Complications were more common in patients with cardiac injury than those without cardiac injury and included acute respiratory distress syndrome (48 of 82 [58.5%] vs 49 of 334 [14.7%]; P < .001), acute kidney injury (7 of 82 [8.5%] vs 1 of 334 [0.3%]; P < .001), electrolyte disturbances (13 of 82 [15.9%] vs 17 of 334 [5.1%]; P = .003), hypoproteinemia (11 of 82 [13.4%] vs 16 of 334 [4.8%]; P = .01), and coagulation disorders (6 of 82 [7.3%] vs 6 of 334 [1.8%]; P = .02). Patients with cardiac injury had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury (42 of 82 [51.2%] vs 15 of 334 [4.5%]; P < .001). In a Cox regression model, patients with vs those without cardiac injury were at a higher risk of death, both during the time from symptom onset (hazard ratio, 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49]) and from admission to end point (hazard ratio, 3.41 [95% CI, 1.62-7.16]). Conclusions and Relevance: Cardiac injury is a common condition among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality.","Shi, Shaobo; Qin, Mu; Shen, Bo; Cai, Yuli; Liu, Tao; Yang, Fan; Gong, Wei; Liu, Xu; Liang, Jinjun; Zhao, Qinyan; Huang, He; Yang, Bo; Huang, Congxin",JAMA Cardiol,,290
492601,A minimal model for household effects in epidemics,2020,"The test positivity (TP) rate has emerged as an important metric for gauging the illness burden due to COVID-19. Given the importance of COVID-19 TP rates for understanding COVID-related morbidity, researchers and clinicians have become increasingly interested in comparing TP rates across countries. The statistical methods for performing such comparisons fall into two general categories: frequentist tests and Bayesian methods. Using data from Our World in Data (ourworldindata.org), we performed comparisons for two prototypical yet disparate pairs of countries: Bolivia versus the United States (large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates), and South Korea vs. Uruguay (two very small TP rates of similar magnitude). Three different statistical procedures were used: two frequentist tests (an asymptotic z-test and the 'N-1' chi-square test), and a Bayesian method for comparing two proportions (TP rates are proportions). Results indicated that for the case of large vs. small-to-moderate TP rates (Bolivia versus the United States), the frequentist and Bayesian approaches both indicated that the two rates were substantially different. When the TP rates were very small and of similar magnitude (values of 0.009 and 0.007 for South Korea and Uruguay, respectively), the frequentist tests indicated a highly significant contrast, despite the apparent trivial amount by which the two rates differ. The Bayesian method, in comparison, suggested that the TP rates were practically equivalent-a finding that seems more consistent with the observed data. When TP rates are highly similar in magnitude, frequentist tests can lead to erroneous interpretations. A Bayesian approach, on the other hand, can help ensure more accurate inferences and thereby avoid potential decision errors that could lead to costly public health and policy-related consequences.","Hittner, James B; Fasina, Folorunso O",Methods (S.

493064,Bayesian Optimization of Risk Measures,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND: On February 21, 2020, 2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in pilgrim travelers from Korea to Israel were identified. We investigated the source of infection, clinical features of COVID-19, and transmission potential of presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases. METHODS: All 39 pilgrim travelers were aggressively tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Their clinical features and possible source of infection were investigated by interview and review of their medical records. Ten confirmed cases without symptoms at the first sampling dates were selected for follow-up reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS: Of 39 pilgrim travelers, 30 (77%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 positive COVID-19 cases, 4 (13%) were asymptomatic. Available follow-up cycle threshold values from 10 cases gradually increased over time and were lower during the presymptomatic period than during the postsymptomatic period. Out of 328 contacts related to the COVID-19 cases in the pilgrim travelers, 22 additional cases (7%) were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Three tertiary cases were identified to be transmitted by presymptomatic secondary cases. CONCLUSION: To prevent transmission of COVID-19, we need to focus on presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and massive testing for SARS-CoV-2 is required. More research about the possibility of presymptomatic transmission over 2 days before symptom onset is required.","Park, Ji Hyuk; Jang, Joon Ho; Lee, Kwan; Yoo, Seok Ju; Shin, Hyojung",J Korean Med Sci,,290

495481,"Cellulose, nanocellulose, and antimicrobial materials for the manufacture of disposable face masks: a review",2021,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation in intensive care for 48 h or longer is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might be present at the time ventilatory support is instituted or develop afterwards, predominantly during the first 5 days. Survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ARDS are at risk of considerably impaired physical function that can persist for years. An early pathogenic mechanism of lung injury in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrin deposition, leading to thrombosis of the microvasculature and hyaline membrane formation in the air sacs. The main aim of this study was to determine if nebulised heparin, which targets fibrin deposition, would limit lung injury and thereby accelerate recovery of physical function in patients with or at risk of ARDS. METHODS: The Can Heparin Administration Reduce Lung Injury (CHARLI) study was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial across nine hospitals in Australia. Adult intensive care patients on invasive ventilation, with impaired oxygenation defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300, and with the expectation of invasive ventilation beyond the next calendar day were recruited. Key exclusion criteria were heparin allergy, pulmonary bleeding, and platelet count less than 50âXâ109/L. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, with stratification by site and using blocks of variable size and random seed, via a web-based system, to either unfractionated heparin sodium 25â000 IU in 5 mL or identical placebo (sodium chloride 0·9% 5 mL), administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 h to day 10 while invasively ventilated. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function Score (out of 100) of survivors at day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, included development of ARDS to day 5 among at-risk patients, deterioration of the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) to day 5, mortality at day 60, residence of survivors at day 60, and serious adverse events. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. There was no imputation of missing data. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612000418875 . FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Aug 23, 2018, 256 patients were randomised. Final follow-up was on Feb 25, 2019. We excluded three patients who revoked consent and one ineligible participant who received no intervention. Of 252 patients included in data analysis, the mean age was 58 years (SD 15), 157 (62%) were men, and 118 (47%) had ARDS. 128 (51%) patients were assigned to the heparin group and 124 (49%) to the placebo group, all of whom received their assigned intervention. Survivors in the heparin group (n=97) had similar SF-36 Physical Function Scores at day 60 compared to the placebo group (n=94; mean 53·6 [SD 31·6] vs 48·7 [35·7]; difference 4·9 [95% CI -4·8 to 14·5]; p=0·32). Compared with the placebo group, the heparin group had fewer cases of ARDS develop to day 5 among the at-risk patients (nine [15%] of 62 patients vs 21 [30%] of 71 patients; hazard ratio 0·46 [95% CI 0·22 to 0·98]; p=0·0431), less deterioration of the MLIS to day 5 (difference -0·14 [-0·26 to -0·02]; p=0·0215), similar day 60 mortality (23 [18%] of 127 patients vs 18 [15%] of 123 patients; odds ratio [OR] 1·29 [95% CI 0·66 to 2·53]; p=0·46), and more day 60 survivors at home (86 [87%] of 99 patients vs 73 [73%] of 100 patients; OR 2·45 [1·18 to 5·08]; p=0·0165). A similar number of serious adverse events occurred in each group (seven [5%] of 128 patients in the heparin group vs three [2%] of 124 patients in the placebo group; OR 2·33 [0·59 to 9·24]; p=0·23), which were a transient increase in airway pressure during nebulisation (n=3 in the heparin group), major non-pulmonary bleeding (n=2 in each group), haemoptysis (n=1 in the heparin group), tracheotomy site bleeding (n=1 in the heparin group), and hypoxaemia during nebulisation (n=1 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with or at risk of ARDS, nebulised heparin did not improve self-reported performance of daily physical activities, but was well tolerated and exploratory outcomes suggest less progression of lung injury and earlier return home.

496687,2021 SPP Virtual Spring Meeting,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 mainly causes damage to the lung, as well as other organs and systems such as the hearts, the immune system and so on. Although the pathogenesis of COVID-19 has been fully elucidated, there is no specific therapy for the disease at present, and most treatments are limited to supportive care. Stem cell therapy may be a potential treatment for refractory and unmanageable pulmonary illnesses, which has shown some promising results in preclinical studies. In this review, we systematically summarize the pathogenic progression and potential mechanisms underlying stem cell therapy in COVID-19, and registered COVID-19 clinical trials. Of all the stem cell therapies touted for COVID-19 treatment, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or MSC-like derivatives have been the most promising in preclinical studies and clinical trials so far. MSCs have been suggested to ameliorate the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and protect alveolar epithelial cells by secreting many kinds of factors, demonstrating safety and possible efficacy in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, considering the consistency and uniformity of stem cell quality cannot be quantified nor guaranteed at this point, more work remains to be done in the future.","Li, Zhongwen; Niu, Shuaishuai; Guo, Baojie; Gao, Tingting; Wang, Lei; Wang, Yukai; Wang, Liu; Tan, Yuanqing; Wu, Jun; Hao, Jie",Cell Prolif,,290

This research aims to study which factors will affect digital accounts' promotion by digital banking. Specifically, we apply the Pearson product-moment correlation (PPMC) to analyze the relationship between variables. The empirical findings can briefly be summarized as follows: 1. In the PPMC model, the research shows that digital accounts have a significant positive relationship with the card in force and active cards. 2. The digital accounts' negative relationship with account opening age limit. On the whole, there are two ways for digital banking to promote digital accounts. First, digital banking effectively promotes digital accounts by targeting customers who hold the bank's credit cards. Second, digital banking best doesn't set the account opening age limit. The results of this research can also serve as a reference for bank authorities when formulating policies to promote digital accounts' promotion.","Chen, Tsung-Chun Kuo Fu-Hsiang Lin Wei-Bin",Journal of Applied Finance and Banking,,290

Few reports were published on the outcome of surgical procedures in diagnosed COVID-19 patients and even fewer on the surgical outcomes of asymptomatic undiagnosed COVID-19 surgical patients. We aimed to review all published data regarding surgical outcomes of preoperatively asymptomatic untested coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: This report is a review on the perioperative period in COVID-19 patients who were preoperatively asymptomatic and not tested for COVID-19. Searches were conducted in PubMed April 4th, 2020. All publications, of any design, were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Four reports were identified through our literature search, comprising 64 COVID-19 carriers, of them 51 were diagnosed only in the postoperative period. Synthesis of these reports, concerning the postoperative outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during the perioperative period, suggested a 14/51 (27.5%) postoperative mortality rate and severe mostly pulmonic complications, as well as medical staff exposure and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 may have potential hazardous implications on the perioperative course. Our review presents results of unacceptable mortality rate and a high rate of severe complications. These observations warrant further well-designed studies, yet we believe it is time for a global consideration of sampling all asymptomatic patients before surgical treatment.","Nahshon, Chen; Bitterman, Arie; Haddad, Riad; Hazzan, David; Lavie, Ofer",World J Surg,,290

497958,Social Transmission of Corona Virus: An Overview,2020,"The increasing use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for magnetic resonance imaging is leading to widespread contamination of freshwater and drinking water systems. Contrary to previous assumptions that GBCAs are stable throughout the water cycle, they can degrade. The stability of GBCAs depends largely on their organic ligands, but also on the physicochemical conditions. There is specific concern regarding UV end-of-pipe water treatments, which may degrade GBCAs. Degradation products in drinking water supplies can increase the risk of adverse health effects. This is of particular relevance where the raw water for drinking water production has a higher proportion of recycled wastewater. GBCAs concentrations in aquatic systems, often referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium, are determined using a variety of calculation methods. Where anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations are low, the inconsistent use of these methods results in high discrepancies and high levels of uncertainty. The current COVID-19 crisis will, in the short-term, drastically decrease the input of GBCAs to freshwater systems. Temporal variations in anthropogenic gadolinium concentrations in river water can be used to better understand river-aquifer interactions and groundwater flow velocities. Collecting urine from all patients following MRI examinations could be a way forward to halt the generally increasing concentrations of Gd in drinking water systems and recover this technologically critical element.","Brünjes, Robert; Hofmann, Thilo",Water Res,,290
498092,Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of unconventional temporal laser modes,2020,"Background: Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to inhibit entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into epithelial cells in vitro, but clinical studies found no evidence of reduced mortality when treating patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of COVID-19 mortality, as opposed to treatment for the disease. Methods: We did a prespecified observational, population-based cohort study using national primary care data and linked death registrations in the OpenSAFELY platform, which covers approximately 40% of the general population in England, UK. We included all adults aged 18 years and older registered with a general practice for 1 year or more on March 1, 2020. We used Cox regression to estimate the association between ongoing routine hydroxychloroquine use before the COVID-19 outbreak in England (considered as March 1, 2020) compared with non-users of hydroxychloroquine and risk of COVID-19 mortality among people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Model adjustment was informed by a directed acyclic graph. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020, of 194â637 people with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, 30â569 (15·7%) received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine. Between March 1 and July 13, 2020, there were 547 COVID-19 deaths, 70 among hydroxychloroquine users. Estimated standardised cumulative COVID-19 mortality was 0·23% (95% CI 0·18 to 0·29) among users and 0·22% (0·20 to 0·25) among non-users; an absolute difference of 0·008% (-0·051 to 0·066). After accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, and geographical region, no association with COVID-19 mortality was observed (HR 1·03, 95% CI 0·80 to 1·33). We found no evidence of interactions with age or other immunosuppressive drugs. Quantitative bias analyses indicated that our observed associations were robust to missing information for additional biologic treatments for rheumatological disease. We observed similar associations with the negative control outcome of non-COVID-19 mortality. Interpretation: We found no evidence of a difference in COVID-19 mortality among people who received hydroxychloroquine for treatment of rheumatological disease before the COVID-19 outbreak in England. Therefore, completion of randomised trials investigating pre-exposure prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention of severe outcomes from COVID-19 are warranted.

498413,Society and the slow burn of inequality,2020,"Neural Architecture Search (NAS) provides state-of-the-art results when trained on well-curated datasets with annotated labels. However, annotating data or even having balanced number of samples can be a luxury for practitioners from different scientific fields, e.g., in the medical domain. To that end, we propose a NAS-based framework that bears the threefold contributions: (a) we focus on the self-supervised scenario, i.e., where no labels are required to determine the architecture, and (b) we assume the datasets are imbalanced, (c) we design each component to be able to run on a resource constrained setup, i.e., on a single GPU (e.g. Google Colab). Our components build on top of recent developments in self-supervised learning~\citep{zbontar2021barlow}, self-supervised NAS~\citep{kaplan2020self} and extend them for the case of imbalanced datasets. We conduct experiments on an (artificially) imbalanced version of CIFAR-10 and we demonstrate our proposed method outperforms standard neural networks, while using $27\times$ less parameters. To validate our assumption on a naturally imbalanced dataset, we also conduct experiments on ChestMNIST and COVID-19 X-ray. The results demonstrate how the proposed method can be used in imbalanced datasets, while it can be fully run on a single GPU.

Specifically, the first and the second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated as well as the pre-operative COVID-19 test. A cross-sectional single-center study of our prospectively maintained institutional arthroplasty registry was performed. The first COVID-19 wave and the second COVID-19 wave led to a socioeconomic lockdown in 2020. Performed surgeries, cause of revision, age, gender, and American Society of Anesthesiologists-level were analyzed. Preoperative COVID-19 testing was evaluated and nationwide COVID-19 data were compared to other countries. In 2020, there was a decrease by 16.2% in primary and revision TJAs of the hip and knee compared to 2019. We observed a reduction of 15.8% in primary TJAs and a reduction of 18.6% on rTJAs in 2020 compared to 2019. There is an incline in total hip arthroplasties (THAs) and a decline in total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) comparing 2019 to 2020. During the first wave, there was a reduction in performed primary TJAs of 86%. During the second wave, no changes were observed. This is the first study quantifying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary and revision TJAs regarding the first and second wave.","Simon, Sebastian; Frank, Bernhard J H; Aichmair, Alexander; Manolopoulos, Philip P; Dominkus, Martin; Schernhammer, Eva S; Hofstaetter, Jochen G",,,290

The objective of the study is focused on Mediterranean region connectivity initiatives in the context of the broader vision of an interconnected European–Mediterranean (Euro–Med) power system for a future low-carbon energy system as the fundamental objective of Med-TSO, the Association of the Mediterranean Transmission System Operators (TSOs) for electricity. The analysis examines how the power grid connectivity evolves from now on to 2030, describing the progress made to date in integrating the power grids of the Mediterranean region as well as the future possibilities for a more integrated power grid covering the whole region. The research, conducted within Mediterranean Project II of Med-TSO, includes an overview on the current situation of the interconnections and the proposal for the 2030 interconnections Master Plan, coherent with the national development plans (NDPs) and shared energy scenarios for the whole region at the same horizon of 2030. It conducts an assessment of the gap between the current and the 2030 expected situation, taking into account the energy transition toward 2030 objectives resulting from the achievements of climate change pledges, local governmental policies and EU strategy for neighboring countries and Africa. The solutions survey includes technical solutions, procedures and rules to improve systems’ integration and increase regional electricity exchanges in Med-TSO countries, and is aimed at achieving a higher quality of services and better efficiency of energy supply in Med-TSO member countries in the framework of the expected energy transition. The main scope is to present solutions that will be made available due to maturity and experience in the coming decade, specifically: high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technologies, energy storage, sectors coupling, smart grid technologies and services, inter-TSO and transmission–distribution cooperation platforms, etc. The article presents two case studies: the island paradigm and a new cross-border interconnection project of common interest. Finally, the post-pandemic core role of TSOs, which has become more relevant than ever, is transformed into a key-enabler of energy transition towards a sustainable, resilient and innovative climate-neutral recovery.","Moretti, Antonio Pitas Charalampos Christofi George Bué Emmanuel Modesto Gabrieli Francescato",Energies,,290

Specifically, we are interested in how differences in the amino acid and codon sequence can lead to different incubation periods and outbreak periods. Our initial question was to compare SARS-CoV-2 to different viruses in the coronavirus family using BLAST program of NCBI and machine learning algorithms. RESULTS: The result of experiments using BLAST, Apriori and Decision Tree has shown that SARS-CoV-2 had high similarity with SARS-CoV while having comparably low similarity with MERS-CoV. We decided to compare the codons of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV to see the difference. Though the viruses are very alike according to BLAST and Apriori experiments, SVM proved that they can be effectively classified using non-linear kernels. Decision Tree experiment proved several remarkable properties of SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequence that cannot be found in MERS-CoV amino acid sequence. The consequential purpose of this paper is to minimize the damage on humanity from SARS-CoV-2. Hence, further studies can be focused on the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 virus with other viruses that also can be transmitted during latent periods.","Huh, Jung Eun; Han, Seunghee; Yoon, Taeseon",BMC Res Notes,,290

METHODS: One hundred forty one SARS-CoV-2 positive samples were collected during a period of 10-days. In-house protocols were based on extraction with magnetic beads and designed to be used with either the Opentrons OT-2 (OT-2in-house) liquid handling robot or the MagMAXTM Express-96 system (MMin-house). Both protocols were tested in parallel with a commercial kit that uses the MagMAXTM system (MMkit). Nucleic acid extraction efficiencies were calculated from a SARS-CoV-2 DNA positive control. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between both in-house protocols and the commercial kit in their performance to detect positive samples. The MMkit was the most efficient although the MMin-house presented, in average, lower Cts than the other two. In-house protocols allowed to save between 350 and 400 for every 96 extracted samples compared to the commercial kit.

Obviously, some drugs approved for other than epilepsy indications can modify the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptics. Areas covered: This review highlights the drug-drug interactions between antiepileptics and aminophylline, some antidepressant, antiarrhythmic (class I - IV), selected antihypertensive drugs and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics (ketamine, propofol, etomidate, and alphaxalone). The data were reviewed mainly from experimental models of seizures. Whenever possible, clinical data were provided. PUBMED data base was the main search source. Expert opinion: Aminophylline generally reduced the protective activity of antiepileptics, which, to a certain degree, was consistent with scarce clinical data on methylxanthine derivatives and worse seizure control. The only antiarrhythmic with this profile of action was mexiletine when co-administered with VPA. Among antidepressants and non-barbiturate injectable anesthetics, trazodone, mianserin and etomidate or alphaxalone, respectively, negatively affected the anticonvulsant action of some antiepileptic drugs. Clinical data indicate that only amoxapine, bupropion, clomipramine and maprotiline should be used with caution. Possibly, drugs reducing the anticonvulsant potential of antiepileptics should be avoided in epilepsy patients.","Borowicz-Reutt, Kinga K; Czuczwar, Stanislaw J; Rusek, Marta",Expert rev. clin. pharmacol,,290

The urgent needs for exploring the neutralizing antibodies from patients with different clinical characteristics are emerging. METHODS: A total of 117 blood samples were collected from 70 COVID-19 inpatients and convalescent patients. Antibodies were determined with a modified cytopathogenic neutralization assay (NA) based on live SARS-CoV-2 and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dynamics of neutralizing antibody levels at different time points with different clinical characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: The seropositivity rate reached up to 100.0% within 20 days since onset, and remained 100.0% till day 41-53. The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6) by NA and 1:12441.7 (95% CI, 9754.5 to 15869.2) by ELISA. The antibody level by NA and ELISA peaked on day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-45, 46-60, and 61-84 had a higher neutralizing antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (ß=1.0470, P=0.0125; ß=1.0613, P=0.0307; ß=1.3713, P=0.0020).

507109,A comprehensive spatial-temporal infection model,2020-08-28,"We report the clinical and laboratory findings and successful management of seven patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). The patients were diagnosed based on epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and nucleic acid testing. Upon diagnosis with COVID-19 of critical severity, the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, where they received early noninvasive-invasive sequential ventilation, early prone positioning, and bundle pharmacotherapy regimen, which consists of antiviral, anti-inflammation, immune-enhancing, and complication-prophylaxis medicines. The patients presented fever (n = 7, 100%), dry cough (n = 3, 42.9%), weakness (n = 2, 28.6%), chest tightness (n = 1, 14.3%), and/or muscle pain (n = 1, 14.3%). All patients had normal or lower than normal white blood cell count/lymphocyte count, and chest computed tomography scans showed bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs. Nucleic acid testing confirmed COVID-19 in all seven patients. The median MV duration and intensive care unit stay were 9.9 days (interquartile range, 6.5-14.6 days; range, 5-17 days) and 12.9 days (interquartile range, 9.7-17.6 days; range, 7-19 days), respectively. All seven patients were extubated, weaned off MV, transferred to the common ward, and discharged as of the writing of this report. Thus, we concluded that good outcomes for patients with critical COVID-19 can be achieved with early noninvasive-invasive sequential ventilation and bundle pharmacotherapy.","Peng, Mian; Liu, Xueyan; Li, Jinxiu; Ren, Di; Liu, Yongfeng; Meng, Xi; Lyu, Yansi; Chen, Ronglin; Yu, Baojun; Zhong, Weixiong",Front Med,,290

The year 2020 will be a pandemic with the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) across the globe. Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has been a part of our scary life for more than a quarter of a year in 2020. The Wuhan market and China have been the most commonly used terms in the world for at least a quarter of 2020. A zoonotic coronavirus has entered organisms to affect organisms for the third season in several centuries. CoV is a global pandemic prompted a drastic and rapid reconfiguration of society. CoV have extraordinary broad genomes of about 30 kilobases of RNA. There is no genetic relationship between the SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2. For health care strategies and for anticipating and preventing potential outbreaks, adequate description of the international spread of COVID-19 virus is imperative. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as endemic to pandemic in the first trimester of 2020. The biggest issues for diagnosis COVID-19 is not established apart from Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In order to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, testing of active SARS-CoV-2 infections is a fundamental public health method. The vast use of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests around the world has led to increased availability of test kits, which is also a major bottleneck. The technique RT-PCR was generally agreed in the present scenario to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the human body. This review discusses about the importance of molecular technique for diagnosing the pandemic disease of 2019. In conclusion, RT-PCR was found to be an apt technique for identification of SARS-CoV-2.","Farasani, Abdullah",,,290

The FAT10 gene is localized in the MHC class I locus and FAT10 protein expression is mainly restricted to cells and organs of the immune system. In all other cell types and tissues, FAT10 expression is highly inducible by the pro-inflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Besides ubiquitin, FAT10 is the only ULM which directly targets its substrates for degradation by the 26S proteasome. This poses the question as to why two ULMs sharing the proteasome-targeting function have evolved and how they differ from each other. This Review summarizes the current knowledge of the special structure of FAT10 and highlights its differences from ubiquitin. We discuss how these differences might result in differential outcomes concerning proteasomal degradation mechanisms and non-covalent target interactions. Moreover, recent insights about the structural and functional impact of FAT10 interacting with specific non-covalent interaction partners are reviewed.","Aichem, Annette; Groettrup, Marcus",J. cell. sci,,290

The impact of restrictions on which patients undergo surgical procedures and their perioperative outcomes is less understood. METHODS: Adult patients who underwent medically necessary surgical procedures at our institution during a restricted operative period due to the COVID-19 pandemic (March 23-April 24, 2020) were compared to patients undergoing procedures during a similar time period in the pre-COVID-19 era (March 25-April 26, 2019). Cardinal matching and differences in means were utilized to analyze perioperative outcomes. RESULTS: 857 patients had surgery in 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 212 patients had surgery in 2020 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 era cohort had a higher proportion of patients who were male (61.3% vs. 44.5%, P < 0.0001), were White (83.5% vs. 68.7%, P < 0.001), had private insurance (62.7% vs. 54.3%, p 0.05), were ASA classification 4 (10.9% vs. 3%, P < 0.0001), and underwent oncologic procedures (69.3% vs. 42.7%, P < 0.0001). Following 1:1 cardinal matching, COVID-19 era patients (N = 157) had a decreased likelihood of discharge to a nursing facility (risk difference-8.3, P < 0.0001) and shorter median length of stay (risk difference-0.6, p 0.04) compared to pre-COVID-19 era patients. There was no difference between the two patient cohorts in overall morbidity and 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions on surgical operations were associated with a change in the racial and insurance demographics in patients undergoing medically necessary surgical procedures but were not associated with worse postoperative morbidity. Further study is necessary to better identify the causes for patient demographic differences.","Shannon, Adrienne B; Roberson, Jeffrey L; Keele, Luke; Bharani, Tina; Song, Yun; Miura, John T; Kelz, Rachel R; Dempsey, Daniel T; Fleisher, Lee A; DeMatteo, Ronald P; Karakousis, Giorgos C",World J Surg,,290

In recent years, we established an inter-hospital ECMO transfer programme that enables ECMO implants in peripheral hospitals. During the pandemic, the programme was expanded to include ECMO support in selected critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This retrospective single-centre study reports the technical details and challenges encountered during our initial experience with ECMO implants in peripheral hospitals for patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: During March and April 2020, our team at the University Hospital of Zurich performed 3 out-of-centre ECMO implants at different peripheral hospitals. The implants were performed without any complications. The patients were transported by ambulance or helicopter. Good preparation and selection of the required supplies are the keys to success. The implant should be performed by a well-trained, seasoned ECMO team, because options are limited in most peripheral hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Out-of-centre ECMO implants in well-selected patients with COVID-19 is feasible and safe if a well-established organization is available and if the implantation is done by an experienced and regularly trained team.","Schmiady, Martin O; Hofmann, Michael; Sromicki, Juri; Halbe, Maximilian; van Tilburg, Koen; Aser, Raed; Mestres, Carlos A; Maisano, Francesco; Ferrari, Enrico",Interact. cardiovasc. thorac. surg,,290

The swiftly rising of positive cases globally created panic, anxiety and depression among people. The effect of this deadly disease was found to be directly proportional to the physical and mental health of the population. As of 28 October 2020, more than 40 million people are tested positive and more than 1 million deaths have been recorded. The most dominant tool that disturbed human life during this time is social media. The tweets regarding COVID-19, whether it was a number of positive cases or deaths, induced a wave of fear and anxiety among people living in different parts of the world. Nobody can deny the truth that social media is everywhere and everybody is connected with it directly or indirectly. This offers an opportunity for researchers and data scientists to access the data for academic and research use. The social media data contains many data that relate to real-life events like COVID-19. In this paper, an analysis of Twitter data has been done through the R programming language. We have collected the Twitter data based on hashtag keywords, including COVID-19, coronavirus, deaths, new case, recovered. In this study, we have designed an algorithm called Hybrid Heterogeneous Support Vector Machine (H-SVM) and performed the sentiment classification and classified them positive, negative and neutral sentiment scores. We have also compared the performance of the proposed algorithm on certain parameters like precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM).","Kaur, Harleen; Ahsaan, Shafqat Ul; Alankar, Bhavya; Chang, Victor",Inf Syst Front,,290
517456,The Lives or Livelihoods? The Coronavirus Dilemma for Administrations,2020,"Initiation and inhibition are executive functions whose disruption in Parkinson's disease impacts substantially on everyday activities. Management of Parkinson's disease with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) modifies initiation and inhibition, with prior work suggesting that these effects may be mediated via the connectivity of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) with the frontal cortex. Here, we employed high-resolution structural neuroimaging to investigate the variability in initiation, inhibition and strategy use in a cohort of twenty-five (ten females, mean age 62.5, mean Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.5) participants undertaking subthalamic DBS for Parkinson's disease. Neuropsychological assessment of initiation and inhibition was performed preoperatively and at six months postoperatively. We first reconstructed the preoperative connectivity of the STN with a frontal network of anterior and superior medial cortical regions. We then modelled the postoperative site of subthalamic stimulation and reconstructed the connectivity of the stimulation field within this same network. We found that, at both pre- and postoperative intervals, inter-individual variability in inhibition and initiation were strongly associated with structural network connectivity. Measures of subcortical atrophy and local stimulation effects did not play a significant role. Preoperatively, we replicated prior work, including a role for the right inferior frontal gyrus in inhibition and strategy use, as well as the left inferior frontal gyrus in tasks requiring selection under conditions of maintained inhibition. Postoperatively, greater connectivity of the stimulation field with right anterior cortical regions was associated with greater rule violations and suppression errors, supporting prior work implicating right-hemispheric STN stimulation in disinhibition. Our findings suggest that, in Parkinson's disease, connectivity of the frontal cortex with the STN is an important mediator of individual variability in initiation and inhibition,. Personalised information on brain network architecture could guide individualised brain circuit manipulation to minimise neuropsychological disruption after STN-DBS.","Mosley, Philip E; Robinson, Katherine; Coyne, Terry; Silburn, Peter; Barker, Megan S; Breakspear, Michael; Robinson, Gail A; Perry, Alistair",Neuroimage,,290

Digital mental health offers potential to increase access to care, but tangible risks around safety and poor efficacy remain common. METHODS: We conduct a select analysis of U.S. and international published evidence, government websites, grey literature, and media outlets. We present the marked discordance around digital mental health policy, as these frameworks grapple with the challenges of regulating in this sphere. RESULTS: Across the world, there is no consensus around evaluation with countries piloting or proposing different models. Common barriers include the defining the scope and risk of health apps, creating processes able to update evaluation with software updates, lacking better data to inform evaluation, and educating users to the risks and benefits. DISCUSSION: We propose four next steps for guiding any future policy: (i) clear clarification of the categorical status of mental health apps;(ii) objective methodology for assessing apps on a premarket basis which does not solely rely on self-reporting;(iii) well-designed, detailed procedures for iterative post-market app review;(iv) clinician and patient education which empowers users to make smart mental health app choices.","Kahane, K.; Francois, J.; Torous, J.",The Journal of Mental Health Policy & Economics,,290

589840,The Reply,2021-05-04,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among women. Although endocrine therapy is effective, the development of endocrine resistance is a major clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) promotes tumor malignancy, and tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM) within the TME play a crucial role in endocrine resistance. Herein, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between TAM and the endocrine‐resistant phenotype of breast cancer. Macrophages were cultured with conditioned medium (CM) from tamoxifen‐sensitive (MCF7‐S) or ‐resistant (MCF7‐R) MCF7 breast cancer cells. M2 polarization was detected by CD163 immunofluorescence. To determine the effect on endocrine resistance, MCF7 cells were cultured in the supernatant of different TAM, and then treated with tamoxifen. CC‐chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) immunohistochemistry was carried out on pathological sections from 100 patients with invasive estrogen receptor‐positive breast cancer. We found that macrophages cultured in the CM of MCF7‐S and MCF7‐R cells were induced into TAM, with a more obvious M2 polarization in the latter. Tamoxifen resistance was increased by culture in TAM medium. TAM secreted CCL2, which increased endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. High expression of CCL2 was correlated with infiltration of CD163+macrophages (r = 0.548, P < .001), and patients with high CCL2 expression presented shorter progression‐free survival than those with low CCL2 expression (P < .05). We conclude that CCL2 secreted by TAM activates PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and promotes an endocrine resistance feedback loop in the TME, suggesting that CCL2 and TAM may be novel therapeutic targets for patients with endocrine‐resistant breast cancer.","Li, Dongbo; Ji, Hongfei; Niu, Xingjian; Yin, Lei; Wang, Yiran; Gu, Yucui; Wang, Jinlu; Zhou, Xiaoping; Zhang, Han; Zhang, Qingyuan",Cancer Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31710162/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cas.14230,290

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests is an acute respiratory infectious disease. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and safety of oral CPM for COVID-19. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tested oral CPM for the treatment of COVID-19 identified from publications in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Web of Science, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and arXiv before November 2nd, 2020. The risk of bias for each trial was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. RevMan 5.4 software was used for data analyses. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the online GRADEpro tool. RESULTS: Seven RCTs including 1079 participants were identified. The overall bias was assessed as “-high risk of bias” for all included trials. Oral CPM investigated were: Lianhua Qingwen capsule/granules (LHQW), Jinhua Qinggan granules (JHQG), Huoxiang Zhengqi dripping pills (HXZQ), Toujie Quwen granules (TJQW) and Lianhua Qingke granules (LHQK). Compared with conventional western therapy alone for people with COVID-19: regarding the main outcomes, the results showed that oral CPM combined with conventional western therapy improved cure rate (RR = 1.20, 95 % CI 1.04–1.38, involving LHQW and TJQW), reduced aggravation rate (RR = 0.50, 95 % CI 0.29 – 0.85, involving LHQW, JHQG, LHQK and TJQW); with regard to additional outcomes, the results showed that add-on oral CPM shortened the duration of fever, cough and fatigue, improved the recovery rate of cough and fatigue, and increased the improvement and recovery rate of chest CT manifestations. There were some differences in therapeutic effects among various CPMs for the same COVID-19 outcome. The use of TJQW and LHQG appeared not to increase the risk of adverse events, but JHQG may cause mild diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Low-certainty or very low-certainty evidence demonstrated that oral CPM may have add-on potential therapeutic effects for patients with non-serious COVID-19. These findings need to be further confirmed by well-designed clinical trials with adequate sample sizes.","Liang, Shi-Bing; Fang, Min; Liang, Chang-Hao; Lan, Hui-Di; Shen, Chen; Yan, Li-Jiao; Hu, Xiao-Yang; Han, Mei; Robinson, Nicola; Liu, Jian-Ping",Complement Ther Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0965229921000856; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2021.102744; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229921000856?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091029/,290
590757,How coronavirus survives for hours in aerosols,2021-08-18,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the clinical phenotypes and infectious triggers in the 2019 Peruvian Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) outbreak. METHODS: We prospectively collected clinical and neurophysiologic data of patients with GBS admitted to a tertiary hospital in Lima, Peru, between May and August 2019. Molecular, immunologic, and microbiological methods were used to identify causative infectious agents. Sera from 41 controls were compared with cases for antibodies to Campylobacter jejuni and gangliosides. Genomic analysis was performed on 4 C jejuni isolates. RESULTS: The 49 included patients had a median age of 44 years (interquartile range [IQR] 30–54 years), and 28 (57%) were male. Thirty-two (65%) had symptoms of a preceding infection: 24 (49%) diarrhea and 13 (27%) upper respiratory tract infection. The median time between infectious to neurologic symptoms was 3 days (IQR 2–9 days). Eighty percent had a pure motor form of GBS, 21 (43%) had the axonal electrophysiologic subtype, and 18% the demyelinating subtype. Evidence of recent C jejuni infection was found in 28/43 (65%). No evidence of recent arbovirus infection was found. Twenty-three cases vs 11 controls (OR 3.3, confidence interval [CI] 95% 1.2–9.2, p < 0.01) had IgM and/or IgA antibodies against C jejuni. Anti-GM1:phosphatidylserine and/or anti-GT1a:GM1 heteromeric complex antibodies were strongly positive in cases (92.9% sensitivity and 68.3% specificity). Genomic analysis showed that the C jejuni strains were closely related and had the Asn51 polymorphism at cstII gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the 2019 Peruvian GBS outbreak was associated with C jejuni infection and that the C jejuni strains linked to GBS circulate widely in different parts of the world.","Ramos, Ana P.; Leonhard, Sonja E.; Halstead, Susan K.; Cuba, Mireya A.; Castañeda, Carlos C.; Dioses, Jose A.; Tipismana, Martin A.; Abanto, Jesus T.; Llanos, Alejandro; Gourlay, Dawn; Grogl, Max; Ramos, Mariana; Rojas, Jesus D.; Meza, Rina; Puiu, Daniela; Sherman, Rachel M.; Salzberg, Steven L.; Simner, Patricia J.; Willison, Hugh J.; Jacobs, Bart C.; Cornblath, David R.; Umeres, Hugo F.; Pardo, Carlos A.",Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547152/; https://doi.org/10.1212/nxi.0000000000000952,290
590875,Occurrence of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds and Potential Ecological Risks in Wastewater from Hospitals and Receiving Waters in Sri Lanka,2021,"The current COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented new challenges to public health and medical care delivery. To control viral transmission, social distancing measures have been implemented all over the world, interrupting the access to routine medical care for many individuals with neurological diseases. Cognitive disorders are common in many neurological conditions, e.g., stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and other types of dementia, Parkinson's disease and parkinsonian syndromes, and multiple sclerosis, and should be addressed by cognitive rehabilitation interventions. To be effective, cognitive rehabilitation programs must be intensive and prolonged over time; however, the current virus containment measures are hampering their implementation. Moreover, the reduced access to cognitive rehabilitation might worsen the relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional. Urgent measures to address issues connected to COVID-19 pandemic are, therefore, needed. Remote communication technologies are increasingly regarded as potential effective options to support health care interventions, including neurorehabilitation and cognitive rehabilitation. Among them, telemedicine, virtual reality, augmented reality, and serious games could be in the forefront of these efforts. We will briefly review current evidence-based recommendations on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation and offer a perspective on the role of tele- and virtual rehabilitation to achieve adequate cognitive stimulation in the era of social distancing related to COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we will discuss issues related to their diffusion and propose a roadmap to address them. Methodological and technological improvements might lead to a paradigm shift to promote the delivery of cognitive rehabilitation to people with reduced mobility and in remote regions.","Mantovani, Elisa; Zucchella, Chiara; Bottiroli, Sara; Federico, Angela; Giugno, Rosalba; Sandrini, Giorgio; Chiamulera, Cristiano; Tamburin, Stefano",Front Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041963/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00926,290

However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to lack of direct contact, implying the existence of unknown intermediate hosts. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2, but only ACE2s of certain species can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Here, we evaluated and ranked the receptor-utilizing capability of ACE2s from various species by phylogenetic clustering and sequence alignment with the currently known ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2. As a result, we predicted that SARS-CoV-2 tends to utilize ACE2s of various mammals, except murines, and some birds, such as pigeon. This prediction may help to screen the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.","Qiu, Ye; Zhao, Yuan-Bo; Wang, Qiong; Li, Jin-Yan; Zhou, Zhi-Jian; Liao, Ce-Heng; Ge, Xing-Yi",Microbes Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2020.03.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457920300496; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1286457920300496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32199943/,290

DESIGN: Causal mediation analysis. SETTING: Retrospective data from the 2011 Census linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (2017-2019) and death registration data (up to 30 November 2020). PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 65 years or over living in private households in England from 2 March 2020 until 30 November 2020 (n=10,078,568). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hazard ratios were estimated for COVID-19 death for people living in a multi-generational household compared with people living with another older adult, adjusting for geographic factors, socioeconomic characteristics and pre-pandemic health. RESULTS: Living in a multi-generational household was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 death. After adjusting for confounding factors, the hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household with dependent children were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06–1.30) and 1.21 (95% CI 1.06–1.38) for elderly men and women. The hazard ratios for living in a multi-generational household without dependent children were 1.07 (95% CI 1.01–1.13) for elderly men and 1.17 (95% CI 1.07–1.25) for elderly women. Living in a multi-generational household explained about 11% of the elevated risk of COVID-19 death among elderly women from South Asian background, but very little for South Asian men or people in other ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSION: Elderly adults living with younger people are at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, and this is a contributing factor to the excess risk experienced by older South Asian women compared to White women. Relevant public health interventions should be directed at communities where such multi-generational households are highly prevalent.","Nafilyan, Vahé; Islam, Nazrul; Ayoubkhani, Daniel; Gilles, Clare; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Mathur, Rohini; Summerfield, Annabel; Tingay, Karen; Asaria, Miqdad; John, Ann; Goldblatt, Peter; Banerjee, Amitava; Glickman, Myer; Khunti, Kamlesh",J R Soc Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33759630/; https://doi.org/10.1177/0141076821999973,290

596552,New perspectives on psychoanalytic clinical processes,2021-07-12,"Making gender bias visible allows to fill the gaps in knowledge and understand health records and risks of women and men. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shown a clear gender difference in health outcomes. The more severe symptoms and higher mortality in men as compared to women are likely due to sex and age differences in immune responses. Age-associated decline in sex steroid hormone levels may mediate proinflammatory reactions in older adults, thereby increasing their risk of adverse outcomes, whereas sex hormones and/or sex hormone receptor modulators may attenuate the inflammatory response and provide benefit to COVID-19 patients. While multiple pharmacological options including anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, antivirals, anti-inflammatory agents and traditional Chinese medicine preparations have been tested to treat COVID-19 patients with varied levels of evidence in terms of efficacy and safety, information on sex-targeted treatment strategies is currently limited. Women may have more benefit from COVID-19 vaccines than men, despite the occurrence of more frequent adverse effects, and long-term safety data with newly developed vectors are eagerly awaited. The prevalent inclusion of men in randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with subsequent extrapolation of results to women needs to be addressed, as reinforcing sex-neutral claims into COVID-19 research may insidiously lead to increased inequities in health care. The huge worldwide effort with over 3,000 ongoing RCTs of pharmacological agents should focus on improving knowledge on sex, gender and age as pillars of individual variation in drug responses and enforce appropriateness.","Spini, Andrea; Giudice, Valentina; Brancaleone, Vincenzo; Morgese, Maria Grazia; De Francia, Silvia; Filippelli, Amelia; Ruggieri, Anna; Ziche, Marina; Ortona, Elena; Cignarella, Andrea; Trabace, Luigia",Pharmacol Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043661821004321?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043661821004321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34454035/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105848,290

The extent of environmental contamination has not been fully investigated in the context of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. AIM: To investigate environmental SARS-CoV-2 contamination in the isolation rooms of severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy. METHODS: We collected environmental swab samples and air samples from the isolation rooms of three COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia. Patient 1 and Patient 2 received mechanical ventilation with a closed suction system, while Patient 3 received high-flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive ventilation. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to detect SARS-CoV-2; viral cultures were performed for samples not negative on rRT-PCR. FINDINGS: Of the 48 swab samples collected in the rooms of Patient 1 and Patient 2, only samples from the outside surfaces of the endotracheal tubes tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR. However, in Patient 3’s room, 13 of the 28 environmental samples (fomites, fixed structures, and ventilation exit on the ceiling) showed positive results. Air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Viable viruses were identified on the surface of the endotracheal tube of Patient 1 and seven sites in Patient 3’s room. CONCLUSION: Environmental contamination of SARS-CoV-2 can be a route of viral transmission. However, it might be minimized when patients receive mechanical ventilation with a closed suction system. These findings can provide evidence for guidelines for the safe use of personal protective equipment.","Ahn, Jin Young; An, Sanggwon; Sohn, Yujin; Cho, Yunsuk; Hyun, Jong Hoon; Baek, Yae Jee; Kim, Moo Hyun; Jeong, Su Jin; Kim, Jung Ho; Ku, Nam Su; Yeom, Joon-Sup; Smith, Davey M.; Lee, Hyukmin; Yong, Dongeun; Lee, Youn-Jung; Kim, Ji Won; Kim, Hyeong Rae; Hwang, Jung Ho; Choi, Jun Yong",J Hosp Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120304011; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120304011?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32828864/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.08.014,290

599744,Genomic medicine implementation protocols in the PhenX Toolkit: tools for standardized data collection,2021-05-10,"In a 2018 report titled, Quantifying the Epidemic of Prescription Opioid Overdose Deaths, four senior analysts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the head of the Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch, acknowledged for the first time that the number of prescription opioid overdose deaths reported by the CDC in 2016 was erroneous. The error, they said, was caused by miscoding deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) as deaths involving prescribed fentanyl. To understand what caused this error, the authors examined the CDC’s methodology for compiling drug-related mortality data, beginning with the source data obtained from approximately 2.8 million death certificates received each year from state vital statistics registrars. Systemic problems often begin outside the CDC, with a surprisingly high rate of errors and omissions in the source data. Using the CDC’s explanation for what caused the error, the authors show why an international program used by the CDC for reporting mortality is ill-suited for compiling and reporting drug overdose deaths. Except for heroin, methadone, and opium, each of which has an individual program code, all other opioids are separated in just two program codes according to whether they are synthetic or semisynthetic/opiates. Methadone-involved deaths pose a special problem for the CDC because methadone has dual indications for treating pain and for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). In 2019, more than seven times more methadone was administered or dispensed for OUD treatment than was prescribed for pain, yet all methadone-involved deaths are coded by the CDC as involving the prescribed form of the drug. The authors conclude that the CDC was at fault for failing to recognize and correct this problem before 2016. Public policy consequences of this failure are briefly mentioned.","Peppin, John F.; Coleman, John J.",Pain Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33761120/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-021-00254-z,290

Consistent with previous reports, a small set of bat and pangolin-derived Sarbecoviruses show the greatest similarity to SARS-CoV-2 but unlikely to be the direct source of SARS-CoV-2. Three proteins (nsp3, spike and orf9) showed differing regions between the bat Sarbecoviruses and SARS-CoV-2 and indicate virus protein features that might have evolved to support human infection and/or transmission. Spike analysis identified all regions of the protein that have tolerated change and revealed that the current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) have sampled only a fraction (~31%) of the possible spike domain changes which have occurred historically in Sarbecovirus evolution.

The evidence syntheses are used to derive specific recommendations for clinical practice and to contribute to national guidelines. Besides the necessity of conducting good quality evidence syntheses during a pandemic, just as important is that the dissemination of evidence needs to be quick and efficient, especially in a health crisis. The CEOsys project has set itself this challenge. OBJECTIVE: Preparing the most suitable distribution of evidence syntheses as part of the CEOsys project tasks. METHODS: Intensive care unit (ICU) personnel in Germany were surveyed via categorical and free text questions. The survey focused on the following topics: evidence syntheses, channels and strategies of distribution, possibility of feedback, structure and barriers of dissemination and trustworthiness of various organizations. Profession, qualification, setting and size of the facility were recorded. Questionnaires were pretested throughout the queried professions (physician, nurse, others). The survey was anonymously carried out online through SosciSurvey® and an e‑mail was sent directly to 940 addresses. The survey was launched on 3 December, a reminder was sent after 14 days and it ended on 31 December. The survey was also announced via e‑mail through DIVI. RESULTS: Of 317 respondents 200 completed the questionnaire. All information was analyzed including the responses from incomplete questionnaires. The most stated barriers were lack of time and access. Especially residents and nurses without specialization in intensive care mentioned uncertainty or insufficient experience in dealing with evidence syntheses as a barrier. Active distribution of evidence syntheses was clearly preferred. More than half of the participants chose websites of public institutions, medical journals, professional societies and e‑mail newsletters for drawing attention to new evidence syntheses. Short versions, algorithms and webinars were the most preferred strategies for dissemination. Trust in organizations supplying information on the COVID-19 pandemic was given to professional societies and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) as the German governmental institute for infections and public health. The respondents‘ prioritized topics are long-term consequences of the disease, protection of medical personnel against infection and possibilities of ventilation treatment. CONCLUSION: Even though universally valid, evidence syntheses should be actively brought to the target audience, especially during a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic with its exceptional challenges including lack of time and uncertainties in patient care. The contents should be clear, short (short versions, algorithms) and with free access. E‑mail newsletters, websites or medical journals should continuously report on new evidence syntheses.

We formulate a mathematical model to analyze the transmission of the infection through different human compartments. By applying a sensitivity test, we obtain the sensitivity indexes of the parameters involved in the transmission of the disease. We demonstrate the most active/sensitive parameters to analyze the spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. The most active transmission parameters are interposed by introducing control variables. The control intervention is in the form of smart lockdown, frequent handwash, control of the disease’s side effects, face mask, and sanitizer.

We used the same PCR diagnostic panel to test all self-collected and healthcare worker–collected samples from participants at a public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Among 1,076 participants, 51.9% were men, 57.1% were >50 years of age, 81.2% were Black (non-Hispanic), and 74.9% reported >1 chronic medical condition. In total, 8.0% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Compared with nasopharyngeal swab samples, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 59% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 68%. Among participants tested 3–7 days after symptom onset, ANS samples had a sensitivity of 80% and saliva samples a sensitivity of 85%. Sensitivity varied by specimen type and patient characteristics.

603305,Improvements in Methods for Disease Diagnosis and Monitoring,2021-05-14,"INTRODUCTION: In France March 14, 2020 a national lockdown was imposed in France for 55 days to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 and all schools were closed. This study aimed to investigate the effects of home confinement as a result of lockdown on the activity (physical activity and sedentary behaviors), and their determinants, on French children (6-10 years) and adolescents (11-17 years). METHODS: The National Observatory for Physical Activity and Sedentary behaviors launched an online survey from April 1(st), to May 6(th), 2020 using popular social networks and websites. It compared the level of physical activity (PA), sitting and screen time before and during the lockdown and identified the impact of the initial PA (active vs. inactive), sedentary (high vs. low) profiles of the participants and the housing conditions. RESULTS: 6,491 children were included in this study. Initially active children and adolescents decreased their PA more than those initially inactive (p>0.001), while those who met the sitting time recommendations increased more their sitting time during lockdown (p<0.001). The same applies to screen time (p<0.001). Live in urban was associated with a decrease of PA (p<0.001), an increase of their sitting time (p<0.001) and children's screen time (p=0.002) during lockdown. CONCLUSION: This study showed the deleterious effects of confinement caused by lockdown on physical activity and sedentary behaviors. Housing conditions were associated with lifestyle behaviors over this period of lockdown. Future public health policies should consider these results.","Chambonniere, PhD student C; Lambert, C; Fearnbach, N; Tardieu, M; Fillon, A; Genin, P; Larras, B; Melsens, P; Bois, J; Pereira, B; Tremblay, A; Thivel, D; Duclos, M",Eur J Integr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584872/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2021.101308; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382021000263; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382021000263?v=s5,290

Specific control measures restricting social contacts were introduced by the Italian government starting from the beginning of March. In the current study we analyzed public data from the four most affected Italian regions. We (i) estimated the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)), the average number of secondary cases that each infected individual would infect at time t, to monitor the positive impact of restriction measures; (ii) applied the generalized logistic and the modified Richards models to describe the epidemic pattern and obtain short-term forecasts. We observed a monotonic decrease of R(t) over time in all regions, and the peak of incident cases ~2 weeks after the implementation of the first strict containment measures. Our results show that phenomenological approaches may be useful to monitor the epidemic growth in its initial phases and suggest that costly and disruptive public health controls might have had a positive impact in limiting the Sars-Cov-2 spread in Northern Italy.","Moirano, Giovenale; Richiardi, Lorenzo; Novara, Carlo; Maule, Milena",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574301/,290

Employers expect their employees to apply their knowledge to real-world settings, analyze and solve problems, connect choices to actions, and innovate and create. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated changes to the educational landscape by forcing online and remote contexts; physical distancing and other preventive measures have necessitated a shift towards increasing the use of disruptive digital technologies- extended reality (e.g., virtual and augmented reality), gaming, and additive manufacturing-in simulation delivery. Yet Canada’s economic and demographic data suggests that many new graduates struggle to transition from school to working life. The confluence of these factors has led to a need for both individuals and higher education institutions to upgrade and adapt to new digital techniques and modalities. As these needs grow, simulation-based education (SBE) techniques and technologies-already an integral part of training for some professions, including nursing, medicine, and various other health professions-are increasingly being used in digital contexts. In this editorial, we provide our perspective of the socio-technological movement associated with health-professions education (HPE) within the SBE context and examine the application and implementation of micro-credentialing within this field. We also discuss the various levels of expertise that learners may acquire. From this vantage point, we address how SBE can complement the assessment of competencies that learners must demonstrate to attain micro-credentials and explore micro-credentialing’s advantages for, and use in, HPE.","Peisachovich, Eva H; Dubrowski, Adam; Da Silva, Celina; Kapralos, Bill; Klein, Jennifer E; Rahmanov, Zipora",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513481/,290

She was admitted at the intensive care unit with severe pneumonia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and weight-for-age z score of less than −2. She remained more than 30 days in the intensive care unit where she had a femoral venous catheter placement, enteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, and prophylaxis with fluconazole. Moreover, pericardiocentesis was performed due to cardiac tamponade. She had a previous history of prematurity, cardiac surgery due to patent ductus arteriosus, and a long period of hospital stay. Despite the antifungal prophylaxis, two yeast isolates were recovered from blood and then identified by classical mycological methods and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing as Wickerhamomyces anomalus. Both isolates exhibited susceptibility to amphotericin B, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole.

To understand the determinant for this situation, we constructed a mathematical model describing the transmission dynamics and natural history of COVID-19 and analyzed the dataset of mortality in Italy, Spain, and Japan. We estimated the parameter which describes the age-dependency of susceptibility by fitting the model to reported data, including the effect of change in contact patterns during the epidemics of COVID-19, and the fraction of symptomatic infections. Our study revealed that if the mortality rate or the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases does not depend on age, then unrealistically different age-dependencies of susceptibilities against COVID-19 infections between Italy, Japan, and Spain are required to explain the similar age distribution of mortality but different basic reproduction numbers (R(0)). Variation of susceptibility by age itself cannot explain the robust age distribution in mortality by COVID-19 infections in those three countries, however it does suggest that the age-dependencies of (i) the mortality rate and (ii) the fraction of symptomatic infections among all COVID-19 cases determine the age distribution of mortality by COVID-19.","Omori, Ryosuke; Matsuyama, Ryota; Nakata, Yukihiko",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024235/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73777-8,290

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single-center cohort study including 64 patients with fragility hip fractures treated during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1st–May 1st, 2020), compared to 172 patients treated in 2018 and 2019. Dedicated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 circuits were established on March 14th. Patients treated before cohorting (17 patients), in COVID-19 (14 patients) and non-COVID-19 circuits (33 patients) were included. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar for 2018–19 and 2020. Patients in 2020 had a lower median surgical delay (50.5 vs. 91.3 h) and length of stay (9.0 vs. 14.0 days), while those with COVID-19, had longer surgical delays and length of stay (87.7 h and 15.0 days, respectively). Thirty-days mortality was higher among patients before cohorting, but similar in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 pathways compared to 2018–19 (7.1% and 3.0% vs 5.2%, respectively). 23.5% of patients treated before circuiting suffered coronavirus infectious disease-19 disease after discharge. Following separation, no secondary cases of coronavirus infectious disease-19 were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Separate circuits for patients with and without coronavirus infectious disease-19 provided adequate hip fracture care. We did not observe increased mortality rates among hip fracture patients with preoperatively confirmed or suspected coronavirus infectious disease-19, compared to negative cases and 2018–19. Delaying surgery among patients with severe respiratory illness until a favourable trend could be observed did not lead to increased mortality.

In influenza C virus, a single glycoprotein, the haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) protein, possesses all three functions (reviewed in ref. 1). In influenza A and B, the first two activities are mediated by haemagglutinin and the third by a second glycoprotein, neuraminidase. Here we report the crystal structure of the HEF envelope glycoprotein of influenza C virus. We have identified the receptor-binding site and the receptor-destroying enzyme (9-O -acetylesterase) sites, by using receptor analogues. The receptor-binding domain is structurally similar to the sialic acid-binding domain of influenza A haemagglutinin, but binds 9-O -acetylsialic acid. The esterase domain has a structure similar to the esterase from Streptomyces scabies and a brain acetylhydrolase(2),(3). The receptor domain is inserted into a surface loop of the esterase domain and the esterase domain is inserted into a surface loop of the stem. The stem domain is similar to that of influenza A haemagglutinin, except that the triple-stranded, α-helical bundle diverges at both of its ends, and the amino terminus of HEF2, the fusion peptide, is partially exposed. The segregation of HEF's three functions into structurally distinct domains suggests that the entire stem region, including sequences at the amino and carboxy termini of HEF1 which precede the post-translational cleavage site between HEF1 and HEF2, forms an independent fusion domain which is probably derived from an ancestral membrane fusion protein.","Rosenthal, Peter B.; Zhang, Xiaodong; Formanowski, Frank; Fitz, Wolfgang; Wong, Chi-Huey; Meier-Ewert, Herbert; Skehel, John J.; Wiley, Don C.",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9817207/,290

Induction and retention of IL-15-independent memory CD8(+) T cells was assessed in IL-15(−/−) and wild-type (wt) mice immunized with recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) or Sindbis virus (rSIN) vectors expressing the identical foreign epitope. Both vectors induced epitope-specific CD8(+) T cell expansion and function, independent of IL-15. Similar kinetics of rVV clearance confirmed effective CD8(+) T cell function in IL-15(−/−) mice. CD44(hi) CD122(hi) CD8(+) T cells, mainly of the CD62L(−/lo) phenotype, increased more dramatically and declined more rapidly in IL-15(−/−) mice, independent of the vector. Rapid IL-15-independent memory CD8(+) T cell expansion following challenge of immune mice compensated for the limited memory CD8(+) populations in IL-15(−/−) mice. However, despite expansion and expression of potent effector function, viral clearance was delayed in the absence of IL-15, coinciding with a rapid loss in cytolytic function.","Zuo, Jun; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629776/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204007111; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204007111,290

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact and coping strategies of frontline medical staff in Hunan province, adjacent to Hubei province, during the COVID-19 outbreak between January and March 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study included doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff throughout Hunan province between January and March 2020. The study questionnaire included five sections and 67 questions (scores, 0–3). The chi-squared χ(2) test was used to compare the responses between professional groups, age-groups, and gender. RESULTS: Study questionnaires were completed by 534 frontline medical staff. The responses showed that they believed they had a social and professional obligation to continue working long hours. Medical staff were anxious regarding their safety and the safety of their families and reported psychological effects from reports of mortality from COVID-19 infection. The availability of strict infection control guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of their efforts by hospital management and the government, and reduction in reported cases of COVID-19 provided psychological benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei resulted in increased stress for medical staff in adjacent Hunan province. Continued acknowledgment of the medical staff by hospital management and the government, provision of infection control guidelines, specialized equipment and facilities for the management of COVID-19 infection should be recognized as factors that may encourage medical staff to work during future epidemics.","Cai, Haozheng; Tu, Baoren; Ma, Jing; Chen, Limin; Fu, Lei; Jiang, Yongfang; Zhuang, Quan",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.924171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32291383/,290

In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark",J Biosaf Biosecur,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32835180/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2588933820300017; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2588933820300017,290

BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak a shortage of respirators is occurring worldwide; more specifically, CE-certified FFP2 respirators. This has resulted in an increased supply to hospitals of alternative respirators of uncertain quality. Nevertheless, the quality of the respirators used by our healthcare workers must be ensured. METHOD: A protocol and criteria based on applicable standards was developed to ensure the quality of respirators. The protocol has been implemented at the Catharina hospital and includes verification of the documents accompanying the respirator, visual inspection of the respirator and a test for total inward leak of particles into respirators. FINDINGS: 67% of the respirators brands and types received in the Catharina hospital did not meet quality criteria. CONCLUSION: With a simple verification protocol the quality of the respirators can be checked and guaranteed while there is a shortage of the CE approved respirators which are normally used.

How to account for this unprecedented reversal of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in Africa, initially delayed compared to other continents, then apparently contained and now difficult to control? In our opinion, at least two factors play a major role in the current spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Africa: the structural inadequacy of health systems and the serious deficiencies in the African approach to the response. We believe that political decision-makers must assume their responsibilities and inform their decisions on the basis of scientific facts, taking into account the specificities of our approaches to life, the only ones capable of containing fears and participating in the optimal management of crises and ultimately in the development of African nations. If Africa fails, the impact could be catastrophic not only from a health standpoint, but also from an economic standpoint and therefore from an overall human perspective.

Longer-term rewiring of metapopulation networks or the enforcement of feasible long-term measures that decrease disease transmissions appear to be more efficient than temporarily restricted intensive mitigation strategies (e.g. short-term mass quarantine).

Furthermore, we constructed a variety of policy scenarios based on management experience in Beijing. The analysis showed that priority to the development of public transport (PDPT) could significantly increase the proportion of public transport locally and would be helpful in pursuing energy savings and emission reductions as well. Travel demand management (TDM) had a distinctive effect on energy savings and emission reductions in the short term, while technical progress (TP) was more conducive to realizing emission reduction targets. Administrative rules and regulations management (ARM) had the best overall effect of the individual policies on both energy savings and emission reductions.

METHODS: An 11-item survey was emailed to American College of Radiology accredited breast imaging facilities in California and Texas in August 2020. A question subset addressed March-April government restrictions on elective services (“during the shutdown” and “after reopening”). Comparisons were made between states with chi-square and Fisher’s tests, and time frames with McNemar’s and paired t-tests. RESULTS: There were 54 respondents (54/240, 23%, 26 California, 28 Texas). Imaging volumes fell during the shutdown and remained below pre-pandemic levels after reopening, with reduction in screening greatest (ultrasound 12% of baseline, mammography 13%, MRI 23%), followed by diagnostic MRI (43%), procedures (44%), and diagnostics (45%). California reported higher volumes during the shutdown (procedures, MRI) and after reopening (diagnostics, procedures, MRI) versus Texas (P = 0.001 - 0.02). Most screened patients (52/54, 96% symptoms and 42/54, 78% temperatures), and 100% (53/53) modified check-in and check-out. Reading rooms or physician work were altered for social distancing (31/54, 57%). Physician mask (45/48, 94%), gown (15/48, 31%), eye wear (22/48, 46%), and face shield (22/48, 46%) use during procedures increased after reopening versus pre-pandemic (P < 0.001 - 0.03). Physician (47/54, 87%) and staff (45/53, 85%) financial impacts were common, but none reported terminations. CONCLUSION: Breast imaging volumes during the early pandemic fell more severely in Texas than in California. Safety measures and financial impacts on physicians and staff were similar in both states.","Chalfant, James S; Cohen, Ethan O; Leung, Jessica W T; Pittman, Sarah M; Kothari, Pranay D; Downey, John R; Sohlich, Rita E; Chong, Alice; Grimm, Lars J; Hoyt, Anne C; Ojeda-Fournier, Haydee; Joe, Bonnie N; Trinh, Long; Rosen, Eric L; Feig, Stephen A; Aminololama-Shakeri, Shadi; Ikeda, Debra M",J Breast Imaging,https://doi.org/10.1093/jbi/wbab020,290
612078,FDA Review Times for New Drugs in Ophthalmology,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The novel SARS-CoV-2 has been rattling the world since its outbreak in December 2019, leading to the COVID-19 pandemic. The learning curve of this new virus has been steep, with a global scientific community desperate to learn how the virus is transmitted, how it replicates, what cause such a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, causing none or few symptoms in some. Others are burdened by an intense immune response that resembles the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which leads to severe disease manifestations, often complicated by fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Research efforts have been focusing on finding effective cures and vaccinations for this virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, represented by several GI manifestations, has led to its investigation as a target for the virus and as an indicator of disease severity. The response of the microbiome (which is heavily linked to immunity) to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its role in igniting the exaggerated immune response has therefore become a focus of interest. The objective of our study was to gather the data connecting between the microbiome, the GI tract and COVID-19 and to investigate whether these reported alterations in the gut microbiome bear any resemblance to those seen in lupus, the prototypical autoimmune disease. Confirming such changes may become the steppingstone to potential therapies that may prevent transmission, progression and immune related manifestations of COVID-19, via manipulation of the gut microbiota. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature review, utilizing the Pubmed search engine and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the microbiome in COVID-19 patients and compared results with studies evaluating the microbiome in lupus. We searched for the terms: microbiome, dysbiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal as well as lupus and autoimmune. While there were hundreds of articles which referred to gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, to date only 4 studies investigated the gastrointestinal microbiome in this setting. We compared the similarities between microbiome of COVID-19 patients and lupus patients. RESULTS: We found that there are several similar processes of immune dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 and in those with lupus, with several other alterations seen in other pathological states. Some of these similarities include loss of microbiota biodiversity, increased representation of pathobionts, which are microbes associated with inflammation and disease (i.e Proteobacteria) and a relative decrease of symbionts, which are protective microbes, associated with anti-inflammatory properties (i.e Lactobacillus). Compromise to the intestinal barrier has also been reported in both. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the disease manifestations in COVID-19. Whether gastrointestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of gastrointestinal manifestations and several severe systemic manifestations, which may be the response to an increased pro-inflammatory environment, is still debatable and warrants further investigation. Given the resemblance of the microbiome in COVID-19 patients to that seen in lupus patients, it becomes clearer why several therapies used in autoimmune conditions are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these findings should promote further investigating the utility of manipulation of the microbiome, via nutritional supplementation or even fecal transplantations, interventions that may alter the course of the disease, and potentially prevent disease transmission at low cost and low risk.","Katz-Agranov, Nurit; Zandman-Goddard, Gisele",Autoimmun Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.autrev.2021.102865; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568997221001373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118455/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568997221001373?v=s5,290

These biological activities depend on the nature of the chemical groups (neutral or cationic) on their surface as well as their generation. As lessons to learn, in the oncology domain, the increase in the generation of metallo-dendrimers is in the same direction as the anti-proliferative activities, in contrast to the development of polycationic dendrimers, where the most potent anti-tuberculosis phosphorus dendrimer was observed to have the lowest generation (G0).

There have been limited reports of co-infections accompanying SARS-CoV-2 infections, albeit lacking India specific study. The present study has made an effort toward elucidating the prevalence, diversity and characterization of co-infecting respiratory pathogens in the nasopharyngeal tract of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Two complementary metagenomics based sequencing approaches, Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel (RVOP) and Holo-seq, were utilized for unbiased detection of co-infecting viruses and bacteria. The limited SARS-CoV-2 clade diversity along with differential clinical phenotype seems to be partially explained by the observed spectrum of co-infections. We found a total of 43 bacteria and 29 viruses amongst the patients, with 18 viruses commonly captured by both the approaches. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, Human Mastadenovirus, known to cause respiratory distress, was present in a majority of the samples. We also found significant differences of bacterial reads based on clinical phenotype. Of all the bacterial species identified, ∼60% have been known to be involved in respiratory distress. Among the co-pathogens present in our sample cohort, anaerobic bacteria accounted for a preponderance of bacterial diversity with possible role in respiratory distress. Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus and Halomonas sp. are anaerobes found abundantly across the samples. Our findings highlight the significance of metagenomics based diagnosis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory co-infections in the current pandemic to enable efficient treatment administration and better clinical management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 1277 participants who answered a web-based open survey with questions about the use of facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics with percentages was performed, and the responses were analyzed with chi-square and independent t-tests. RESULTS: A total of 1277 answered the questionnaire, and most participants were female (81.8%). Almost all the participants (99.1%) reported wearing facemasks, and 34.2% are wearing just because it is mandatory; 65.8% would continue to wear masks even if it was not mandatory. Most subjects (50.4%) believe that masks’ use effectively prevents infection by the novel coronavirus. Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants (49.5%). Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to crowded and public places. Most respondents (67.3%) are bothered with the use of facemasks, and the most cited reason for the discomfort was feeling trapped or suffocated (58.9%). DISCUSSION: The use of facemasks can help prevent the COVID-19, but it is most effective at reducing the spread of the virus when the general population’s compliance is high. Some factors that limit the population’s compliance with the use of masks are discomfort and a sense of embarrassment. Media campaigns and public health promotion activities supported by governmental agencies can increase the use of facemasks by the population. CONCLUSION: The mean level of anxiety with the COVID-19 pandemic was 6.18. Almost all the participants were wearing facemasks, and they believe that its use effectively prevents infection by the novel coronavirus.

Some of these antivirals can be isolated from a variety of sources, such as animals, plants, bacteria or fungi, while others must be obtained by chemical synthesis, either designed or random. Antivirals display a variety of mechanisms of action, and while some of them enhance the animal immune system, others block a specific enzyme or a particular step in the viral replication cycle. As viruses are mandatory intracellular parasites that use the host’s cellular machinery to survive and multiply, it is essential that antivirals do not harm the host. In addition, viruses are continually developing new antiviral resistant strains, due to their high mutation rate, which makes it mandatory to continually search for, or develop, new antiviral compounds. This review describes natural and synthetic antivirals in chronological order, with an emphasis on natural compounds, even when their mechanisms of action are not completely understood, that could serve as the basis for future development of novel and/or complementary antiviral treatments.","Villa, T.G.; Feijoo-Siota, L.; Rama, J.L.R.; Ageitos, J.M.",Biochem Pharmacol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006295216303306; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006295216303306; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2016.09.029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27697545/,290

This study aims to assess the relative risk of hospitalization due to RTI in winter and summer seasons for different types of CHD. All children born in Sweden and under the age of two, in 2006–2011, were included. Heart defects were grouped according to type. Hospitalization rates for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and RTI in general were retrieved from the national inpatient registry. The relative risk of hospitalization was calculated by comparing each subgroup to other types of CHD and otherwise healthy children. The relative risk of hospitalization was increased for all CHD subgroups, and there was a greater increase in risk in summer for the most severe CHD. This included RSV infection, as well as RTI in general. The risk of hospitalization due to RTI is greater for CHD children. Prophylactic treatment with palivizumab, given to prevent severe RSV illness, is only recommended during winter.

In particular, increased e-learning engagement with digital screens and reduction in outdoor activities are two likely channels posing adverse risks for myopia development. This study investigated the association between e-learning screen use, outdoor activity, lighting condition, and myopia development among school-age children in China, during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 3405 school-age children attending primary, lower-secondary, and upper-secondary schools in China. Univariate parametric and nonparametric tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used. Findings show that each diopter hour increase in daily e-learning screen use is significantly associated with progression of myopia symptoms (OR: 1.074, 95% CI: 1.058–1.089; p < 0.001), whereas engaging in outdoor exercise four to six times per week (OR: 0.745, 95% CI: 0.568–0.977; p = 0.034) and one to three times per week (OR: 0.829, 95% CI: 0.686–0.991; p = 0.048) is associated with a lower likelihood of myopia progression than none at all.

Extant research does not however explore the role of third sector organisations in the employability of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Therefore, our paper explores this gap by adopting a qualitative approach via a total of 36 interviews involving migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and managers of third sector organisations, alongside a categorisation of TSOs. Our findings reveal that TSOs are the primary (and for asylum seekers perhaps the only) providers of integration support services and training or education services. We found that only a limited number of organisations provide formal employability services or skills development services which seem to be only residual in terms of the range of activities that TSOs can organise. Thus, perhaps the main function that TSOs perform that enables integration into the UK labour market is providing a safe and trusted environment that people can use to increase their confidence, improve their well-being, broaden their social circle, learn the language or increase their work experience.","Calò, Francesca; Montgomery, Tom; Baglioni, Simone",Voluntas,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-020-00306-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424139/,290

However, no agents have been approved to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections to date, underscoring the great need for effective and practical therapies for SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. We reported that a focused screen of OA saponins identified 3-O-β-chacotriosyl OA benzyl ester 2 as a novel small molecule inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 virus entry, via binding to SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein (S). We performed structure-activity relationship profiling of 2 and discovered C-17-COOH of OA was an important modification site that improved both inhibitor potency toward SARS-CoV-2 and selectivity index. Then optimization from hit to lead resulted in a potent fusion inhibitor 12f displaying strong inhibition against infectious SARS-CoV-2 with an IC(50) value of 0.97 μM in vitro. Mechanism studies confirmed that inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry of 12f was mediated by the direct interaction with SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit to block membrane fusion. These 3-O-β-chacotriosyl OA amide saponins are suitable for further optimization as SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors with the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections.","Li, Hui; Cheng, Chen; Li, Sumei; Wu, Yan; Liu, Zhihao; Liu, Mingjian; Chen, Jianxin; Zhong, Qiuyu; Zhang, Xuesha; Liu, Shuwen; Song, Gaopeng",Eur J Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S022352342100091X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588180/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113242; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S022352342100091X?v=s5,290

Prevention, however, remains not a constant priority, as the objective may be avoidance of saturation of intensive care beds or more generally of healthcare facilities rather than the minimisation of the disease incidence. This combined with the fact that notwithstanding repeated warnings in past years the epidemic occurred as a surprise denotes a way of thinking in which prevention is an important option but not a guiding principle of choice and action within the health system. To modify this way of thinking and place prevention at the core of the system, non-negligible changes are required: they may become possible in light of emerging hazards like new viruses and climate change, huge economic costs of failed prevention and initial changes in the health system already induced by the COVID-19 epidemic.","Saracci, Rodolfo",J Epidemiol Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32595136/,290

623388,Concentration methods for the quantification of coronavirus and other potentially pandemic enveloped virus from wastewater,2020-08-19,"Abstract To obtain information about the structure and evolution of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), we determined the entire nucleotide sequences of the N genes of MHV-A59, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-1 from cDNA clones. At the nucleotide level, the N gene sequences of these viral strains, and that of MHV-JHM, were more than 92% conserved overall. Even higher nucleotide sequence identity was found in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of the five strains, which may reflect the role of the 3′ UTR in negative-strand RNA synthesis. All five N genes were found to encode markedly basic proteins of 454 or 455 residues having at least 94% sequence identity in pairwise comparisons. However, amino acid sequence divergences were found to be clustered in two short segments of N, putative spacer regions that, together, constituted only 11% of the molecule. Thus, the data suggest that the MHV N protein is composed of three highly conserved structural domains connected to each other by regions that have much less constraint on their amino acid sequences. The first two conserved domains contain most of the excess of basic amino acid residues; by contrast, the carboxy-terminal domain is acidic. Finally, we noted that four of the five N genes contain an internal open reading frame that potentially encodes a protein of 207 amino acids having a large proportion of basic and hydrophobic residues.","Parker, Monica M.; Masters, Paul S.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2171216/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229090316J; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229090316J,290
623724,The Prospective Synergy of Antitubercular Drugs With NAD Biosynthesis Inhibitors,2021-01-26,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a cancer-associated pathogen for which there is no vaccine. Successful anti-viral vaccines elicit antibodies that neutralize infectivity; however, it is unknown whether neutralizing antibodies prevent EBV acquisition. Here we assessed whether passively delivered AMMO1, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes EBV in a cell-type-independent manner, could protect against experimental EBV challenge in two animal infection models. When present prior to a high-dose intravenous EBV challenge, AMMO1 prevented viremia and reduced viral loads to nearly undetectable levels in humanized mice. AMMO1 conferred sterilizing immunity to three of four macaques challenged orally with rhesus lymphocryptovirus, the EBV ortholog that infects rhesus macaques. The infected macaque had lower plasma neutralizing activity than the protected animals. These results indicate that a vaccine capable of eliciting adequate titers of neutralizing antibodies targeting the AMMO1 epitope may protect against EBV acquisition and are therefore highly relevant to the design of an effective EBV vaccine.","Singh, Swati; Homad, Leah J.; Akins, Nicholas R.; Stoffers, Claire M.; Lackhar, Stefan; Malhi, Harman; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Rawlings, David J.; McGuire, Andrew T.",Cell Rep Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724901/,290
624654,XGBLC: An Improved Survival Prediction Model Based on Xgboost.,2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND: Although most observational studies identify viral or bacterial pathogens in 50% or less of patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), we previously demonstrated that a multi-test bundle (MTB) detected a potential pathogen in 73% of patients. This study compares detection rates for potential pathogens with the MTB versus the Biofire® Pneumonia FilmArray® panel (BPFA) multiplex PCR platform and presents an approach for integrating BPFA results as a foundation for subsequent antibiotic stewardship (AS) activities. METHODS: Between January 2017 to March 2018, all patients admitted for CAP were enrolled. Patients were considered evaluable if all elements of the MTB and the BPFA were completed, and they met other a priori inclusion criteria. The primary endpoint was the percentage of potential pathogens detected using the MTB (8 viral and 6 bacterial targets) versus the BPFA (8 viral and 18 bacterial targets). Blood and sputum cultures were performed on all patients. Two or more procalcitonin (PCT) levels assisted clinical assessments as to whether detected bacteria were invading or colonizing. RESULTS: Of 585 enrolled patients, 274 were evaluable. A potential viral pathogen was detected in 40.5% with MTB versus 60.9% of patients with BPFA with an odds ratio (95% CI) of 9.00 (4.12 to 23.30) p<0.01. A potential bacterial pathogen was identified in 66.4% with the MTB vs 75.5% with the BPFA odds ratio (95% CI) of 2.09 (1.24 to 3.59), p 0.003). Low PCT levels helped identify detected bacteria as colonizers.","Gilbert, David N.; Leggett, James E.; Wang, Lian; Ferdosian, Shirin; Gelfer, Gita D.; Johnston, Michael L.; Footer, Brent W.; Hendrickson, Kathryn W.; Park, Hiromichi S.; White, Emma E.; Heffner, John",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115246; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889320306234; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33253962/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889320306234?v=s5,290

For example, as compared with the dog, little is known about the various causes of malabsorptive disease in the cat. So frequently, intestinal biopsy samples reveal nothing more than intestinal thickening with fibrosis and nonspecific mild cellular infiltration, and the inciting cause is never determined. It is, perhaps, wrong to be critical about the use of the bark of Berberis vulgaris and the root of Rheum in modern feline gastroenterology, since most of us occasionally use unconventional therapies. It has been rumored that I have been known to advocate the daily addition of a tablespoon of pumpkin-pie filling to the food of cats suffering from recurrent constipation and acquired megacolon.

625052,Vaccination strategies on dynamic networks with indirect transmission links and limited contact information,2020-11-12,"PURPOSE OF PROGRAM: Access to health care services remains a significant barrier for many Indigenous people’s living in rural and remote regions of Canada. Driven by geographical isolation and compounded by socioeconomic and environmental disparities, individuals living under these circumstances face disproportionately poor health outcomes. Kidney Check is a comprehensive screening, triage, and treatment initiative working to bring culturally safe preventive care to rural and remote Indigenous communities across Manitoba, Ontario, BC, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The project’s patient-oriented approach addresses concerns raised by kidney patients and their caregivers using culturally safe practices. Using the various expertise of their multidisciplinary team, Kidney Check seeks to further collaborative efforts to improve access to preventive health care for these groups. Meaningful engagement with patients, communities, and local health care stakeholders ensures Indigenous voices are heard and incorporated into the project in a way that promotes shared decision-making and sustainability. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: As an affiliate program of the Can-SOLVE CKD Network, Kidney Check’s guiding priorities were developed over 3 years of patient consultation and finalized during 2 workshops held with more than 30 patients, caregivers, Indigenous peoples, researchers, and policy makers using a modified Delphi process. Today, patients continue to participate in project development via 2 governing bodies: The Patient Governance Circle and the Indigenous Peoples Engagement and Research Council (IPERC). METHODS: Modeled after the Indigenous-led 2015 FINISHED project in Manitoba, Kidney Check employs point-of-care testing to identify diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals, ages 10 and above, regardless of pre-existing risk factors. The Kidney Check team consists of 4 working groups: project leadership, provincial management, local community partners, and patient partners. By using and building on existing relationships between local and provincial health care stakeholders and various Indigenous communities, the program furthers collaborative efforts to bridge gaps in health equity. KEY FINDINGS: The Kidney Check program has established an infrastructure that integrates patient engagement at all stages of the program from priority setting to deployment and dissemination strategies. LIMITATIONS: While we encourage and offer screening services to all, many still choose not to attend for a variety of reasons which may introduce selection bias. Kidney Check uses patient engagement as a foundational component of the program; however, there is currently a limited amount of research documenting the benefits of patient engagement in health care settings. More formal qualitative evaluations of these activities are needed. In addition, as the COVID-19 pandemic has halted screening procedures in most communities, we currently do not have quantitative data to support the efficacy of the Kidney Check program. IMPLICATIONS: For many Indigenous people, lack of accessibility to health care services is compounded by sociopolitical barriers that disrupt relationships between patients and providers. Meaningful engagement presents one opportunity to ensure the voices and perspectives of Indigenous patients and communities are incorporated into health services. In addition, this screening paradigm has shown to be cost effective as shown by analyses done on the FINISHED screening program.","Curtis, Sarah; Martin, Heather; DiNella, Michelle; Lavallee, Barry; Chartrand, Caroline; McLeod, Lorraine; Woods, Cathy; Dart, Allison; Tangri, Navdeep; Rigatto, Claudio; Komenda, Paul",Can J Kidney Health Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/20543581211003744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33868690/,290

Till date, DNA testing in microbiology has been directed predominantly to the detection of organisms that are difficult to culture in vitro, or for various reasons the growth is unlikely. DNA analysis can be used successfully in infections in which there is a mix of pathogens. Apart from the straightforward diagnostic applications, DNA microbiological testing has been used to detect antimicrobial resistance or toxigenic forms of E. coli. More recently, the availability of DNA technology to quantitate HCV and HIV has been useful in planning and monitoring treatment. The pathogenesis of many infections, particularly viral ones, can also be realized from experimental strategies based on light and electron microscopy, cell culture and immunoassay. The advantages that are provided by DNA techniques include the ability to detect latent (non-replicating) viruses and to localize their genomes to nuclear or cytoplasmic regions within cells. Nucleic acid probe techniques (NAT) can also be manipulated to enable a broad spectrum of serotypes to be detectable. This is particularly valuable in those emerging infections where the underlying serotypes are unknown.","Trent, Ronald J",Molecular Medicine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780126990577500084; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780126990577500084,290

629581,Effectiveness of portable air filtration on reducing indoor aerosol counts: preclinical observational trials,2021-04-28,"Detecting and analyzing patient insights from social media enables healthcare givers to better understand what patients want and also to identify their pain points. Healthcare institutions cannot neglect the need to monitor and analyze popular social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook. To have a study success, a healthcare giver needs to be able to engage with their patients and adapt to their preferences effectively. However, data-driven decision-making is no longer enough, as the best-in-class organizations struggle to realize tangible benefits from their data-driven analytics investments. Relying on simplistic textual analytics that use big data technologies to learn consumer/patient insights is no longer sufficient as most of these analytics utilize sort of bag-of-words counting algorithms. The majority of projects utilizing big data analytics have failed due to the obsession with metrics at the expense of capturing the customer’s perspective data, as well as the failure in turning consumer insights into actions. Most of the consumer insights can be captured with qualitative research methods that work with small, even statistically insignificant, sample sizes. Employing qualitative analytics provide some kind of actionable intelligence which acquires understanding to broad questions about the consumer needs in tandem with analytical power. Generating insight, on one hand, requires sound techniques to measure consumers’ engagement more precisely and offers depth analytics to the consumer data story. On the other hand, turning relevant insights into actions requires incorporating actionable intelligence across the business by verify hypotheses based on qualitative findings by using web analytics to see if these axioms apply to a large number of customers. The first component of our visionary approach is dedicated to identifying the relationships between constituents of the healthcare pain points as echoed by the social media conversation in terms of sociographic network where the elements composing these conversations are described as nodes and their interactions as links. In this part, conversation groups of nodes that are heavily connected will be identified representing what we call conversation communities. By identifying these conversation communities several consumer hidden insights can be inferred from using techniques such as visualizing conversation graphs relevant to given pain point, conversation learning from question answering, conversations summaries, conversation timelines, conversation anomalies and other conversation pattern learning techniques. These techniques will identify and learn the patient insights without forgetting from the context of conversation communities, are tagged as “thick data analytics”. Additionally machine learning methods can be used as assistive techniques to learn from the identified thick data and build models around identified thick data. With the use of transfer learning we also can fine tune these models with the arrival of new conversations.

CT follow-up analysis in the negative RT-PCR group is also described. Thirty-three patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by RT-PCR, with 216 lesions upon CT, were included. Demographic information and chest CT imaging features were collected. The average age in the whole study group was 46.9 ± 11.1 years, with 18 males and 15 females. Patients in the positive RT-PCR test group were more likely to have a fever than patients in the negative RT-PCR test group (85.7% vs 50%, P < .05). Lesions in the positive group were more likely to be located in the peripheral area than lesions in the negative group (83.6% vs 68.2%, P < .05). Regarding the appearance of 216 lesions, ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with consolidation (43.2%) was the most common appearance in the negative group, followed by pure GGOs (31.8%), while in the positive group, pure GGOs (32%) and GGOs with interlobular septal thickening (32.8%) were both most frequent, and the difference between them was evident (P < .05). For the follow-up analysis, the largest short-axis of a lesion was smaller upon follow-up (median size 13.6 mm vs 14 mm), albeit by a smaller margin. Pure GGOs decreased in frequency, from 31.3% to 21.3%, while consolidation increased in frequency, from 7.5% to 12.5%.

There is a need to characterize which HCWs are at increased risk of psychological sequela from the pandemic. Methods: HCWs across seven hospitals in New York City were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational digital study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Surveys were obtained daily. Results: Three hundred and sixty-one HCWs were enrolled. Multivariable analysis found New York City COVID-19 case count to be significantly associated with increased longitudinal stress (p=0.008). A non-significant decrease in stress (p=0.23) was observed following COVID-19 diagnosis, though there was a borderline significant increase following the 4-week period after a COVID-19 diagnosis via nasal PCR (p=0.05). Baseline emotional support, baseline quality of life and baseline resilience were associated with decreased longitudinal stress (p<0.001). Baseline resilience and emotional support were found to buffer against stressors, with a significant reduction in stress during the 4-week period after COVID-19 diagnosis observed only in participants in the highest tertial of emotional support and resilience (effect estimate -0.97, p=0.03; estimate -1.78, p=0.006). A significant trend between New York City COVID-19 case count and longitudinal stress was observed only in the high tertial emotional support group (estimate 1.22, p=0.005), and was borderline significant in the high and medium resilience tertials (estimate 1.29, p=0.098; estimate 1.14, p=0.09). Participants in the highest tertial of baseline emotional support and resilience had significantly reduced amplitude and acrophase of the circadian pattern of longitudinally collected heart rate variability. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that low resilience, emotional support, and quality of life identify HCWs at risk of high perceived longitudinal stress secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a distinct physiological stress profile. Assessment of HCWs for these features can identify and permit allocation of psychological support to these at-risk individuals as the COVID-19 pandemic and its psychological effects continue in this vulnerable population.","Hirten, R.

AimThis paper aims to explore how Covid-19 has affected the ability of mental health nurses to deliver care in community and inpatient mental health services in the UK. MethodWe investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental healthcare and mental health service users in the UK, using a mixed methods online survey. A total of 897 nurses across a range of inpatient and community settings participated. DiscussionKey themes within the data explore: new ways of working; remote working; risks of infection/infection control challenges; and the impact on service users. Targeted guidelines are required to support mental health nurses providing care and support during a pandemic to people in severe mental distress, often in unsuitable environments. Implications for PracticeService developments need to occur alongside tailored guidance and support for staff welfare supported by clear leadership. These findings identify areas requiring attention and investment to prepare for future crises and the consequences of the pandemic. Accessible SummaryO_ST_ABSWhat is known on the subject?C_ST_ABSDuring the Covid-19 pandemic there has been research considering the impact on medical healthcare professionals and the mental health needs of the general population. However, limited focus has been placed on mental health services or mental health staff providing care in the community and in hospitals. Whilst nurses make up the largest section of the mental health workforce in the UK, the impact that this pandemic has had on their work has been largely ignored. What the paper adds to existing knowledge?This paper provides a unique insight into the experiences and impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on mental health nurses across a range of community and inpatient settings to understand what has changed in their work and the care they can and do provide during this crisis. This includes exploring how services have changed, the move to remote working, the impact of the protective equipment crisis on nurses, and the difficult working conditions facing those in inpatient settings where there is minimal guidance provided. What are the implications for practice?By understanding the impact the pandemic has had on mental health nursing care, we can understand the gaps in guidance that exist, the challenges being faced, and the impact the crisis has had on care for mental health service users. By doing so we can plan for the ongoing nature of this pandemic as well as the aftermath that the crisis may leave for our service users and workforce alike. Relevance StatementThis paper provides insight into the impact that the Covid-19 pandemic has had on the service and care that mental health nurses are expected to and can provide. As a workforce that often requires ongoing face to face contact with service users, many in serious distress, in inpatient and community settings, it is important that we understand their experiences and the challenges and risks that face this workforce. This will enable us to ensure that future planning, guidance, support and safeguarding can take place during the ongoing and future crises.","Foye, Una; Dalton-Locke, Christian; Harju-Seppanen, Jasmine; Lane, Rebecca; Beams, Lewys; Juan, Norha Vera San; Johnson, Sonia; Simpson, Alan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226472; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226472v1?rss=1,290
631371,Afterword. Going Granular,2021-06-18,"SiRNAs exert their biological effect by guiding the degradation of their cognate mRNA sequence, thereby shutting down the corresponding protein production (gene silencing by RNA interference or RNAi). Due to this property, siRNAs are emerging as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of inherited and acquired diseases, as well as research tools for the elucidation of gene function in both health and disease. Because of their lethality and prevalence, lung diseases have attracted particular attention as targets of siRNA-mediated cures. In addition, lung is accessible to therapeutic agents via multiple routes, e.g., through the nose and the mouth, thus obviating the need for targeting and making it an appealing target for RNAi-based therapeutic strategies. The clinical success of siRNA-mediated interventions critically depends upon the safety and efficacy of the delivery methods and agents. Delivery of siRNAs relevant to lung diseases has been attempted through multiple routes and using various carriers in animal models.

Methods: From 24 February to 7 March 2021 an online cross-sectional survey was conducted with a self-administered COVID-19 vaccine questionnaire among medical staff in Taizhou, China. In total, 1397 interviewees (1,107 women and 290 men) participated in the survey. Results: In our study, 178 (16.1%) women and 23 (7.9%) men reported adverse reactions following their first vaccination, and 169 (15.3%) women and 35 (12.1%) men reported adverse reactions following their second vaccination. After adjusting for confounding factors, adverse reactions to other vaccines, worry about adverse reactions, knowledge of the inactivated vaccine being used in the hospital, taking the vaccine for one's family proactively and receiving an influenza vaccination were significantly related to adverse reactions to both injections in women. In contrast, in men, concerns about adverse reactions independently increased the risk of adverse reactions following either vaccination, and a history of adverse reactions to other vaccines also increased the risk of adverse reactions to both injections. Conclusions: Sex differences in the frequency of reported adverse reactions to an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and potential factors were demonstrated in a sample of medical staff.","Zhu, Jian-Sheng; Zhang, Mei-Xian; Chien, Ching-Wen; Yang, Wei-Ying; Shi, Gui-Feng; Qiu, Shulin; Tung, Tao-Hsin; Chen, Hai-Xiao",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.731593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34568389/,290

The study aim was to describe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and cut-offs for defining long COVID in primary care follow-up patients. METHODS: A retrospective observational study in primary care in Madrid, Spain, was conducted. Data was collected during 6 months (April to September) in 2020, during COVID-19 first wave, from patients ≥ 18 years with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia diagnosed. Variables: sociodemographic, comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms and complications, laboratory test and chest X-ray. Descriptive statistics were used, mean (standard deviation (SD)) and medians (interquartile range (IQR)) respectively. Differences were detected applying X(2) test, Student’s T-test, ANOVA, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis depending on variable characteristics. RESULTS: 155 patients presented pneumonia in day 7.8 from the onset (79.4% were hospitalized, median length of 7.0 days (IQR: 3.0, 13.0)). After discharge, the follow-up lasted 54.0 median days (IQR 42.0, 88.0) and 12.2 mean (SD 6.4) phone calls were registered per patient. The main symptoms and their duration were: cough (41.9%, 12 days), dyspnoea (31.0%, 15 days), asthenia (26.5%, 21 days). Different cut-off points were applied for long COVID and week 4 was considered the best milestone (28.3% of the sample still had symptoms after week 4) versus week 12 (8.3%). Patients who still had symptoms >4 weeks follow-up took place over 81.0 days (IQR: 50.5, 103.0), their symptoms were more prevalent and lasted longer than those ≤ 4 weeks: cough (63.6% 30 days), dyspnoea (54.6%, 46 days), and asthenia (56.8%, 29 days). Embolism was more frequent in patients who still had symptoms >4 weeks than those with symptoms ≤4 weeks (9.1% vs 1.8%, p value 0.034). CONCLUSION: Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia recovered during the first 4 weeks from the beginning of the infection. The cut-off point to define long COVID, as persisting symptoms, should be between 4 to 12 weeks from the onset of the symptoms.","Ares-Blanco, Sara; Pérez Álvarez, Marta; Gefaell Larrondo, Ileana; Muñoz, Cristina; Aguilar Ruiz, Vanesa; Castelo Jurado, Marta; Guisado-Clavero, Marina",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551007/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257604,290
634405,Considerations on the clinical development of COVID-19 vaccine from trial design perspectives,2020-09-29,"Nanotechnology is considered one of the paramount forefronts in science over the last decade. Its versatile implementations and fast-growing demand have paved the way for innovative measures for the synthesis of higher quality nanomaterials. In the early stages, traditional synthesis methods were utilized, and they relied on both carcinogenic chemicals and high energy input for production of nano-sized material. The pollution produced as a result of traditional synthesis methods induces a need for environmentally safer synthesis methods. As the downfalls of climate change become more abundant, the scientific community is persistently seeking solutions to combat the devastation caused by toxic production methods. Green methods for nanomaterial synthesis apply natural biological systems to nanomaterial production. The present review highlights the history of nanoparticle synthesis, starting with traditional methods and progressing towards green methods. Green synthesis is a method just as effective, if not more so, than traditional synthesis; it provides a sustainable approach to nanomaterial manufacturing by using naturally sourced starting materials and relying on low energy processes. The recent use of active molecules in natural biological systems such as bacteria, yeast, algae and fungi report successful results in the synthesis of various nanoparticle systems. Thus, the integration of green synthesis in scientific research and mass production provides a potential solution to the limitations of traditional synthesis methods.","Huston, Matthew; DeBella, Melissa; DiBella, Maria; Gupta, Anisha",Nanomaterials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/nano11082130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34443960/,290

Method: Patient data were obtained from medical records from the North Memorial Health Hospital, Robbinsdale, MN, USA Results: Three patients (two men and one woman, aged 38 - 63) presented with fatigue, cough and fever leading to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome secondary to COVID-19 infection requiring intubation and ventilatory support. Two patients were unresponsive, one with strong eye deviation to the left and the third patient had severe diffuse weakness. MRI in all patients showed findings consistent with ADEM. CSF showed elevated protein in all patients with normal cell count and no evidence of infection, including negative COVID-19 PCR. All three of the patients received Convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19. All patients were treated with intravenous corticosteroids and improved, although two responded minimally. Two patients treated with IVIG showed no further improvement. Conclusion: Neurological complications from COVID-19 are being rapidly recognized. Our three cases highlight the occurrence of ADEM as a postinfectious/immune mediated complication of COVID-19 infection, which may be responsive to corticosteroid treatment.

636365,Enhancing hygiene/antimicrobial properties of polyolefins,2014-03-27,"BACKGROUND: In early childhood allergy prevention (ECAP), parents act on behalf of their children. Parental health literacy and the availability of high-quality information, both online and offline, are crucial for effective ECAP. Recent research highlights three main points. First, parents need sufficient health literacy to discriminate between high-quality and low-quality information. Second, ECAP information behaviors may vary between phases of childhood development and according to individual circumstances. Third, to strengthen user-centeredness of available services, a better overview of parents’ information practices and needs and how they handle uncertainties is required. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore why, how, and when parents search for and apply ECAP-specific health information and which individual (eg, understanding of advice) and organizational challenges (eg, information services, information complexity, and changing recommendations) they perceive and how they handle them. This study also aims to assess the needs and preferences that parents express for future information formats and contents. The findings should inform the practical design of ECAP information as well as formats and channels specific to different parent groups. METHODS: The above-named issues will be explored with parents in four German cities as one element in our efforts to cover the spectrum of perspectives. Based on a mixed methods design, including qualitative and quantitative assessments, the first year serves to prepare focus groups, a piloted focus group guide, a short standardized survey adapted from the European Health Literacy Project, recruitment channels, and the recruitment of participants. After conducting 20 focus groups in the second year, data will be analyzed via a constant comparison method in the third year. Based on this, practice implications on channels (ie, Where?), formats (ie, How?), and contents (ie, What?) of ECAP-specific information will be derived and discussed with parents and associated project partners before its dissemination to relevant ECAP actors (eg, childcare institutions and pediatricians). RESULTS: The study began with preselection of recruitment channels, drafting of recruitment and study information for potential participants, and agreement on a first full version of the guideline. Then, a detailed contact list was compiled of health professionals, administrative and social institutions, and relevant social media channels (N=386) to be approached for assistance in contacting parents. The recruitment was postponed due to COVID-19 and will start in January 2021. CONCLUSIONS: ECAP is a relevant example for assessing how users (ie, parents) handle not only health information but the various and continuous changes, uncertainties, and controversies attached to it. So far, it is unclear how parents implement the respective scientific recommendations and expert advice, which is why this study aims to inform those who communicate with parents about ECAP information.

From three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 28 treated and untreated wastewater composite samples were collected from April 4 to May 2, 2020. In this study, polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) was used through one-step real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for identification of RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was elicited from wastewater composite samples in all inlet samples taken from the three above mentioned cities. The results of outlet samples were as follows: 1) Results from Qom and East Anzali outlets showed no trace of SARS-CoV-2 RNA despite the difference in treatment disinfection method used (chlorine vs. ultraviolet (UV) disinfection). 2. In Tehran, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the outlet samples taken from the modules disinfected by UV. Out of the four samples taken from the modules disinfected by chlorine, two were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA which could have been caused by deficiencies in operation and maintenance. It can be concluded that meeting the standards of operation and maintenance (O&M) in WWTPs can considerably ensure that wastewater does not act as one of the roots of transmission for the disease.","Nasseri, Simin; Yavarian, Jila; Baghani, Abbas Norouzian; Azad, Talat Mokhtari; Nejati, Ahmad; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Hadi, Mahdi; Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra Shafiei; Vakili, Behnam; Vaghefi, Seyed Koushyar Azam; Baghban, Mahtab; Yousefi, Somayeh; Nazmara, Shahrokh; Alimohammadi, Mahmood",J Environ Health Sci Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643658/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40201-021-00629-6,290

Thus, to protect the global population, developing safe and effective vaccines is mandatory to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have similarity and use the same receptor (ACE2), it is important to learn from the development of SARS-CoV-1 vaccines for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Normally vaccine development takes 10–15 years but vaccine development against SARS-CoV2 is going on at a very fast pace resulting in almost breakthrough methods of vaccine development by several research institutions. The whole process of vaccine development including clinical trials gets shortened and may be fast tracked to 15–18 months. Global collaborations and increased research efforts among the scientific community have led to more than 214 candidate vaccines globally. The current review highlights the different approaches and technologies used around the world for the design and development of the vaccines and also focuses on the recent status of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates under development by various institutions to combat the world threat of COVID-19 pandemic.","Belete, Tafere Mulaw",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s288877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500636/,290

Using unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) semantic topic discovery, we identify temporal patterns in the use of credit cards that allow us to quantitatively assess the changes in the behavior of the people under the lockdown measures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. An unsupervised latent topic analysis uncovers the main patterns of credit card transaction activity that explain the behavior of the inhabitants of Santiago City. The approach is non-intrusive because it does not require the collaboration of people for providing the anonymous data. It does not interfere with the actual behavior of the people in the city; hence, it does not introduce any bias. We identify a strong downturn of the economic activity as measured by credit card transactions (down to 70%), and thus of the economic activity, in city sections (communes) that were subjected to lockdown versus communes without lockdown. This change in behavior is confirmed by independent data from mobile phone connectivity. The reduction of activity emerges before the actual lockdowns were enforced, suggesting that the population was spontaneously implementing the required measures for slowing virus propagation.","Muñoz-Cancino, Ricardo; Rios, Sebastian A.; Goic, Marcel; Graña, Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063860/,290

639338,Something to Crow About!,2021,"Eukaryotic mRNAs are 5′ end capped with a 7-methylguanosine, which is important for processing and translation of mRNAs. Cap methyltransferase 1 (CMTR1) catalyzes 2′-O-ribose methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide (N1 2′-O-Me) to mask mRNAs from innate immune surveillance by retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I). Nevertheless, whether this modification regulates gene expression for neuronal functions remains unexplored. Here, we find that knockdown of CMTR1 impairs dendrite development independent of secretory cytokines and RIG-I signaling. Using transcriptomic analyses, we identify altered gene expression related to dendrite morphogenesis instead of RIG-I-activated interferon signaling, such as decreased calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2α (Camk2α). In line with these molecular changes, dendritic complexity in CMTR1-insufficient neurons is rescued by ectopic expression of CaMK2α but not by inactivation of RIG-I signaling. We further generate brain-specific CMTR1-knockout mice to validate these findings in vivo. Our study reveals the indispensable role of CMTR1-catalyzed N1 2′-O-Me in gene regulation for brain development.","Lee, Yen-Lurk; Kung, Fan-Che; Lin, Chia-Hsuan; Huang, Yi-Shuian",Cell Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720312584; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086056/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720312584,290

639831,Covid and the colorectal surgeon - on Rumsfeld and black swans,2021,"BACKGROUND: From the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, pregnant women have been considered at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality. However, data on hospitalized pregnant women show that the symptom profile and risk factors for severe disease are similar to those among women who are not pregnant, although preterm birth, Cesarean delivery, and stillbirth may be more frequent and vertical transmission is possible. Limited data are available for the cohort of pregnant women that gave rise to these hospitalized cases, hindering our ability to quantify risk of COVID-19 sequelae for pregnant women in the community. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that pregnant women in community differ in their COVID-19 symptoms profile and disease severity compared to non-pregnant women. This was assessed in two community-based cohorts of women aged 18–44 years in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. STUDY DESIGN: This observational study used prospectively collected longitudinal (smartphone application interface) and cross-sectional (web-based survey) data. Participants in the discovery cohort were drawn from 400,750 UK, Sweden and US women (79 pregnant who tested positive) who self-reported symptoms and events longitudinally via their smartphone, and a replication cohort drawn from 1,344,966 USA women (162 pregnant who tested positive) cross-sectional self-reports samples from the social media active user base. The study compared frequencies of symptoms and events, including self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing and differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women who were hospitalized and those who recovered in the community. Multivariable regression was used to investigate disease severity and comorbidity effects. RESULTS: Pregnant and non-pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection drawn from these community cohorts were not different with respect to COVID-19-related severity. Pregnant women were more likely to have received SARS-CoV-2 testing than non-pregnant, despite reporting fewer clinical symptoms. Pre-existing lung disease was most closely associated with the severity of symptoms in pregnant hospitalized women. Heart and kidney diseases and diabetes were additional factors of increased risk. The most frequent symptoms among all non-hospitalized women were anosmia [63% in pregnant, 92% in non-pregnant] and headache [72%, 62%]. Cardiopulmonary symptoms, including persistent cough [80%] and chest pain [73%], were more frequent among pregnant women who were hospitalized. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, were different among pregnant and non-pregnant women who developed severe outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Although pregnancy is widely considered a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes, and was associated with higher propensity for testing, the profile of symptom characteristics and severity in our community-based cohorts were comparable to those observed among non-pregnant women, except for the gastrointestinal symptoms. Consistent with observations in non-pregnant populations, comorbidities such as lung disease and diabetes were associated with an increased risk of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. Pregnant women with pre-existing conditions require careful monitoring for the evolution of their symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Molteni, Erika; Astley, Christina M.; Ma, Wenjie; Sudre, Carole H; Magee, Laura A.; Murray, Benjamin; Fall, Tove; Gomez, Maria F.; Tsereteli, Neli; Franks, Paul W.; Brownstein, John S.; Davies, Richard; Wolf, Jonathan; Spector, Tim D; Ourselin, Sebastien; Steves, Claire J; Chan, Andrew T; Modat, Marc",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839787/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.17.20161760v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.17.20161760,290

640011,Estimating Incidence Curves of Several Infections Using Symptom Surveillance Data,2011-08-24,"“The bacterial vaginosis syndrome” has significant adverse effects for women and babies, including preterm birth and increased risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections and HIV. Currently, the gold standard for diagnosis is Gram stain microscopy of vaginal secretions, which is not readily available, is somewhat subjective, and does not differentiate between the likely different subtypes of vaginal dysbioses that may have different etiologies, microbiology, responses to antibiotics, and phenotypic outcomes. With new information from molecular-based, cultivation-independent studies, there is increasing interest in the use of molecular techniques for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. We reviewed the current evidence on and the rationale behind the use of molecular techniques for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. We found a number of commercially available molecular diagnostic tests, a few of which have US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or Conformité Européenne in vitro diagnostic (CE-IVD) approval, and we have compared their performance with respect to sensitivities and specificities. Molecular-based tests have the advantage of objectivity, quantification, detection of fastidious organisms, and validity for self-obtained vaginal swabs. The performance of the molecular tests against standard microscopy is impressive, but further education of users on interpretation is needed. Bacterial vaginosis is the major cause of vaginal dysbiosis and should be recognized for the threat it is to women’s genital tract health. Quantitative assessment of microbial abundance, the diversity of other organisms present, specific primers for gene sequence regions, and clades and biovars of target microbes should be recognized and incorporated into future molecular diagnostic tests to better differentiate between vaginal eubiosis and dysbiosis.","Lamont, Ronald F; van den Munckhof, Ellen HA; Luef, Birgitte Møller; Vinter, Christina Anne; Jørgensen, Jan Stener",Fac Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659953/; https://doi.org/10.12703/r/9-21,290

METHODS: COVID-19 hospital admissions data from the Premier Healthcare Database were evaluated to estimate hospital costs, length of stay (LOS), and discharge status. Adult COVID-19 patients (ICD-10-CM: U07.1) hospitalized in the US from April 1 to December 31, 2020, were identified. Analyses were stratified by patient and hospital characteristics, levels of care during hospitalization, and discharge status. Factors associated with changes in costs, LOS, and discharge status were estimated using regression analyses. Monthly trends in costs, LOS, and discharge status were examined. RESULTS: Of the 247,590 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 49% were women, 76% were aged ≥ 50, and 36% were admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Overall median hospital LOS, cost, and cost/day were 6 days, US$11,267, and $1772, respectively; overall median ICU LOS, cost, and cost/day were 5 days, $13,443, and $2902, respectively. Patients requiring mechanical ventilation had the highest hospital and ICU median costs ($47,454 and $41,510) and LOS (16 and 11 days), respectively. Overall, 14% of patients died in hospital and 52% were discharged home. Older age, Black and Caucasian race, hypertension and obesity, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and discharge to long-term care facilities were major drivers of costs, LOS, and risk of death. Admissions in December had significantly lower median hospital and ICU costs and LOS compared to April. CONCLUSION: The burden from COVID-19 in terms of hospital and ICU costs and LOS has been substantial, though significant decreases in cost and LOS and increases in the share of hospital discharges to home were observed from April to December 2020. These estimates will be useful for inputs to economic models, disease burden forecasts, and local healthcare resource planning.

641442,Prediction of individual COVID-19 diagnosis using baseline demographics and lab data,2021-07-06,"OBJECTIVE: The intent of this study was to examine the recovery of individuals who had been hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the year following their discharge from the hospital. Parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. In addition, we explored the incidence of femoral head necrosis in some of the individuals recovering from SARS. METHODS: The subjects of this study were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in Beijing, China. They were tested regularly for serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody and lung function and were given chest X-rays and/or high resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) examinations at the Chinese PLA General Hospital during the 12 months that followed their release from the hospital. Those individuals who were found to have lung diffusion abnormities (transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide [D(L)CO] < 80% of predicted value [pred]) received regular lung function tests and HRCT examinations in the follow-up phase in order to document the changes in their lung condition. Some patients who complained of joint pain were given magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of their femoral heads. FINDINGS: Of all the subjects, 81.2% (311 of 383 patients) tested positive for serum SARS-CoV IgG. Of those testing positive, 27.3% (85 of 311 patients) were suffering from lung diffusion abnormities (D(L)CO < 80% pred) and 21.5% (67 of 311 patients) exhibited lung fibrotic changes. In the 12 month duration of this study, all of the 40 patients with lung diffusion abnormities who were examined exhibited some improvement of lung function and fibrosis detected by radiography. Of the individuals receiving MRI examinations, 23.1% (18 of 78 patients) showed signs of femoral head necrosis. INTERPRETATION: The lack of sero-positive SARS-CoV in some individuals suggests that there may have been some misdiagnosed cases among the subjects included in this study. Of those testing positive, the serum levels of SARS-CoV IgG antibody decreased significantly during the 12 months after hospital discharge. Additionally, we found that the individuals who had lung fibrosis showed some spontaneous recovery. Finally, some of the subjects developed femoral head necrosis.","Xie, Lixin; Liu, Youning; Fan, Baoxing; Xiao, Yueyong; Tian, Qing; Chen, Liangan; Zhao, Hong; Chen, Weijun",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15638943/,290

641992,The Reply,2021-06-25,"Burnout adversely affects healthcare researchers, their place of employment, and the production of valuable research. It is directly associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety. Having an easily employed and reliable measure of depression and anxiety in healthcare researchers is important if burnout is to be diminished. Doodling may be one such measure. Doodling became a possible indicator based on unexpected outcomes associated with one diverse and voluntary health narrative research group where doodling was introduced. The result, with respect to casual, self-reported levels of depression and anxiety, ranged from researchers expressing low levels of distress to those revealing clinical diagnoses of depression and anxiety. Changes to doodling execution and content, and their effect on the doodler—metrics previously unmentioned in the literature—hold promise for evaluating depression and anxiety levels of researchers. Maligned in academic settings with increasingly punitive outcomes, doodling should be reassessed as a possible indicator of internal states of distress, dysphoria, depression, and anxiety based on this University of Toronto Health Narratives Research Group result of doodling. Under certain well-defined conditions, variations in doodling may serve as a measure of change in these internal states and, therefore, act as an aid in reducing burnout.","Nash, Carol",Cult Med Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136278/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11013-020-09690-6,290
643128,An agent based modelling approach to study lockdown efficacy for infectious disease spreads,2020-06-24,"INTRODUCTION: People with pre-existing mental health conditions may have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions. In this study, we compared psychological outcomes, experiences and sources of stress over the pandemic lockdown in New Zealanders with and without a previous diagnosis of mental illness. METHODS: Two online surveys were conducted in New Zealand over the level 4 lockdown in April 2020 measuring psychological distress, anxiety, well-being, suicidality, alcohol use and subjective experiences. They included 3389 participants, of whom 18.4% reported having been previously diagnosed with a mental illness. RESULTS: During the lockdown, people previously diagnosed with a mental illness had about twice the risk of reporting moderate-high levels of psychological distress (K10 â©¾ 12), at least moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7 â©¾ 10) and poor well-being (WHO-5 â©½ 12). They reported increased alcohol use and were about four times as likely to have experienced suicidal thoughts with 3% reporting having made a suicide attempt over the lockdown period. They reported less satisfaction with, and poorer relationships with people in their 'bubble', reduced social contacts and greater loneliness. They also reported higher levels of health and financial concerns. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand, people with a previous diagnosis of a mental illness were at increased risk of detrimental psychological outcomes. This highlights the importance of recognising this and the challenges people face in pandemics.","Bell, Caroline; Williman, Jonathan; Beaglehole, Ben; Stanley, James; Jenkins, Matthew; Gendall, Philip; Rapsey, Charlene; Every-Palmer, Susanna",Aust N Z J Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211034317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313158/,290
643151,Chapter 779 Birnavirus VP4 Processing Endopeptidase,2013-12-31,"The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to a pandemic infecting more than two million people worldwide in less than four months, posing a major threat to healthcare systems. This is compounded by the shortage of available tests causing numerous healthcare workers to unnecessarily self-isolate. We provide a roadmap instructing how a research institute can be repurposed in the midst of this crisis, in collaboration with partner hospitals and an established diagnostic laboratory, harnessing existing expertise in virus handling, robotics, PCR, and data science to derive a rapid, high throughput diagnostic testing pipeline for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patients with suspected COVID-19. The pipeline is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from combined nose-throat swabs and endotracheal secretions/ bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Notably, it relies on a series of in-house buffers for virus inactivation and the extraction of viral RNA, thereby reducing the dependency on commercial suppliers at times of global shortage. We use a commercial RT-PCR assay, from BGI, and results are reported with a bespoke online web application that integrates with the healthcare digital system. This strategy facilitates the remote reporting of thousands of samples a day with a turnaround time of under 24 hours, universally applicable to laboratories worldwide.","Aitken, J.; Ambrose, K.; Barrell, S.; Beale, R.; Bineva-Todd, G.; Biswas, D.; Byrne, R.; Caidan, S.; Cherepanov, P.; Churchward, L.; Clark, G.; Crawford, M.; Cubitt, L.; Dearing, V.; Earl, C.; Edwards, A.; Ekin, C.; Fidanis, E.; Gaiba, A.; Gamblin, S.; Gandhi, S.; Goldman, J.; Goldstone, R.; Grant, P.

643720,Brief Summary of Potential SARS-CoV-2 Prophylactic and Treatment Drugs in the Emergency Department,2020-03-31,"To achieve proper diagnosis of dogs based on acute clinical symptoms and poorly preserved field samples taken from animals that died due to canine distemper (CD), a new differential diagnostic test has been developed based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, more than 150 samples collected from dogs showing respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological signs suggesting canine distemper virus (CDV) infection were examined. The samples consisted of urine, blood and nasal swabs collected from clinically ill patients, sent to our laboratory by clinicians from various veterinary clinics throughout Hungary. Various organs collected during the necropsy of dogs with pathological changes that suggested CDV infection were also included. Three distinct PCRs were designed. For diagnostic purposes, a primer pair specific to a 409 bases-long segment within the conservative part of the large polymerase region (L) of the CDV genome was designed. Using this test, out of the 150 analyzed samples, 46 (30.66%) proved to be positive for CDV, indicating that CDV still represents a high risk to the canine population in Hungary. For the phylogenetical analysis, a primer pair that completely encompasses the hemagglutinin (H) gene of the CDV genome was designed. The amplicons of this region were sequenced in both directions using the appropriate primers. Our results indicate that several different CDV genotypes are currently present in Hungary. Nine of the analyzed Hungarian strains turned out to belong to the so-called Arctic group of CDVs, and were most closely related to non-European strains from North America, China and Greenland, as well as to the phocine distemper virus 2 (PDV-2) isolated from Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica). One of the Hungarian strains showed high similarity to other European isolates from Denmark, Germany, Italy and Turkey, as well as to other isolates from geographically more distant regions, such as the USA. Three Hungarian strains seem to join a new cluster that is formed by only a couple of strains, one isolated from a mink in Denmark, and another from a dog in North America. Using a third set of primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay has also been designed for the fast and reliable differentiation of the wild-type CDVs from the vaccine strains.","Demeter, Zoltán; Lakatos, Béla; Palade, Elena Alina; Kozma, Tamás; Forgách, Petra; Rusvai, Miklós",Vet Microbiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113507000685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17350769/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113507000685,290

646757,On the optimal control of coronavirus (2019-nCov) mathematical model; a numerical approach,2020-09-25,"The gut-brain axis describes a complex interplay between the central nervous system and organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Sensory neurons of dorsal root and nodose ganglia, neurons of the autonomic nervous system, and immune cells collect and relay information about the status of the gut to the brain. A critical component in this bi-directional communication system is the vagus nerve which is essential for coordinating the immune system’s response to the activities of commensal bacteria in the gut and to pathogenic strains and their toxins. Local control of gut function is provided by networks of neurons in the enteric nervous system also called the ‘gut-brain’. One element common to all of these gut-brain systems is the expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These ligand-gated ion channels serve myriad roles in the gut-brain axis including mediating fast synaptic transmission between autonomic pre- and postganglionic neurons, modulation of neurotransmitter release from peripheral sensory and enteric neurons, and modulation of cytokine release from immune cells. Here we review the role of nicotinic receptors in the gut-brain axis with a focus on the interplay of these receptors with the gut microbiome and their involvement in dysregulation of gut function and inflammatory bowel diseases.","Rueda Ruzafa, Lola; Cedillo, José Luis; Hone, Arik J.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18031189; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33572734/,290
647048,Risk assessment for airborne disease transmission by poly-pathogen aerosols,2021-04-08,"OBJECTIVE: To examine rapidly emerging ventilator technologies during coronavirus disease 2019 and highlight the role of CRISIS, a novel 3D printed solution. DATA SOURCES: Published articles, literature, and government guidelines that describe and review emergency use ventilator technologies. STUDY SELECTION: Literature was chosen from peer-reviewed journals and articles were limited to recent publications. DATA EXTRACTION: All information regarding ventilator technology was extracted from primary sources. DATA SYNTHESIS: Analysis of technology and relevance to coronavirus disease 2019 physiology was collectively synthesized by all authors. CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has placed massive stress on global supply chains for ventilators due to the critical damage the virus causes to lung function. There is an urgent need to increase supply, as hospitals become inundated with patients requiring intensive respiratory support. Coalitions across the United States have formed in order to create new devices that can be manufactured quickly, with minimal resources, and provide consistent and safe respiratory support. Due to threats to public health and the vulnerability of the U.S. population, the Food and Drug Administration released Emergency Use Authorizations for new or repurposed devices, shortening the approval timeline from years to weeks. The list of authorized devices varies widely in complexity, from automated bagging techniques to repurposed sleep apnea machines. Three-dimensional printed ventilators, such as “CRISIS,” propose a potential solution to increase the available number of vents for the United States and abroad, one that is dynamic and able to absorb the massive influx of hospitalized patients for the foreseeable future.","Nacharaju, Deepthi; Menzel, Whitney; Fontaine, Evan; Child, Dennis; El Haddi, S.

Methods: The measurement results obtained by the Regional Environmental Protection Inspectorate (REPI) in Kraków and our deposited particulate-matter (PM) analysis, as well as United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) methodology of risk assessment were used in the study. Results: Annual pollutant contents kept decreasing, with the exception of O(3). However, the permissible annual levels were exceeded in the cases of PM10, PM2.5, and NO(2). Increased contents of SO(2), CO, C(6)H(6), PM10, and PM2.5, as well as of As, Pb, Cd, Ni, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM particles during winter months indicated that house heating was the source of pollution. Due to no significant change in the monthly NO(2) contents, this measurement was used as an indicator of traffic sources of pollution. In winter months, the allowable 24 h PM2.5 and PM10 contents were constantly exceeded. PM was identified as the most significant air pollutant. Enrichment factors revealed that deposited PM was enriched with heavy metals. The potential ecological risk (ERI) was determined to be very high for Cd, considerable for Zn, and low for As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Tl.

We aimed to investigate the independent impact of COVID-19 infection on the mortality of these patients. Healthcare databases were systematically searched over 2-weeks from 1st–14th November 2020 to identify eligible studies assessing the impact of COVID-19 on hip fracture patients. Meta-analysis of proportion was performed to obtain pooled values of prevalence, incidence and case fatality rate of hip fracture patients with COVID-19 infection. 30-day mortality, excess mortality and all-cause mortality were analysed using a mixed-effects model. 22 studies reporting 4015 patients were identified out of which 2651 (66%) were assessed during the pandemic. An excess mortality of 10% was seen for hip fractures treated during the pandemic (OR 2.00, p = 0.007), in comparison to the pre-pandemic controls (5%). Estimated mortality of COVID-19 positive hip fracture patients was four-fold (RR 4.59, p < 0.0001) and 30-day mortality was 38.0% (HR 4.73, p < 0.0001).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) was associated with higher severity and mortality of COVID‐19. We aimed to evaluate the effects of comorbidities and medications in addition to determining the association between AKI, antibiotics against coinfections (AAC) and outcomes of patients. We conducted a retrospective study on adult patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 in a tertiary center. Our primary outcomes were the incidence rate of AKI based on comorbidities and medications. The secondary outcome was to determine mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and prolonged hospitalization by AKI and AAC. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression method was used to explore predictive effects of AKI and AAC on outcomes. Out of 854 included participants, 118 patients developed AKI in whom, 57 used AAC and 61 did not. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities in patients developed AKI. AAC, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, and corticosteroids had significant higher rate of administration in patients developed AKI. AAC were associated with higher deaths (odds ratio [OR] = 5.13; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3–8.78) and ICU admission (OR = 5.87; 95%CI: 2.81–12.27), while AKI had higher OR for prolonged hospitalization (3.37; 95%CI: 1.76–6.45).

652633,Global dynamics for a Filippov epidemic system with imperfect vaccination,2020-11-30,"Developing or independently evaluating algorithms in biomedical research is difficult because of restrictions on access to clinical data. Access is restricted because of privacy concerns, the proprietary treatment of data by institutions (fueled in part by the cost of data hosting, curation, and distribution), concerns over misuse, and the complexities of applicable regulatory frameworks. The use of cloud technology and services can address many of the barriers to data sharing. For example, researchers can access data in high performance, secure, and auditable cloud computing environments without the need for copying or downloading. An alternative path to accessing data sets requiring additional protection is the model-to-data approach. In model-to-data, researchers submit algorithms to run on secure data sets that remain hidden. Model-to-data is designed to enhance security and local control while enabling communities of researchers to generate new knowledge from sequestered data. Model-to-data has not yet been widely implemented, but pilots have demonstrated its utility when technical or legal constraints preclude other methods of sharing. We argue that model-to-data can make a valuable addition to our data sharing arsenal, with 2 caveats. First, model-to-data should only be adopted where necessary to supplement rather than replace existing data-sharing approaches given that it requires significant resource commitments from data stewards and limits scientific freedom, reproducibility, and scalability. Second, although model-to-data reduces concerns over data privacy and loss of local control when sharing clinical data, it is not an ethical panacea. Data stewards will remain hesitant to adopt model-to-data approaches without guidance on how to do so responsibly. To address this gap, we explored how commitments to open science, reproducibility, security, respect for data subjects, and research ethics oversight must be re-evaluated in a model-to-data context.","Suver, Christine; Thorogood, Adrian; Doerr, Megan; Wilbanks, John; Knoppers, Bartha",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/18087; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32540846/,290

Antibody (Ab) levels to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) protein were measured at +1, +3, +6 months after nasal swabs became PCR-negative. Forty-five patients (9 FL, 8 DLBCL, 8 CLD, 10 MM, 10 MDS/MPS) and 18 controls were studied. Mean anti-N and anti-S-Ab levels were similar between HM patients and controls, and shared the same behavior, with anti-N Ab levels declining at +6 months and anti-S-Ab remaining stable. Seroconversion rates were lower in HM patients than in controls. In lymphoma patients mean Ab levels and seroconversion rates were lower than in other HM patients, primarily because all nine patients who had received rituximab within 6 months before COVID-19 failed to produce anti-N and anti-S-Ab. Only one patient requiring hematological treatment after COVID-19 lost seropositivity after 6 months. No reinfections were observed.

655172,The emerging landscape of circular RNAs in immunity: breakthroughs and challenges,2020-07-10,"The non-coding regions found at the 5' and 3' ends of alphavirus genomes regulate viral gene expression, replication, translation and virus-host interactions, which have significant implications for viral evolution, host range, and pathogenesis. The functions of these non-coding regions are mediated by a combination of linear sequence and structural elements. The capped 5' untranslated region (UTR) contains promoter elements, translational regulatory sequences that modulate dependence on cellular translation factors, and structures that help to avoid innate immune defenses. The polyadenylated 3' UTR contains highly conserved sequence elements for viral replication, binding sites for cellular miRNAs that determine cell tropism, host range, and pathogenesis, and conserved binding regions for a cellular protein that influences viral RNA stability. Nonetheless, there are additional conserved elements in non-coding regions of the virus (e.g., the repeated sequence elements in the 3' UTR) whose function remains obscure. Thus, key questions remain as to the function of these short yet influential untranslated segments of alphavirus RNAs.","Hyde, Jennifer L.; Chen, Rubing; Trobaugh, Derek W.; Diamond, Michael S.; Weaver, Scott C.; Klimstra, William B.; Wilusz, Jeffrey",Virus Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.01.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016817021500026X; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S016817021500026X; https://manuscript.elsevier.com/S016817021500026X/pdf/S016817021500026X.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25630058/,290

In spite of several outbreaks in the very recent years, no vaccine against this deadly virus is developed yet. In this study, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV was analyzed through Computational Immunology approach to identify the antigenic determinants (epitopes). In order to do so, the sequences of S glycoprotein that belong to different geographical regions were aligned to observe the conservancy of MERS-CoV RBD. The immune parameters of this region were determined using different in silico tools and Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). Molecular docking study was also employed to check the affinity of the potential epitope towards the binding cleft of the specific HLA allele. The N-terminus RBD (S367-S606) of S glycoprotein was found to be conserved among all the available strains of MERS-CoV. Based on the lower IC(50) value, a total of eight potential T-cell epitopes and 19 major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class-I alleles were identified for this conserved region. A 9-mer epitope CYSSLILDY displayed interactions with the maximum number of MHC class-I molecules and projected the highest peak in the B-cell antigenicity plot which concludes that it could be a better choice for designing an epitope based peptide vaccine against MERSCoV considering that it must undergo further in vitro and in vivo experiments. Moreover, in molecular docking study, this epitope was found to have a significant binding affinity of -8.5 kcal/mol towards the binding cleft of the HLA-C*12:03 molecule.","ali, Mohammad Tuhin; Morshed, Mohammed Monzur; Gazi, Md.

Italy has been one of the most affected countries after China. North Italian regions, such as Lombardia and Veneto, had an abnormally large number of cases. COVID-19 patients management requires availability of sufficiently large number of Intensive Care Units (ICUs) beds. Resources shortening is a critical issue when the number of COVID-19 severe cases are higher than the available resources. This is also the case at a regional scale. We analysed Italian data at regional level with the aim to: (i) support health and government decision-makers in gathering rapid and efficient decisions on increasing health structures capacities (in terms of ICU slots) and (ii) define a geographic model to plan emergency and future COVID-19 patients management using reallocating them among health structures.

Our aim was to analyze the effectiveness of safinamide on sleep and daytime sleepiness in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: SAFINONMOTOR is a prospective open-label single-arm study conducted in 5 centers from Spain. In this analysis, a secondary objective of the study, the score in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at V1 (baseline) and V4 (6 months ± 1 month) were compared. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included between May/2019 and February/2020 (age 68.5 ± 9.12 years; 58% women; 6.4 ± 5.1 years from diagnosis). At 6 months, 44 patients completed the follow-up (88%). The PSQI total score was reduced by 19.8% (from 10.43 ± 4.02 at V1 to 8.36 ± 4.41 at V4; p = 0.001). By domains, improvement was observed in subjective sleep quality (PSQI-C1; − 23.9%; p = 0.009), sleep latency (PSQI-C2; − 25%; p = 0.025), sleep duration (PSQI-C3; − 40%; p = 0.001), and habitual sleep efficiency (PSQI-C4; − 25.9%; p = 0.023). A significant reduction (− 24.7%) in the ESS total score from V1 to V4 was observed as well (from 9.20 ± 5.64 to 6.93 ± 5.11; p = 0.012). Specifically, the improvement in daytime sleepiness was observed in sitting and reading (p = 0.024) and sitting inactive in a public space (p = 0.027). A total of 21 adverse events in 11 patients (22%) were reported, 5 of which were severe (not related to safinamide).

660503,Beta testing the monkey model,2021,"Compared with other deadly diseases, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious with a relatively low mortality rate. Although critical cases account for only 5% of cases, the mortality rate for the same is nearly 50%. Therefore, the key to the COVID-19 treatment is to effectively treat severe patients and reduce the transition from severe to critical cases. A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate outcomes of treatment in patients with severe and critical COVID-19 admitted to a COVID-19 special hospital in Wuhan, China. A total of 75 severe and critical COVID-19 patients were admitted and treated with immunomodulation as the main strategy combined with anti-inflammatory therapy and appropriate anticoagulation. Leukocyte levels in patients with 7-14 days of onset to diagnosis were significantly lower than in those with >14 days. Higher levels of globulin and D-dimer and lower lymphocyte levels were found in the older age group (>65 years) than in the middle-aged group (50-64 years). Patients with comorbidity had higher levels of inflammatory indicators. After treatment, 65 (86.67%) patients were cured, 7 (9.33%) had improved, and 3 (4.00%) had died. Median hospitalization duration was 23 days. Fatal cases showed continuously increased levels of globulin, dehydrogenase (LDH), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), D-dimer, and cytokines during treatment. Time from onset to diagnosis, age, and comorbidity are important influencing factors on treatment effects. The occurrence of immunosuppression, “cytokine storm,” and thrombosis may be an important cause of death in severely infected cases. In conclusion, high cure rate and low mortality suggested that immunomodulation combined with anti-inflammatory therapy and appropriate anticoagulant therapy is a good strategy for treatment of patients with severe and critical COVID-19.","Li, Mingliang; Zhu, Donglin; Yang, Jianghua; Yan, Ling; Xiong, Zhiyong; Lu, Jiahai; Bi, Xiaogang; Xi, Yun; Chen, Zeliang",Mediators Inflamm,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9924542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602859/,290

METHODS: Retrospectively, ten children with confirmed COVID-19 in the Jinan Infectious Disease Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University were enrolled between January 23, 2020 to March 9, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of the children were analyzed. RT-PCR assays were performed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in the respiratory tract and fecal specimens in the follow-up after discharge. RESULTS: Among ten patients, five (50%) were asymptomatic and five (50%) showed mild symptoms of respiratory illness. The average age of asymptomatic children was younger than that of symptomatic children (p = 0.03). The decreases in white blood cell (WBC) (p = 0.03) and lymphocyte (p = 0.03) counts were more severe in symptomatic patients than those in asymptomatic patients. During the follow-up examination after discharge, seven out of ten patients contained SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in their fecal specimens, despite all patients showed negative results in respiratory tract specimens. One out of those seven patients relapsed. The median time from onset to being negative results in respiratory tract and fecal specimens was 9 days and 34.43 days, respectively.

The amount of regularity infers on the unpredictability of fluctuations. The t-test and F-test are performed on estimated LLE and ApEn. In total, 36 statistical tests are performed to check for differences between time periods (pre- versus during COVID-19 pandemic samples) on the one hand, as well as check for differences between markets (cryptocurrencies versus stocks), on the other hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic period it was found that (a) the level of stability in cryptocurrency markets has significantly diminished while the irregularity level significantly augmented, (b) the level of stability in international equity markets has not changed but gained more irregularity, (c) cryptocurrencies became more volatile, (d) the variability in stability and irregularity in equities has not been affected, (e) cryptocurrency and stock markets exhibit a similar degree of stability in price dynamics, whilst finally (f) cryptocurrency exhibit a low level of regularity compared to international equity markets. We find that cryptos showed more instability and more irregularity during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to international stock markets.

We examined: i) the psychosocial patterning of positive changes, ii) the psychosocial processes by which positive change was realised, and worked with partner organizations to share our insights. Method: A sequential multi-method design included an online survey (n=2445) assessing positive changes in sleep and physical activity patterns, socio-demographics, mood, social support, coping, and resilience, with multivariate logistic regression analysis. We also employed interviews with a purposive diverse sub-sample of people self-reporting high levels of positive change (n=48) and used thematic analysis. Finally, partnership work translated insights into positive change-sharing targeted resources. Results: The survey identified positive change was significantly patterned by age, gender and vulnerability to COVID-19. Higher positive reframing and higher active coping were associated with higher levels of cross-domain positive change. Higher symptoms of depression, planning, and self-distraction were associated with less cross-domain positive change.

Surviving animals re-challenged with virus 22 days after the primary infection were protected from death, indicating that mDEF201 did not compromise the immune response against the initial infection. Post-exposure therapy was given between 6–24 h after vaccinia virus exposure and protection was afforded by a 10(8) dose of mDEF201 given at 24 h, whereas a 10(7) dose was effective up to 12 h. Comparisons were made of the ability of mDEF201, given either 28 or 1 day prior to infection, to inhibit tissue virus titers and lung infection parameters. Lung, liver, and spleen virus titers were inhibited to nearly the same extent by either treatment, as were lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores (indicators of pneumonitis). Lung virus titers were significantly (>100-fold) lower than in the placebo group, and the other infection parameters in mDEF201 treated mice were nearly at baseline. In contrast, viral titers and lung infection parameters were high in the placebo group on day 5 of the infection.

Several trials testing a variety of therapeutics are on-going. Some in-vitro studies found the anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), are effective against COVID19. However, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical trials in humans have produced conflicting findings on the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Guidelines vary considerably and are hotly debated at political and scientific levels. Therefore, it has become necessary to provide a summary of the effectiveness and safety of these drugs in treating COVID19 infection, using an overview of the existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Objective To synthesize the findings presented in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as to update the evidence using a meta-analysis in evaluating the efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ with or without Azithromycin for the treatment of COVID19 infection. Methods The design of this meta-review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Systematic Reviews including harms checklist (PRIO-harms). A comprehensive search included several electronic databases in identifying all systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as experimental studies which investigated the efficacy and safety of CQ, HCQ with or without antibiotics as COVID19 treatment. Manual searches of the reference list of all included studies and a citation search of the top 20 papers supplemented the search. Findings from the systematic reviews and meta-analyses were reported using a structured summary including tables and forest plots. The updated meta-analysis of experimental studies was carried out using the distributional-assumption-free quality effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool for reviews and the MethodologicAl STandard for Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale for the experimental studies. The main outcomes for both the meta-review and the updated meta-analysis were; mortality, transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), intubation or the need for mechanical ventilation, worsening of illness, viral clearance and the occurrence of adverse events. Results A total of 13 reviews with 40 primary studies comprising 113,000 participants were included. Most of the primary studies were observational (n=27) and the rest were experimental studies. Two meta-analyses reported a high risk of mortality with similar ORs of 2.5 for HCQ with Azithromycin. However, four other meta-analyses reported contradictory results with two reporting a high risk of mortality (OR ~ 2.2 to 3.0) and the other two reporting no significant association between HCQ with mortality. Most reviews reported that HCQ with or without Azithromycin had no significant effect on virological cure, disease exacerbation or the risk of transfer to the ICU, need for intubation or mechanical ventilation. After exclusion of studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria, the updated meta-analysis contained eight experimental studies (7 RCTs and 1 quasi-experimental trial), with a total of 5279 participants of whom 1856 were on either CQ/HCQ or combined with Azithromycin. CQ/HCQ with or without Azithromycin was significantly associated with a higher risk of adverse events (RR 5.7, 95%CI 2.4-13.7, I2 =55%, n = 5 studies). HCQ was not effective in reducing mortality (RR 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.2, I2 =0%, n=6 studies), transfer to the ICU, intubation or need for mechanical ventilation (RR 1.1, 95%CI 0.9-1.4, I2 =0%, n=3 studies) virological cure (RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.9-1.2, I2 =55%, n=5 studies) nor disease exacerbation (RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.3-5.0, I2 =29%, n=3 studies). Conclusion There is conclusive evidence that CQ and HCQ, with or without Azithromycin are not effective in treating COVID-19 or its exacerbation.","Chivese, T.; Musa, O. A.

665491,Plant in vitro Culture Technologies; A Promise Into Factories of Secondary Metabolites Against COVID-19,2021-03-12,"Background Neuropathology caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been reported across several studies. The characterisation of the spatial distribution of these pathology remains critical to assess long and short-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19. To this end, Mathematical models can be used to characterise the location and aetiologies underlying COVID-19-related neuropathology. Method We performed a systematic review of the literature to quantify the locations of small neurological events identified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among COVID-19 patients. Neurological events were localised into the Desikan-Killiany grey and white matter atlases. A mathematical network diffusion model was then used to test whether the spatial distribution of neurological events could be explained via a linear spread through the structural connectome of the brain. Findings We identified 35 articles consisting of 123 patients that assessed the spatial distribution of small neurological events among COVID-19 patients. Of these, 91 patients had grey matter changes, 95 patients had white matter changes and 72 patients had confirmed cerebral microbleeds. White matter events were observed within 14 of 42 white matter bundles from the IIT atlas. The highest proportions (26%) of events were observed within the bilateral corticospinal tracts. The splenium and middle of the corpus callosum were affected in 14% and 9% of the cases respectively. Grey matter events were spatially distributed in the 41 brain regions within the Desikan-Killiany atlas. The highest proportions (~10%) of the events were observed in areas including the bilateral superior temporal, precentral, and lateral occipital cortices. Sub-cortical events were most frequently identified in the Pallidum. The application of a mathematical network diffusion model suggested that the spatial pattern of the small neurological events in COVID-19 can be modelled with a linear diffusion of spread from epicentres in the bilateral cerebellum and basal ganglia (Pearsons r=0.41, p<0.001, corrected). Interpretation To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically characterise the spatial distribution of small neurological events in COVID-19 patients and test whether the spatial distribution of these events can be explained by a linear diffusion spread model. The location of neurological events is consistent with commonly identified neurological symptoms including alterations in conscious state among COVID-19 patients that require brain imaging. Given the prevalence and severity of these manifestations, clinicians should carefully monitor neurological symptoms within COVID-19 patients and their potential long-term sequelae.","Parsons, N.; Outsikas, A.; Parish, A.; Clohesy, R.; Thakkar, N.; Fiore DAprano, F.; Toomey, F.; Advani, S.; Poudel, G.

665777,Bacterial communities in commercial aircraft high‐efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters assessed by PhyloChip analysis,2012-06-08,"INTRODUCTION: In Palestine (West Bank and Gaza), there have been more than 320 890 known cases of COVID-19, resulting in 3452 deaths. The detrimental effects of the virus can be seen in the nation’s health, economy and government operations, leading to radical uncertainty that is exacerbated by the absence of any definitive treatment or vaccines. The level of knowledge about and trust in treatment and vaccination varies worldwide. This study aims to assess the willingness of Palestinians to receive a COVID-19 vaccine and their knowledge about such vaccines. METHODS: An online survey of adults over 18 years old (n=1080) was conducted in Palestine in October 2020. Using multivariate logistic regression, we identified correlates of participants’ willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine. RESULTS: We found that about 63% of participants were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. However, acceptance varied with the specific demographic variables that were investigated. Women, married participants and those aged 18–24 years are more likely to take the vaccine. Further, participants with good knowledge about the vaccine and its side effects are more willing to get the vaccine. CONCLUSION: The availability of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine in Palestine is crucial to decrease the burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition, to ensure a high vaccination rate, health awareness campaigns should target those who are not willing to get the vaccine, especially those who are more vulnerable and the elderly.","Zawahrah, Hassan J; Saca-Hazboun, Hanan; Melhem, Shatha S; Adwan, Rabee; Sabateen, Ali; Abu-Rmeileh, Niveen M E",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620671/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053681,290

A handful of literatures have summarized its clinical and radiologic features, whereas therapies for COVID‐19 are rather limited. In order to evaluate the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID‐19 patients, we did this timely descriptive study. 6 laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 patients were enrolled and received the transfusion of ABO‐compatible convalescent plasma. The efficacy of this intervention was determined by the alleviation of symptoms, changes in radiologic abnormalities and laboratory tests. No obvious adverse effect observed during the treatment. Transfusion of convalescent plasma led to a resolution of ground glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation in patient #1, #2, #3, #4 and #6. In patient #1 and #5 who presented with SARS‐CoV‐2 in throat swab, convalescent plasma therapy elicited an elimination of virus. Serologic analysis indicated an immediate increase in anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody titers in patient #2 and #3, but not in patient #1. This study indicates that convalescent plasma therapy is effective and specific for COVID‐19. This intervention has a special significance for eliminating SARS‐CoV‐2 and is believed to be a promising state‐of‐art therapy during COVID‐19 pandemic crisis. This article is protected by copyright.

The exact role that correctional facilities play in enhancing COVID-19 spread and enabling community re-emergence of COVID-19 is unknown. We constructed a novel stochastic model of COVID-19 transmission to estimate the impact of correctional facilities, specifically jails and state prisons, for enhancing disease transmission and enabling disease re-emergence in local communities. Using our model, we evaluated scenarios of testing and quarantining infected incarcerated people at 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 times the rate that occurs for infected people in the local community for population sizes of 5, 10, and 20 thousand people. Our results illustrate testing and quarantining an incarcerated population of 800 would reduce the probability of a major community outbreak by 6% and also prevent between 250 to 730 incidences of COVID-19 per year, depending on local community size. These findings illustrate that managing COVID-19 in correctional facilities is essential to mitigate risks to community health, and thereby stresses the importance of improving the health standards of incarcerated people.","Greenhalgh, S.; Provencher, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.05.21251174v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.05.21251174,290

Effective prognostication would be beneficial in managing this disease. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the occurrence of leukocytopenias at admission and at 24 and 48 hours after admission, and changes in absolute leukocyte counts over time, could be used to predict outcome. Animals: Sixty‐two puppies with confirmed CPV. Methods: A prospective study was performed. CBC was performed daily until discharge or death (in which case a postmortem examination was performed). Results: Of the nonsurvivors (10/62; 16%), 9 died because of complications of the disease and 1 was euthanized because of a poor prognosis. There was a statistical significant difference in the occurrence of leukocytopenias between groups at 24 and 48 hours postadmission. The survivors showed a significant increase over time in certain leukocyte types (specifically lymphocytes) compared with values at admission. The positive predictive value for survivors was high. Nonsurvivors had marked thymic and lymphoid atrophy and marked bone marrow hypocellularity.

668750,CGS 41st Annual Scientific Meeting: Book of Abstracts,2021-09-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses new challenges to health care providers and the delivery of continuous care. Although many diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors, have been established, the data from these devices are rarely assessed. Furthermore, telemedicine has not been sufficiently integrated into clinical workflows. OBJECTIVE: We sought to remotely support children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers, enhance the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with diabetes, increase multiple stakeholders’ engagement with digital care via a participatory approach, evaluate the feasibility of using an interoperable open-source platform in a university hospital setting, and analyze the success factors and barriers of transitioning from conventional care to digital care. METHODS: Service design methods were used to adapt clinical workflows. Remote consultations were performed on a monthly and on-demand basis. Diabetes device data were uploaded from patients’ homes to an open-source platform. Clinical and patient-reported outcomes were assessed before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown period in Germany. RESULTS: A total of 28 children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers enrolled in this study and completed 6 months of remote visits. Of these 28 participants, 16 (57%) also opted to attend at least one of their regular visits remotely. After 3 months of remote visits, participants’ time in range (P=.001) and time in hyperglycemia (P=.004) significantly improved, and their time in hypoglycemia did not increase. These improvements were maintained during the COVID-19 lockdown period (ie, between months 3 and 6 of this study). Participants’ psychosocial health improved after 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Remote consultations and commonly shared data access can improve the clinical outcomes and quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes, even during challenging circumstances. A service design approach helped with the delivery of comprehensive and holistic solutions that accounted for the needs of multiple stakeholders. Our findings can inform the future integration of digital tools into clinical care during and beyond the pandemic.

The severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is related to the high rate of interhuman transmission of the virus, variability of clinical presentation, and the absence of specific therapeutic methods. COVID-19 can manifest with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially among the elderly. In some cases, the clinical manifestations of hyponatremia may be the first to appear. The pathophysiological mechanisms of hyponatremia among patients with COVID-19 are diverse, including syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), digestive loss of sodium ions, reduced sodium ion intake or use of diuretic therapy. Hyponatremia may also be considered a negative prognostic factor in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

However, these powerful cytokines are a caged lion, as excessive and sustained IFN-I production can drive immunopathology during infection, and aberrant IFN-I production is a feature of several types of autoimmunity. As specialized producers of IFN-I plasmacytoid (p), dendritic cells (DCs) can secrete superb quantities and a wide breadth of IFN-I isoforms immediately after infection or stimulation, and are the focus of this review. Notably, a few days after viral infection pDCs tune down their capacity for IFN-I production, producing less cytokines in response to both the ongoing infection and unrelated secondary stimulations. This process, hereby referred to as “pDC exhaustion”, favors viral persistence and associates with reduced innate responses and increased susceptibility to secondary opportunistic infections. On the other hand, pDC exhaustion may be a compromise to avoid IFN-I driven immunopathology. In this review we reflect on the mechanisms that initially induce IFN-I and subsequently silence their production by pDCs during a viral infection. While these processes have been long studied across numerous viral infection models, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought their discussion back to the fore, and so we also discuss emerging results related to pDC-IFN-I production in the context of COVID-19.","Greene, Trever T.; Zuniga, Elina I.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578420/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091839,290

To assess the impact of unobserved specimen self-collection on test performance, we examined results from a SARS-CoV-2 qualitative RT-PCR test for self-collected specimens from participants in a return-to-work screening program and assessed the impact of a pooled testing strategy in this cohort. METHODS: Self-collected anterior nasal swabs from employee return to work programs were tested using the Quest Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR EUA. The Ct values for the N1 and N3 N-gene targets and a human RNase P (RP) gene control target were tabulated. For comparison, we utilized Ct values from a cohort of HCP-collected specimens from patients with and without COVID-19 symptoms. RESULTS: Among 47,923 participants, 1.8% were positive. RP failed to amplify for 13/115,435 (0.011%) specimens. The median (IQR) Cts were 32.7 (25.0-35.7) for N1 and 31.3 (23.8-34.2) for N3. Median Ct values in the self-collected cohort were significantly higher than those of symptomatic, but not asymptomatic patients. Based on Ct values, pooled testing with 4 specimens would have yielded inconclusive results in 67/1,268 (5.2%) specimens but only a single false-negative result. CONCLUSIONS: Unobserved self-collection of nasal swabs provides adequate sampling for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. These findings alleviate concerns of increased false negatives in this context. Specimen pooling could be used for this population as the likelihood of false negative results is very low due when using a sensitive, dual-target methodology.","Kagan, Ron M; Rogers, Amy A; Borillo, Gwynngelle A; Clarke, Nigel J; Marlowe, Elizabeth M",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954224/,290

As a countermeasure, viruses have elaborated mechanisms to subvert the host response in order to maintain viral protein synthesis and production. In the last decade, several reports have shown that viruses modulate the assembly of stress granules (SGs), which are translationally silent ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and sites of RNA triage. This review discusses recent advances in our understanding of the interactions between viruses and the host response and how virus-induced modulations in SG abundance play fundamental roles in dictating the success of viral replication.","Valiente-Echeverría, Fernando; Melnychuk, Luca; Mouland, Andrew J.",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22705970/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2012.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170212002018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170212002018,290

The present study investigated the effects of an 8-week (16 session) school-based mindfulness program for young children across 8 classrooms (K through 2) using a quasi-experimental delayed-intervention control group design. Results indicated that the mindfulness program was associated with significant improvements in teacher ratings of externalizing and prosocial behaviors. Program outcomes were not associated with child sex or race/ethnicity, but did vary by grade. Descriptive analyses suggest that outcomes tended to be more positive in classrooms with higher levels of teacher and student engagement. Results of the present study add to the growing knowledge base on the positive effects of school-based mindfulness programs and point to a need for more rigorous inquiry into the extent to which students and teachers are engaged with mindfulness programs both during the program itself and in their day to day functioning.","Sciutto, Mark J.; Veres, Denise A.; Marinstein, Tovia L.; Bailey, Brooke F.; Cehelyk, Sarah K.",J Child Fam Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875914/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-021-01955-x,290

We sought to characterize our experience with arterial thromboembolic complications in patients with hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: All patients admitted from March 1 to April 20, 2020 and who underwent carotid, upper, lower and aortoiliac arterial duplex, CT angiogram or MRA for suspected arterial thrombosis were included. A retrospective case-control study design was used to identify, characterize and evaluate potential risk factors for arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Demographics, characteristics and laboratory values were abstracted and analyzed. RESULTS: During the study period, 424 patients underwent 499 arterial duplex, CT angiogram or MRA imaging studies with overall 9.4% positive for arterial thromboembolism. Of the 40 patients with arterial thromboembolism, 25 (62.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons and 15 (37.5%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The odds ratio for arterial thrombosis in COVID-19 was 3.37 (95% CI 1.68 – 6.78, p=0.001). Although not statistically significant, in patients with arterial thromboembolism, patients who were SARS-CoV-2 positive compared to those testing negative or not tested tended to be male (66.7 % v. 40.0%, p=0.191), have a less frequent history of former or active smoking (42.9% vs 68.0%, p=0.233) and have a higher white blood cell count (WBC 14.5 vs. 9.9, p=0.208). While the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients trended toward a higher the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (8.9 vs. 4.1, p=0.134), CPK level (359.0 vs. 144.5, p=0.667), CRP level (24.2 vs. 13.8, p=0.627), LDH level (576.5 vs. 338.0, p=0.313) and ferritin level (974.0 vs. 412.0, p=0.47), these did not reach statistical significance. Patients with arterial thromboembolic complications and SARS-CoV-2 positive when compared to SARS-CoV-2 negative or admitted for unrelated reasons were younger (64 vs. 70 years, p=0.027), had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (32.6 vs. 25.5, p=0.012), a higher D-dimer at the time of imaging (17.3 vs. 1.8, p=0.038), a higher average in hospital D-dimer (8.5 vs. 2.0, p=0.038), a greater distribution of patients with clot in the aortoiliac location (5 vs. 1, p=0.040), less prior use of any antiplatelet medication (21.4% vs. 62.5%, p=0.035) and a higher mortality rate (40.0 % vs. 8.0%, p=0.041). Treatment of arterial thromboembolic disease in the COVID-19 positive patients included open thromboembolectomy in 6 patients (40%), anticoagulation alone in 4 (26.7%) and 5 (33.3%) did not require or their overall illness severity precluded additional treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAR-CoV-2 are at risk for acute arterial thromboembolic complications despite a lack of conventional risk factors. A hyperinflammatory state may be responsible for this phenomenon with a preponderance for aortoiliac involvement. These findings provide an early characterization of arterial thromboembolic disease in SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Indes, Jeffrey E.; Koleilat, Issam; Hatch, Ayesha Nzeribe; Choinski, Krystina; Jones, Davis Brent; Aldailami, Hasan; Billett, Henny; Denesopolis, John M.; Lipsitz, Evan",J Vasc Surg,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0741521420318796; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861865/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0741521420318796?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2020.07.089,290
674107,Internal quality assurance in diagnostic microbiology: A simple approach for insightful data,2017-11-14,"Background: HER2-based retargeted viruses are in advanced phases of preclinical development of breast cancer models. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a cell-surface tumor antigen expressed in different subtypes of breast and non-breast cancer. Its recent identification as a marker of some triple-negative breast tumors renders it an attractive target, presently investigated in clinical trials employing antibody drug conjugates and CAR-T cells. The availability of MSLN-retargeted oncolytic viruses may complement the current immunotherapeutic panel of biological drugs against HER2-negative breast and non-breast tumors. Methods: A fully virulent, tumor-targeted oncolytic Herpes simplex virus-1 (MSLN-THV) with a selectivity for mesothelin-expressing cancer cells was generated. Recombineering technology was used to replace an essential moiety of the viral glycoprotein D with antibody fragments derived from clinically validated MSLN monoclonal antibodies, and to allow IL12 cargo expression in infected cells. Panels of breast and female reproductive system cell lines were used to verify the oncolytic potential of the viral constructs. A platform for production of the retargeted viruses was developed in HEK 293 cells, providing stable expression of a suitable chimeric receptor. Results: We demonstrated the selectivity of viral infection and cytotoxicity by MSLN-retargeted viruses in a panel of mesothelin-positive cancer cells, originating from breast and female reproductive system tumors. We also developed a second-generation oncolytic MSLN-THV, encoding IL12, to enhance the immunotherapeutic potential of the viral backbone. A non-tumor cell line expressing a chimeric MSLN/Nectin-1 receptor, de-sensitized from antiviral responses by genetic inactivation of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING)-dependent pathway was engineered, to optimize viral yields. Conclusions: Our proof-of-concept study proposes MSLN-retargeted herpesviruses as potential cancer immunotherapeutics for assessments in preclinical models of MSLN-positive tumors, complementing the available panel of oncolytic viruses to HER2-negative breast tumors.","Froechlich, Guendalina; Gentile, Chiara; Infante, Luigia; Caiazza, Carmen; Pagano, Pasqualina; Scatigna, Sarah; Cotugno, Gabriella; D’Alise, Anna Morena; Lahm, Armin; Scarselli, Elisa; Nicosia, Alfredo; Mallardo, Massimo; Sasso, Emanuele; Zambrano, Nicola",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020477; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418877/,290

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prostate target biopsy (TB) outcomes could be predicted by using artificial intelligence approach based on a set of clinical pre-biopsy. METHODS: Pre-biopsy characteristics in terms of PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE), previous prostate biopsies, number of suspicious lesions at mp-MRI, lesion volume, lesion location, and Pi-Rads score were extracted from our prospectively maintained TB database from March 2014 to December 2019. Our approach is based on Fuzzy logic and associative rules mining, with the aim to predict TB outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1448 patients were included. Using the Frequent-Pattern growth algorithm we extracted 875 rules and used to build the fuzzy classifier. 963 subjects were classified whereas for the remaining 484 subjects were not classified since no rules matched with their input variables. Analyzing the classified subjects we obtained a specificity of 59.2% and sensitivity of 90.8% with a negative and the positive predictive values of 81.3% and 76.6%, respectively. In particular, focusing on ISUP ≥ 3 PCa, our model is able to correctly predict the biopsy outcomes in 98.1% of the cases. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrated that the possibility to look at several pre-biopsy variables simultaneously with artificial intelligence algorithms can improve the prediction of TB outcomes, outclassing the performance of PSA, its derivates and MRI alone.","Checcucci, Enrico; Rosati, Samanta; De Cillis, Sabrina; Vagni, Marica; Giordano, Noemi; Piana, Alberto; Granato, Stefano; Amparore, Daniele; De Luca, Stefano; Fiori, Cristian; Balestra, Gabriella; Porpiglia, Francesco",Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480083/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41391-021-00441-1,290

The disease is common throughout the world where chickens are produced commercially. PCR on reverse transcribed RNA is a potent technique for the detection of IBV. In comparison with classical detection methods, PCR-based techniques are both sensitive and fast. Dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been detected, and many more will surely be reported in future. This research was conducted to identify the infectious bronchitis virus with group specific primers of avian Coronaviruses in Zabol, southeast of Iran. Tracheal swabs were collected from eleven commercial broiler flocks and these swabs were used for RNA extraction. General primers included XCE2+ and XCE2- that amplify all IBV serotypes were used. Primers MCE1+, BCE1+ and DCE1+ was used to amplifying the specific nucleotide sequence of Massachusetts, 4/91 and D274 serotypes, respectively. The results of this study showed that 36.36% of the sampled flocks were positive to IBV by RT-PCR. Moreover, the Massachusetts was the identified serotype of infectious bronchitis virus. The results provide the first molecular evidence for the presence of infectious bronchitis virus and Massachusetts serotype in Zabol.

676634,N95 respirator mask breathing leads to excessive carbon dioxide inhalation and reduced heat transfer in a human nasal cavity,2021-08-23,"AIM: COVID-19 clinical presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from asymptomatic to severe cases. While there are a number of early publications relating to risk factors for COVID-19 infection, low sample size and heterogeneity in study design impacted consolidation of early findings. There is a pressing need to identify the factors which predispose patients to severe cases of COVID-19. For rapid and widespread risk stratification, these factors should be easily obtainable, inexpensive, and avoid invasive clinical procedures. The aim of our study is to fill this knowledge gap by systematically mapping all the available evidence on the association of various clinical, demographic, and lifestyle variables with the risk of specific adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted using standardized methodology, searching two electronic databases (PubMed and SCOPUS) for relevant literature published between 1(st) January 2020 and 9(th) July 2020. Included studies reported characteristics of patients with COVID-19 while reporting outcomes relating to disease severity. In the case of sufficient comparable data, meta-analyses were conducted to estimate risk of each variable. RESULTS: Seventy-six studies were identified, with a total of 17,860,001 patients across 14 countries. The studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of the sample under study, outcomes, and risk measures reported. A large number of risk factors were presented for COVID-19. Commonly reported variables for adverse outcome from COVID-19 comprised patient characteristics, including age >75 (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.81–3.90), male sex (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.39–3.04) and severe obesity (OR: 2.57, 95% CI: 1.31–5.05). Active cancer (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04–2.04) was associated with increased risk of severe outcome. A number of common symptoms and vital measures (respiratory rate and SpO2) also suggested elevated risk profiles.

Methods: clinical data of three patients with MIS-C that underwent surgery were collected. Histopathological analysis of the appendix was performed. Results: we present the clinical course of three children with fever, abdominal pain and vomiting for several days. Clinical examination and highly elevated inflammation markers led to indication for laparoscopy; appendectomy was performed in two patients. Because of intraoperative findings or due to lack of postoperative improvement, all patients were reevaluated and tested positive for MIS-C associated laboratory parameters and were subsequently treated with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, acetyl salicylic acid and/or light molecular weight heparin. Conclusions: we discuss the implications of MIS-C as a new differential diagnosis and stress the importance of assessing the previous medical history, identifying patterns of symptoms and critically surveilling the clinical course.

679491,Current Antimicrobial Stewardship Practice and Education in Russian Hospitals: Results of a Multicenter Survey,2021-07-22,"Enveloped viruses gain entry into host cells by fusing with cellular membranes, a step required for virus replication. Coronaviruses, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), fuse at the plasma membrane or use receptor-mediated endocytosis and fuse with endosomes depending on the cell or tissue type. The virus Spike (S) protein mediates fusion with the host cell membrane. We have shown previously that an Abl kinase inhibitor, imatinib, significantly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viral titers and prevents endosomal entry by HIV SARS S and MERS S pseudotyped virions. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are classified as BSL-3 viruses, which can make experimentation into the cellular mechanisms involved in infection more challenging. Here, we use IBV, a BSL-2 virus, as a model for studying the role of Abl kinase activity during coronavirus infection. We found that imatinib and two specific Abl kinase inhibitors, GNF2 and GNF5, reduce IBV titers by blocking the first round of virus infection. Additionally, all three drugs prevented IBV S-induced syncytia formation prior to the hemifusion step. Our results indicate that membrane fusion (both virus-cell and cell-cell) is blocked in the presence of Abl kinase inhibitors. Studying the effects of Abl kinase inhibitors on IBV will be useful in identifying host cell pathways required for coronavirus infection. This will provide insight into possible therapeutic targets to treat infections by current as well as newly emerging coronaviruses.","Sisk, Jeanne M.; Frieman, Matthew B.; Machamer, Carolyn E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/246991,290

All participants were surveyed about use of mask, gloves, gowns, and hand-washing, as recommended under droplets and contact precautions when caring for index patients with SARS. 69 staff who reported use of all four measures were not infected, whereas all infected staff had omitted at least one measure (p=0·0224). Fewer staff who wore masks (p=0·0001), gowns (p=0·006), and washed their hands (p=0·047) became infected compared with those who didn't, but stepwise logistic regression was significant only for masks (p=0·011). Practice of droplets precaution and contact precaution is adequate in significantly reducing the risk of infection after exposures to patients with SARS.

To analyze infection of enterocytes is a challenging task as culture systems for differentiated intestinal epithelial cells are not readily available and often have a life span that is too short for infection studies. Precision-cut intestinal slices (PCIS) from chicken embryos were prepared and shown that the epithelial cells lining the lumen of the intestine are viable for up to 4 days. Using lectin staining, it was demonstrated that α2,3-linked sialic acids, the preferred receptor determinants of avian influenza viruses, are present on the apical side of the epithelial cells. Furthermore, the epithelial cells (at the tips) of the villi were shown to be susceptible to infection by an avian influenza virus of the H9N2 subtype. This culture system will be useful to analyze virus infection of intestinal epithelial cells and it should be applicable also to the intestine of other species.","Punyadarsaniya, Darsaniya; Winter, Christine; Mork, Ann-Kathrin; Amiri, Mahdi; Naim, Hassan Y.; Rautenschlein, Silke; Herrler, Georg",Journal of Virological Methods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25445801/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.10.015; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093414004169; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093414004169,290

The worldwide scientific community is forging ahead to characterize a wide range of outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection; however the underlying assumptions in these studies have varied so widely that the resulting data are difficult to compareFormal definitions are needed in order to design robust and consistent studies of Long COVID that consistently capture variation in long-term outcomes. Even the condition itself goes by three terms, most widely “Long COVID”, but also “COVID-19 syndrome (PACS)” or, “post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)”. In the present study, we investigate the definitions used in the literature published to date and compare them against data available from electronic health records and patient-reported information collected via surveys. Long COVID holds the potential to produce a second public health crisis on the heels of the pandemic itself. Proactive efforts to identify the characteristics of this heterogeneous condition are imperative for a rigorous scientific effort to investigate and mitigate this threat.","Rando, Halie M.; Bennett, Tellen D.; Byrd, James Brian; Bramante, Carolyn; Callahan, Tiffany J.; Chute, Christopher G.; Davis, Hannah E.; Deer, Rachel; Gagnier, Joel; Koraishy, Farrukh M; Liu, Feifan; McMurry, Julie A.; Moffitt, Richard A.; Pfaff, Emily R.; Reese, Justin T.; Relevo, Rose; Robinson, Peter N.; Saltz, Joel H.; Solomonides, Anthony; Sule, Anupam; Topaloglu, Umit; Haendel, Melissa A.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.20.21253896v1?rss=1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791733/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.20.21253896,290

685406,"Population genetics: past, present, and future",2020-07-18,"This study explored how university students remained motivated to learn, despite all the limitations they encountered and endured during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work was carried out in Indonesia, but the benefits are beyond a stateboundary. The study examines how university students in developing countries have faced obstacles, and yet despite this, they are still trying their hardest to stay focused on achieving their personal goals during the pandemic. This research employed a qualitative phenomenological approach, involving eighty students that were studying at the Faculty of Education at a state university in Jakarta, Indonesia. As data collection techniques, students were asked to write learning log diaries and reflective essays and to participate in an online focus group discussion. The results showed that the students' motivation to remain learning during the COVID-19 pandemic fell into three key themes, each with associated sub-themes. The three themes and sub-themes described were: (a) personal, with sub-themes of challenge, curiosity, self-determination, satisfaction and religious commitment; (b) social, with sub-themes of relationships, inspiration, and well-being of self and others; and (c) environmental, with sub-themes of facilities and conditioning. The themes and sub-themes indicate the source of motivation for these university students to learn during the pandemic. This study concluded that these emerging adults were both intrinsically and extrinsically autonomously motivated and committed to their studies. Most of these students were motivated by their consequential aspirations, not by a controlled motivation, nor were they motivated by a reward, a penalty, or a rule that propelled them. By defining how the students managed to empower themselves, this study recommends the importance of preparing students to be more resilient and to enable them to cultivate the ability to remain optimistic and motivated to succeed and overcome any of life’s adversities.","Rahiem, Maila D.H.",Child Youth Serv Rev,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33318719/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190740920322246?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190740920322246,290
686188,Relationship of α2‐Macroglobulin with Steroid‐Induced Femoral Head Necrosis: A Chinese Population‐Based Association Study in Southeast China,2019-06-26,"Most coronaviruses infecting humans cause mild diseases, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus is an extremely dangerous pathogen. Here, we report the development of a serologic assay for detection of antibodies to human coronaviruses (HCoVs) based on recombinant nucleocapsid (N) proteins of all known pathogenic strains (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS). The novel immunoassay is highly useful for epidemiologic surveys, where use of nucleic acid diagnostics often is limited. Purified recombinant antigens were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes and applied in a line immunoassay, which allows rapid detection of antibodies to 5 different HCoVs in a single experiment. For assay evaluation, serum samples from persons infected with 229E or OC43 (acute/convalescent), recovered SARS patients and healthy donors were analyzed. Screening for nucleocapsid (N)-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in convalescent sera reached 100% sensitivity. With this new technique, we found that recently identified NL63 and HKU1 contribute significantly to the overall spectrum of coronavirus infections. Possibly, cross-reactive antibody responses were observed using 229E and OC43 serum pairs. However, the potential of this assay could clearly be demonstrated employing SARS-positive serum samples, where nonspecific binding to nucleocapsids of other HCoVs was not observed. This coronavirus strain-specific line immunoassay represents a powerful tool for serologic diagnostics.","Lehmann, Christian; Wolf, Hans; Xu, Jianguo; Zhao, Quanbi; Shao, Yiming; Motz, Manfred; Lindner, Petra",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2007.12.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889307005883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18191362/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889307005883,290

METHODS: In this prospective study, single or double SM were worn by term pregnant women who applied for routine controls. The vital signs of the participants such as oxygen saturation, pulse, respiratory rate, fever, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured at admission and 30 min later. RESULTS: There were 223 participants in the single SM group and 231 participants in the double SM group. Thirty minutes after putting on the mask, there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients whose oxygen saturation fell below 95 (3.6 vs 5.6%, p = 0.301). No significant difference was observed between the admission and 30 min oxygen saturation levels of the pregnant women in the single SM group. However, maternal oxygen saturation after 30 min of the pregnant women in the double SM group was significantly lower (97.4 ± 1.1 vs 96.6 ± 1.3, p < 0.001). No significant changes were observed in the vital signs of either groups. CONCLUSION: When using double SM, oxygen saturation is significantly reduced compared to pre-mask values. Nevertheless, it seems difficult to say that these decreases have clinical significance.","Isikalan, Mehmet Murat; Özkaya, Buşra; Özkaya, Eren Berkay; Gümüş, Meryem; Ferlibaş, Enes; Acar, Ali",Arch Gynecol Obstet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34143265/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00404-021-06126-3,290

688228,International transfers of personal data for health research following Schrems II: a problem in need of a solution,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Because patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have an impaired immune response to pathogens, they are at higher risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, data on antibody production among HD patients with COVID-19 is scarce. Thus, we performed a retrospective cohort study evaluating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two antibody (SARS-CoV-2) production within 1 month after COVID-19 onset in hospitalized patients on HD. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G levels were quantified using an iFlash 3000 Chemiluminescence Immunoassay analyzer (Shenzhen YHLO Biotech Co., Ltd.) to detect IgG antibodies specific for the S1 subunit of the spike protein (IgG-S1). Propensity score matching was used to balance covariate distribution in HD and non-HD patients. From April 2020 to February 2021, antibody testing was performed on 161 hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. Of them, 34 HD patients were matched to 68 non-HD patients. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, the median levels of IgG-S1 in the HD patients at 7–13 days after symptom onset were significantly lower than in non-HD patients, especially in those with severe disease. Among all patients, those with severe disease produced lower levels of IgG-S1 at 7–13 days compared with non-severe patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with severe disease, especially those undergoing HD, had lower IgG-S1 production in the second week of the disease. Thus, the increased risk of severe COVID-19 in HD patients may be, in part, due to a slow and reduced antibody response.","Beppu, Hiroko; Fukuda, Tatsuya; Kawanishi, Tomoko; Yasui, Fumihiko; Toda, Minami; Kimura, Hitomi; Nakamura, Yuki; Nakamura, Yuka; Kojima, Kaori; Ogawa, Hina; Ishiwatari, Ayumi; Kamei, Yuiko; Ogawa, Toshie; Abe, Yasutomo; Endo, Mariko; Hanawa, Tomohide; Mizobuchi, Rie; Sugita, Chise; Okamoto, Koh; Hatakeyama, Shuji; Yamada, Tetsusya; Kohara, Michinori; Wakai, Sachiko",Clin Exp Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34487276/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10157-021-02130-8,290

The structure of all compounds was determined using X-ray structural analysis. The vanadium atom in these structures has an octahedral coordination environment. Complex 4 has an unexpected structure. Firstly, it contains 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3-bian instead of 3,5-(CF3)2C6H3-mian. Secondly, it has a binuclear structure, in contrast to 3, in which two oxovanadium parts are linked to each other through V=O···V interaction. This interaction is non-covalent in origin, according to DFT calculations. In structures 2 and 3, non-covalent π-π staking interactions between acenaphthene moieties of the neighboring molecules (distances are 3.36-3.40 Å) with an estimated energy of 3 kcal/mol were also found. The redox properties of the obtained compounds were studied using cyclic voltammetry in solution. In all cases, the reduction processes initiated by the redox-active nature of the mian or bian ligand were identified. The paramagnetic nature of complexes 3 and 4 has been proven by EPR spectroscopy. Complexes 3 and 4 exhibited high catalytic activity in the oxidation of alkanes and alcohols with peroxides. The yields of products of cyclohexane oxidation were 43% (complex 3) and 27% (complex 4). Based on the data regarding the study of regio- and bond-selectivity, it was concluded that hydroxyl radicals play the most crucial role in the reaction. The initial products in the reactions with alkanes are alkyl hydroperoxides, which are easily reduced to their corresponding alcohols by the action of triphenylphosphine (PPh3). According to the DFT calculations, the difference in the catalytic activity of 3 and 4 is most likely associated with a different mechanism for the generation of âOH radicals. For complex 4 with electron-withdrawing CF3 substituents at the diimine ligand, an alternative mechanism, different from Fenton's and involving a redox-active ligand, is assumed.","Lukoyanov, Anton N; Fomenko, Iakov S; Gongola, Marko I; Shul'pina, Lidia S; Ikonnikov, Nikolay S; Shul'pin, Georgiy B; Ketkov, Sergey Y; Fukin, Georgy K; Rumyantcev, Roman V; Novikov, Alexander S; Nadolinny, Vladimir A; Sokolov, Maxim N; Gushchin, Artem L",Molecules (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577177/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185706,290

The digital age and the rise of social media have accelerated changes to our social systems, with poorly understood functional consequences.
