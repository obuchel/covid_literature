2322,Clinical profile and outcome of patients with acute kidney injury requiring dialysis—an experience from a haemodialysis unit in a developing country,2016-07-22,"BACKGROUND: The first government funded and sustainable dialysis unit was established in Ethiopia at Saint Paul’s Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC). This has led to the development of a unique cohort of patients about which very little is known. This study was conducted to describe the clinical profile and outcome of adult Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) patients treated with intermittent haemodialysis at the dialysis center of SPHMMC. METHODS: A retrospective review of clinical records of cases of AKI who required haemodialysis support during the time period from August 1, 2013 to February 1, 2015 was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 151 cases AKI requiring dialysis were included for the study. Overall, the patients were generally younger with a mean age of 36.7 years and thus with few premorbid conditions. The most common causes of AKI were hypovolemia (22.5 %), acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) (21.9 %) and pregnancy related causes (18.5 %). Nearly a third (29.1 %) of patients succumbed to the AKI. CONCLUSION: Infections, AGN, obstetric causes and nephrotoxins were the primary causes of dialysis requiring AKI. Most of these causes can be prevented with simple interventions such as health education on oral rehydration, quality prenatal and emergency obstetric care, appropriate management of infections and taking appropriate precautions when prescribing potentially nephrotoxic medications.","Ibrahim, Ahmed; Ahmed, Momina M.; Kedir, Seman; Bekele, Delayehu",BMC Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4957374/,351
4200,Risk factors and outcomes of acute kidney injury in South African critically ill adults: a prospective cohort study,2019-12-10,"BACKGROUND: There is a marked paucity of data concerning AKI in Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a substantial burden of trauma and HIV. METHODS: Prospective data was collected on all patients admitted to a multi-disciplinary ICU in South Africa during 2017. Development of AKI (before or during ICU admission) was recorded and renal recovery 90 days after ICU discharge was determined. RESULTS: Of 849 admissions, the mean age was 42.5 years and mean SAPS 3 score was 48.1. Comorbidities included hypertension (30.5%), HIV (32.6%), diabetes (13.3%), CKD (7.8%) and active tuberculosis (6.2%). The most common reason for admission was trauma (26%). AKI developed in 497 (58.5%). Male gender, illness severity, length of stay, vasopressor drugs and sepsis were independently associated with AKI. AKI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 31.8% vs 7.23% in those without AKI. Age, active tuberculosis, higher SAPS 3 score, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support and sepsis were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio for death. HIV was not independently associated with AKI or hospital mortality. CKD developed in 14 of 110 (12.7%) patients with stage 3 AKI; none were dialysis-dependent. CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective multidisciplinary ICU cohort of younger patients, AKI was common, often associated with trauma in addition to traditional risk factors and was associated with good functional renal recovery at 90 days in most survivors. Although the HIV prevalence was high and associated with higher mortality, this was related to the severity of illness and not to HIV status per se.","Aylward, Ryan E.; van der Merwe, Elizabeth; Pazi, Sisa; van Niekerk, Minette; Ensor, Jason; Baker, Debbie; Freercks, Robert J.",BMC Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6902455/,351
4463,Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia using electronic nose sensor array signals: solutions to improve the application of machine learning in respiratory research,2020-02-07,"BACKGROUND: Our recent meta-analysis indicated that vitamin C may shorten the length of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Here we analyze modification of the vitamin C effect on ventilation time, by the control group ventilation time (which we used as a proxy for severity of disease in the patients of each trial). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant publications. We included controlled trials in which the administration of vitamin C was the only difference between the study groups. We did not limit our search to randomized trials and did not require placebo control. We included all doses and all durations of vitamin C administration. One author extracted study characteristics and outcomes from the trial reports and entered the data in a spreadsheet. Both authors checked the data entered against the original reports. We used meta-regression to examine whether the vitamin C effect on ventilation time depends on the duration of ventilation in the control group. RESULTS: We identified nine potentially eligible trials, eight of which were included in the meta-analysis. We pooled the results of the eight trials, including 685 patients in total, and found that vitamin C shortened the length of mechanical ventilation on average by 14% (P = 0.00001). However, there was significant heterogeneity in the effect of vitamin C between the trials. Heterogeneity was fully explained by the ventilation time in the untreated control group. Vitamin C was most beneficial for patients with the longest ventilation, corresponding to the most severely ill patients. In five trials including 471 patients requiring ventilation for over 10 h, a dosage of 1–6 g/day of vitamin C shortened ventilation time on average by 25% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: We found strong evidence that vitamin C shortens the duration of mechanical ventilation, but the magnitude of the effect seems to depend on the duration of ventilation in the untreated control group. The level of baseline illness severity should be considered in further research. Different doses should be compared directly in future trials.","Hemilä, Harri; Chalker, Elizabeth",J Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7006137/,351
7918,Current Concepts of Severe Pneumococcal Community-acquired Pneumonia,2007,"Much of our current understanding of measles has come from experiments in non-human primates. In 1911, Goldberger and Anderson showed that macaques inoculated with filtered secretions from measles patients developed measles, thus demonstrating that the causative agent of this disease was a virus. Since then, different monkey species have been used for experimental measles virus infections. Moreover, infection studies in macaques demonstrated that serial passage of the virus in vivo and in vitro resulted in virus attenuation, providing the basis for all current live-attenuated measles vaccines. This chapter will review the macaque model for measles, with a focus on vaccination and immunopathogenesis studies conducted over the last 15 years. In addition, recent data are highlighted demonstrating that the application of a recombinant measles virus strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein dramatically increased the sensitivity of virus detection, both in living and sacrificed animals, allowing new approaches to old questions on measles vaccination and pathogenesis.","de Swart, R.

10844,Prehospital reversal of profound respiratory acidosis and hypercapnic coma by non-invasive ventilation: a report of two cases,2020-05-07,"Complement is a key component of the innate immune system. Inappropriate complement activation underlies the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases. Complement component 5 (C5) is a validated therapeutic target for complement-mediated diseases, but the development of new therapeutics has been limited by a paucity of preclinical models to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of candidate therapies. The present report describes a novel humanized C5 mouse and its utility in evaluating a panel of fully human anti-C5 antibodies. Surprisingly, humanized C5 mice revealed marked differences in clearance rates amongst a panel of anti-C5 antibodies. One antibody, pozelimab (REGN3918), bound C5 and C5 variants with high affinity and potently blocked complement-mediated hemolysis in vitro. In studies conducted in both humanized C5 mice and cynomolgus monkeys, pozelimab demonstrated prolonged PK and durable suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo. In humanized C5 mice, a switch in dosing from in-house eculizumab to pozelimab was associated with normalization of serum C5 concentrations, sustained suppression of hemolytic activity ex vivo, and no overt toxicity. Our findings demonstrate the value of humanized C5 mice in identifying new therapeutic candidates and treatment options for complement-mediated diseases.","Latuszek, Adrianna; Liu, Yashu; Olsen, Olav; Foster, Randi; Cao, Marc; Lovric, Irena; Yuan, Ming; Liu, Nina; Chen, Henry; Zhang, Qian; Xiao, Hui; Springer, Carola; Ehrlich, George; Kamat, Vishal; Rafique, Ashique; Hu, Ying; Krueger, Pamela; Huang, Tammy; Poueymirou, William; Babb, Robert; Rosconi, Michael P.; Retter, Marc W.; Chen, Gang; Morton, Lori; Zambrowicz, Brian; Cao, Jingtai; Romano, Carmelo; Olson, William C.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7209288/,351
11057,Clinical relevance and impact of Corynebacterium isolation in lower respiratory tract of critically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation,2020-03-17,"Notwithstanding successful harmonization efforts, the global regulatory framework governing product safety is complex and continually evolving, as evidenced by additional regional guidance and regulations. In this regulatory review, we provide an overview from both global and regional perspectives. A historical perspective, with a focus on recent developments, enables identification of important long–term trends, such as a shift from single–case medical review of serious adverse events to an interdisciplinary evaluation of aggregate data for the purpose of judging product causality and informing benefit–risk assessments. We will show how these trends lead to opportunities for closer interdisciplinary collaboration, for bridging the gap between preand postmarketing surveillance, and for a more proactive determination of patient populations with a positive benefit–risk profile for product use. We will conclude by pointing to ongoing and future work that seeks to provide specific solutions for ongoing aggregate safety evaluation.","Ball, Greg; Kurek, Raffael; Hendrickson, Barbara A.; Buchanan, James; Wang, William W.; Duke, Susan P.; Bhattacharyya, Amit; Li, Mengchun; O’Brien, Dennis; Weigel, Judith; Wang, Wenquan; Jiang, Qi; Ahmad, Faiz; Seltzer, Jonathan H.; Herrero-Martinez, Esteban; Tremmel, Lothar",Ther Innov Regul Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222952/,351
11122,Refeeding syndrome: multimodal monitoring and clinical manifestation of an internal severe neurotrauma,2020-05-04,"BACKGROUND: The optimal surgical strategy for pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD) in neonates and young infants is controversial. Staged repair may be associated with a higher risk of inter-stage mortality, while primary repair may lead to frequent post-repair re-interventions. METHODS: From 2004 to 2017, 65 patients with PA/VSD who underwent surgical intervention before 90 days of age were identified and enrolled in this retrospective study. The cohort was divided into two groups: group-SR, who underwent initial palliation with staged repair (n = 50), and group-PR who underwent primary repair (n = 15). RESULTS: There were three post-palliation in-hospital mortalities, four inter-stage mortalities, and one post-repair in-hospital mortality in group-SR. In group-PR, there was one in-hospital death and one late death. Five-year survival rates were comparable between the two groups (group-SR: 83.6%; group-PR: 86.7%; p = 0.754). During the median follow-up duration of 44.7 months (Inter-quartile range, 19–109 months), 40 post-repair re-interventions (22 in group-SR, 18 in group-PR) were performed in 26 patients (18 in group-SR, 8 in group-PR). On Cox proportional hazards model, primary repair was identified as the only risk factor for decreased time to death/1st post-repair re-intervention (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.3, p = 0.049) and death/2nd post-repair re-intervention (HR 2.91, p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: A staged repair strategy, compared with primary repair, was associated with comparable overall survival with less frequent re-interventions after repair in young infants with PA/VSD. Lowering the inter-stage mortality after initial palliation by vigilant outpatient care and aggressive home monitoring may be the key to better surgical outcomes in this subset. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: Surgical outcomes of PA with VSD according to the surgical strategies. Patient 1 (birth weight: 2.7 kg) underwent primary Rastelli-type repair at post-natal day # 50 (body weight: 3.8 kg) using Contegra® 12 mm. The postoperative course was rocky, with long ventilatory support (10 days), ICU stay (14 days), and hospital stay (20 days). Cardiac CT scan at 9 months post-repair showed severe branch pulmonary artery stenosis, which necessitated LPA stenting at 12 months post-repair and RV-PA conduit replacement with extensive pulmonary artery reconstruction at 25 months post-repair. Patient 2 (birth weight: 2.5 kg) underwent RMBT at post-natal day #30 (body weight: 3.4 kg) using 4 mm PTFE vascular graft and staged Rastelli-type repair at post-natal 11 months using a hand-made Gore-Tex valved conduit (14 mm). No post-repair re-intervention has been performed. Cardiac CT scan at 90 months post-repair showed no branch pulmonary artery stenosis.

11258,Influence of different PEEP levels on electrical impedance tomography findings in patients under general anesthesia ventilated in the lateral decubitus position,2019-05-06,"Melanocortin 4 receptor gene plays an important role in food intake, energy balance, and weight control. The autosomal dominantly inherited MC4R variants cause obesity by causing hyperphagia and decreased sense of satiety. Homozygous variants are rarely reported, and they cause earlier/severe obesity. Our objective is to determine the MC4R gene variant frequency in children and adolescents with familial early-onset obesity. One hundred thirty-nine children and adolescents (57 girls/82 boys) whose weight increase started before the age of 5 years and who had early-onset obesity in at least one of their first-degree relatives were included in the study. Obesity is defined as body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 95th percentile, and as extreme obesity is defined if the BMI ≥ 120% of the 95th percentile or ≥ 35 kg/m(2). Children having genetic syndromes associated with obesity and mental retardation or taking drugs that promote changes in eating behavior or weight were excluded from the study. Coding region of the MC4R gene was sequenced by using the Illumina MiSeq Next Generation Sequencing System. The mean age of the patients was 7.3 ± 3.7 years, and the mean BMI SDS was 3.7 ± 0.7. While 118 patients (85%) were prepubertal, 21 patients (15%) were pubertal. Seven different variants were identified in 12 patients by giving a variant detection rate of 8.6%, of these five were previously identified missense variants p.N274S, p.S136F, p.V166I, p.R165W, and p.I291SfsX10. One homozygous variant p.I291SfsX10 (c.870delG) was detected in a severely obese 2-year-old boy, and other variants were heterozygous. Two novel variants were found: p.M200del and p.S188L. By using the in silico analysis software, these novel variants were predicted to be disease causing. Conclusion: MC4R gene variants are quite common in childhood obesity in Turkish population. Screening the variants in MC4R gene is necessary in patients with severe childhood-onset obesity. In such patients, comorbidities of obesity can be seen from early years.","Aykut, Ayça; Özen, Samim; Gökşen, Damla; Ata, Aysun; Onay, Hüseyin; Atik, Tahir; Darcan, Şükran; Özkinay, Ferda",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223532/,351
11396,The application of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation in the first episode of acute respiratory failure,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Bacteremia and endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), are challenging to treat and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Telavancin is a lipoglycopeptide antibacterial active against susceptible Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA. OBJECTIVE: This registry study assessed the real-world use and clinical outcomes of telavancin in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis enrolled in the Telavancin Observation Use Registry (TOUR™). METHODS: The subset of patients enrolled in TOUR who were diagnosed with endocarditis and/or bacteremia with a known or unknown primary source (N = 151) were analyzed. Data including demographics, infection type, baseline pathogens, prior or concomitant antimicrobial therapy, dosing regimen, clinical response, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of interest, and mortality were collected by retrospective medical chart review. RESULTS: Telavancin was primarily used as a second-line or greater therapy (n = 132, 87.4%). MRSA was present in 87 (57.6%) patients. Median telavancin dose was 740.6 mg (interquartile range (IQR) 206.0 mg) and median duration of therapy was 9.0 days (IQR 24.0 days). Of the 132/151 (87.4%) patients with an available assessment at the end of telavancin therapy, a positive clinical response was achieved in 98/132 (74.2%), while 14/132 (10.6%) failed therapy and 20/132 (15.2%) had an indeterminant outcome. TEAEs occurred in 24 (15.9%) patients. The most frequent TEAE was renal failure (n = 12, 7.9%); seven of these patients were receiving concomitant nephrotoxic medications. There was no change in creatinine clearance for 67/89 (75.3%) patients with values recorded at the beginning and the end of telavancin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In real-world clinical practice, overall positive clinical outcomes are observed in patients with bacteremia or endocarditis treated with telavancin, including in those patients infected with MRSA or another S. aureus pathogen. Telavancin may be an alternative treatment option for these patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02288234) on 11 November 2014.

11514,The artificial kidney induces acute kidney injury: yes,2019-12-12,"Despite tremendous advances in the development of anti-viral therapeutics, viral infections remain a chief culprit accounting for ongoing morbidity and mortality worldwide. Natural products, in particular animal venoms, embody a veritable cornucopia of exotic constituents, suggesting an immensurable source of anti-infective drugs. In this context, melittin, the principal constituent in the venom of the European honeybee Apis mellifera, has been demonstrated to exert anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-infective, and adjuvant properties. To our knowledge, there is no review appertaining to effects of melittin against viruses, prompting us to synopsize experimental investigations on its anti-viral activity throughout the past decades. Accumulating evidence indicates that melittin curbs infectivity of a diverse array of viruses including coxsackievirus, enterovirus, influenza A viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), Junín virus (JV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). However, medication safety, different routes of administrations, and molecular mechanisms behind the anti-viral activity of melittin should be scrutinized in future studies.","Memariani, Hamed; Memariani, Mojtaba; Moravvej, Hamideh; Shahidi-Dadras, Mohammad",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7224078/,351
12242,Atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting,2013-08-01,"Background. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare but are frequently diagnosed at advanced stages and require systemic therapy. Patients and methods. This multicenter, open-label, phase II study evaluated sunitinib in Japanese patients with well-differentiated pancreatic NET. Patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR; percentage of complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs] plus stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), tumor shrinkage, progression-free survival (PFS) probability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers. Results. Twelve patients received treatment. The CBR was 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 43–94) and included 6 patients with a PR and 3 with SD. The ORR was 50 % (95 % CI, 21–79). PFS probability was 91 % (95 % CI, 54–99) at 6 months and 71 % (95 % CI, 34–90) at 12 months. Commonly reported treatment-emergent (all-causality), any-grade adverse events included diarrhea (n = 10), hand–foot syndrome and hypertension (both n = 8), fatigue and headache (both n = 7), and neutropenia (n = 6). No deaths on study were reported; one death due to disease progression occurred >28 days after end of treatment. Sunitinib on a CDD schedule resulted in sustained drug concentrations without accumulation across cycles. Tumor responses in all 12 patients did not appear to correlate with decreases in chromogranin A levels. Conclusions. Sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a CDD schedule demonstrated antitumor activity in Japanese patients with unresectable, well-differentiated pancreatic NET. Commonly reported adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sunitinib.

H2A.B genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 H2A.B genes in mice. We show that H2A.B KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that H2A.B plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between H2A.B KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the H2A.B status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that H2A.B is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.","Molaro, Antoine; Wood, Anna J.; Janssens, Derek; Kindelay, Selina M.; Eickbush, Michael T.; Wu, Steven; Singh, Priti; Muller, Charles H.; Henikoff, Steven; Malik, Harmit S.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7757805/,351

In Cox regression analysis, independent risk factors for mortality included liver herniation, pulmonary hypoplasia, relaparotomy for perforation or necrosis, abdominal compartment syndrome, and central line sepsis. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis identified central line sepsis, abdominal compartment syndrome, complex gastroschisis, and a younger gestational age as independent predictors of the composite adverse outcome. Conclusion: The risk of death is increased in newborns with gastroschisis who have liver herniation, pulmonary hypoplasia, abdominal compartment syndrome, relaparotomy for perforation or necrosis, or central line–associated sepsis.

The sensor, based on instantaneous measurements, functions as a position server for dual-axis solar trackers in photovoltaic plants. The proposed device has been developed with free software and hardware, which makes it a pioneering solution because it is open and accessible as well as capable of being improved by the scientific community, thereby contributing to the rapid advancement of technology. In addition, the device includes an algorithm developed ex professo that makes it possible to predetermine the regions of the celestial sphere for which, according to the geometric characteristics of the PV plant, there would be shading between the panels. In this way, solar trackers do not have to locate the Sun’s position at all times according to astronomical models, while taking into account factors such as shadows or cloudiness that also affect levels of incident irradiance on solar collectors. Therefore, with this device, it is possible to provide photovoltaic plants with dual-axis solar tracking with a low-cost device that helps to optimise the trajectory of the trackers and, consequently, their radiative capture and energy production.","Gómez-Uceda, Francisco J.; Ramirez-Faz, José; Varo-Martinez, Marta; Fernández-Ahumada, Luis Manuel",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7865246/,351

This pattern of overuse contributes to inefficient health care spending. These patients require coordinated care to achieve optimal health outcomes. However, the poor exchange of health-related information between various clinicians renders the delivery of coordinated care challenging. Health information exchanges (HIEs) facilitate health-related information sharing and have been shown to be effective in chronic disease management; however, their effectiveness in the delivery of integrated care is less clear. It is prudent to consider new approaches to sharing both general medical and behavioral health information. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify and describe factors influencing the intention to use behavioral health information that is shared through HIEs. METHODS: We used a mixed methods design consisting of two sequential phases. A validated survey instrument was emailed to clinical and nonclinical staff in Alabama and Oklahoma. The survey captured information about the impact of predictors on the intention to use behavioral health data in clinical decision making. Follow-up interviews were conducted with a subsample of participants to elaborate on the survey results. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze survey data. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from the interviews. RESULTS: A total of 62 participants completed the survey. In total, 63% (n=39) of the participants were clinicians. Performance expectancy (β=.382; P=.01) and trust (β=.539; P<.001) predicted intention to use behavioral health information shared via HIEs. The interviewees (n=5) expressed that behavioral health information could be useful in clinical decision making. However, privacy and confidentiality concerns discourage sharing this information, which is generally missing from patient records altogether. The interviewees also stated that training for HIE use was not mandatory; the training that was provided did not focus specifically on the exchange of behavioral health information. CONCLUSIONS: Despite barriers, individuals are willing to use behavioral health information from HIEs if they believe that it will enhance job performance and if the information being transmitted is trustworthy. The findings contribute to our understanding of the role HIEs can play in delivering integrated care, particularly to vulnerable patients.","Cochran, Randyl A; Feldman, Sue S; Ivankova, Nataliya V; Hall, Allyson G; Opoku-Agyeman, William",JMIR Ment Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8193493/,351
19083,ACE2 and Apelin-13: Biomarkers with a Prognostic Value in Congestive Heart Failure,2021-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and high sitting time are directly related to mortality and morbidity of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Thus, improved understanding of the prevalence and trends of these behaviors could support the design of policies and interventions for NCDs prevention. OBJECTIVE: To determine the current prevalence of physical inactivity and high sitting time, to analyze the trends, and to estimate the association of meeting/not meeting physical activity recommendations and low/high sitting time with sociodemographic characteristics and body mass index categories. METHODOLOGY: Data from the 2018 National Health and Nutrition Survey were used. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sitting minutes per week were calculated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ). In total, 38,033 questionnaires of adults aged 20 to 69-year-old were analyzed. Adults were classified as physically inactive if they achieved less than 150 minutes per week of MVPA and as with high sitting time if they accumulated more than 420 minutes of sitting per day. Health and Nutrition National Surveys (ENSANUT) 2006, 2012 and 2018 were used to estimate the trends. RESULTS: In total, 16.5% were classified as physically inactive and 11.3% within the high sitting time category. Both prevalences increased more than 40% during the 12-y period (2006–2018). In 2018, men, younger adults, those living in urban areas, and people within the highest socioeconomical status and educational levels were more likely to not achieve physical activity recommendations and to be classified in the highest sitting time category. CONCLUSION: To stop current increased trends and achieve global targets, stronger and more concerted efforts to promote physical activity and reduce sitting time are required. Thus, continued surveillance of these behaviors is necessary.","Medina, Catalina; Jáuregui, Alejandra; Hernández, Cesar; Shamah, Teresa; Barquera, Simón",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8253416/,351
19102,Dynamics in perioperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte*platelet ratio as a predictor of early acute kidney injury following cardiovascular surgery,2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common skin cancer often curable by excision; however, for patients with BCC around the eye, excision places visual organs and function at risk. In this article, we test the hypothesis that use of the hedgehog inhibitor vismodegib will improve vision‐related outcomes in patients with orbital and extensive periocular BCC (opBCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open‐label, nonrandomized phase IV trial, we enrolled patients with globe‐ and lacrimal drainage system–threatening opBCC. To assess visual function in the context of invasive periorbital and lacrimal disease, we used a novel Visual Assessment Weighted Score (VAWS) in addition to standard ophthalmic exams. Primary endpoint was VAWS with a score of 21/50 (or greater) considered successful, signifying globe preservation. Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST v1.1. Surgical specimens were examined histologically by dermatopathologists. RESULTS: In 34 patients with opBCC, mean VAWS was 44/50 at baseline, 46/50 at 3 months, and 47/50 at 12 months or postsurgery. In total, 100% of patients maintained successful VAWS outcome at study endpoint. Compared with baseline, 3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1–15.3) experienced major score decline (5+ points), 14.7% (95% CI, 5 to 31.1) experienced a minor decline (2–4 points), and 79.4% experienced a stable or improved score (95% CI, 62.1–91.3). A total of 56% (19) of patients demonstrated complete tumor regression by physical examination, and 47% (16) had complete regression by MRI/CT. A total of 79.4% (27) of patients underwent surgery, of which 67% (18) had no histologic evidence of disease, 22% (6) had residual disease with clear margins, and 11% (3) had residual disease extending to margins. CONCLUSION: Vismodegib treatment, primary or neoadjuvant, preserves globe and visual function in patients with opBCC. Clinical trail identification number.NCT02436408. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Use of the antihedgehog inhibitor vismodegib resulted in preservation of end‐organ function, specifically with regard to preservation of the eye and lacrimal apparatus when treating extensive periocular basal cell carcinoma. Vismodegib as a neoadjuvant also maximized clinical benefit while minimizing toxic side effects. This is the first prospective clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy of neoadjuvant antihedgehog therapy for locally advanced periocular basal cell carcinoma, and the first such trial to demonstrate end‐organ preservation.","Kahana, Alon; Unsworth, Shelby P.; Andrews, Christopher A.; Chan, May P.; Bresler, Scott C.; Bichakjian, Christopher K.; Durham, Alison B.; Demirci, Hakan; Elner, Victor M.; Nelson, Christine C.; Kim, Denise S.; Joseph, Shannon S.; Swiecicki, Paul L.; Worden, Francis P.",Oncologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8265335/,351

METHODS: A cross-sectional, retrospective, comparative study was conducted on a total of 330 (48.2%) psychiatry trainees and 355 (51.8%) psychiatrists from Mexico through an online survey. Demographic features, professional activities and adversities, physical and mental health problems, self-care behaviors, and social support were examined. Comparative analyses and multiple logistic regression models were performed. RESULTS: Major depression, anxiety, and burnout were the most common mental health problems reported with a higher frequency of anxiety disorders in psychiatry trainees. Being a woman, having a physical health problem, and lack of restful sleep were the main risk factors in both groups. Consultation in the government sector and having patients with severe suicidal ideation affected more psychiatry trainees. Perceived discrimination and inadequate eating schedules were risk factors for mental health problems for psychiatrists. CONCLUSION: Psychiatry trainees constitute a vulnerable group for anxiety disorders. Particular attention should be paid to how students cope with the training experience to determine whether additional support is required. These professionals face major stressors leading to a high prevalence of depression, burnout, and anxiety. Encouraging psychiatrists to have better health habits is a step in the right direction, which must be accompanied by tangible organizational avenues to do so and creating a culture that truly promotes self-care.","Fresán, Ana; Guízar-Sánchez, Diana; Yoldi-Negrete, María; Robles-García, Rebeca; Tovilla-Zárate, Carlos-Alfonso; Heinze, Gerhard; Medina-Mora, María-Elena",Acad Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294267/,351

Recent tick invasions and range expansion in the USA has been attributed to climate and land use change, an increase in global travel, and importations of exotic animals. METHODS: A 10-year surveillance study was conducted on Block Island, Rhode Island, from 2010 to 2020 including sampling ticks from small mammal and avian hosts. RESULTS: We report the discovery and establishment of the red sheep tick (Haemaphysalis punctata) for the first time in the western hemisphere and in the US. This invasive species was first collected in 2010 on Block Island, was collected continuously throughout the study, and was collected from an avian host. We document the first report of the invasive Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis) in the state of Rhode Island, first observed at our sites in 2018. Finally, we present data on the range expansion and establishment of two native tick species, the lone star tick and the rabbit tick, on Block Island. CONCLUSION: This study emphasized the importance of long-term surveillance to detect changes in tick host communities, including invasive and expanding native vectors of potential significance to humans and wildlife.

20509,A Prospective Cohort Study of Bioavailable 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels as a Marker of Vitamin D Status in Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Disease,2021-07-23,"Toxoplasmosis, caused by the intracellular protozoon Toxoplasma gondii, is a significant parasitic zoonosis with a world-wide distribution. As a main transmission route, human infection can be acquired by the ingestion of T. gondii oocysts from the environment (e.g., soil, water, fruits and vegetables). Regarding the detection of T. gondii oocysts in environmental samples, the development of a time-saving, cost-effective and highly sensitive technique is crucial for the surveillance, prevention and control of toxoplasmosis. In this study, we developed a new method by combining recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) with CRISPR-Cas12a, designated as the RAA-Cas12a-Tg system. Here, we compared this system targeting the 529 bp repeat element (529 bp-RE) with the routine PCR targeting both 529 bp-RE and ITS-1 gene, respectively, to assess its ability to detect T. gondii oocysts in soil samples. Our results indicated that the 529 bp RE-based RAA-Cas12a-Tg system was able to detect T. gondii successfully in nearly an hour at body temperature and was more sensitive than the routine PCR assay. The sensitivity of this system reached as low as 1 fM with high specificity. Thus, RAA-Cas12a-Tg system provided a rapid, sensitive and easily operable method for point-of-care detection of T. gondii oocysts in soil, which will facilitate the control of T. gondii infection in humans and animals.","Ma, Qiao-Ni; Wang, Meng; Zheng, Lai-Bao; Lin, Zi-Qin; Ehsan, Muhammad; Xiao, Xing-Xing; Zhu, Xing-Quan",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401747/,351
20704,Acute kidney injury in ECMO patients,2021-08-31,"OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) as a marker of functional residual capacity (FRC) during the entire extubation procedure of very preterm infants. METHODS: Prospective observational study in preterm infants born at 26–32 weeks gestation being extubated to non-invasive respiratory support. Changes in EELI and cardiorespiratory parameters (heart rate, oxygen saturation) were recorded at pre-specified events during the extubation procedure compared to baseline (before first handling of the infant). RESULTS: Overall, 2912 breaths were analysed in 12 infants. There was a global change in EELI during the extubation procedure (p = 0.029). EELI was lowest at the time of extubation [median (IQR) difference to baseline: −0.30 AU/kg (−0.46; −0.14), corresponding to an FRC loss of 10.2 ml/kg (4.8; 15.9), p(adj) = 0.004]. The biggest EELI loss occurred during adhesive tape removal [median change (IQR): −0.18 AU/kg (−0.22; −0.07), p(adj) = 0.004]. EELI changes were highly correlated with changes in the SpO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (r = 0.48, p < 0.001). Forty per cent of FRC was re-recruited at the tenth breath after the initiation of non-invasive ventilation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The extubation procedure is associated with significant changes in FRC. This study provides novel information for determining the optimal way of extubating a preterm infant. IMPACT: This study is the first to examine the development of lung volumes during the entire extubation procedure including the impact of associated events. The extubation procedure significantly affects functional residual capacity with a loss of approximately 10 ml/kg at the time of extubation. Removal of adhesive tape is the major contributing factor to FRC loss during the extubation procedure. Functional residual capacity is regained within the first breaths after initiation of non-invasive ventilation and is further increased after turning the infant into the prone position.","Plastina, Leonie; Gaertner, Vincent D.; Waldmann, Andreas D.; Thomann, Janine; Bassler, Dirk; Rüegger, Christoph M.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8406659/,351
21291,Nosocomial exposure to tuberculosis: a snapshot of South Korea,2021-09-01,"[Image: see text] The monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme class is a prevalent target for many neurodegenerative and depressive disorders. Even though scrutinization of many promising drugs for the treatment of MAO inhibition has been carried out in recent times, a conclusive structural requirement for potent activity needs to be developed. Numerous approaches have been examined for the identification of structural features for potent MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) that mainly involve an array of computational studies, synthetic approaches, and biological evaluation. In this paper, we have analyzed ∼2200 well-known MAOIs to expand perceptions in the chemical space of MAOIs. The physicochemical properties of the MAOIs disclosed a discernible hydrophobic feature making a bunch discrete from the central nervous system (CNS) acting drugs, as exposed using the principal component analysis (PCA). The Murcko scaffold structure study revealed unfavorable and favorable scaffold structures, in both data sets, with the highest biological activity shown by the 3-phenyl-2H-chromen-2-one scaffold. This scaffold showed a polypharmacological effect. R-group disintegration and automatic structure–activity relationship (SAR) study resulted in identification of substructures responsible for the inhibitory bioactivity of the MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes. Moreover, with activity cliff analysis, significant biological activity was detected by simple molecular conversion in the chemical compound structure. In addition, we used the machine learning tool to generate a hypothesis wherein pyrazole, benzene ring, and amide containing structural functionalities can exhibit potential biological activities. This hypothesis revealed that CNS target drugs, C4155, C13390, C21265, C43862, C31524, C24810, C37100, C42075, and C43644, could be repurposed as valuable candidates for the MAO-B enzyme. For researchers, this study will bring new perceptions in the discovery and development of MAOIs and direct lead and hit optimization for the progress of small molecules beneficial for MAO-targeting associated diseases.","Kumar, Sunil; Nair, Aathira Sujathan; Bhashkar, Vaishnav; Sudevan, Sachithra Thazhathuveedu; Koyiparambath, Vishal Payyalot; Khames, Ahmed; Abdelgawad, Mohamed A.; Mathew, Bijo",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8444296/,351

They recognize their targets, i.e. MHC / peptide complexes, trough the T-cell receptor. TCR usage determines the molecular interaction of the immune system with biologically relevant MHC/peptide molecules. The TCR coding genes (variable, diversity and junctional) determine the molecular composition of the TCR alpha and beta heterodimer. The random association of the VDJ genes constitutes the complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3) responsible for antigen recognition and TCR specificity. The molecular composition of a T-cell population can be objectively defined by measuring the CDR3 region. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the TCR composition in different anatomic compartments, or longitudinally over time, allow to asses the entire TCR repertoire. This methodology can be supplemented with functional T-cell based assays and aids to objectively describe any alteration in the T-cell pool. TCR CDR3 analysis is useful in immunomonitoring, e.g. examining patients after BMT or solid organ transplantation, patients with HAART therapy, or patients receiving molecularly defined vaccines.","Maeurer, Markus J.",Analyzing T Cell Responses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120667/,351

Human sewage contains enteric bacteria as normal flora, and has the potential to contain parasites, bacteria and viruses which may prove pathogenic to Antarctic wildlife. Treatment can reduce levels of micro-organisms in sewage effluent, but is not a requirement of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty (the Madrid Protocol). In contrast, the deliberate release of non-native organisms for any other reason is prohibited. Hence, disposal of sewage effluent to the marine environment is the only activity routinely undertaken in Antarctica knowing that it will likely result in the release of large numbers of potentially non-native species. When the Madrid Protocol was negotiated, the decision to allow release of untreated sewage effluent was considered the only pragmatic option, as a prohibition would have been costly, and may not have been achievable by many Antarctic operators. In addition, at that time the potential for transmission of pathogens to wildlife from sewage was not emphasised as a significant potential risk. Since then, the transmission of disease-causing agents between species is more widely recognised and it is now timely to consider the risks of continued discharge of sewage effluent in Antarctica and whether there are practical alternatives.","Smith, J.

As a result, there may be large differences in total epidemic size from similar initial conditions. This work seeks to determine the extent to which the effects of behavior changes and metapopulation coupling on epidemic size can be characterized. While mathematical models have been developed to study local containment by social distancing, intervention and other behavior changes, their connection to larger-scale transmission is relatively underdeveloped. We make use of the assumption that behavior changes limit local transmission before susceptible depletion to develop a time-varying birth-death process capturing the dynamic decrease of the transmission rate associated with behavior changes. We derive an expression for the mean outbreak size of this model and show that the distribution of outbreak sizes is approximately geometric. This allows a probabilistic extension whereby infected individuals may initiate new outbreaks. From this model we characterize the overall epidemic size as a function of the behavior change rate and the probability that an infected individual starts a new outbreak. We find good agreement between the analytical results and stochastic simulations leading to novel findings including critical learning rates that demarcate large and small epidemic sizes.","Drake, John M.; Park, Andrew W.",Mathematical and Statistical Modeling for Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123051/,351

Understanding parasite dynamics for bats is important from a human public health perspective because of their role as natural reservoirs for recent high-profile emerging zoonotic pathogens (e.g. Ebola, Hendra) and from a bat conservation perspective because of the recent emergence of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America highlighting the potential population impacts of parasites and pathogens. Although some bat species are among the most gregarious of mammals, species vary widely in terms of their social behavior and this variation could influence pathogen transmission and impacts. Here, we review the literature on links between bat social behavior and parasite dynamics. Using standardized search terms in Web of Science, we identified articles that explicitly tested or discussed links between some aspect of bat sociality and parasite transmission or host population impacts. We identified social network analysis, epidemiological modeling, and interspecific comparative analyses as the most commonly used methods to quantify relationships between social behavior and parasite-risk in bats while WNS, Hendra virus, and arthropod ectoparasites were the most commonly studied host-parasite systems. We summarize known host-parasite relationships in these three systems and propose testable hypotheses that could improve our understanding of links between host sociality and parasite-dynamics in bats.","Webber, Quinn M.

To overcome this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses source and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by an arbitrary relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this generalized compiler correctness definition gives us when instantiated with a non-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not equality, it is no longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program unchanged. Instead, we provide a generic characterization of the target trace property ensured by correctly compiling a program that satisfies a given source property, and dually, of the source trace property one is required to show in order to obtain a certain target property for the compiled code. We show that this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior, resource exhaustion, different source and target values, side-channels, and various abstraction mismatches. Finally, we show that the same generalization also applies to many secure compilation definitions, which characterize the protection of a compiled program against linked adversarial code.","Abate, Carmine; Blanco, Roberto; Ciobâcă, Ștefan; Durier, Adrien; Garg, Deepak; Hrițcu, Cătălin; Patrignani, Marco; Tanter, Éric; Thibault, Jérémy",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7702255/,351
43093,The diagnostic accuracy of direct agglutination test for serodiagnosis of human visceral leishmaniasis: a systematic review with meta-analysis,2020-12-11,"INTRODUCTION: Controversy exists as to whether telephone clinics are appropriate in neurosurgical-oncology. The COVID-19 pandemic forced neuro-oncology services worldwide to re-design and at the University Hospitals Birmingham UK, telephone clinics were quickly implemented in select patients to limit numbers of patients attending hospital. It was important to determine how these changes were perceived by patients. METHODS: A 20-question patient satisfaction questionnaire was distributed to patients who attended neuro-oncology clinic in person (“face-to-face”), or via the telephone. Fisher’s exact test was used to determine significance, which was set at p< 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty questionnaires were distributed between June 2020 and August 2020. Overall, 50% (n=40) of patients returned the questionnaire, 50% (n=23) of face-to-face and 50% (n=17) telephone patients. Of those who received telephone consultations, 88% (n=15) felt the consultation was convenient, 88% (n=15) were satisfied with their consultation and 18% (n=3) felt they would have preferred to have a face-to-face appointment. Of those who attended clinic in person, 96% (n=22) felt their consultation was convenient, 100% (n=23) were satisfied with their consultation and 13% (n=3) would have preferred a telephone consultation. Within the face-to-face clinic attendees, only 13% (n=3) were concerned regarding the COVID risk associated with attending hospital. There was no significant difference in patient convenience or satisfaction (p=0.565 and p=0.174 respectively) between face-to-face and telephone clinics. There was no significant difference in whether patients would’ve preferred the alternative method of consultation (p > 0.999). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that careful patient selection for neuro-oncology telephone clinic is not inferior to face-to-face clinic. Telephone clinic during COVID-19 pandemic proved to be convenient, safe and effective. This global health crisis has transformed telephone neuro-oncology consultations from an experimental innovation into established practice and should be continued beyond the pandemic in select cases.","Toman, Emma; Goddard, Claire; Berki, Frederick; Garratt, William; Scott, Teresa; Sher, Zenab; Stevens, Andrew; Petrik, Vladimir; Ughratdar, Ismail; White, Anwen; Zisakis, Athanasios; Watts, Colin; Wykes, Victoria",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650481/,351

43679,A Rare Case of Myocarditis Mimicking ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction,2020-11-24,"BACKGROUND: People’s perceptions of pandemic-associated risk are key factors contributing to increased public participation in disease preventive measures. The aim of the study was to investigate risk perceptions regarding the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, among the general population. A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used with a convenience sample of 723 participants, recruited from the general population of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan. Data collection was performed using a standardized risk perception assessment questionnaire, in April 2020. RESULTS: The mean score for the perception of COVID-19 seriousness was significantly higher and the mean scores for the perception of disease susceptibility and extent of anxiety were also higher among Saudi Arabian participants than participants from Egypt and Jordan. Participants from Egypt had significantly lower mean scores for the perception of efficacy and self-efficacy to cope with COVID-19, and significantly lower intention to comply with COVID-19 precautionary measures than the other populations. A significant positive correlation was detected between the perception of COVID-19 seriousness and self-efficacy to handle COVID-19, for the entire sample. The primary reasons reported by participants driving their willingness to perform certain preventive measures against COVID-19 was a feeling of responsibility toward their own health, followed by preventing transmission to other people and the feeling that COVID-19 can be serious. Most of the study sample reported a desire to receive information about COVID-19 treatment, ways to prevent disease contraction, and the incubation period for the novel coronavirus. Also, most of the study sample reported that they prefer receiving COVID-19 updates from national authorities. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, communications designed to promote the adoption of preventive behaviors should focus on increasing the perception of seriousness, the risk perception, self-efficacy to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness of the adopted behavioral measures for reducing risk. Health education programs that are tailored to various sociodemographic categories, to improve public awareness, perceptions, and attitudes, are vital for increasing the adoption of outbreak preventive measures.","Shahin, Mahmoud Abdel Hameed; Hussien, Rasha Mohammed",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7753501/,351

In this paper, two diffusion models were built to simulate the diffusion behavior of elements in the coating or in the coating–substrate system. Firstly, a core–shell model was set up to investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of the localized microstructure. The results of the simulation successfully explained the mechanism of the formation of α(core)–γ′(shell) structure at lower temperature (750 °C) and γ(core)–β(shell) structure at higher temperature (1100 °C). Secondly, a coating–substrate planner model was used to simulate the interdiffusion of elements between the MCrAlY coating and the superalloy substrate. The simulation results in the Ni22Cr10AlY-superalloy system semiquantitatively agreed with the experimental observation. Furthermore, by applying the planner diffusion model, the effect of the MCrAlY coatings on the formation of TCP phases in the substrate was studied, and a GOODMAN map for designing TCP-limited MCrAlY coatings can be provided.","Xu, Zhenyuan; Yuan, Kang; Zheng, Zhaoran; Peng, Haoran; Liu, Jianming",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816750/,351
48682,Diagnostic Approach to a Patient with Coronavirus Disease,2020-10-06,"Sustainable transport modes, particularly micro-mobility, allows to reduce possible congestion phenomena in urban traffic. In this study, the aim is to make a contribution to increase micro-mobility use by exploring the impacts of socio-demographic, vehicle ownership (car, bicycle and micro mobility), level of infrastructure service and road users’ perception in safety, comfort and chaotic environment on renting micro-mobility in a shared urban street. The study area is a historical center called Via Maqueda in Palermo, Italy, which is rich in commercial and cultural activities. A survey with 200 individuals is carried out for the data collection regarding the aim of the study. The analysis starts with a descriptive statistics in order to illustrate the characteristics of the predictor variables. This is followed by relaxing p-value method for selecting the statistically significant predictor variables with 90% confidence level. These selected predictor variables are applied into an ordinal logit model. The results suggest that one unit increase in car ownership decrease the willingness of renting a micro mobility by log odds of −0.74, given all the other predictors are held constant. One unit increase in age group decrease the willingness of renting micro-mobility in shared urban streets. The outcomes will guide decision makers to understand who the average road users are and what are their needs in terms of further developments of the micro-mobility system in urban shared streets. The originality of this paper consists the perceptions of road users, such as safety and comfort, on micro-mobility that can encourage to use this sustainable urban travel mode in restricted traffic areas.","Campisi, Tiziana; Akgün, Nurten; Tesoriere, Giovanni",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978566/,351

Current studies have focused on determining whether turnout during the pandemic increased the risk of more cases of or deaths from COVID-19 and others focused on the potential impact of the epidemic on voter turnout and absentee voting. The present study explores, via hierarchical multiple regression, the powers of traditional variables to predict voter turnout while controlling for opinions on the safety measures for curtailing COVID-19. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey in Lagos, the epicenter of the pandemic in Nigeria. Results indicate a general tendency to believe COVID-19 is not real in Nigeria, and most of the safety measures in fighting against the virus are not essential. COVID-19 skeptics are significantly more likely to vote during the pandemic. However, since most skeptics do not have trust in government and hence abstain, voter turnout during the pandemic is likely to be very low because people who would have voted (i.e., those having trust in government) prefer not to turnout rather than contract the virus. The paper indicates the essentials of the social connectedness and political efficacy models for exploring the connection between COVID-19 and political participation.","Nwankwo, Cletus Famous",SN Soc Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8172249/,351

Adam Malik Medan,2021-10-08,"Whenever a system needs to be operated by a central decision making authority in the presence of two or more conflicting goals, methods from multi-criteria decision making can help to resolve the trade-offs between these goals. In this work, we devise an interactive simulation-based methodology for planning and deciding in complex dynamic systems subject to multiple objectives and parameter uncertainty. The outline intermittently employs simulation models and global sensitivity analysis methods in order to facilitate the acquisition of system-related knowledge throughout the iterations. Moreover, the decision maker participates in the decision making process by interactively adjusting control variables and system parameters according to a guiding analysis question posed for each iteration. As a result, the overall decision making process is backed up by sensitivity analysis results providing increased confidence in terms of reliability of considered decision alternatives. Using the efficiency concept of Pareto optimality and the sensitivity analysis method of Sobol’ sensitivity indices, the methodology is then instantiated in a case study on planning and deciding in an infectious disease epidemic situation similar to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Results show that the presented simulation-based methodology is capable of successfully addressing issues such as system dynamics, parameter uncertainty, and multi-criteria decision making. Hence, it represents a viable tool for supporting decision makers in situations characterized by time dynamics, uncertainty, and multiple objectives.","Dunke, Fabian; Nickel, Stefan",Ann Oper Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506089/,351
61018,Pregnancy and Perinatal Outcomes of Women With Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: A Preliminary Analysis.,2020-03-18,"The alveolar epithelium serves as a barrier to the entry of potential respiratory pathogens. Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response. Primary TI cells produce cytokines when treated with LPS, contain important components of the RAS, and can modulate LPS-induced cytokine production via the RAS, suggesting a role for TI cells in the innate immune response of the lung.","Wong, Mandi H; Chapin, Olivia C; Johnson, Meshell D",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2011-0289oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22205632/,351

Recently, emerging evidence has demonstrated that combinations of PARP and PI3K inhibitors could evoke unanticipated synergistic effects in various cancers, even including BRCA-proficient ones. In this work, a series of PARP/PI3K dual inhibitors were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their biological activities. It was found that compounds 9a and 23a exhibited excellent inhibitory activities against PARP-1 (9a: IC50 = 1.57 nM, 23a: IC50 = 0.91 nM) and PI3Kα (9a: IC50 = 2.0 nM, 23a: IC50 = 1.5 nM), and showed promising antiproliferative activities against both BRCA-deficient (HCT-116, HCC-1937) and BRCA-proficient (SW620, MDA-MB-231/468) tumor cells. 9a and 23a also exhibited considerable in vivo antitumor efficacy in an MDA-MB-468 xenograft mouse model, with TGI values of 56.39% and 48.77%, respectively. Additionally, 23a possessed promising profiles including high kinase selectivity and low cardiotoxicity. Overall, this work indicates 9a and 23a might be potential PARP/PI3K dual inhibitors for cancer therapy and deserve further research.","Wu, Zhengyang; Bai, Ying; Jin, Jiaming; Jiang, Teng; Shen, Hui; Ju, Qiurong; Zhu, Qihua; Xu, Yungen",European journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2021.113357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740547/,351

61856,The effect of alveolar dead space on the measurement of end-expiratory lung volume by modified nitrogen wash-out/wash-in in lavage-induced lung injury.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Autophagy has recently been shown to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and to contribute to antigen processing and presentation through the major histocompatibility complex. Genetic variation in the autophagy gene ATG16L1 has been recently implicated in Crohn's disease pathogenesis. The mechanisms underlying this association are not yet known, although experimental models suggest an inhibitory effect of autophagy on interleukin 1β (IL-1β) responses. Here, the effect of ATG16L1 genetic variation on cytokine responses has been assessed in humans. DESIGN AND SETTING Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals and patients with Crohn's disease with different ATG16L1 genotypes were stimulated with ligands for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4 and nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain 2 (NOD2), with or without the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Induction of cytokine production and related factors were measured at the mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, protein levels of ATG16L1 were assessed by western blot. RESULTS The present study demonstrates that cells isolated from individuals bearing the ATG16L1 Thr300Ala risk variant, which is shown to affect ATG16L1 protein expression upon NOD2 stimulation, display increased production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, specifically after stimulation with NOD2 ligands. In contrast, no differences were found when cells were stimulated with TLR2 or TLR4 agonists. These findings were confirmed in two independent cohorts of volunteers and in a group of patients with Crohn's disease. The increased production could be ascribed to increased mRNA expression, while processing of pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 activation was not affected. The effect of the ATG16L1 polymorphism was abrogated when autophagy was blocked. CONCLUSIONS The present study is the first to link the ATG16L1 polymorphism with an excessive production of IL-1β and IL-6 in humans, which may explain the effects of this polymorphism on the inflammatory process in Crohn's disease.","Plantinga, Theo S; Crisan, Tania O; Oosting, Marije; van de Veerdonk, Frank L; de Jong, Dirk J; Philpott, Dana J; van der Meer, Jos W M; Girardin, Stephen E; Joosten, Leo A B; Netea, Mihai G",Gut,https://doi.org/10.1136/gut.2010.228908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21406388/,351

The Contour Neurovascular System embolization device is a novel tool for the treatment of such intracranial aneurysms. We report on our experience with this device. METHODS Prospective clinical and radiological data were collected for all patients treated with the Contour device at our center. All our patients were treated on an elective basis. RESULTS We have treated 11 patients successfully with the Contour device to date. All patients were women with a mean (SD) age of 65.0 (6.4) years. In total, four basilar tip, two internal carotid artery, three middle cerebral artery, one anterior communicating artery, and one superior cerebellar artery aneurysms were treated. At 1-year follow-up, complete occlusion (Raymond Class 1) was seen in 55.56% (5/9) of cases, with 44.44% (4/9) having small neck remnants (Raymond Class 2). One patient declined 1-year catheter angiography and another had no further follow-up due to an unrelated medical condition. For six patients, 2-year radiological follow-up is available and shows stability. At 6 weeks, nine of the 11 patients had a modifed Rankin Scale score of 0, with two patients scoring 1 for headaches. Two patients had thromboembolic events, but there were no complications leading to permanent neurological disability or death. We additionally had three patients where the Contour device was attempted but was unable to be successfully used.

METHODS The American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network and the Robert Graham Center distributed weekly surveys from March 27, 2020, through June 15, 2020, to a network of more than 1960 physicians. Responses to the question, ""Could you please tell us about any financial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on your practice, if any?"" were analyzed using a grounded theory approach of qualitative analysis. The number of unique respondents who answered the financial impact question totaled 461 over the 12 weeks. RESULTS Severe declines in patient visits, causing drastic revenue reductions, greatly impacted the ability to serve patients. Primary care clinicians and practices experienced significant changes in several areas about financial implications: patient visits, financial strain, staffing and telehealth. DISCUSSION Preliminary findings revealed that even with Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as CARES Act, funding, business viability remains questionable for some primary care practices. CONCLUSIONS Low patient visits directly resulted in decreased revenues, which in turn, impacted staffing decisions and fueled telehealth implementation. It is difficult to predict whether patient visits will increase after June.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate the feasibility and technical aspects of robotic single incision for hepatobiliary surgery using the GelPort laparoscopic system in a preliminary animal study. METHODS We performed eight robotic single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) procedures, including four cholecystectomies and four lateral segmentectomy of the liver, in a porcine study using the da Vinci S-HD Surgical System. A single-channel GelPort access was placed through a 2.5-cm single incision for robotic access. A 12-mm camera port, two 8-mm ports for the robotic arms and one 5-mm port for the patient-side assistant were inserted. A Mini Loop Retractor was applied to retract the fundus of the gallbladder. The EndoWrist dissector and grasping forceps was introduced to fine-dissect Calot's triangle. The instruments were crossed to avoid ""sword fighting"" and clashing of instruments in the abdomen. The cystic duct was divided after double ligation and the gallbladder was removed. Hepatic transection was performed with bipolar Harmonic shears and LigaSure for vascular pedicles. RESULTS All robotic SILS procedures were completed (8/8, 100%). The cholecystectomies and hepatectomies were safely performed in average operating times of 70 min (±15) and 60 min (±20), respectively, with minimal blood loss. There were no conversions, re-interventions or extension of the skin incision. CONCLUSIONS Robotic hepatobiliary SILS is technically feasible and safe using GelPort as a single-incision access platform.

However, gastrointestinal barriers and antigen degradation impose significant hurdles in the development of oral vaccines. Live attenuated viruses and bacteria can overcome these barriers but at the risk of introducing safety concerns. As an alternative, particles have been investigated for antigen protection and delivery, yet there are no FDA-approved oral vaccines based on particle-based delivery systems. Our objective was to discover underlying determinants that can explain the current inadequacies and identify paradigms that can be implemented in future for successful development of oral vaccines relying on particle-based delivery systems. AREAS COVERED We reviewed literature related to the use of particles for oral vaccination and placed special emphasis on formulation characteristics and administration schedules to gain an insight into how these parameters impact production of antigen-specific antibodies in systemic and mucosal compartments. EXPERT OPINION Despite the long history of vaccines, particle-based oral vaccination is a relative new field with the first study published in 1989. Substantial variability exists between different studies with respect to dosing schedules, number of doses, and the amount of vaccine per dose. Most studies have not used adjuvants in the formulations. Better standardization in vaccination parameters is required to improve comparison between experiments, and adjuvants should be used to enhance the systemic and mucosal immune responses and to reduce the number of doses, which will make oral vaccines more attractive.","Gonzalez-Cruz, Pedro; Gill, Harvinder Singh",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1080/17425247.2021.1946511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34148474/,351

DESIGN Retrospective study (February 2010-September 2013). SETTING University veterinary teaching hospital. ANIMALS Eighteen dogs and 2 cats with intolerance of, or contraindications to, gastric feeding that underwent attempted FEJT placement. INTERVENTIONS All patients underwent attempted FEJT placement using a novel fluoroscopic wire-guided technique. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient data were collected including information about the FEJT placement and utilization of the tube postplacement. The primary diagnosis in dogs undergoing FEJT placement was pancreatitis in 61% of cases. The ability to achieve postpyloric access with the technique was 95% (19/20). Mean duration of the procedure in dogs where FEJT placement was successful was 63.8 minutes (SD, 28.6; min-max, 30-120 min). Mean fluoroscopy time was 19.4 minutes (SD, 11.5; min-max, 5.2-42.1-min). Esophagostomy site infection was a complication of FEJT placement in 2 dogs. The mean duration the FEJT remained in place in dogs was 3.8 days (SD, 2.2; min-max, 1-7 days), and mean duration of feeding was 3.6 days (SD, 2.2; min-max, 1-7 days). Vomiting was noted in 89% of patients prior to FEJT placement and was significantly reduced to only 24% of patients postplacement (P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS FEJT placement is a viable technique for providing postpyloric nutrition in dogs and cats intolerant of, or with contraindications to, gastric feeding.","Carabetta, David J; Koenigshof, Amy M; Beal, Matthew W",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/vec.12822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30861280/,351

The disinsertion of the PM would need increased contributions from intact shoulder musculature to generate shoulder torques. This study aimed to identify neuromuscular compensation strategies adopted by subpectoral implant breast reconstruction patients using novel muscle synergy analyses. Fourteen patients treated bilaterally with subpectoral implant breast reconstruction (>2.5 years post-reconstruction) were compared to ten healthy controls. Surface electromyography was obtained from sixteen shoulder muscles as participants generated eight three-dimensional (3D) shoulder torques in five two-dimensional arm postures bilaterally. Non-negative matrix factorization revealed the muscle synergies utilized by each experimental group on the dominant and non-dominant limbs, and the normalized similarity index assessed group differences in overall synergy structure. Bilateral subpectoral implant patients exhibited similar shoulder strength to healthy controls on the dominant and non-dominant arms. Our results suggest that 3D shoulder torque is driven by three shoulder muscle synergies in both healthy participants and subpectoral implant patients. Two out of three synergies were more similar than is expected by chance between the groups on the non-dominant arm, whereas only one synergy is more similar than is expected by chance on the dominant arm. While bilateral shoulder strength is maintained following bilateral subpectoral implant breast reconstruction, a closer analysis of the muscle synergy patterns underlying 3D shoulder torque generation reveals that subpectoral implant patients adopt compensatory neuromuscular strategies only with the dominant arm.","Leonardis, Joshua M; Wolff, Whitney L; Momoh, Adeyiza O; Lipps, David B",Journal of biomechanics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2021.110348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33744721/,351

Though approved for treatment of gastric ulcers, its use is limited due to adverse effects such as cytotoxicity. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a natural, non-toxic protein with high water-solubility and low immunogenicity, and is widely used as a nanocarrier for targeted drug delivery. In the present study, controlled release BSA-CBX nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by desolvation method to reduce drug cytotoxicity. These NPs showed desirable physicochemical properties such as particle size (∼240 nm), polydispersity index (0.08), zeta potential (-7.12 mV), drug encapsulation efficiency (72 %), and were stable for at least 3 months at room temperature. The drug was released from the BSA-CBX NPs in a biphasic manner in vitro following non-fickian diffusion. Computational analysis determined that the binding between BSA and CBX occurred through van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds with 93 % steric stability. Further, the cytotoxic assays demonstrated ∼1.8-4.9-fold reduction in cytotoxicity using three human cell lines (A549, MCF-7, and U-87). Subsequently, this novel CBX formulation with BSA as an efficient carrier can potentially be used for diverse biomedical applications.","Bharathala, Subhashini; Kotarkonda, Lakshmi Kanth; Singh, Vijay Pal; Singh, Rajni; Sharma, Pankaj","Colloids and surfaces.

High fat and high sugar diets account for the development of a low-grade inflammation which is the pathogenic common denominator of various chronic disease. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS)-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection affects all ages and especially frail elderly people and a nutri-tional intervention seems to be crucial in the course of this pandemic. The present review describes the properties of some vegetal products and their derivatives, such as Lupin sp., garlic, salvia and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) that can be exploit-ed for their beneficial effects, as preventive and/or nutritional treatment of coronavirus disease SARS-CoV2. DISCUSSION Lupin, salvia, garlic and EVOO share overlapping properties, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities. Quite importantly, these products and their derivatives are able to recover the expression of angiotensin con-verting enzyme expression 2 on cell membrane, otherwise suppressed by COVID-19 binding and entry into cytoplasm.

Even with advances in the management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) such as reperfusion therapies, complication rates are still high. During quarantine, patients presenting mechanical complications after AMI have increased in our institution. METHODS From a retrospective database analysis in our institution between the years 2004 and 2020, we identified 37 cases of VSR after AMI. Four chronic cases were excluded from our analysis. The primary endpoint was to identify baseline characteristics that increased 30-day mortality. RESULTS Among 33 acute cases of VSR, 24 cases were submitted to surgery. The 30-day mortality of the operated patients was 45.8%. From 2004 to 2019 our average number of operations of VSR was 1.9 cases/year with an increase to 4 cases/year in 2020. Diabetes mellitus, age, cardiogenic shock, and use of intra-aortic balloon pump were associated with significantly increased mortality using logistic regression. CONCLUSION We reported an increased number of mechanical complication cases from April to September 2020, compared to our historical records. Despite therapeutic advances, mortality rates remain high. Although the number of cases is small to conclude that the pandemic was responsible for this augmentation, we believe that it is related to the decreased number of patients seeking medical assistance.","Dallan, Luis R P; Dallan, Luis A O; Lisboa, Luiz A F; Mejia, Omar A V; Veronese, Elinthon T; Camilo, Juliana P M; Nascimento, Polyanna C M; Jatene, Fabio B",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834536/,351

A Systematic Review of Literature.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND The systematic implementation of evidence-based practice through the use of guidelines, checklists, and protocols mitigates the risks associated with mechanical ventilation, yet variation in practice remains prevalent. Recent advances in software and hardware have allowed for the development and deployment of an enhanced visualization tool that identifies mechanical ventilation goal variance. Our aim was to assess the utility of daily goal establishment and a computer-aided visualization of variance. METHODS This study was composed of 3 phases: a retrospective observational phase (baseline) followed by 2 prospective sequential interventions. Phase I intervention comprised daily goal establishment of mechanical ventilation. Phase II intervention was the setting and monitoring of daily goals of mechanical ventilation with a web-based data visualization system (T3). A single score of mechanical ventilation was developed to evaluate the outcome. RESULTS The baseline phase evaluated 130 subjects, phase I enrolled 31 subjects, and phase II enrolled 36 subjects. There were no differences in demographic characteristics between cohorts. A total of 171 verbalizations of goals of mechanical ventilation were completed in phase I. The use of T3 increased by 87% from phase I. Mechanical ventilation score improved by 8.4% in phase I and 11.3% in phase II from baseline (P = .032). The largest effect was in the low risk VT category, with a 40.3% improvement from baseline in phase I, which was maintained at 39% improvement from baseline in phase II (P = .01). mechanical ventilation score was 9% higher on average in those who survived. CONCLUSIONS Daily goal formation and computer-enhanced visualization of mechanical ventilation variance were associated with an improvement in goal attainment by evidence of an improved mechanical ventilation score. Further research is needed to determine whether improvements in mechanical ventilation score through a targeted, process-oriented intervention will lead to improved patient outcomes.

Here we evaluate ex vivo gene therapy followed by transplantation of single-cell or spheroid hepatocytes. METHODS Pig and mouse hepatocytes were isolated, labeled with zirconium-89 and returned to the liver as single cells or spheroids. Biodistribution was evaluated through positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient pig hepatocytes were isolated and transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the Fah gene. Animals received portal vein infusion of single-cell or spheroid autologous hepatocytes after ex vivo gene delivery. Portal pressures were measured and ultrasound was used to evaluate for thrombus. Differences in engraftment and expansion of ex vivo corrected single-cell or spheroid hepatocytes were followed through histologic analysis and animals' ability to thrive off 2-(2-nitro-4-trifluoromethylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione. RESULTS Positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging showed spheroid hepatocytes with increased heterogeneity in biodistribution as compared with single cells, which spread more uniformly throughout the liver. Animals receiving spheroids experienced higher mean changes in portal pressure than animals receiving single cells (P < .01). Additionally, two animals from the spheroid group developed portal vein thrombi that required systemic anticoagulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of spheroid- and single-cell-transplanted animals showed similar engraftment and expansion rates of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-positive hepatocytes in the liver, correlating with similar weight stabilization curves. CONCLUSION Ex vivo gene correction of autologous hepatocytes in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient pigs can be performed using hepatocyte spheroids or single-cell hepatocytes, with spheroids showing a more heterogeneous distribution within the liver and higher risks for portal vein thrombosis and increased portal pressures.","Nicolas, Clara T; Hickey, Raymond D; Allen, Kari L; Du, Zeji; Guthman, Rebekah M; Kaiser, Robert A; Amiot, Bruce; Bansal, Aditya; Pandey, Mukesh K; Suksanpaisan, Lukkana; DeGrado, Timothy R; Nyberg, Scott L; Lillegard, Joseph B",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2018.04.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884476/,351
100666,Postoperative intubation time is associated with acute kidney injury in cardiac surgical patients.,2014,"γδ T cells are a subset of nonconventional T cells that play a critical role in bridging the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. γδ T cells are particularly abundant in ruminant species and may constitute up to 60% of the circulating lymphocyte pool in young cattle. The frequency of circulating γδ T cells is highest in neonatal calves and declines as the animal ages, suggesting these cells may be particularly important in the immune system of the very young. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is a significant cause of respiratory infection in calves, and is most severe in animals under one year of age. BRSV is also a significant factor in the development of bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is closely related to BRSV and a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and children worldwide. BRSV infection in calves shares striking similarities with RSV infection in human infants. To date, there have been few studies defining the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to BRSV or RSV infection in animals or humans, respectively. However, emerging evidence suggests that γδ T cells may play a critical role in the early recognition of infection and in shaping the development of the adaptive immune response through inflammatory chemokine and cytokine production. Further, while it is clear that γδ T cells accumulate in the lungs during BRSV and RSV infection, their role in protection vs. immunopathology remains unclear. This review will summarize what is currently known about the role of γδ T cells in the immune response to BRSV and BRDC in cattle, and where appropriate, draw parallels to the role of γδ T cells in the human response to RSV infection.","McGill, Jodi L; Sacco, Randy E",Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.02.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26923879/,351

In a subsample of 82 participants, we compared the anthropometric information reported in the baseline questionnaire with the direct measurements collected by the investigating staff. To do this, we calculated the intraclass correlation index (ICC) and the Bland-Altman coefficient. RESULTS the ICC was 0.96 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-0.98 for weight; 0.95 (95 % CI: 0.92-0.96) for height; 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.64-0.86) for waist circumference; and 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.76-0.89) for hip circumference.

104922,Letter to the Editor: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 Impact on Oncofertility Services in Malaysia.,2020-10-22,"BACKGROUND Molecular estimates of breeding value are expected to increase selection response due to improvements in the accuracy of selection and a reduction in generation interval, particularly for traits that are difficult or expensive to record or are measured late in life. Several statistical methods for incorporating molecular data into breeding value estimation have been proposed, however, most studies have utilized simulated data in which the generated linkage disequilibrium may not represent the targeted livestock population. A genomic relationship matrix was developed for 698 Angus steers and 1,707 Angus sires using 41,028 single nucleotide polymorphisms and breeding values were estimated using feed efficiency phenotypes (average daily feed intake, residual feed intake, and average daily gain) recorded on the steers. The number of SNPs needed to accurately estimate a genomic relationship matrix was evaluated in this population. RESULTS Results were compared to estimates produced from pedigree-based mixed model analysis of 862 Angus steers with 34,864 identified paternal relatives but no female ancestors. Estimates of additive genetic variance and breeding value accuracies were similar for AFI and RFI using the numerator and genomic relationship matrices despite fewer animals in the genomic analysis. Bootstrap analyses indicated that 2,500-10,000 markers are required for robust estimation of genomic relationship matrices in cattle. CONCLUSIONS This research shows that breeding values and their accuracies may be estimated for commercially important sires for traits recorded in experimental populations without the need for pedigree data to establish identity by descent between members of the commercial and experimental populations when at least 2,500 SNPs are available for the generation of a genomic relationship matrix.","Rolf, Megan M; Taylor, Jeremy F; Schnabel, Robert D; McKay, Stephanie D; McClure, Matthew C; Northcutt, Sally L; Kerley, Monty S; Weaber, Robert L",BMC genetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2156-11-24; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20403185/,351

In response to alarming vaccines preventable diseases (VPDs) outbreaks resurgence, decreased vaccination coverage and vaccine refusal, several European countries have recently revised their vaccination policies introducing or extending mandatory vaccination. This review examines the health, political and ethical aspects of mandatory vaccination. AREAS COVERED The authors first clarify terms and definitions and propose a conceptual framework of mandatory policies. Second, the authors describe the current status of mandatory childhood immunization programmes in Europe and assess selected mandatory laws. Third, as the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature (retrieving from Medline 17 relevant records between 2010 and 2020), they take an analytical approach to measure the impact of mandatory vaccination policies on both VPDs control and immunization coverage, but also on population attitudes towards vaccines. 40% of European countries currently have mandatory vaccination policies; however, policies vary widely and, although there is evidence of increased vaccine uptake, their impact on informed adherence to preventive behaviors is scant. EXPERT OPINION Although mandatory vaccination policies might be needed to protect collective health in times of emergency, public health goals of VPD prevention and health promotion should primarily be pursued through health education and population empowerment.","Odone, Anna; Dallagiacoma, Giulia; Frascella, Beatrice; Signorelli, Carlo; Leask, Julie",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1912603; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896302/,351

METHODS This cross-sectional study was done in central, provincial, and local level health centers of the Government of Nepal to assess the perspective of medical doctors regarding COVID-19 pandemic readiness in their facility. Nonprobability sampling was used to collect 56 responses from doctors working in different hospitals of Nepal. An online survey was performed using a questionnaire tool, which was adapted from the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS Most of the participants were medical officers with an MBBS degree (32) followed by anesthesiologists (10). Thirteen participants worked in central hospitals (23.2%), 24 in provincial hospitals (42.8%) and 19 in local health centers (33.92%). The availability of adequate facemask was 84% in central hospitals, which was higher than provincial hospitals (66.7%), and local level health centers (77.8%). There were only 53.8% trained critical care providers in central hospitals and 29.2% in provincial hospitals. Nearly 38.5% (5) of central hospitals had measures for airborne isolation in place, whereas this was only found in 8.3% (2) of provincial hospitals surveyed for critical care facilities. Overall, only 2 hospitals had the provision of a negative pressure room with air exchanges.

107388,"Reply to ""Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: Is Lung Ultrasound the Better Choice?""",2020-10-28,"OBJECTIVE We recently recorded a high prevalence of inclusion body myositis (IBM) in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Whether myositis patients with SS differ from myositis patients without SS in terms of the characteristics of the myositis is currently unknown. Anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1 A (cN1A) has recently been proposed as a biomarker for IBM but is also frequent in SS. Whether anti-cN1A is independently associated with IBM is still an open question. We aimed to assess the significance of SS and anti-cN1A in myositis patients. METHODS Cumulative data on all myositis patients (EULAR/ACR 2017 criteria) screened for SS (ACR/EULAR 2016 criteria) in a single center were analyzed. Ninety-nine patients were included, covering the whole spectrum of EULAR/ACR 2017 myositis subgroups and with a median follow-up of 6 years [range 1.0-37.5]. The 34 myositis patients with SS (myositis/SS+) were compared with the 65 myositis patients without SS (myositis/SS-). RESULTS IBM was present in 24% of the myositis/SS+ patients vs 6% of the myositis/SS- group (p = 0.020). None of the IBM patients responded to treatment, whether they had SS or not. Anti-cN1A was more frequent in myositis/SS+ patients (38% vs 6%, p = 0.0005), independently of the higher prevalence of IBM in this group (multivariate p-value: 0.02). Anti-cN1A antibody specificity for IBM was 0.96 [95% CI, 0.87-0.99] in the myositis SS- group but dropped to 0.70 [95% CI, 0.48-0.85] in the myositis SS/+ group. INTERPRETATION In myositis patients, SS is associated with IBM and with anti-cN1A antibodies, independently of the IBM diagnosis. As a consequence, anti-cN1A has limited specificity for IBM in myositis patients with SS.","Levy, Dan; Nespola, Benoit; Giannini, Margherita; Felten, Renaud; Severac, François; Varoquier, Coralie; Rinagel, Marina; Korganow, Anne-Sophie; Martin, Thierry; Poindron, Vincent; Maurier, Francois; Chereih, Hassam; Bouldoires, Bastien; Hervier, Baptiste; Lenormand, Cedric; Chatelus, Emmanuel; Geny, Bernard; Sibilia, Jean; Arnaud, Laurent; Gottenberg, Jacques-Eric; Meyer, Alain",Rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab423; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974078/,351

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify evidence on transferability of surgical skills acquired on robotic VR simulators to the operating room and the predictive value of robotic VR simulator performance for intraoperative performance. METHODS MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science were searched systematically. Risk of bias was assessed using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for Education. Correlation coefficients were chosen as effect measure and pooled using the inverse-variance weighting approach. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the summary effect. RESULTS A total of 14 131 potential articles were identified; there were eight studies eligible for qualitative and three for quantitative analysis. Three of four studies demonstrated transfer of surgical skills from robotic VR simulators to the operating room measured by time and technical surgical performance. Two of three studies found significant positive correlations between robotic VR simulator performance and intraoperative technical surgical performance; quantitative analysis revealed a positive combined correlation (r = 0.67, 95 per cent c.i. 0.22 to 0.88). CONCLUSION Technical surgical skills acquired through robotic VR simulator training can be transferred to the operating room, and operating room performance seems to be predictable by robotic VR simulator performance. VR training can therefore be justified before operating on patients.","Schmidt, M W; Köppinger, K F; Fan, C; Kowalewski, K-F; Schmidt, L P; Vey, J; Proctor, T; Probst, P; Bintintan, V V; Müller-Stich, B-P; Nickel, F",BJS open,https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsopen/zraa066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33864069/,351

The average diet in India is low in iron and mostly of vegetable origin. This can be improved by increasing awareness of foodstuffs that are rich in iron and ensuring their availability. Objective The objective of the study was to assess the quality of information available on iron-rich foods and to assess their production and consumption in India. Methods This was a review of common textbooks for medical, nursing, and home science students; related policy and program documents; and government publications on production and consumption of various foodstuffs in India. Results Details of specific foods that are rich in iron have not been provided. Instead, food groups such as pulses, cereals, nuts, and green leafy vegetables (GLVs) have been mentioned that are good sources of non-heme iron. This is in spite of the fact that all the foodstuffs in these groups are not uniformly iron rich. Among cereals and pulses, rice and red gram dal (arhar) are the most commonly produced and consumed, though they have the lowest iron content. Spinach and mustard leaves believed to be iron rich and commonly consumed are among those GLVs having lowest iron content. Conclusion Details of 5-10 foodstuffs which have the highest iron content within each food group should be available in relevant books and documents meant for education, production, and consumption data.","Taneja, Davendra K; Rai, Sanjay K; Yadav, Kapil",Indian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijph.ijph_65_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985423/,351

121951,Continuous heart rate variability and electroencephalography monitoring in severe acute brain injury: a preliminary study.,2021-03-18,"Endoscopic approaches to the midline ventral skull base have been extensively developed and refined for resection of cranial base tumors over the past several years. As these techniques have improved, both the degree of resection and complication rates have proven comparable to those for transcranial approaches, while visual outcomes may be better via endoscopic endonasal surgery and hospital stays and recovery times are often shorter. Yet for all of the progress made, the steep learning curve associated with these techniques has hampered more widespread implementation and adoption. The authors address this obstacle by coupling a thorough description of the technical nuances for endoscopic endonasal craniopharyngioma resection with detailed illustrations of the important steps in the operation. Traditionally, transsphendoidal approaches to craniopharyngiomas have been restricted to lesions mostly confined to the sella. However, recently, endoscopic endonasal resections are more frequently employed for extrasellar and purely third ventricle craniopharyngiomas, whose typical retrochiasmatic location makes them ideal candidates for endoscopic transnasal surgery. The endonasal endoscopic approach offers many advantages, including direct access to the long axis of the tumor, early tumor debulking with minimal manipulation of the optic apparatus, more precise visualization of tumor planes, particularly along the undersurface of the chiasm and the roof of the third ventricle, and a minimal-access corridor that obviates the need for brain retraction. Although much emphasis has been placed on technical tenets of exposure and ""how to get there,"" this article focuses on nuances of tumor resection ""when you are there."" Three operative videos illustrate our discussion of technical tenets.","Conger, Andrew R; Lucas, Joshua; Zada, Gabriel; Schwartz, Theodore H; Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2014.7.focus14364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25270129/,351

127576,Clinical features of neurological patients with coronavirus 2019: an observational study of one centre.,2021-02-02,"INTRODUCTION Since Pall-German stopped manufacturing ITLC-SG, it has become necessary to validate alternative stationary phases. OBJECTIVE To validate different stationary phases versus ITLC-SG Pall-Gelman in the determination of the radiochemical purity (RCP) of (111)In-pentetreotide ((111)In-Octreoscan) by planar chromatography. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a case-control study, which included 66 (111)In-pentetreotide preparations. We determined the RCP by planar chromatography, using a freshly prepared solution of 0,1M sodium citrate (pH 5) and the following stationary phases: ITLC-SG (Pall-Gelman) (reference method), iTLC-SG (Varian), HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck), Whatman 1, Whatman 3MM and Whatman 17. For each of the methods, we calculated: PRQ, relative front values (RF) of the radiopharmaceutical and free (111)In, chromatographic development time, resolution between peaks. We compared the results obtained with the reference method. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program. The p value was calculated for the study of statistical significance. RESULTS The highest resolution is obtained with HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck). However, the chromatographic development time is too long (mean=33.62minutes). Greater resolution is obtained with iTLC-SG (Varian) than with the reference method, with lower chromatographic development time (mean=3.61minutes). Very low resolutions are obtained with Whatman paper, essentially with Whatman 1 and 3MM. Therefore, we do not recommend their use. CONCLUSIONS Although iTLC-SG (Varian) and HPTLC silica gel 60 (Merck) are suitable alternatives to ITLC-SG (Pall-Gelman) in determining the RCP of (111)In-pentetreotide, iTLC-SG (Varian) is the method of choice due to its lower chromatographic development time.","Moreno-Ortega, E; Mena-Bares, L M; Maza-Muret, F R; Hidalgo-Ramos, F J; Vallejo-Casas, J A",Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.remn.2013.01.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23499123/,351

We sought to understand the impact of the SAMMPRIS trial on current ICAD clinical practices and future trial design. METHODS During the ICAD symposium at the 2012 International Stroke Conference, electronic data were collected regarding attendees' clinical management of ICAD and opinions on the feasibility of future trials post-SAMMPRIS. RESULTS 217 attendees from different specialties, including neurologists (57%), neurointerventionalists (9%) and neurosurgeons (5%), participated in the session. The majority of respondents (77%) indicated that the results of SAMMPRIS have impacted their consideration for intracranial stenting. Post-SAMMPRIS, 84% selected 'SAMMPRIS-style' medical management for the treatment of ICAD. For patients with ICAD who failed aggressive medical therapy, 82% would consider an alternative approach to continuing medical therapy (30% considered clinical trial enrollment, 28% suggested angioplasty and stenting and 24% angioplasty). The majority of participants (85%) were willing to randomize patients with symptomatic ICAD in future trials. For the next ICAD trial, 29% indicated that angioplasty alone should be compared with aggressive medical therapy. CONCLUSIONS Our polling results suggest that the SAMMPRIS trial has had an impact on the current treatment of ICAD. Treatment of patients who failed medical therapy varied widely from aggressive medical therapy to balloon angioplasty, stenting or enrollment in future clinical trials. The willingness to continue clinical trials and randomize patients supports the need for future ICAD studies.","Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Nguyen, Thanh N; Becker, Kyra J; Derdeyn, Colin P; Nelson, Peter K; Amarenco, Pierre; Brott, Thomas G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23563478/,351

In this experiment, we examined the lethal and sublethal effects of heat shock on reproduction, feeding behaviour and antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidases (POD) in P. solenopsis. Results showed that males were highly susceptible to heat shock treatments than females, as LTemp50 values were 43.8 °C for males and 45.11 °C for females. Heat shock events non-significantly affected the fecundity in female only treated adults and significantly affected the both sexes heat treated adults, it increased the xylem feeding duration, percentage of xylem feeding adults and reduce the phloem feeding duration and percentage of phloem feeding adults. Similarly it alter the antioxidant enzymes activities, an increase of CAT, SOD and POD activities were noticed in response to highest intensity of heat shock while a reduction of CAT and SOD activity were noticed in response to lowest intensity of heat shock compared to control (30 °C). These results suggest that heat shock may result in loss of body water and induce oxidative stress in P. solenopsis.

RECENT FINDINGS Compared with pressure support, neurally adjusted ventilatory assist has been shown to improve patient-ventilator interaction and synchrony in patients with the most challenging respiratory system mechanics, such as very low compliance consequent to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and high resistance and air trapping due to chronic airflow obstruction; enhance redistribution of the ventilation in the dependent lung regions; avert the risk of patient-ventilator asynchrony due to sedation; avoid central apneas; limit the risk of high (injurious) tidal volumes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of varied severity; and improve patient-ventilator interaction and synchrony during noninvasive ventilation, irrespective of the interface utilized. SUMMARY Several studies nowadays prove the physiological benefits of neurally adjusted ventilatory assist, as opposed to the conventional modes of partial support. Whether these advantages translate into improvement of clinical outcomes remains to be determined.","Navalesi, Paolo; Longhini, Federico",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486574/,351
139043,Impact of the Prevalence on the Predictive Positive Value of Chest CT in the Diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).,2020-07-09,"INTRODUCTION The redundant skin left behind after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair overlies a dead space that is a potential site for seroma formation. This predisposes patients to surgical-site infection and compromises the cosmetic outcome of the procedure, which is a key feature of the minimally invasive approach. We present a simple technique to deal with this problem. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE This technique was used in six patients who underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. Two patients were men and four were women. At the end of the procedure, glue (fibrin sealant) was injected in the dead space underneath the redundant skin and pressure was applied for some time; this attached the excessive skin to the underlying tissue. This obliterated the potential dead space, reducing the chances of seroma formation, and improved the cosmetic outcome of the procedure. Patients were reviewed 8 weeks after the procedure, and their body contours had returned to normal, with no skin redundancy. DISCUSSION Minimally invasive surgery offers the advantage of a shorter hospital stay, faster recovery and improved cosmetic outcome, achieving better patient satisfaction as a result. This simple technique at the end of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, in which the redundant skin is attached to the underlying tissue, improves the immediate postoperative cosmetic outcome and also obliterates any potential dead space for seroma formation.","Karim, Muhammad Ali; Ali, Abdulmajid",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23602000/,351
139194,Cutaneous Manifestations of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection-What Do We Know So Far?,2020-05-11,"BACKGROUND We developed and compared two liquid chromatography (LC) methods, one with UV/Visible spectrophotometric detection (HPLC) and the other with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS), for quantifying very-long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) in human plasma. Association of VLCFA with various cardiovascular risk factors were evaluated. METHOD Fasting blood samples were collected from 541 human volunteers (242 men and 299 women; mean age Â±SD, 58.9 Â±12.4 years), including 429 and 112 individuals with and without hypertriglyceridemia, respectively. Esterified VLCFA were saponified and derivatized with 2-nitrophenylhydrazine. Separation of VLCFA species was achieved with C4 Mightysil column (HPLC) and Ascentis Express Phenyl-Hexyl column (LC-MS) followed by spectrophotometric and selected-reaction monitoring mode of mass spectrometric detection, respectively. RESULTS The HPLC assay of VLCFA was precise with intra-assay imprecision of 2.5% to 6.9% and inter-assay imprecision of 3.2% to 9.5%. Moreover, there was an excellent correlation (r > 0.96) between HPLC and LC-MS methods. The 95 percentile reference intervals (RI; upper limit) of VLCFA was determined to be 41.3 Î¼mol/L in healthy volunteers. Plasma VLCFA were significantly correlated with triglycerides (Spearmanâs ï²=0.306, p<0.001) and total cholesterol (Spearmanâs ï²=0.251, p<0.001). All species of VLCFA were significantly elevated in hypertriglyceridemic individuals compared to control. CONCLUSION We established LC-based assays of VLCFA with either spectrophotometry or mass spectrometry as a detection system. Hypertriglyceridemia is significantly associated with elevated concentration of each species of VLCFA.","Shrestha, Rojeet; Chen, Zhen; Gao, Zijun; Chen, Yifan; Okada, Emiko; Ukawa, Shigekazu; Nakagawa, Takafumi; Nakamura, Koshi; Tamakoshi, Akiko; Chiba, Hitoshi; Hui, Shu-Ping",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211007157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730871/,351

140608,Factors that confound the prediction of renal medullary oxygenation and risk of acute kidney injury from measurement of bladder urine oxygen tension.,2019,"BACKGROUND/AIMS Post-stroke neurocognitive disorders (post-stroke NCD) have been reported with a very variable prevalence. METHODS Based on a systematic literature search, hospital-based studies published between January 1990 and September 2015 were selected when they reported the prevalence of total, mild, and major post-stroke NCD diagnosed by using specified criteria. Factors affecting prevalence were assessed using meta-regression analysis. RESULTS Among the 7,440 references evaluated, 16 hospital-based studies were selected, corresponding to a total of 3,087 patients. The overall prevalence of total post-stroke NCD was 53.4% (95% CI: 46.9-59.8): 36.4% for mild post-stroke NCD (95% CI: 29-43.8) and 16.5% (95% CI: 12.1-20.8) for major post-stroke NCD. The overall prevalence was mainly influenced by the threshold score used for categorization (p = 0.0001) and, in the subgroup of studies using a conservative threshold (i.e., ≤7th percentile), by the recurrent stroke rate (p = 0.0005). The prevalence of major post-stroke NCD was mainly influenced by age (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION More than half of stroke survivors experience post-stroke NCD, corresponding to mild post-stroke NCD in two-thirds of cases and major post-stroke NCD in one-third of cases. Harmonization of stroke assessment and cognitive score thresholds is urgently needed to allow more accurate estimation of post-stroke NCD prevalence, especially mild post-stroke NCD.","Barbay, Mélanie; Diouf, Momar; Roussel, Martine; Godefroy, Olivier",Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,https://doi.org/10.1159/000492920; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30504699/,351

Little is known regarding how physicians have been affected. We aimed to characterize COVID-19 impact on NYC resident physicians.MethodsIRB-exempt and expedited cross-sectional analysis through survey to NYC residency program directors (PDs) April 3-12, 2020, encompassing events from March 2-April 12, 2020.ResultsFrom an estimated 340 residency programs around NYC, recruitment yielded 91 responses, representing 24 specialties and 2,306 residents. 45.1% of programs reported at least one resident with confirmed COVID-19: 101 resident physicians were confirmed COVID-19-positive, with an additional 163 residents presumed positive for COVID-19 based on symptoms but awaiting or unable to obtain testing. Two COVID-19-positive residents were hospitalized, with one in intensive care. Among specialties with >100 residents represented, negative binomial regression indicated that infection risk differed by specialty (p=0.039). 80% of programs reported quarantining a resident. 90/91 programs reported reuse or extended mask use, and 43 programs reported that personal protective equipment (PPE) was suboptimal. 65 programs (74.7%) have redeployed residents elsewhere to support COVID-19 efforts.ConclusionMany resident physicians around NYC have been affected by COVID-19 through direct infection, quarantine, or redeployment. Lack of access to testing and concern regarding suboptimal PPE are common among residency programs.

METHODS Sixty-one didactic-year PA students from one Midwestern University (2 sequential cohorts) were randomized to receive the standard PA curriculum plus EBM training (intervention) or the standard PA curriculum only (control). Evidence-based medicine knowledge was measured with a validated Fresno test. Self-efficacy was measured with a validated Likert scale. Clinical application of EBM skills was measured with an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). RESULTS Evidence-based medicine education led to significant improvements on the Fresno and self-efficacy tests, both within and between groups. On the OSCE, the intervention group performed no better than the control group. Higher Fresno pretest scores were significantly related to decreasing improvements in the posttest scores: R = -0.634. CONCLUSION Teaching EBM to PA students improved their EBM knowledge and self-efficacy but not their clinical application. Future research should focus on enhancing EBM evaluation and application in the clinical setting.","Stack, Matthew A; DeLellis, Nailya O; Boeve, Wallace; Satonik, Robert C",The journal of physician assistant education : the official journal of the Physician Assistant Education Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/jpa.0000000000000313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810055/,351

The analysis distinguishes SDOH from other determinants of health. Social determinants of health are defined as mutable societal systems, their components, and the social resources and hazards for health that societal systems control and distribute, allocate and withhold, and that, in turn, cause health consequences, including changes in the demographic distributions and trends of health. A systems conceptualization holds concepts such as ""race"" as the creations of social systems and as having negative consequences, such as racism, when part of a racist system, but potentially ameliorative consequences when part of an anti-racist system. The integration of SDOH into public health theory and practice may substantially expand the benefits of public health, but will require new theorizing, intervention research, education, collaboration, policy, and practice.","Hahn, Robert A",Journal of public health research,https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162174/,351

METHODS We searched PubMed® to identify original studies reporting the prevalence of H. pylori infection in occupational groups. The differences between occupational groups and the general population were analyzed taking into account the direction and statistical significance of the differences observed when comparing each occupational group with a reference group (either recruited in the same study or using an external comparator). RESULTS A total of 98 studies addressing the prevalence of H. pylori infection in occupational groups were included in the systematic review. Overall, health professionals showed a significantly higher prevalence of H. pylori infection than the general population, especially among those working at gastrointestinal units. Similar results were found in subjects involved in agricultural, forestry and fishery, as well as in sewage workers, miners, and workers at institutions for the intellectually disabled, although differences were less pronounced. CONCLUSIONS Our results show an occupational risk of H. pylori infection supporting the role of oral-oral, fecal-oral, and zoonotic transmission. Studies comparing specific occupational groups with adequate comparators may contribute to better identify groups at higher risk of infection. The recognition of this infection as an occupational disease would result in early detection and treatment, as well as prevention and control of its transmission in workplaces.","Kheyre, Hassan; Morais, Samantha; Ferro, Ana; Costa, Ana Rute; Norton, Pedro; Lunet, Nuno; Peleteiro, Bárbara",International archives of occupational and environmental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-018-1315-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29845564/,351

145875,Bioethics and informatics in medical studies during coronavirus disease 2019.,2020-07-04,"Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture capable of triggering inflammation and oxidative damage in animals at the pulmonary and systemic levels. Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) reduces tissue injury associated with inflammation in vivo by mechanisms that are not completely understood. Here we evaluated the effect of tempol on inflammation and oxidative damage induced by acute exposure to cigarette smoke in vivo. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 32) were divided into 4 groups (n = 8 each): 1) control group exposed to ambient air (GC), 2) animals exposed to cigarette smoke for 5 days (CSG), mice treated 3) prior or 4) concomitantly with tempol (50 mg/kg/day) and exposed to cigarette smoke for 5 days. The results showed that the total number of leukocytes and neutrophils increased in the respiratory tract and lung parenchyma of mice exposed to cigarette smoke. Likewise, MPO levels and activity as well as lipid peroxidation and lung protein nitration and carbonylation also increased. Administration of tempol before or during exposure to cigarette smoke inhibited all the above parameters. Tempol also reduced the pulmonary expression of the inflammatory cytokines Il-6, Il-1β and Il-17 to basal levels and of Tnf-α by approximately 50%. In contrast, tempol restored Il-10 and Tgf-β levels and enhanced the expression of Nrf2-associated genes, such as Ho-1 and Gpx2. In agreement, total GPx activity increased in lung homogenates of tempol treated animals. Taken together, the results show that tempol protects mouse lungs from inflammation and oxidative damage resulting from exposure to cigarette smoke, probably through reduction of leukocyte infiltration and increased transcription of some of the Nrf2-controlled genes.","Almeida da Silva, Danielba; Lopes Correia, Thiago Macêdo; Pereira, Rafael; Augusto da Silva, Robson Amaro; Augusto, Ohara; Queiroz, Raphael Ferreira",Chemico-biological interactions,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbi.2020.109210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726580/,351

This regimen is currently highly prevalent in the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has brought about increased concern about how best to safely avoid brachial plexus injuries when caring for unconscious proned patients. METHODS A review of the published literature on brachial plexus injuries secondary to proning ventilated patients was performed. This was combined with a review of available international critical care guidelines in order to produce a succinct set of guidelines to aid critical care departments in reducing brachial plexus injuries during these challenging times. DISCUSSION There is no one manner in which prone positioning an unconscious patient can be made universally safe. This paper provides 6 key steps to reducing the incidence of brachial plexus injuries while proning and suggests a safe and sensible management and referral pathway for the conscious patient in which a brachial plexus injury is identified. CONCLUSION There is in truth no completely safe position for every patient and certainly there will be anomalies in anatomy that will predispose certain individuals to nerve injury. Thus the injury rate cannot be reduced to zero but an understanding of the principles of protection will inform those undertaking positioning.,"Simpson, Ashley I; Vaghela, Kalpesh R; Brown, Hazel; Adams, Kate; Sinisi, Marco; Fox, Michael; Quick, Tom",Journal of intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620954787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959717/,351

In an effort to systematically investigate the structure/function relationships of transmembrane domains we had previously designed LV-peptides that mimic natural fusion protein TMDs in their ability to drive fusion after incorporation into liposomal membranes. Here, we investigate the impact of different structural features of LV-peptide TMDs on inner and outer leaflet mixing. We find that fusion driven by the helical peptides involves a hemifusion intermediate as previously seen for natural fusion proteins. Helix backbone dynamics enhances fusion by selectively promoting outer leaflet mixing. Furthermore, the hydrophobic length of the peptides as well as covalent attachment of long acyl chains affects outer and inner leaflet mixing to different extents. Different structural features of transmembrane domains thus appear to differentially influence the rearrangements of lipids in fusion initiation and the hemifusion-to-fusion transition. The relevance of these findings in respect to the function of natural fusion proteins is discussed.","Poschner, Bernhard C; Fischer, Konrad; Herrmann, Jana R; Hofmann, Mathias W; Langosch, Dieter",Molecular membrane biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/09687680903362044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19939203/,351

Offline digital education has the potential to improve the quality of health professions education. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of offline digital education compared with various controls in improving learners' knowledge, skills, attitudes, satisfaction, and patient-related outcomes. The secondary objectives were (1) to assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and (2) to assess adverse effects of the interventions on patients and learners. METHODS We searched 7 electronic databases and 2 trial registries for randomized controlled trials published between January 1990 and August 2017. We used Cochrane systematic review methods. RESULTS A total of 27 trials involving 4618 individuals were included in this systematic review. Meta-analyses found that compared with no intervention, offline digital education (CD-ROM) may increase knowledge in nurses (standardized mean difference [SMD]=1.88; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.62; participants=300; studies=3; I2=80%; low certainty evidence). A meta-analysis of 2 studies found that compared with no intervention, the effects of offline digital education (computer-assisted training [CAT]) on nurses and physical therapists' knowledge were uncertain (SMD 0.55; 95% CI -0.39 to 1.50; participants=64; I2=71%; very low certainty evidence). A meta-analysis of 2 studies found that compared with traditional learning, a PowerPoint presentation may improve the knowledge of patient care personnel and pharmacists (SMD 0.76; 95% CI 0.29 to 1.23; participants=167; I2=54%; low certainty evidence). A meta-analysis of 4 studies found that compared with traditional training, the effects of computer-assisted training on skills in community (mental health) therapists, nurses, and pharmacists were uncertain (SMD 0.45; 95% CI -0.35 to 1.25; participants=229; I2=88%; very low certainty evidence). A meta-analysis of 4 studies found that compared with traditional training, offline digital education may have little effect or no difference on satisfaction scores in nurses and mental health therapists (SMD -0.07; 95% CI -0.42 to 0.28, participants=232; I2=41%; low certainty evidence). A total of 2 studies found that offline digital education may have little or no effect on patient-centered outcomes when compared with blended learning. For skills and attitudes, the results were mixed and inconclusive. None of the studies reported adverse or unintended effects of the interventions. Only 1 study reported costs of interventions. The risk of bias was predominantly unclear and the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. CONCLUSIONS There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of offline digital education in improving learners' knowledge and insufficient quality and quantity evidence for the other outcomes. Future high-quality studies are needed to increase generalizability and inform use of this modality of education.","Posadzki, Pawel; Bala, Malgorzata M; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Semwal, Monika; Divakar, Ushashree; Koperny, Magdalena; Sliwka, Agnieszka; Car, Josip",Journal of medical Internet research,https://doi.org/10.2196/12968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017584/,351

Its timing and surgical management could be extremely challenging because extensive adhesions may heavily affect the approach to the abdominal cavity. PRESENTATION OF CASE We hereby report a case of EAF in a 70 year-old man. In order to control the fistula output and the surrounding tissue damage from enteric content, the patient was managed conservatively using different technical solutions. Finally, the patient underwent surgery that started with a laparoscopic approach in order to avoid the hostile abdomen. DISCUSSION Due to the lack of guidelines, treatment of EAF requires a multidisciplinary approach and different technical options based on the experience and inventiveness of the surgeon. Among others, the vacuum assisted wound management proved to be a useful support andlaparoscopy demonstrated to be valuable in approaching the abdominal cavity.

Diagnostic testing is critical for epidemiological surveillance, but the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) and clinical utility (impact on health outcomes) of the current diagnostic methods used for SARS-CoV-2 detection are not known. I ran a quick search in PubMed/MEDLINE to find studies on laboratory diagnostic tests and rapid viral diagnosis. After running the search strategies, I found 47 eligible articles that I discuss in this review, commenting on test characteristics and limitations. I did not find any papers that report on the clinical utility of the tests currently used for COVID-19 detection, meaning that we are fighting a battle without proper knowledge of the proportion of false negatives that current testing is resulting in.

Recently, research has suggested that colonies may be important as sources of social information. The ready availability of information from conspecifics allows animals to make better decisions about avoiding predators, reducing brood parasitism, migratory phenology, mate choice, habitat choice and foraging. These choices can play a large part in the development and maintenance of colonies. Here we review the types of information provided by colonial animals and examine the different ways in which decision-making in colonies can be enhanced by social information. We discuss what roles information might take in the evolution, formation and maintenance of colonies. In the process, we illustrate that information use permeates all aspects of colonial living.","Evans, Julian C; Votier, Stephen C; Dall, Sasha R X",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25882618/,351

The aims of the current study were to assess natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) as an alternative to transthoracic endoscopic surgery, and to test the feasibility of peroral transesophageal right upper pulmonary lobectomy with the assistance of a single transthoracic trocar. METHODS In 10 acute and 4 survival pigs, right upper pulmonary lobectomy was performed using a forward-viewing double-channel gastroscope and an operative thoracoscope with a 5-mm working channel inserted through a single transthoracic 12-mm) port. Time, safety, and feasibility of the following steps were recorded in all animals: esophagotomy, hilar dissection, individual ligation of the hilum elements, pulmonary lobectomy, and specimen retrieval. In the survival experiments, esophagotomy was closed using a reticulated laparoscopy suture device and an esophageal stent was placed. These animals were kept alive and monitored for 2 weeks. RESULTS Esophagotomy was performed safely in all animals (mean procedure duration 5.4 ± 1.7 minutes). Dissection of the right upper lobe hilum elements (bronchus, arteries, and veins) was carried out without adverse events. Individual ligation of the hilum elements was performed in all but two cases (time for dissection and ligation 44.2 ± 14.8 minutes). Lobectomy and specimen retrieval were completed in all animals (9.5 ± 3.1 minutes). Esophagotomy closure and stent placement were carried out in 20.0 ± 2.8 minutes in the survival animals. These animals fed normally and gained weight postoperatively without signs of disease. Endoscopic examination before necropsy revealed a pseudo-diverticulum in one animal, and wound dehiscence with confined collection/recess in the remaining animals. CONCLUSIONS Transesophageal right upper pulmonary lobectomy using single transthoracic trocar assistance is feasible and may represent a step towards scar-free pulmonary lobectomy.","Moreira-Pinto, J; Ferreira, A; Miranda, A; Rolanda, C; Correia-Pinto, J",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1291594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22438144/,351

RECENT FINDINGS Limited clinical studies suggest that an exposure-response relationship for posaconazole exists for the treatment of established invasive fungal diseases (IFDs), with emerging but less compelling data supporting its role in prophylaxis. The high prevalence of subtherapeutic levels has not translated to high prophylactic failure rates perhaps because of preferential uptake by effector cells important in the front-line defence against Aspergillus species. Nevertheless, TDM would appear prudent in patients deemed at highest risk for IFD with correction of patient modifiable factors and attention to drug administration important in optimizing drug exposure. TDM performed within a few days after commencing posaconazole may be predictive of steady-state levels, thus minimizing the delay in obtaining results in addition to identifying a subset of patients who may remain persistently subtherapeutic and also resistant to dose-escalation. Trough levels may be supplanted by untimed levels at steady state, thereby expanding the practicalities of TDM. We propose that TDM becomes one of the several measures in an integrated approach to IFD prevention combining screening of high-risk haematology patients for invasive aspergillosis at presentation, together with prospective surveillance for IFD, explicit criteria for switching to an alternative prophylactic agent and adherence to infection control practices. SUMMARY Growing evidence supports the value of TDM for posaconazole to identify patients who may benefit from correction of modifiable factors impacting bioavailability, dosage adjustment or switch to an alternative agent.","Ananda-Rajah, Michelle R; Grigg, Andrew; Slavin, Monica A",Current opinion in infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0b013e328359a56e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23086185/,351
161157,Early rehabilitation in a critically ill inpatient with coronavirus disease 2019: a case report.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Single incision thoracoscopic surgery (SITS) is recognized as a difficult procedure and surgeons hesitate to perform this technique. We describe our experience of SITS and determine whether SITS can be a routine approach in minimally invasive surgery. METHODS From May 2011 to April 2013, a single operator attempted SITS for 264 cases. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed with regard to age, sex, diagnosis, operation time, hospital stay, need of additional incision, morbidity, and early outcome. RESULTS A number of thoracic diseases and procedures were attempted with SITS including primary (n = 172) or secondary (n = 22) spontaneous pneumothorax, biopsy for lung (n = 29), pleura (n = 3), and mediastinal lymph node (n = 3), mediastinal mass excision (n = 11), empyema decortication (n = 11), lobectomy (n = 6), pulmonary metastasectomy (n = 3), pericardial window formation (n = 3), and hematoma evacuation (n = 1). Of these, 237 cases underwent SITS successfully. However, additional incision was needed in 10.2% (n = 27). Reasons for conversions were as follows: extensive pleural adhesion (n = 14), difficulty in endoscopic stapling (n = 11), bleeding (n = 1), and intolerance of one lung ventilation (n = 1). Conversion rate of empyema was 54.5%, which was the most difficult for SITS. In contrast, the conversion rate of PSP was 4.7%, which means PSP was the most applicable for SITS. Postoperative complications included air leak (≥ 3 days) (n = 1), wound problem (n = 4), delayed pleural effusion (n = 1), and postoperative bleeding (n = 1). CONCLUSIONS SITS can be a routine approach from simple to more complicated diseases. However, we still have difficulties in cases with extensive pleural adhesion or location of lesion with difficult accessibility for endoscopic stapling.","Song, In-Hag; Yum, Sungwon; Choi, Wonsuk; Cho, Sukki; Kim, Kwhanmien; Jheon, Sanghoon; Yang, Hee Chul",Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-8090-9-44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24607000/,351

162742,A guide to physical activity at home during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. (Special issue on COVID-19.) [Persian],2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consists of a severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract leading to an acute respiratory syndrome. But there exist other infectious respiratory syndromes that have the same initial respiratory symptoms, show similar pattern in the size of the antigenic proteins and release comparable cytokines pathways, but with an unlike response magnitude. Here we propose that COVID-19 disease wrong response in the host immune system can be explained in the perspective of the antigen viral size. In COVID-19 sepsis, the < 70 kDa antigens activate the B-cell receptor (BCR), which modulates the shift in the pattern of T-helper 1 (Th1) to Th2 cytokines, increases the release of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and the up-regulation of the membrane form of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), promoting the production of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)- and IgG3-neutralizing antibodies, but failing in IgG2a production and in developing long-lasting B-cell immune memory. The sustained infected cells lysis overfeeds high levels of viral proteins < 70 kDa, increases B-cell activation and, in the shift from a Th1 to a Th2 immune response, can trigger a cytokine storm. The continuous BCR activation increases IL-10 release that can lead to cytokine storm, apoptosis, and immune paralysis. Here, we propose a new vaccine design using the polymerization of viral antigens that could be ready in short time, would be cheap and easy to develop because it is based on classic technologies available in every country, is safe because it does not employ genetic material, and would able to promote long-lasting B-cell immune memory and IgG2a production.","Martín Oncina, Javier",Critical reviews in immunology,https://doi.org/10.1615/critrevimmunol.2020035601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900691/,351

Several aspects such as environmental, psychological and constitutional factors contribute to OA pain and they were enhanced during and after lockdown, for COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of the modified lifestyle forced by lockdown on joint pain using Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) scale. the variation of VAS pain, the reduction of physical activity, the variation of body weight, the stress values defined by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the use of anxiolytics and antidepressant drugs were measured in OA patiens during the lockdown period. Methods: 74 adult patients affected by primary or secondary OA were included. The median age was 69.8 years old and 55/74 (74%) of the patients were female. Sex, age, comorbidities, pharmacological therapy, variation rate of VAS pain referred to OA symptoms (0-100) during lockdown, weight variation, degree of physical activity (defined as: absent 0 h, low 1-5 h, moderate 6-10 h, high > 10 h) were recorded. Perceived stress using PSS was recorded and patients were divided into two classes: low (0-13) or moderate-high (14-40) stress scale. This observational retrospective real-life study was conducted in May 2020. A linear regression model was used to analyze the different patients groups separately. Overall variables were expressed on analogic scales. To assess the impact on VAS pain, regression models were estimated with VAS pain as dependent variable, and weight increase, physical activity and perceived stress as independent variable. Results: Patients enrolled with a pre lockdown VAS pain < 40 were 30, whereas 44 patients referred a pre lockdown VAS pain > 40. Patients taking anxiolytics, antidepressant, anxiolytics or antidepressant drugs were 14/74 (19%), 7/74 (9%), 19/74 (26%) respectively. PSS score Low (score 0-13), Med (score 14-26), High (score 27-40) was recorded in 34/74 (46%), 36/74 (49%), 4/74 (5%) patients respectively. Patients were divided in two different groups on the basis of baseline pre lockdown VAS pain: low VAS pain (< 40) (n=30) and moderate-high (≥ 40) (n=44). In the low-VAS group there was an average increase of pain by 1,36 points, an average increase of weight by 0.63 kg, and an average decrease of weekly physical activity by 6.4 hours that was statistically relevant (p< 0.0001). In moderate-high VAS group an average increase of pain and weight, by 2.62 points and 0.35 kg respectively, and a significant decrease of physical activity by 3.15 h weekly (p< 0.0001) has been recorded In low VAS group, 43% of the patients perceived low stress values vs 57% moderate-high. In VAS > 40 group 47% of the patients perceived low stress value vs 53% high-moderate. 80% of low-VAS <group did not take anxiolytics and antidepressant drugs and for this cluster of patients was not recorded a VAS increase regardless of PSS. 16.7% of patients (5/30) with VAS < 40, taking anxiolytics / antidepressant medications and with a moderate-high PSS displayed an average increase of VAS pain by 20 mm. In the VAS > 40 group a VAS variation was not recorded, regardless of taking anxiolytics / antidepressant medications and PSS. Conclusion: Lockdown impact on OA pain has been higher in the cluster of patients who were taking anxiolytics / antidepressant drugs with a moderate-high PSS. VAS pain increase in this cluster of patients exceeds minimal clinically relevant difference reported in literature 1. A relevant physical activity decrease which might negatively impact on OA course has also been recorded.","Orsini, F.; De Lucia, O.; Ingegnoli, F.; Cincinelli, G.; Armentaro, G.; Di Taranto, R.; Caporali, R.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.2688,351

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic that caught the world unaware is just a recent example that reveals how people are affected by sudden threats and uncertainty. This chapter analyzes the importance and implications of Soft Skills to learn from failure, an attitude that has been suppressed and marginalized but needs urgent activation to face unavoidable disruption in the VUCA environment. It considers dealing with failure as a tool needed for survival in uncertain and volatile environments. Virtual reality offers several advantages to complement Soft Skills learning creating simulations of reality to engage learners that may include intricate discussions with team members, conflicting situations, practicing listening skills, empathy and agility. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic is inducing the shift to virtual interactions that will increasingly replace face-to-face meetings and will require a constant change in Soft Skills.

186472,Risk factors for extubation failure in infants with severe acute bronchiolitis.,2010,"INTRODUCTION: Based in Belfast, the Royal Victoria Hospital is the only Major Trauma Centre in Northern Ireland. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 23rd March 2020, Northern Ireland was placed into ‘lockdown' with the majority of the population advised to “stay at home”. The objective of this paper is to identify what effect the lockdown restrictions had on the workload of the Major Trauma Service at the Royal Victoria Hospital. METHOD: Patients were identified at the orthopaedic trauma meetings and from direct referral to the Major Trauma Service (MTS). Patients admitted and seen by the MTS from 23/03/20, the day lockdown was announced, to 29/05/20, when restrictions were partially lifted, were included in the analysis. Admissions data from this time period was then compared to admissions data from the same period in 2019 (23/03/19 - 29/05/19). RESULTS: When comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown groups there was an overall decrease of 26% in admissions to the MTS (n=57 vs n=42). Road Traffic Accidents were reduced by 53% (n=31 vs n=15) and falls from >2m were reduced by 29% (n=21 vs n=15). CONCLUSION: Overall the number of admissions to the major trauma service was reduced during the lockdown period. A significant proportion of the reduction may be a result of social restrictions that reduced volume of traffic on Northern Irelands roads. Further study of future lockdowns and including admissions data of other MTCs in the UK would allow us to draw more robust conclusions.","Jefferies, Owen; Kealey, David; Yoong, Susan; Houston, Ruth; Tennyson, Caoimhe",Ulster Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7907901/,351

Biggs and associates at the Houghton Poultry Research Station (HPRS) in England attenuated HPRS-16, the first cell-culture-isolated MDV strain, by passaging HPRS-16 in chick kidney cells. Although HPRS-16/Att was the first commercially available vaccine, it never became widely used and was soon replaced by the FC126 strain of herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) vaccine developed by Witter and associates at the Regional Poultry Research Laboratory (now Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory [ADOL]) in East Lansing, MI. Ironically, Kawamura et al. isolated a herpesvirus from kidney cell cultures from turkeys in 1969 but never realized its potential as a vaccine against MD. Rispens of the Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) developed the third vaccine. His associate, Maas, had found commercial flocks of chickens with MDV antibodies but without MD. Subsequently, Rispens isolated a very low pathogenic strain from hen number 988 from his MD antibody-positive flock, which was free of avian leukosis virus and clinical MD. This isolate became the CVI-988 vaccine used mostly in The Netherlands. During the late 1970s, HVT was no longer fully protective against some new emerging field strains. The addition of SB-1, isolated by Schat and Calnek, to HVT improved protection against the emerging very virulent strains. In the 1990s CVI-988 became the worldwide vaccine gold standard. This review will present data from published papers and personal communications providing additional information about the exciting 15-yr period after the isolation of MDV to the development of the different vaccines.","Schat, Karel A",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27902902/,351

However, it is challenging to model the behavior of epidemics based on social contact networks due to their high dynamics. Traditional models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model ignore the crowding or protection effect and thus has some unrealistic assumption. In this paper, we consider the crowding or protection effect and develop a novel model called improved SIR model. Then, we use both deterministic and stochastic models to characterize the dynamics of epidemics on social contact networks. The results from both simulations and real data set conclude that the epidemics are more likely to outbreak on social contact networks with higher average degree. We also present some potential immunization strategies, such as random set immunization, dominating set immunization, and high degree set immunization to further prove the conclusion.","Zhang, Zhaoyang; Wang, Honggang; Wang, Chonggang; Fang, Hua",IEEE transactions on emerging topics in computing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27722037/,351
196474,From the Operating Room to the Front Lines: Shared Experiences of Nurse Anesthetists During the Coronavirus Pandemic.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND We postulate that hypercytokinemia plays a role in immunopathogenesis of severe human influenza. METHODS We prospectively studied 39 consecutive patients who were hospitalized with severe influenza A virus infection. On laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, paired acute-phase (obtained at hospital admission) and convalescent-phase (obtained >10 days after hospital admission) plasma samples were collected for assay of 11 cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL] 1 beta; IL-6; IL-10; IL-12p70; tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL-8; monokine induced by interferon [IFN]-gamma; IFN-inducible protein 10; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; regulated upon activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted; and IFN-gamma) using cytometric bead-array analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Simultaneously, virus concentration in the acute-phase nasopharyngeal aspirate was determined using real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Intracellular signaling molecules regulating lymphocyte activation, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were studied in the acute-phase samples using flow cytometric analysis and were compared with results for samples from healthy control subjects. RESULTS Statistically significant increases in plasma IL-6 (3.7-fold increase), IL-8 (2.6-fold increase), IFN-induced protein 10 (4.9-fold increase), and monokine induced by IFN-gamma (2.3-fold increase) concentrations were detected during acute illness (P < .01 for all, by Wilcoxon signed-rank test); the highest concentrations were observed on symptom days 3 and 4. Corresponding plasma cytokine and chemokine concentrations and nasopharyngeal viral loads showed statistically significant correlations (rho = 0.41, 0.49, 0.54, and 0.46, respectively; P < or = .01). Phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase expression in CD4+ lymphocytes was increased, correlating with cytokine concentrations (e.g., for IFN-induced protein 10, rho = 0.78; P < .01); phospho-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase was suppressed. Advanced age and comorbidity were associated with aberrant IL-6, IL-8, and monokine induced by IFN-gamma responses (P < .05, by Mann-Whitney U test). An elevated IL-6 concentration was independently associated with prolonged hospitalization (hospitalization for >5 days; P = .02), adjusted for age, comorbidity, and virus load. CONCLUSIONS Hypercytokinemia (of proinflammatory and T helper 1 cytokines) is detected in severe influenza, correlating with clinical illness and virus concentration. Hyperactivation of phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (in T helper cells) is possibly involved. Early viral suppression may attenuate these potentially deleterious cytokine responses.","Lee, N; Wong, C K; Chan, P K S; Lun, S W M; Lui, G; Wong, B; Hui, D S C; Lam, C W K; Cockram, C S; Choi, K W; Yeung, A C M; Tang, J W; Sung, J J Y",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17712756/,351

Twenty-four female Landrace/Large-White piglets aged 10-15 weeks with average weight of 19 ± 2 kg were randomly assigned to 2 different groups of 12 subjects each. After the end of an 8-minute ventricular fibrillation, the control group (Group C) received saline as placebo, whereas the EPO group (Group E) received EPO 5000 U/kg. The animals were resuscitated according to the 2010 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines for Resuscitation. Results. Five animals (41.67%) from Group C and 11 animals (91.67%) from Group E achieved ROSC (p = 0.027). Eight animals (66.67%, 5 surviving and 3 nonsurviving) from Group C suffered severe kidney damage or AKI compared to animals from Group E, in which none of the swine had evidence of severe kidney damage or AKI (p = 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in all tested biochemical markers between the two groups, as well as a positive correlation of creatinine with NGAL, L-FABP, and IL-18 (summed mean values' p = 0.049, 0.01, and 0.004, resp.).

METHODS A total of 67 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by nucleic acid testing were included and divided into 4 groups according to the clinical staging based on Diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Trial version 6). The CT imaging characteristics were analyzed among patients with different clinical types. RESULTS Among 67 patients, 3 (4.5%) were mild cases, 35 (52.2%) were ordinary cases, 22 (32.8%) were severe cases, and 7 (10.4%) were critically ill. There were no abnormal CT findings in mild cases. In 35 ordinary cases, there were single lesions in 3 cases (8.6%) and multiple lesions in 33 cases (91.4%), while in severe case 1 case had single lesion (4.5%) and 21 had multiple lesions (95.5%). CT images of ordinary patients were mainly manifested as solid plaque shadow and halo sign (18/35, 51.4%); while fibrous strip shadow with ground glass shadow was more frequent in severe cases (7/22, 31.8%). Consolidation shadow as the main lesion was observed in 7 cases, and all of them were severe or critical ill patients. CONCLUSIONS CT images in patients with different clinical types of COVID-19 have characteristic manifestations, and solid shadow may predict severe and critical illness.","Zhong, Qi; Li, Zhi; Shen, Xiaoyong; Xu, Kaijin; Shen, Yihong; Fang, Qiang; Chen, Feng; Liang, Tingbo",Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

The data were analyzed by means of panel mixed logit models. RESULTS: The prevention of deaths and financial problems of households had a very strong influence on the uptake of the app. Predicted app uptake rates ranged from 24% to 78% for the worst and best possible app for these societal effects. We found a strong positive relationship between people's trust in government and people's propensity to install the DCT app. CONCLUSIONS: The uptake levels we find are much more volatile than the uptake levels predicted in comparable studies that did not include societal effects in their discrete choice experiments. Our finding that the societal effects are a major factor in the uptake of the DCT app results in a chicken-or-the-egg causality dilemma. That is, the societal effects of the app are severely influenced by the uptake of the app, but the uptake of the app is severely influenced by its societal effects.","Mouter, Niek; Collewet, Marion; de Wit, G Ardine; Rotteveel, Adrienne; Lambooij, Mattijs S; Kessels, Roselinde",Value Health,,351

206891,Impact of lockdown on patients with congestive heart failure during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2020,"Response Gene to Complement 32 (RGC-32) is an important mediator of the TGF-ß signaling pathway, and an increasing amount of evidence implicates this protein in regulating astrocyte biology. We showed recently that spinal cord astrocytes in mice lacking RGC-32 display an immature phenotype reminiscent of progenitors and radial glia, with an overall elongated morphology, increased proliferative capacity, and increased expression of progenitor markers when compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts that make them incapable of undergoing reactive changes during the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, in order to decipher the molecular networks underlying RGC-32's ability to regulate astrocytic maturation and reactivity, we performed next-generation sequencing of RNA from WT and RGC-32 knockout (KO) neonatal mouse brain astrocytes, either unstimulated or stimulated with the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-ß. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that RGC-32 is critical for the TGF-ß-induced up-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in brain development and tissue remodeling, such as axonal guidance molecules, transcription factors, extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins, and proteoglycans. Our next-generation sequencing of RNA analysis also demonstrated that a lack of RGC-32 results in a significant induction of WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (Wdfy1) and stanniocalcin-1 (Stc1). Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cords isolated from normal adult mice and mice with EAE at the peak of disease showed that RGC-32 is necessary for the in vivo expression of ephrin receptor type A7 in reactive astrocytes, and that the lack of RGC-32 results in a higher number of homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX)+ and CD133+ radial glia cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that RGC-32 plays a major role in modulating the transcriptomic changes in astrocytes that ultimately lead to molecular programs involved in astrocytic differentiation and reactive changes during neuroinflammation.","Tatomir, Alexandru; Beltrand, Austin; Nguyen, Vinh; Courneya, Jean-Paul; Boodhoo, Dallas; Cudrici, Cornelia; Muresanu, Dafin F; Rus, Violeta; Badea, Tudor C; Rus, Horea",Front Immunol,,351

Three driving simulator experiment scenarios were developed to simulate the typical traffic and weather conditions on the rural Interstate 80 (I-80) in Wyoming. A total of 25 professional drivers from the WYDOT and trucking industry were recruited to participate in the driving simulator experiment. Participants' instantaneous speeds at various locations were collected to reveal the effects of CV TIMs on their speed selection. The results showed that average speed profiles under CV scenarios were generally lower than under baseline scenarios, particularly for winter conditions (snowy and severe weather). The variance of speed under CV scenarios was found to be significantly lower than the baseline scenarios, indicating that CV TIMs have the potential to harmonize the variations in speed. In addition, for the work zone driving simulator experiment, this research revealed that the mean time-to-collision (TTC) under baseline scenario is approximately 40 % lower than CV scenario, and the mean deceleration to avoid a crash (DRAC) under baseline scenario is approximately 19.3 % higher than CV scenario. These findings suggest that CV TIMs can reduce the risk of crashes. Research findings would provide the WYDOT with early insights into the effectiveness of CV TIMs, which could assist with developing more efficient transportation management strategies under adverse weather conditions.","Yang, Guangchuan; Ahmed, Mohamed; Gaweesh, Sherif; Adomah, Eric",Accid Anal Prev,,351

We examined the relationship between the number of COVID-19 swab tests (per 10,000 population) performed from February 24 through March 27 and 7-day lagged COVID-19 mortality (per 10,000 population) in four regions of northern Italy. Lombardy, Piedmont, and initially, also Emilia-Romagna, which followed recommendations for limiting swab testing to symptomatic subjects requiring hospitalization, had a much steeper increase in mortality with increasing number of tests performed than Veneto, which applied a policy of broader testing. The relationship between tests performed and mortality declined in Emilia-Romagna in coincidence with a substantial increase in the number of tests performed on March 18. When the cumulative number of tests performed was regressed linearly toward lagged mortality in Lombardy and Veneto, the slope of the regression was 133 in Veneto and 10.4 tests per one death in Lombardy. These findings suggest that the strategy adopted in Veneto, similar to that in South Korea, was effective in containing COVID-19 epidemics and should be applied in other regions of Italy and countries in Europe.","Di Bari, Mauro; Balzi, Daniela; Carreras, Giulia; Onder, Graziano",Front Med (Lausanne),,351

METHODS: Open-ended questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination were posed to a national cohort of 14- to 24-year-olds (October 30, 2020). Responses were coded through qualitative thematic analysis. Multivariable logistic regression tested the association of demographic characteristics with vaccination unwillingness. RESULTS: Among 911 respondents (response rate = 79.4%), 75.9% reported willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 42.7% had unconditional willingness, and 33.3% were conditionally willing, of which the majority (80.7%) were willing if experts deemed vaccination safe and recommended. Preferred vaccine information sources were medical organizations (42.3%; CDC, WHO) and health care professionals (31.7%). Frequent concerns with vaccination included side effects (36.2%) and efficacy (20.1%). Race predicted vaccination unwillingness (Black: odds ratio = 3.31; and Asian: odds ratio = .46, compared with white, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Most youth in our national sample were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when they believe it is safe and recommended. Public health experts and organizations must generate youth-centered materials that directly address their vaccination concerns.","Brandt, Eric J; Rosenberg, Julia; Waselewski, Marika E; Amaro, Xochitl; Wasag, Jacob; Chang, Tammy",J Adolesc Health,,351
212311,Thrombosis at hospital presentation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019,2020,"BACKGROUND: Increased access to home-based medical abortion may offer women a convenient, safe and effective abortion method, reduce burdens on healthcare systems and support social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Home-based medical abortion is defined as any abortion where mifepristone, misoprostol or both medications are taken at home. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies (NRSs) were conducted. We searched databases from inception to 10 July 2019 and 14 June 2020. Successful abortion was the main outcome of interest. Eligible studies were RCTs and NRSs studies with a concurrent comparison group comparing home versus clinic-based medical abortion. Risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% CIs were calculated. Estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess risk of bias by outcome and to evaluate the overall quality of the evidence. RESULTS: We identified 6277 potentially eligible published studies. Nineteen studies (3 RCTs and 16 NRSs) were included with 11 576 women seeking abortion up to 9 weeks gestation. Neither the RCTs nor the NRS found any difference between home-based and clinic-based administration of medical abortion in having a successful abortion (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01, I2=0%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.01, I2=52%, respectively). The certainty of the evidence for the 16 NRSs was downgraded from low to very low due to high risk of bias and publication bias. The certainty of the evidence for the three RCTs was downgraded from high to moderate by one level for high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Home-based medical abortion is effective, safe and acceptable to women. This evidence should be used to expand women's abortion options and ensure access to abortion for women during COVID-19 and beyond.

212944,Management of hospitalised adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a European Respiratory Society living guideline,2021,"Contact tracing has emerged as one of the main mitigation strategies to prevent the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. Recently, several efforts have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties. Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest.

217466,"Chest-X-ray-Based Scoring, Total Leukocyte Count, and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio for Prediction of COVID-19 in Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness",2021,"BACKGROUND: Early weaning in yak calves is being attempted to improve yak reproduction rate. However, this has to be done with caution because of the high mortality rate of calves due to the lack of nutrients and the harsh environmental conditions. Twenty-four weaned male yak calves were used in a 60 day feeding trial in which astragalus root extract (ARE) was supplemented. They were assigned randomly to one of four dietary treatments (n = six per treatment) that differed in ARE level: 0 g kg-1 (control), ARE0 ; 20 g kg-1 , ARE20 ; 50 g kg-1 , ARE50; and 80 g kg-1 dry matter intake (DMI), ARE80 . RESULTS: Final bodyweight and average daily gain (ADG) were significantly higher and the DMI/ADG ratio was significantly lower in calves with ARE supplementation than control (ARE0 ) calves. Ruminal concentrations of acetate and propionate and serum concentration of superoxide dismutase in ARE80 calves were higher than in the other groups and serum concentration of insulin was higher in ARE80 calves than in ARE20 calves. Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) concentrations in ARE-fed calves were higher than in controls. Serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;) concentration was higher in ARE50 and ARE80 groups than ARE0 calves and serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration was higher in ARE80 than in ARE0 calves. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG and immunoglobulin M (IgM) concentrations increased with age in ARE-fed calves. ARE supplementation increased the abundance of fiber degrading bacteria. CONCLUSION: ARE at a dosage of 5% to 8% DMI can be supplemented to early weaned yak calves to improve growth performance, antioxidant capacity and immunity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.","Wei, Haiyan; Ding, Luming; Wang, Xianju; Yan, Qi; Jiang, Cuixia; Hu, Changsheng; Wang, Guowen; Zhou, Yuqing; Henkin, Zalmen; Degen, Abraham Allan",J. sci. food agric,,351

We employed descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis. The results showed that the accuracy rate of the overall preparedness scale was 68.9%. The preparedness level related to economic, individual, household, and community and social distancing was 64.9, 77.1, 50.4, and 83.2%, respectively. However, the economic preparedness significantly varied by sex, education, occupation, attitude, and worries related to COVID-19. Individual preparedness was significantly associated with education, residence, and attitudes. The household preparedness significantly varied by education, residence, and worries, while the respondent's community and social distancing-related preparedness significantly varied by sex, region, residence, and attitude.

Mass gatherings of individuals seem to be investigated intensively by researchers both in these days and will be further in the forthcoming years. Religion-oriented gatherings are of great importance because they have spiritual motivation for the ones who practice them. For many participants, these gatherings are essential at least once in their life. As is seen from its very nature, religious motivation is one of the most potent subjects to be considered in terms of mass gatherings. Thus, as a useful example, the pilgrimage in Islam to Hajj and Umrah in Saudi Arabia are the focus of this study. The international movements and gatherings stemming from religious motivation are a point of discussion in terms of the precautions which should be taken. Therefore, in this study, general information about these particular pilgrimages is provided, and the specific case of Turkey in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic is investigated within the scope of the precautions taken by the Turkish authorities.

Smell dysfunction has been reported in other viral infections (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, SARS, and others), but the incidence is much lower than SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathophysiology of post-infectious olfactory loss was hypothesized that viruses may produce an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa or damage the olfactory neuro epithelium directly. However, loss of smell could be presented in COVID-19 patients without other rhinologic symptoms or significant nasal inflammation. This review aims to provide a brief overview of recent evidence for epidemiology, pathological mechanisms for the smell, and taste dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Furthermore, prognosis and treatments are reviewed with scanty evidence. We also discuss the possibility of using ""smell and taste loss"" as a screening tool for COVID-19 and treatment options in the post-SARS-CoV-2 infectious olfactory loss.","Kanjanaumporn, Jesada Aeumjaturapat Songklot Snidvongs Kornkiat Seresirikachorn Kachorn Chusakul Supinda",Asian Pacific Journal of Allergy and Immunology,,351

Furthermore, as the NHS dominated PPE purchasing, social care staff were initially an afterthought.6 Over 600 frontline health and social care staff were estimated in 2020 to have died from covid, though the figure by now may be higher,7 and those of us in frontline clinical roles, working with patients in enclosed spaces but not in full ICU grade PPE, are by some order of magnitude the group at highest risk.8 NHSSC says that £23m a year (a tiny fraction of the NHS budget) is spent on uniforms, but there was a surge in demand, especially for scrubs, during the pandemic. Nowhere does the consultation acknowledge failings in pandemic PPE supplies and the impact on staff safety, employers’ ability to honour their obligations to keep staff safe, hospital acquired infection rates (which account for around one in five covid cases),9 or failings by NHSSC and the health secretary on this issue.","Oliver, David",BMJ : British Medical Journal (Online),,351

The effectiveness of such a method depends on how strictly it is applied and the timing of its implementation. An early start and being strict is very effective; however, at the same time, it impacts freedom and economic opportunity. Here we created a simulation model to understand the effect of the starting day of community containment on the ï¬nal outcome, that is, the number of those infected, hospitalized and those that died, as we followed the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used a stochastic recursive simulation method to apply disease outbreak dynamics measures of COVID-19 as an example to simulate disease spread. Parameters are allowed to be randomly assigned between higher and lower values obtained from published COVID-19 literature. Results: We simulated the dynamics of COVID-19 spread, calculated the number of active infections, hospitalizations and deaths as the outcome of our simulation and compared these results with real world data. We also represented the details of the spread in a network graph structure, and shared the code for the simulation model to be used for examining other variables.

Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia.

244558,Self-reported smell and taste recovery in coronavirus disease 2019 patients: a one-year prospective study,2021,"Registering as a dentist and working in the UK is a goal that many overseas dentists aspire to. Overseas-qualified dentists need to either pass a registration exam to be able to practise dentistry in the UK or, under certain circumstances, they can register through assessment. Additionally, temporary registration gives overseas-qualified dentists the opportunity to practise dentistry under supervision for up to five years. However, these routes are difficult and it could take a few years before a dentist is registered. These dentists have the academic route as well, but similar to the registration route, it is not easy and very competitive and expensive. Brexit and COVID-19 had their impact on the journey of these dentists and altered their plans to pursue their career in the UK. To sum up, the current system could probably be modified to be more in line with that of neighbouring countries. To my colleagues who have graduated from the UK or EU and are registered with the General Dental Council, please be aware that it is not an easy journey, requires a lot of money and time, and is an incredibly stressful time.","Ashiti, Shoukat",Br Dent J,,351
244640,Growing role of magnetic resonance enterography in the management of Crohn disease,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemiology in Alberta, British Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Using data through December 1, 2020, we estimated time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using EpiEstim package in R, and calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) across the 3 provinces. RESULTS: In Ontario, 76% (92 745/121 745) of cases were in Toronto, Peel, York, Ottawa, and Durham; in Alberta, 82% (49 878/61 169) in Calgary and Edmonton; in British Columbia, 90% (31 142/34 699) in Fraser and Vancouver Coastal. Across 3 provinces, Rt dropped to &#8804; 1 after April. In Ontario, Rt would remain < 1 in April if congregate-setting-associated cases were excluded. Over summer, Rt maintained < 1 in Ontario, ~1 in British Columbia, and ~1 in Alberta, except early July when Rt was > 1. In all 3 provinces, Rt was > 1, reflecting surges in case count from September through November. Compared with British Columbia (684.2 cases per 100 000), Alberta (IRR = 2.0; 1399.3 cases per 100 000) and Ontario (IRR = 1.2; 835.8 cases per 100 000) had a higher cumulative case count per 100 000 population. CONCLUSIONS: Alberta and Ontario had a higher incidence rate than British Columbia, but Rt trajectories were similar across all 3 provinces.","Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai; Hung, Yuen Wai; Ofori, Sylvia K; Muniz-Rodriguez, Kamalich; Lai, Po-Ying; Chowell, Gerardo",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,351

In the context of clinical management for venous thromboembolism, this could result in suboptimal therapy with warfarin. We aimed to determine the impact of the pandemic on utilization of International normalized ratio (INR) testing and the percentage of high and low results. METHODS: INR data from 11 institutions were extracted to compare testing volume and the percentage of INR results &#8805;3.5 and &#8804;1.5 between a pre-pandemic period (January-June 2019, period 1) and a portion of the COVID-19 pandemic period (January-June 2020, period 2). The analysis was performed for inpatient and outpatient cohorts. RESULTS: Testing volumes showed relatively little change in January and February, followed by a significant decrease in March, April and May, and then returned to baseline in June. Outpatient testing showed a larger percentage decrease in testing volume compared to inpatient testing. At 10 of the 11 study sites we observed an increase in the percentage of abnormal high INR results as test volumes decreased, primarily among outpatients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted INR testing among outpatients which may be attributable to several factors. Increased supratherapeutic INR results during the pandemic period when there was reduced laboratory utilization and access to care is concerning because of the risk of adverse bleeding events in this group of patients. This could be mitigated in the future by offering drive through testing and/or widespread implementation of home INR monitoring.","Pearson, Lauren N; Johnson, Stacy A; Greene, Dina N; Chambliss, Allison B; Farnsworth, Christopher W; French, Deborah; Herman, Daniel S; Kavsak, Peter A; Merril, Anna E; Lo, Sheng-Ying Margaret; Lyon, Martha E; SoRelle, Jeffrey A; Schmidt, Robert L",,,351
246829,Pos-194 Risk Factors and Clinical Characteristics of Acute Kidney Injury in Hospitalized Covid-19 Patients: a Retrospective Cohort Study,2021,"Developing a COVID-19 vaccine is a critical strategy for combatting the pandemic. However, for vaccination efforts to succeed, there must be widespread willingness to vaccinate. Prior research has found that Black Americans, who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, report lower intentions to get a vaccine than do other populations. We investigate two potential contributors to this disparity: COVID-19 vaccine-related behavioral beliefs and trust in four COVID-19 information sources (mainstream media, social media, President Trump, and public health officials and agencies). Using a nationally-representative survey (n= 889), we demonstrate that differences in vaccination beliefs explain the lower vaccination intentions reported by Black participants, compared to non-Black participants. However, while trust in information sources is associated with vaccination beliefs, differences in trust do not account for the observed differences in vaccination beliefs by race. Furthermore, we find that race moderates the relationships between trust in two sources (Trump and public health officials and agencies) and vaccination beliefs. The effects of trusting these sources on COVID-19 vaccine-related beliefs are smaller among Black participants; thus trust in these sources is less consequential to their pro-vaccination beliefs. Our results suggest that trust in information sources alone does not explain the observed relationship between race and vaccination beliefs.","Woko, Chioma; Siegel, Leeann; Hornik, Robert",J Health Commun,,351

250086,The changing landscape of left ventricular assist device care in the setting of a pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused radiotherapy resource pressures and led to increased risks for lung cancer patients and healthcare staff. An international group of experts in lung cancer radiotherapy established this practice recommendation pertaining to whether and how to adapt radiotherapy for lung cancer in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: For this ESTRO & ASTRO endorsed project, 32 experts in lung cancer radiotherapy contributed to a modified Delphi consensus process. We assessed potential adaptations of radiotherapy in two pandemic scenarios. The first, an early pandemic scenario of risk mitigation, is characterized by an altered risk-benefit ratio of radiotherapy for lung cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility for severe COVID-19 infection, and minimization of patient travelling and exposure of radiotherapy staff. The second, a later pandemic scenario, is characterized by reduced radiotherapy resources requiring patient triage. Six common lung cancer cases were assessed for both scenarios: peripherally located stage I NSCLC, locally advanced NSCLC, postoperative radiotherapy after resection of pN2 NSCLC, thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation for limited stage SCLC and palliative thoracic radiotherapy for stage IV NSCLC. RESULTS: In a risk-mitigation pandemic scenario, efforts should be made not to compromise the prognosis of lung cancer patients by departing from guideline-recommended radiotherapy practice. In that same scenario, postponement or interruption of radiotherapy treatment of COVID-19 positive patients is generally recommended to avoid exposure of cancer patients and staff to an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. In a severe pandemic scenario characterized by reduced resources, if patients must be triaged, important factors for triage include potential for cure, relative benefit of radiation, life expectancy, and performance status. Case-specific consensus recommendations regarding multimodality treatment strategies and fractionation of radiotherapy are provided. CONCLUSION: This joint ESTRO-ASTRO practice recommendation established pragmatic and balanced consensus recommendations in common clinical scenarios of radiotherapy for lung cancer in order to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guckenberger, Matthias; Belka, Claus; Bezjak, Andrea; Bradley, Jeffrey; Daly, Megan E; DeRuysscher, Dirk; Dziadziuszko, Rafal; Faivre-Finn, Corinne; Flentje, Michael; Gore, Elizabeth; Higgins, Kristin A; Iyengar, Puneeth; Kavanagh, Brian D; Kumar, Sameera; Le Pechoux, Cecile; Lievens, Yolande; Lindberg, Karin; McDonald, Fiona; Ramella, Sara; Rengan, Ramesh; Ricardi, Umberto; Rimner, Andreas; Rodrigues, George B; Schild, Steven E; Senan, Suresh; Simone, Charles B; Slotman, Ben J; Stuschke, Martin; Videtic, Greg; Widder, Joachim; Yom, Sue S; Palma, David",Radiother Oncol,,351

A recent study demonstrated that GQD enhanced the effect of PD-1 blockade in colorectal cancer (CRC). This study used network pharmacology analysis to investigate the mechanisms of GQD as a potential therapeutic approach against CRC. Materials and Methods: Bioactive chemical ingredients (BCIs) of GQD were collected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. CRC-specific genes were obtained using the gene expression profile GSE110224 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Target genes related to BCIs of GQD were then screened out. The GQD-CRC ingredient-target pharmacology network was constructed and visualized using Cytoscape software. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was subsequently constructed and analyzed with BisoGenet and CytoNCA plug-in in Cytoscape. Gene Ontology (GO) functional and the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis for target genes were then performed using the R package of clusterProfiler. Results: One hundred and eighteen BCIs were determined to be effective on CRC, including quercetin, wogonin, and baicalein. Twenty corresponding target genes were screened out including PTGS2, CCNB1, and SPP1. Among these genes, CCNB1 and SPP1 were identified as crucial to the PPI network. A total of 212 GO terms and 6 KEGG pathways were enriched for target genes. Functional analysis indicated that these targets were closely related to pathophysiological processes and pathways such as biosynthetic and metabolic processes of prostaglandins and prostanoids, cytokine and chemokine activities, and the IL-17, TNF, Toll-like receptor, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathways. Conclusion: The study elucidated the ""multiingredient, multitarget, and multipathway"" mechanisms of GQD against CRC from a systemic perspective, indicating GQD to be a candidate therapy for CRC treatment.","Fan, Qiaowei; Guo, Lin; Guan, Jingming; Chen, Jing; Fan, Yujing; Chen, Zhendong; Li, Hulun",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,,351

The features of the immunopathogenesis of these infections are analyzed. It was found that the structural proteins of the spine, membrane, envelope and nucleocapsid play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. They are associated with hyperactivation of neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages, secreting large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This contributes to the development of a left-pointing-double-angle cytokine storm right-pointing-double-angle and an unfavorable prognosis of the disease. A particularly high risk of developing pneumonia exists against the background of an increase in the production of: macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, macrophage chemotactic protein, interleukin 8. At the height of infection in some patients, macrophages and dendritic cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 lose their ability to produce type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the part of cellular immunity, a significant decrease in the number of CD4+ and CD8+-lymphocytes was noted. Among IgG sub-isotypes, IgG3 antibodies had the highest reactivity, and IgG1 antibodies were less reactive. Antibodies to spike protein with low specificity or low titer do not neutralize the virus and contribute to the contamination of immunocompetent cells via Fc receptors. Low-affinity antibodies or their low levels can contribute to increased cell sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 and the development of severe forms of COVID-19 disease.","Gumilevskiy, B. Y.; Moskalev, A.

266096,Neurological symptoms in acute COVID-19 infected patients: A survey among Italian physicians,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the emergence of COVID-19, health care workers and first responders have been at a high risk for mental health symptoms owing to their exposure to the virus and increased work stress during the pandemic. Although interventions exist to address mental health issues following exposure to disasters, emergencies, and humanitarian crises, considerably less is known about web-based unguided interventions to help mitigate the negative impacts of such events. Additionally, in contexts in which emergencies reduce access to in-person care, remote forms of support are critical, yet there are limited studies on the use of such interventions. Evidence-based, easy-to-use, scalable interventions are direly needed for this population. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility of an unguided electronic mental health program, COVID-19 Anxiety and Stress Resilience Training (COAST), tailored to first responders and health care personnel, based on scientific evidence and empirically based techniques. METHODS: We developed COVID-19-specific training modules focusing on several domains that are previously reported as key to resilience and stress recovery: self-efficacy, mindfulness, sleep quality, and positive thinking. The program was made available to 702 first responders between May and August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sociodemographic, work-, and COVID-19-related information was collected, and psychometric questionnaires were completed. We examined user acceptance and user activity, including module choice and participant feedback. RESULTS: In total, 52 of 702 (7%) first responders to whom we reached out used the program at least once. COAST use was independent of age, sex, or baseline levels of self-efficacy, mindful awareness, sleep quality, and positive thinking (for all, P>.39). First responders who had tested positive and those who had been quarantined were more likely to engage in the program. A click count analysis per module showed that participants used the self-efficacy and mindfulness modules most often, with 382 and 122 clicks, respectively, over 15 weeks. Overall, first responders expressed satisfaction with the program. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of first responders in the multimodule web-based COAST program was feasible and the first responder cohort expressed overall satisfaction with the program. Those in more difficult circumstances, including those in quarantine and those who tested positive, may be more likely to engage in such programs. Further controlled studies could pave the way for efficacy studies and the development of additional modules, including just-in-time interventions or blended interventions combining individual use of an unguided self-help intervention, such as COAST, with subsequent individual psychotherapy for those who continue to experience stress and psychological symptoms.","Heyen, Janna Marie; Weigl, Noé; Müller, Mario; Müller, Stefan; Eberle, Urs; Manoliu, Andrei; Vetter, Stefan; Brown, Adam D; Berger, Thomas; Kleim, Birgit",JMIR Form Res,,351

268904,Coronavirus Disease 19 and Future Ecological Crises: Hopes from Epigenomics and Unraveling Genome Regulation in Humans and Infectious Agents,2021,"Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to exploit the cell’s ACE2 receptor for viral entry. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonism with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increases the expression of ACE2 receptors which, coupled with the metabolic changes associated with obesity-related hypertension, can make hypertensive patients with obesity more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Although current evidence suggests that ACEI/ARB use does not increase risk of severe COVID-19 in the general population, potential interactions with obesity-related hypertension are unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics between March 1st and July 8th, 2020. We included adults who are overweight (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) with hypertension treated as outpatients with or without ACEIs/ARBs. Patients without exposure to RAAS antagonists served as controls. We assessed mortality and the severity of COVID-19 reflected by admission to ICU and usage of supplemental O2, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and vasopressors. Results: Of the 369 inpatients with COVID-19, we identified 138 exhibiting obesity-related hypertension who were then allocated into the control (n=59) and ACEI/ARB (n=79) groups. The BMIs between groups at baseline were not statistically significant (Control: 33.6 ± 0.96 vs. ACEI/ARB: 34.99 ± 0.97;p=.32). Women were less represented in the ACEI/ARB group (Control: 47% vs. ACEI/ARB: 24%). The controls had a substantially higher mortality rate (Control: 32.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 15.1%). In regard to the severity of COVID-19, the ACEI/ARB cohort showed lower usage of supplemental O2 (Control: 52.5% vs. ACEI/ARB: 49.3%), mechanical ventilation (Control: 37.2% vs. ACEI/ARB: 1.2%), vasopressors (Control: 38.9% vs. ACEI/ARB: 31.6%), and had lower ICU admissions (Control: 57.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 46.8%). However, the ACEI/ARB group had higher rates of: ECMO (Control: 0% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%) and non-invasive ventilation (Control: 18.6% vs. ACEI/ARB: 20.2%). Of note, the rate of diabetes was higher in the ACEI/ARB cohort (Control: 45.7% vs. ACEI/ARB: 63.2%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that a history of RAAS antagonism is associated with lower mortality and less severity of COVID-19 in patients with obesity-related hypertension requiring hospital admission.","Kamalumpundi, Vijayvardhan Shams Elham Cheng Linhai Taiwo Adeyinka Shibli-Rahhal Amal A.; Dokun, Ayotunde O.; Correia, Marcelo",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,351

269094,The Year in Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia: Selected Highlights from 2020,2020,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the common designation for ectosomes, microparticles and microvesicles serving dominant roles in intercellular communication. Both viable and dying cells release EVs to the extracellular environment for transfer of cell, immune and infectious materials. Defined morphologically as lipid bi-layered structures EVs show molecular, biochemical, distribution, and entry mechanisms similar to viruses within cells and tissues. In recent years their functional capacities have been harnessed to deliver biomolecules and drugs and immunological agents to specific cells and organs of interest or disease. Interest in EVs as putative vaccines or drug delivery vehicles are substantial. The vesicles have properties of receptors nanoassembly on their surface. EVs can interact with specific immunocytes that include antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells and other mononuclear phagocytes) to elicit immune responses or affect tissue and cellular homeostasis or disease. Due to potential advantages like biocompatibility, biodegradation and efficient immune activation, EVs have gained attraction for the development of treatment or a vaccine system against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection. In this review efforts to use EVs to contain SARS CoV-2 and affect the current viral pandemic are discussed. An emphasis is made on mesenchymal stem cell derived EVs’ as a vaccine candidate delivery system.","Machhi, Jatin Shahjin Farah Das Srijanee Patel Milankumar Abdelmoaty Mai Mohamed Cohen Jacob D.; Singh, Preet Amol Baldi Ashish Bajwa Neha Kumar Raj Vora Lalit K.; Patel, Tapan A.; Oleynikov, Maxim D.; Soni, Dhruvkumar Yeapuri Pravin Mukadam Insiya Chakraborty Rajashree Saksena Caroline G.; Herskovitz, Jonathan Hasan Mahmudul Oupicky David Das Suvarthi Donnelly Ryan F.; Hettie, Kenneth S.; Chang, Linda Gendelman Howard E.; Kevadiya, Bhavesh D.",Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology,,351

The authors conducted a multicenter retrospective study to investigate the clinical manifestations and outcomes of patients with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS: The authors reviewed the medical records of hospitalized patients who were treated at 5 hospitals in Wuhan City, China, between January 5 and March 18, 2020. Clinical parameters relating to cancer history (type and treatment) and COVID-19 were collected. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary analyses were the association between clinical factors and severe COVID-19 and OS. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients with cancer were diagnosed with COVID-19, with a median age of 66 years (range, 37-98 years). Lung (21 patients; 19.6%), gastrointestinal (20 patients; 18.7%), and genitourinary (20 patients; 18.7%) cancers were the most common cancer diagnoses. A total of 37 patients (34.6%) were receiving active anticancer treatment when diagnosed with COVID-19, whereas 70 patients (65.4%) were on follow-up. Overall, 52.3% of patients (56 patients) developed severe COVID-19; this rate was found to be higher among patients receiving anticancer treatment than those on follow-up (64.9% vs 45.7%), which corresponded to an inferior OS in the former subgroup of patients (hazard ratio, 3.365; 95% CI, 1.455-7.782 [P = .005]). The detrimental effect of anticancer treatment on OS was found to be independent of exposure to systemic therapy (case fatality rate of 33.3% [systemic therapy] vs 43.8% [nonsystemic therapy]). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that >50.0% of infected patients with cancer are susceptible to severe COVID-19. This risk is aggravated by simultaneous anticancer treatment and portends for a worse survival, despite treatment for COVID-19.","Zhang, Hongyan; Wang, Linwei; Chen, Yuanyuan; Wu, Qiuji; Chen, Gaili; Shen, Xiaokun; Wang, Qun; Yan, Youqin; Yu, Yi; Zhong, Yahua; Wang, Xinghuan; Chua, Melvin L K; Xie, Conghua",Cancer,,351
270151,Acute kidney injury and kidney replacement therapy in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), is a novel human Coronavirus that is responsible for about 300,000 deaths worldwide. To date, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine prevention strategy against COVID-19. Due to the urgent need for effective treatment, drug repurposing is regarded as the immediate option. Potential drugs can often be identified via in silico drug screening experiments. Consequently, there has been an explosion of in silico experiments to find drug candidates or investigate anecdotal claims. One drug with several anecdotal accounts of benefit is Cefuroxime. The aim of this study was to identify and summarize in silico evidence for possible activity of Cefuroxime against SARS-CoV-2.To this end, we performed a scoping review of literature of in silico drug repurposing experiments for SARS-CoV-2 using PRISMA-ScR. We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar for original studies published between 1st Feb, 2020 and 15th May, 2020 that screened drug libraries, and identified Cefuroxime as a top-ranked potential inhibitor drug against SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Six studies were identified. These studies reported Cefuroxime as a potential inhibitor of 3 key SARS-CoV-2 proteins; main protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and ACE2-Spike complex. We provided a summary of the methodology and findings of the identified studies. Our scoping review identified significant in silico evidence that Cefuroxime may be a potential multi-target inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to evaluate the potential of Cefuroxime for COVID-19.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

270455,Pay attention to 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) induced sepsis immuno-suppression,2020,"Rationale: Lung ultrasound B-lines artifacts represent abnormal interstitial thickening or edema, have been related to patient mortality, and are often visualized when imaging the anteroapex of the lung. Unlike other probe locations, these 2 sites on the upper chest can be readily accessed by healthcare givers and patients alike. In COVID-19 infection, the potential value of these sites for detecting early lung involvement depends not only on accessibility, but also on the relationship of its findings with significant disease. Therefore, as few ultrasound data exist from the lung apex in hospitalized COVID-19 pneumonia, we sought to report the prevalence of apical lung B-line artifacts in inpatients and their association with illness severity. Methods: In a 300-bed community hospital, medical and imaging data from inpatients with known COVID-19 infection who had been referred for echocardiography with lung imaging or who had received a lung point-of-care ultrasound study was reviewed for the presence of ≥3 B-lines (COMETS) in either anteroapex of the lungs. COVID-19 disease was categorized by the CDC Clinical Severity Scale on presentation as mild (no dyspnea, normal CXR/CT), moderate (abnormal CXR/CT, O2 sat&gt;94%), severe (tachypnea, O2 sat &lt;94%, infiltrates &gt;50%), or critical (respiratory failure, shock, multiorgan system failure). Age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and time from onset of symptoms to the imaging study were analyzed for univariable associations with COMET presence and then considered with severity category in a reduced multivariable model using backwards elimination. Results: Of n=56 patients, age (mean±SD) was 63±16 years. COMETS were present in 35/56 (63%) of patients overall, and in 30/37 (81%) of severe-critical disease vs. 5/19 (26)% of mild-moderate disease (p=0.0002). Of the patients with vs. without COMETS, 31 (76%) vs. 10 (24%) had an abnormal CXR and 30 (79%) vs. 8 (21%) had O2 sat&lt;94% on admission, respectively (p&lt;0.05). In the multivariable model, obesity (OR=9.64[95%CI:2.19-68.48], p&lt;0.007) and severe/critical disease (OR=19.47[95%CI:4.33-142.28], p&lt;0.0006) best predicted the presence of COMETs. Conclusions: Ultrasound B-lines in the anteroapex of the lung are a prevalent finding in hospitalized COVID-19 infection and increase with disease severity and obesity, reaching &gt;80% in severe/critical disease. This imaging site, in particular, may be ideal for outpatient screening, ER triage, or patient home imaging, where it may herald the need for early respiratory diagnosis, therapies or hospitalization. Future studies involving the prevalence, timing and outcome of outpatient ultrasound lung imaging may consider the use of this easily-accessed site on the chest wall. .","Shi, R.; Tran, E.

271336,Analysis of drug therapy of 53 patients with Corona Virus Disease-2019,2020,"Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered the residency application process. The lack of an in-person interview experience, the inability to conduct department visits, and the limitations imposed on pursuing away rotations have restricted applicants. This change has placed more emphasis on the online presence of residency programs and exposed several deficits pertaining to virtual content available to applicants. Many residency program websites are inadequate and unable to meet these new demands. The purpose of this study was to collect and organize potential areas for improvement—as proposed by students—regarding the available website information put forth by interventional radiology residency programs. Materials and Methods: Medical students were invited to attend a virtual webinar with multiple residency program directors to discuss the application process. After the webinar discussion, attendees were asked to submit topics and information they deemed to be important when applying to residency programs. These submissions were then organized according to certain themes and quantified. Results: Seventy-eight submitted responses to the following question: “When visiting an IR/DR Program’s website, what important pieces of information are you looking for?” Many responses consisted of multiple components and thus are encompassed within several themes. The major themes and their corresponding response percentages are as follows: advice regarding application (21%), case types and volume (14%), advice regarding rotations (13%), Step exam averages (9%), curriculum schedule (8%), unique traits and program diversity (8%), insights from current residents (6%), and research opportunities (6%). Other minor themes include mentorship opportunities, resident support services, video profiles of faculty, and patient population demographics. Conclusions: Analysis of these responses revealed certain consistent topics of information that are considered by students when applying to the NRMP. These can be potential objectives for residency programs to pursue in order to optimize their appeal to applicants. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly restructured medical education and the residency application process. Therefore, to both accommodate these changes and promote resident training, programs can strengthen their online presence by tailoring their websites to include important information for applicants’ consideration. This will not only better inform prospective students but may also augment the number of applicants.","Khayat, A.; Abboud, R.; Farag, A.; Vatakencherry, G.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,351

For most sectors, these measures have resulted in a significant reduction of economic activity, output, and hence also output-related emissions. Commitment to these measures, apparently regardless of the economic costs involved, is considered by some people to be a blueprint for the commitment required to mitigate climate change and to achieve the Paris climate targets. However, when it comes to devising an efficient climate policy, the differences between the two crises-cororonavirus and climate change-need to be taken more seriously than the similarities. Alarming have been the various calls to put a quick end to corona prevention measures and the restrictions they place on public and economic activity, indicative as they are of the priority accorded to high discount rates and the absence of precautionary thinking among policy-makers. Both the differences between the two crises themselves and the similarities in the reluctance to focus on achieving (more) long-term benefits emphasize once again the need for long-term commitment to climate policies in line with agreed targets.","Rickels, Wilfried; Peterson, Sonja",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),,351

Children, although less directly affected by the virus, are paying a heavy price through the indirect effects of the crisis, including poor diet, mental health impact, social isolation, addiction to screens and lack of schooling and health care, particularly among vulnerable groups. This paper is aimed at discussing the potential impact of this pandemic on children's nutrition and lifestyle. Preliminary data from the literature and from our survey show significant disruptions in nutrition and lifestyle habits of children. While undernutrition is expected to worsen in poor countries, obesity rates could increase in middle- and high-income countries especially among precarious groups widening the gap in health and social inequalities.The real impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children extends well beyond that of a viral infection. This crisis has public health implications that could have life-long consequences on children. It requires effective and targeted measures mainly for vulnerable children and households to guarantee children's basic rights for optimal nutrition, health and development.","Zemrani, Boutaina; Gehri, Mario; Masserey, Eric; Knob, Cyril; Pellaton, Rachel",Int J Equity Health,,351
275550,Mortality associated with acute kidney injury in COVID-19 admissions to a high dependency/intensive care setting,2021,"Allergic conjunctivitis affects 15 to 20% of the general population. It is currently evaluated by the Conjunctival Provocation Test (CPT), which is considered as the gold standard. In the investigation of allergic rhinitis and asthma, environmental exposure chambers (EEC) are increasingly utilised. For allergic conjunctivitis, EEC might be a valid alternative to the CPT. However, evaluation of the allergen response in individual provocation tests or in EECs is still in discussion due to the multiplicity of symptom scores. Indeed, there are many scores used to evaluate allergic conjunctivitis. The main criteria used were described by Abelson in 1990 and include redness, itching, tearing, and swelling. In clinical studies, the specifically ocular score most used is the Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS). Few treatments have been evaluated by EEC, including cold compresses, epinastine and N-acetyl aspartyl glutamic acid. Moreover, early data shows good correlation between ocular symptoms induced in an EEC and those assessed during natural exposure. EEC might be a valid alternative to CPT and correlate with natural seasonal allergen exposure. Finally, EEC might be useful in other fields as well, such as in the study of dry eye disease.","Ehret, M; Bourcier, T; Domis, N; Gherasim, A; Speeg-Schatz, C; de Blay, F",,,351

The multifaceted nature of COVID-19 demands a multidisciplinary approach, but the urgency of the crisis combined with the need for social distancing measures present unique challenges to collaborative science. We applied a massive online open publishing approach to this problem using Manubot. Through GitHub, collaborators summarized and critiqued COVID-19 literature, creating a review manuscript. Manubot automatically compiled citation information for referenced preprints, journal publications, websites, and clinical trials. Continuous integration workflows retrieved up-to-date data from online sources nightly, regenerating some of the manuscript's figures and statistics. Manubot rendered the manuscript into PDF, HTML, LaTeX, and DOCX outputs, immediately updating the version available online upon the integration of new content. Through this effort, we organized over 50 scientists from a range of backgrounds who evaluated over 1,500 sources and developed seven literature reviews.

278127,A Mechanistic Link Between Selenium and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2021,"Statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors interfere with several pathophysiological pathways of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statins may have a direct antiviral effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by inhibiting its main protease. Statin-induced up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) may also be beneficial, whereas cholesterol reduction might significantly suppress SARS-CoV-2 by either blocking its host-cell entry through the disruption of lipid rafts or by inhibiting its replication. Available human studies have shown beneficial effects of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors on pneumonia and sepsis. These drugs may act as immunomodulators in COVID-19 and protect against major complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and cytokine release syndrome. Considering their antioxidative, anti-arrhythmic, antithrombotic properties and their beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction, along with the increased risk of mortality of patients at high cardiovascular risk infected by SARS-CoV-2, statins and PCSK9 inhibitors might prove effective against the cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications of COVID-19. On the whole, randomized clinical trials are needed to establish routine use of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the meantime, it is recommended that lipid-lowering therapy should not be discontinued in COVID-19 patients unless otherwise indicated.","Barkas, Fotios; Milionis, Haralampos; Anastasiou, Georgia; Liberopoulos, Evangelos",Med Hypotheses,,351

Objective: To determine the levels of anxiety, depression and self-care symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Method: Online survey distributed over three weeks using a non-probability sampling. The PHQ-9 Patient Health Questionnaire, the GAD-7 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Visual analog scale for self-care behaviors were used. Between-group (anxiety and depression) descriptive and comparison analyses were carried out. Results: Out of 1508 included participants, 20.8% had symptoms of severe anxiety, while 27.5% showed symptoms of severe depression. Being a woman, being single, having no children, having medical comorbidities and a history of mental health care were risk factors for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression; 66 to 80 % of the population complied with self-care recommendations. A need for receiving mental health care was identified in our study population.

279676,"Pediatric SARS, H1N1, MERS, EVALI, and Now Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pneumonia: What Radiologists Need to Know",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 outbreak lead to nationwide lockdown in Finland on the March 16th, 2020. Previous data regarding to the patient load in the emergency departments during pandemics is scarce. Our aim is to describe the effect of national lockdown and social distancing on the number and reasons for emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions in three large volume hospitals prior to and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Finland. METHODS: Data for this register-based retrospective cohort study were collected from three large ED's in Finland, covering 1/6 of the Finnish population. All patients visiting ED's six weeks before and six weeks after the lockdown were included. Pediatric and gynecological patients were excluded. Numbers and reasons for ED visits and inpatient admissions were collected. Corresponding time period in 2019 was used as reference. RESULTS: A total of 40,653 ED visits and 12,226 inpatient admissions were analyzed. The total number of ED visits decreased 16% after the lockdown, whereas the number of inpatient admissions decreased 15% (p < 0.001). This change in inpatient admissions was similar in all participating hospitals. Visits due to back or limb pain decreased 31% and infectious diseases 28%. The visit rate and inpatient admissions due to acute myocardial infarction and strokes remained stable throughout the study period. Interestingly, the rate of inpatient admissions due to psychiatric diagnoses remained unchanged, although the ED visit rate decreased by 19%. The number of ED visits (n = 282) and inpatient admissions (n = 55) due to COVID-19 remained low in the participating hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in ED visits and inpatient admissions prior to and during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak were unpredictable, and our results may help hospitals and especially ED's focus their resources better. Surprisingly, there was a major decrease in the rate of ED visits due to back or limb pain and not so surprisingly in infectious diseases. Rates of acute myocardial infarctions and cerebral strokes remained stable. In summary, stabile resources for the treatment of patients with severe diseases will be needed in hospitals and ED's.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Ponkilainen, Ville T; Launonen, Antti P; Reito, Aleksi; Hevonkorpi, Teemu P; Paloneva, Juha; Mattila, Ville M",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,,351

Based on declassified documents from the US government, this research contends that Guinea's government downplayed the epidemic in an attempt to prevent investors’ perceptions that Guinea was unsafe for substantial investments that the government had been pursuing in the iron-ore production and export industry However, those investments also proved to be tied to an extensive history of corruption in Guinea's mining industries linked to the leader's extraversion policies designed to consolidate and to maintain power domestically","Ostergard, Robert L.",The Extractive Industries and Society,,351
281991,Successful treatment of 28 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 at a medical center in Taiwan,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the maternal clinical characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes in COVID-19-positive pregnant women. METHODS: Articles in all languages on the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women were sought from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and LILACS; China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and Wan Fang Data between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Bulletins and national reports were also searched. RESULTS: From 12,168 retrieved articles, 143 were selected for full-text assessment; 33 for descriptive analyses, and 4 case-controls for meta-analysis. In 322 infected pregnant women, aged 20-45 years, the most frequent maternal comorbidity was obesity (24.2%). Forty-two (28.4%) were asymptomatic at admission. Cough (n = 148,59.7%) and fever (n = 147,59.3%) were the most prevalent symptoms. In the meta-analysis, fever (OR: 0.13,95% CI 0.05 to 0.36) and cough (0.26,95% CI 0.11 to 0.59) were lower in pregnant women with COVID-19 than non-pregnant women with COVID-19.195 (60.6%) delivered, and 125 (38.8%) remained pregnant during the study. Cesarean was reported in 99 (50.8%) women and vaginal delivery in 64 (32.8%). The main adverse obstetric outcome was premature birth (n = 37,18.9%). Thirty patients (10.3%) with COVID-19-related complications required intensive care, one (0.3%) died. SARS-CoV-2 was absent in breast milk, amniotic fluid, placenta or umbilical cord blood. CONCLUSIONS: The maternal clinical characteristics of COVID-19-positive pregnant include frequently fever and cough; however significantly less frequently than non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Iatrogenic preterm birth is the main adverse obstetric outcome. Current data does not support vertical transmission in the third trimester.","Novoa, Rommy H; Quintana, Willy; Llancarí, Pedro; Urbina-Quispe, Katherine; Guevara-Ríos, Enrique; Ventura, Walter",Travel Med Infect Dis,,351
282164,An audit of end-of-life symptom control in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dying in a hospital in the United Kingdom,2020,"BACKGROUND: In April 2020, two independent clinical trials to assess SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis strategies among health care workers were initiated at our hospital: MeCOVID (melatonin vs placebo) and EPICOS (tenofovir disoproxil/emtricitabine vs hydroxychloroquine vs combination therapy vs placebo). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the reasons why health care workers chose to participate in the MeCOVID and EPICOS trials, as well as why they chose one over the other. METHODS: Both trials were offered to health care workers through an internal news bulletin. After an initial screening visit, all subjects were asked to respond to a web-based survey. RESULTS: In the first month, 206 health care workers were screened and 160 were randomized. The survey participation was high at 73.3%. Health care workers cited ""to contribute to scientific knowledge"" (n=80, 53.0%), followed by ""to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infection"" (n=33, 21.9%) and ""the interest to be tested for SARS-CoV-2"" (n=28, 18.5%), as their primary reasons to participate in the trials. We observed significant differences in the expected personal benefits across physicians and nurses (P=.01). The vast majority of volunteers (n=202, 98.0%) selected the MeCOVID trial, their primary reason being their concern regarding adverse reactions to treatments in the EPICOS trial (n=102, 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers' reasons to participate in prophylaxis trials in an acute pandemic context appear to be driven largely by their desire to contribute to science and to gain health benefits. Safety outweighed efficacy when choosing between the two clinical trials.","Borobia, Alberto M; García-García, Irene; Díaz-García, Lucía; Rodríguez-Mariblanca, Amelia; Martínez de Soto, Lucía; Monserrat Villatoro, Jaime; Seco Meseguer, Enrique; González, Juan J; Frías Iniesta, Jesús; Ramírez García, Elena; Arribas, Jose Ramón; Carcas-Sansuán, Antonio J",J Med Internet Res,,351

Several health-related strategies have been successfully developed to contain the rapidly-spreading virus across the globe, toward reduction of both disease burden and infection rates. Particularly, attention has been focused on either the development of novel drugs and vaccines, or by adapting already-existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment, mobilizing huge efforts to block disease progression and to overcome the shortage of effective measures available at this point.Areas covered: This perspective covers the breakthrough of multifunctional biomimetic cell membrane-based nanoparticles as next-generation nanosystems for cutting-edge COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccination, specifically cell membrane-derived nanovesicles and cell membrane-coated nanoparticles, both tailorable cell membrane-based nanosystems enriched with the surface repertoire of native cell membranes, toward maximized biointerfacing, immune evasion, cell targeting and cell-mimicking properties.Expert opinion: Nano-based approaches have received widespread interest regarding enhanced antigen delivery, prolonged blood circulation half-life and controlled release of drugs.

285784,A comparison of characteristics and outcomes of patients with community-acquired and hospital-acquired COVID-19 in the United Kingdom: An observational study,2021,"Effective systems for the analysis of molecular data are fundamental for monitoring the spread of infectious diseases and studying pathogen evolution. The rapid identification of emerging viral strains, and/or genetic variants potentially associated with novel phenotypic features is one of the most important objectives of genomic surveillance of human pathogens and represents one of the first lines of defense for the control of their spread. During the COVID 19 pandemic, several taxonomic frameworks have been proposed for the classification of SARS-Cov-2 isolates. These systems, which are typically based on phylogenetic approaches, represent essential tools for epidemiological studies as well as contributing to the study of the origin of the outbreak. Here, we propose an alternative, reproducible, and transparent phenetic method to study changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity over time. We suggest that our approach can complement other systems and facilitate the identification of biologically relevant variants in the viral genome. To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we present comparative genomic analyses of more than 175,000 genomes. Our method delineates 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, which, based on the distribution of high-frequency genetic variants, fall into four major macrohaplogroups. We highlight biased spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 genetic profiles and show that seven of the 22 haplogroups (and of all of the four haplogroup clusters) showed a broad geographic distribution within China by the time the outbreak was widely recognized-suggesting early emergence and widespread cryptic circulation of the virus well before its isolation in January 2020. General patterns of genomic variability are remarkably similar within all major SARS-CoV-2 haplogroups, with UTRs consistently exhibiting the greatest variability, with s2m, a conserved secondary structure element of unknown function in the 3'-UTR of the viral genome showing evidence of a functional shift. Although several polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more haplogroups were predicted to be under positive or negative selection, overall our analyses suggest that the emergence of novel types is unlikely to be driven by convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions, or by selection of recombined strains. In the absence of extensive clinical metadata for most available genome sequences, and in the context of extensive geographic and temporal biases in the sampling, many questions regarding the evolution and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 isolates remain open. However, our data indicate that the approach outlined here can be usefully employed in the identification of candidate SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of clinical and epidemiological importance.","Chiara, Matteo; Horner, David S; Gissi, Carmela; Pesole, Graziano",Mol Biol Evol,,351

287518,Therapeutic Strategy for Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 During Left Ventricular Assist Device Supports,2020,"The main aspects of severe COVID-19 disease pathogenesis include hyper-induction of proinflammatory cytokines, also known as 'cytokine storm', that precedes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and often leads to death. COVID-19 patients often suffer from lung fibrosis, a serious and untreatable condition. There remains no effective treatment for these complications. Out of all cytokines, TNF&#945; and IL-6 play crucial roles in cytokine storm pathogenesis and are likely responsible for the escalation in disease severity. These cytokines also partake in the molecular pathogenesis of fibrosis. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed, that can efficiently and swiftly downregulate TNF&#945;, IL-6, and the inflammatory cytokine cascade, in order to curb inflammation and prevent fibrosis, and lead to disease remission. Cannabis sativa has been proposed to modulate gene expression and inflammation and is under investigation for several potential therapeutic applications against autoinflammatory diseases and cancer. Here, we hypothesized that the extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars may be used to downregulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pathways involved in inflammation and fibrosis. Initially, to analyze the anti-inflammatory effects of novel C. sativa cultivars, we used a well-established full thickness human 3D skin artificial EpiDermFTTM tissue model, whereby tissues were exposed to UV to induce inflammation and then treated with extracts of seven new cannabis cultivars. We noted that out of seven studied extracts of novel C. sativa cultivars, three (#4, #8 and #14) were the most effective, causing profound and concerted down-regulation of COX2, TNF&#945;, IL-6, CCL2, and other cytokines and pathways related to inflammation and fibrosis. These data were further confirmed in the WI-38 lung fibroblast cell line model. Most importantly, one of the tested extracts had no effect at all, and one exerted effect that may be deleterious, signifying that careful cannabis cultivar selection must be based on thorough pre-clinical studies. The observed pronounced inhibition of TNF&#945; and IL-6 is the most important finding, because these molecules are currently considered to be the main targets in COVID-19 cytokine storm and ARDS pathogenesis. Novel anti-TNF&#945; and anti-IL-6 cannabis extracts can be useful additions to the current anti-inflammatory regimens to treat COVID-19, as well as various rheumatological diseases and conditions, and 'inflammaging' - the inflammatory underpinning of aging and frailty.","Kovalchuk, Anna; Wang, Bo; Li, Dongping; Rodriguez-Juarez, Rocio; Ilnytskyy, Slava; Kovalchuk, Igor; Kovalchuk, Olga","Aging (Albany, N.Y.

289225,Assessment of the Need for Early Initiation of Rehabilitation Treatments in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Several studies have shown that physical activity (PA) levels and sedentary behaviour (SB) are independent risk factors for many health-related issues. However, there is scarce evidence supporting the relationship between SB and urinary incontinence (UI) in community-dwelling older adults, and no information on any possible association in institutionalised older adults. Stage I of this project has the main objective of determining the prevalence of UI and its associated factors in nursing home (NH) residents, as well as analysing the association between UI (and its types) and SB. Stage II aims to investigate the incidence and predictive factors of functional and continence decline, falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among NH residents. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Stage I is an observational, multicentre, cross-sectional study with mixed methodology that aims to explore the current status of several health-related outcomes in NH residents of Osona (Barcelona, Spain). The prevalence ratio will be used as an association measure and multivariate analysis will be undertaken using Poisson regression with robust variance. Stage II is a 2-year longitudinal study that aims to analyse functional and continence decline, incidence of falls, hospitalisations, mortality and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these outcomes. A survival analysis using the actuarial method for functional decline and continence, evaluated every 6 months, and the Kaplan-Meier method for falls, hospitalisations and deaths, and Cox regression for multivariate analysis will be undertaken.

The use of resident trainees in telemedicine is one area of potential development and expansion. To date, however, training opportunities in this field have been limited, and residents may not be adequately prepared to provide high-quality telemedicine care. AIM: This study evaluates the impact of an adapted telemedicine Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) on telemedicine-specific training competencies of residents. SETTING: Primary Care Internal Medicine residents at a large urban academic hospital. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In March 2020, the New York University Grossman School of Medicine Primary Care program adapted its annual comprehensive OSCE to a telemedicine-based platform, to comply with distance learning and social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. A previously deployed in-person OSCE on the subject of a medical error was adapted to a telemedicine environment and deployed to 23 primary care residents. Both case-specific and core learning competencies were assessed, and additional observations were conducted on the impact of the telemedicine context on the encounter. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Three areas of telemedicine competency need were identified in the OSCE case: technical proficiency; virtual information gathering, including history, collateral information collection, and physical exam; and interpersonal communication skills, both verbal and nonverbal. Residents expressed enthusiasm for telemedicine training, but had concerns about their preparedness for telemedicine practice and the need for further competency and curricular development. DISCUSSION: Programs interested in building capacity among residents to perform telemedicine, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, can make significant impact in their trainees' comfort and preparedness by addressing key issues in technical proficiency, history and exam skills, and communication. Further research and curricular development in digital professionalism and digital empathy for trainees may also be beneficial.","Lawrence, Katharine; Hanley, Kathleen; Adams, Jennifer; Sartori, Daniel J; Greene, Richard; Zabar, Sondra",J Gen Intern Med,,351
296694,Reorganisation of medical oncology departments during the novel coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: a nationwide Italian survey,2020,"This study aims to understand how Covid-19 contagious disease and the EU's policy response may affect macroeconomic performance. Previous studies on this topic have used historical data sets on ""rare macroeconomic disasters"" such as Great Influenza to assess the impact of the current pandemic on the global economy. The authors examine the main channels of transmission and targeted policy response to mitigate crisis qualitatively. The authors use heuristics and apply qualitative trend-based analysis because the current pandemic is a unique event for which accurate quantitative data are not currently available. Researchers first identify a set of eight variables based on previous academic theories. They then express each variable as a trend: ascending, descending, and constant. The numerical calculations consist of 17 scenarios, supplemented by 24 transitions and a transition graph. Besides, the article proposes a graphical solution to examine the change in GDP that is too small. The results of the study should be understood as a reference point to allow both private and public stakeholders to understand better the relationship between the observed variables and their dynamics. The research provides a comprehensive list of future events to examine further the implications for the economy as a whole and each individual.

Among them, 7-(4-(4-(6-fluorobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl) piperidin- 1-yl) butoxy)-2,2-dimethylchroman-4-one (6j) exhibited a promising preclinical profile. Compound 6j not only showed high affinity for dopamine D2, D3, and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A receptors, but was also endowed with low to moderate activities on 5-HT2C, &#945;1, and H1 receptors, indicating a low liability to induce side effects such as weight gain, orthostatic hypotension and QT prolongation. In vivo behavioral studies suggested that 6j has favorable effects in alleviating the schizophrenia-like symptoms without causing catalepsy. Taken together, compound 6j has the potential to be further developed as a novel atypical antipsychotic.","Gao, Lanchang; Yang, Zhengge; Xiong, Jiaying; Hao, Chao; Ma, Ru; Liu, Xin; Liu, Bi-Feng; Jin, Jian; Zhang, Guisen; Chen, Yin",Molecules (Basel),,351
302301,The different manifestations of COVID-19 in adults and children: a cohort study in an intensive care unit,2021,"In Russia, initiatives for healthy ageing have been growing over the last two decades; however, none use an evidence-based (EB) approach. It is proposed that Kazan, a city with a population of over a million in the European part of Russia, has good chances of moving towards age-friendliness and contributing to raising awareness about healthy ageing through Cochrane evidence. One of the eight essential features of age-friendly cities by the World Health Organisation (WHO) directly points to health services. This exploratory study assesses the health information needs of the ageing population of Kazan and the challenges people face in improving their health and longevity. Survey data were used from 134 participants, patients, caregivers and healthcare providers of the Interregional Clinical Diagnostic Centre (ICDC), aged from 30 to over 80 years, and potential associations of the studied parameters with age, gender, quality of life and other characteristics were analysed. Older people (60+) were less positive about their quality of life, took medicines more often on a daily basis (10/16 compared to 29/117 of people under 60), encountered problems with ageing (9/16 compared to 21/117 of people under 60) and rated their quality of life as unsatisfactory (4/14 compared to 9/107 of people under 60). Awareness of EB approaches and Cochrane was higher within health professions (evidence-based medicine: 42/86 vs. 13/48; Cochrane: 32/86 vs. 2/48), and health information needs did not differ between age or gender groups or people with a satisfactory and unsatisfactory quality of life. The minority (10%-13/134) were aware of ageism without age or gender differences. The low awareness calls for the need of Cochrane intervention both for consumers and those in the health profession to raise awareness to contribute to Kazan moving towards an age-friendly city.","Ziganshina, Liliya Eugenevna; Yudina, Ekaterina V; Talipova, Liliya I; Sharafutdinova, Guzel N; Khairullin, Rustem N",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,351
302302,The different manifestations of COVID-19 in adults and children: a cohort study in an intensive care unit,2021,"Purpose: The article shows the needs of vessel decommissioning market. Collected data used in the paper consist period of 2014-2019, before the COVID- 19 epidemy starts. To improve health, safety and life of workers as well as environmental protection related to the decommissioning process, which mainly take place in the South Asian shipyards, the concept of Design for Recycling DfR and Hong Kong Convention are brought up into the daylight. Implementing the DfR is to make the whole decommissioning process as simple and cost-effective as possible. The vessel design stage, with selection of building materials and new technologies used, is the area where constant changes and updates are taking place. Making the Honk Kong Convention alive, will put the duty on the ship owners to dismantle their vessels in shipyards, which are authorized by the adequate Administration of State. Methodology/Approach: Data used for analysis were implemented from UNCTAD. Final deductions has been shown in tables and figures. Findings: Ratification of HK Convention is essential to improve protection of the workers involved in decommissioning process and to protect environment. Practical Implications: Analysis presented in the article underline the need of changes in vessel dismantling market.

303781,Thoracic Surgeons' Insights: Improving Thoracic Surgery Outcomes During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the interruption of most manometry or impedance-pH monitoring studies. The risk of restarting activities is unknown. OBJECTIVE: assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, both to patients and healthcare workers, in relation to esophageal and anorectal functional tests during the pandemic without protective measures. METHOD: a questionnaire was designed to determine whether patients and healthcare workers had COVID-19, confirmed by either a test or compatible symptoms, after functional studies were performed from January until March 2020. RESULTS: the survey was answered by 263 (92.9 %) patients. Four (1.52 %) patients had confirmed COVID-19 in the two weeks after the functional test (adjusted rate 8.34 cases per 1,000 [95 % CI -0.06-16.74], OR 0.84 [95 % CI: 0.83-0.85], p < 0.001) and no patient after anorectal manometry. Another five had only compatible symptoms, for a total of nine patients (3.42 %) (adjusted rate 27.50 cases/1,000 [95 % CI: 7.27-47.74], OR 2.84 [95 % CI: 2.81-2.87]). In the total study period, 18.25 % had confirmed COVID-19 or compatible symptoms. The average number of days between the procedure and the first day of symptoms was progressively shortened (January: 56 days, February: 33 days, March: 10.5 days). Two of ten healthcare workers (20 %) had confirmed COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: the risk of COVID-19 infection when performing functional tests is low and more related to the evolution of the pandemic rather than to the procedure itself. The small number of healthcare workers included in the study does not allow a definitive conclusion to be drawn on their risk of infection.","Pérez de la Serna Y Bueno, Julio; Ruiz de León San Juan, Antonio; Sevilla Mantilla, Concepción; Ciriza de Los Ríos, Constanza; Atarain Valles, Ana; Aparicio Cabezudo, Marta; García Pravia, Laura; Olivares Quintanar, David; Rey Díaz-Rubio, Enrique",Rev Esp Enferm Dig,,351

Comparison of the results of calculations of the epidemic spread, as well as the values of the seven-day incidence values with the corresponding observation data, shows their good correspondence for each of the selected age groups. The greatest influence on the overall spread of the epidemic is in the 20-40 age groups. The relatively low level of vaccination and the high intensity of contact in these age groups contributes to the emergence of new waves of the epidemic, which is especially active when the virus mutates and the lockdown conditions are relaxed. The intensity of the epidemic in the 90+ age group has some peculiarities compared to other groups, which may be explained by differences in contact patterns among individuals in this age group compared to others. Approximate ratios for estimating mortality as a function of the intensity of infection for individual age groups are provided. The proposed stratified ASILV model by age group will allow more detailed and accurate prediction of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including when new, more transmissible versions of the virus mutate and emerge.","Mairanowski, Felix; Below, Denis",,,351

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to study factors associated with COVID-19 and AC in HCWs of a COVID-19 academic medical center. METHODS: This is a case-control study. Cases were either symptomatic or asymptomatic HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result between March 16 and May 21 of 2020. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were calculated by means of multivariable logistic regression. In addition, each subject was followed for 14 days to inform outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred thirty of 249 (52.2%) symptomatic HCWs had COVID-19; 10 were hospitalized but none died. Of 987 asymptomatic HCWs,37 (3.7%) were AC; 6 of the remaining 950 asymptomatic HCWs with a negative PCR test result were found to be presymptomatic COVID-19 cases the following 14 days. Nurses were more frequently present in the COVID-19 group (51.5% vs. 37.0%), but multivariable analysis rendered non-significant results. After adjustment for age, comorbidities, and working place, factors found to be associated with AC were: working in wards as a nurse (aOR = 9.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-80.22, p = 0.045), kitchen personnel (aOR = 4.09, 95% CI = 1.55-10.83, p = 0.005), and being a physician (aOR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.03-0.54, p = 0.006).

Therefore, detection of IL-6 at low concentrations permits early diagnosis of worst-case outcome in viral respiratory infections. Here, a versatile biointerface is presented that eliminates nonspecific adhesion and thus enables immunofluorescence detection of IL-6 in whole human plasma or whole human blood during coagulation, down to a limit of detection of 0.5 pg mL-1 . The sensitivity of the developed lubricant-infused biosensor for immunofluorescence assays in detecting low molecular weight proteins such as IL-6 is facilitated by i) producing a bioink in which the capture antibody is functionalized by an epoxy-based silane for covalent linkage to the fluorosilanized surface and ii) suppressing nonspecific adhesion by patterning the developed bioink into a lubricant-infused coating. The developed biosensor addresses one of the major challenges for biosensing in complex fluids, namely nonspecific adhesion, therefore paving the way for highly sensitive biosensing in complex fluids.","Shakeri, Amid; Jarad, Noor Abu; Terryberry, Jeff; Khan, Shadman; Leung, Ashlyn; Chen, Simeng; Didar, Tohid F",Small,,351

Social scientists have rarely studied face mask wearing, leaving little guidance for methods to encourage these behaviours. In the current article, we provide an approach to address this issue by developing the 32-item and 8-dimension Face Mask Perceptions Scale (FMPS). We begin by developing an over-representative item list in a qualitative study, wherein participants' responses are used to develop items to ensure content relevance. This item list is then reduced via exploratory factor analysis in a second study, and the eight dimensions of the scale are supported. We also support the validity of the FMPS, as the scale significantly relates to both face mask wearing and health perceptions. We lastly confirm the factor structure of the FMPS in a third study via confirmatory factor analysis. From these efforts, we identify an avenue that social scientists can aid in preventing coronavirus and illness more broadly - by studying face mask perceptions and behaviours.","Howard, Matt C",Br. j. health psychol,,351

Interestingly, in the nineteenth century, regular and rigorous handwashing was a key (and controversial) solution proposed by the Hungarian obstetrician Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis to cut drastically cases of puerperal fever. The purpose of this study was to provide evidence that the case of Semmelweis and puerperal fever-a crucial historical scientific controversy-can be used as a springboard to promote university student argumentation. Our study was inspired by the fact that the Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (OECD) stressed that more efforts and resources should be invested in promoting argumentation as an essential component for scientifically literate citizens in twenty-first century societies. However, nowadays, argument and debate are virtually absent from university science education. The data was derived from 124 undergraduates' (64 females and 60 males, 15-30 years old) written responses and audio and video recordings in a university biology course in Colombia. The findings show that the articulation of this historical controversy with decision-making, small-group debate, and whole-class debate activities can be useful for promoting undergraduates' argumentation. This study contributes to the development of a research-based university science education that can inform the design of an argumentation curriculum for higher education.","Archila, Pablo Antonio; Molina, Jorge; Truscott de Mejía, Anne-Marie",Sci Educ (Dordr),,351

In this multicenter retrospective cohort study we included adult patients with COVID-19, need of respiratory support, and elevated C-reactive protein who received intravenous tocilizumab in addition to standard of care. Control patients not receiving tocilizumab were matched for sex, age and respiratory support. We selected survival as the primary endpoint, along with need for invasive ventilation, thrombosis, hemorrhage, and infections as secondary endpoints at 30 days. We included 64 patients with COVID-19 in the tocilizumab group and 64 matched controls. At baseline the tocilizumab group had longer symptom duration (13 ± 5 vs. 9 ± 5 days) and received hydroxychloroquine more often than controls (100% vs. 81%). The mortality rate was similar between groups (27% with tocilizumab vs. 38%) and at multivariable analysis risk of death was not significantly influenced by tocilizumab (hazard ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.33-1.15), while being associated with the use at baseline of non invasive mechanical or invasive ventilation, and the presence of comorbidities. Among secondary outcomes, tocilizumab was associated with a lower probability of requiring invasive ventilation (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.83; P = 0.017) but not with the risk of thrombosis, bleeding, or infections. The use of intravenous tocilizumab was not associated with changes in 30-day mortality in patients with COVID-19 severe respiratory impairment.

314777,Imaging Features of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): Evaluation on Thin-Section CT,2020,"BACKGROUND: Older adults constitute the group most vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality. As a result, in North America and elsewhere, older adults have been strongly advised to shelter in place. Older adults also represent the fastest growing segment of licensed drivers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the change in injuries and fatalities sustained by younger and older drivers and pedestrians during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that adults ages 80 years and over would have a proportionally larger reduction than the other drivers and pedestrians. METHODS: Using a cohort design, we compared the proportion of drivers and pedestrians involved in injuries and fatalities attributable to individuals aged 80 years and over, as recorded in the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (Canada) database, between the 30 days prior to shelter-in-place related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent 30 days. By way of comparison, we conducted a similar comparison for younger age cohorts (16-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65-79 years). RESULTS: Drivers aged 80 years and over represented 21 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days prior to March 17, 2020 (95 % CI: 15-29), and 8 per 1000 injuries and fatalities in the 30 days beginning on that date (95 % CI: 2-20), a 64.7 % reduction (exp (ß) post 0.353, 95 % CI 0.105-0.892). Drivers in the 35-54 year age range underwent a significant but smaller reduction of 22.9 %; no significant changes were seen for drivers in other age groups, or for pedestrians of any age. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The physical distancing measures that aimed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a marked reduction in driver injuries and fatalities in the oldest old, illustrating the impact of physical distancing recommendations in this population. The excess mortality burden faced by the oldest adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, by direct exposure to the virus, may be indirectly mitigated by the reduction in road-related deaths in this cohort.","Rapoport, Mark J; Chee, Justin N; Aljenabi, Nadia; Byrne, Patrick A; Naglie, Gary; Ilari, Frances; Elzohairy, Yoassry; Vingilis, Evelyn; Mulsant, Benoit H",Accid Anal Prev,,351

Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional investigation. An exploratory review of the official publication of state governments and the Federal District to find out the strategies for the execution of the National School Feeding Program, after school closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Information on the form of execution and the public served by the action were reviewed in a descriptive manner. Results Out of the 27 federative units, 55% distributed food kits, 26% supplied food cards/vouchers and 19% provided food kits and food cards/vouchers. As to the scope, 37% maintained general service, 30% attended schoolchildren from families registered in the Brazilian cash transfer program (Bolsa Família) and 26% attended schoolchildren from families registered in the Underprivileged Families Registry. Conclusion The National School Feeding Program was weak in terms of assuring the Human Right to Adequate Food and Food and Nutrition Security.

Inferences under such models are distorted in the presence of measurement error, which is very common in practice. In this article, we establish analytical results for quantifying the biases of the parameter estimation in AR models if the measurement error effects are neglected. We propose two measurement error models to describe different processes of data contamination. An estimating equation approach is proposed for the estimation of the model parameters with measurement error effects accounted for. We further discuss forecasting using the proposed method. Our work is inspired by COVID-19 data, which are error-contaminated due to multiple reasons including the asymptomatic cases and varying incubation periods. We implement our proposed method by conducting sensitivity analyses and forecasting of the mortality rate of COVID-19 over time for the four most populated provinces in Canada. The results suggest that incorporating or not incorporating measurement error effects yields rather different results for parameter estimation and forecasting.","Zhang, Qihuang; Yi, Grace Y.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05649v1.pdf,351

Based on fear appeal theories, this research proposed a chain reaction model that links physical distance to the nearest patients, which is informed by the location information of patients, citizens' anxiety, attention to information and preventive behaviors. To test the hypothesized model, we conducted a study during the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China in March 2020. The survey of 2061 people from 244 cities across 30 provinces showed that physical distance to confirmed cases has a significant influence on citizens' anxiety, which in turn can improve their preventive behaviors through the mediating factor of attention to information. In addition, this research also revealed the twofold effects of vertical collectivism as a personality trait on anxiety. These findings will provide support to help governments take actions to reduce citizens' anxiety and promote preventive behaviors.","Wu, Guobin; Deng, Xiaopeng; Liu, Bingsheng",Curr Psychol,,351
318598,Thorax CT Findings in Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"We propose a mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a homogeneously mixing non constant population, and generalize it to a model where the parameters are given by piecewise constant functions. This allows us to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection. We claim that this methodology is a tool with enormous potential in the current pandemic context, and can be applied in the management of outbreaks (in regional terms) but also to manage the opening/closing of borders.","Silva, Cristiana J; Cantin, Guillaume; Cruz, Carla; Fonseca-Pinto, Rui; Passadouro, Rui; Soares Dos Santos, Estevão; Torres, Delfim F M",J Math Anal Appl,,351

The analysis is conducted using Bayesian structural time-series and focuses on nine crime categories and on the overall crime count, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020. We concentrate on two post-intervention time windows-from March 4th to March 16th and from March 4th to March 28th 2020-to dynamically assess the short-term effects of mild and strict policies. In Los Angeles, overall crime has significantly decreased, as well as robbery, shoplifting, theft, and battery. No significant effect has been detected for vehicle theft, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, intimate partner assault, and homicide.

This situation would affect the diagnosis and treatment of patients with STEMI. The outbreak was under improved control in the mainland of China. We here describe the impact of this pandemic on STEMI patient's management. METHODS: Information of STEMI patient management was collected from the CPC data reporting platform. We compared these with data of patients from the same period in 2018 and 2019. Also we made an analysis of those characteristics in each month in 2020. RESULTS: There was 51.4% decrease of STEMI patients admitted to hospital during the peak period of COVID-19 epidemic. The ratio of no reperfusion of STEMI patients is more than 10% higher in 2020 than 2018, 2019. The percentage of STEMI patients received fibrinolysis in 2020 was 2 to 3 times higher than that in 2018, 2019, while the volume of PPCI dropped by more than half. The mortality rate of whole cohort and perioperative was the highest in February 2020. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reduced the number of STEMI patients attending hospital and delay the time to treatment and consequently, a higher in-hospital mortality. The benefits of thrombolysis during the pandemic remain to be proven.","Zhang, Feifei; Song, Xuelian; Dang, Yi",Cardiovasc. revasc. med,,351

323413,Recurrence of COVID-19 related symptoms and viral detection in a patient discharged after complete recovery and test negativization,2021,"BACKGROUND: Older cancer survivors, faced with both age- and treatment-related morbidity, are at increased and premature risk for physical function limitations. Physical performance is an important predictor of disability, quality of life, and premature mortality, and thus is considered an important target of interventions designed to prevent, delay, or attenuate physical functional decline. Currently, low-cost, valid, and reliable, methods to remotely assess physical performance tests that are self-administered by older adults in the home-setting do not exist. This limits the reach, scalability, and dissemination of interventions. OBJECTIVE: To describe the rationale and design for a study to evaluate the accuracy, reliability, safety, and acceptability of videoconferencing and self-administered tests of functional mobility and strength by older cancer survivors in their own homes. METHODS: To enable remote assessment, participants receive a toolkit and instructions for setting up their test course and communicating with the investigator. Two standard gerontologic performance tests are being evaluated: the Timed Up and Go test and the 30-second chair stand test. Phase 1 of the study evaluates proof-of-concept that older cancer survivors (age &#8805;60 years) can follow the testing protocol and use a tablet PC to communicate with the study investigator. Phase 2 evaluates the criterion validity of videoconference compared to direct observation of the two physical performance tests. Phase 3 evaluates reliability by enrolling 5-10 participants who agree to repeat the remote assessment (without direct observation). Phase 4 enrolls 5-10 new study participants to complete the remote assessment test protocol. Feedback from participants in each phase is used to refine the test protocol and instructions. RESULTS: Enrollment began in December 2019. Ten participants completed the Phase 1 proof-of-concept. The study was paused in mid-March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This validity and reliability study will provide important information on the acceptability and safety of using videoconferencing to remotely assess two tests of functional mobility and strength, self-administered by older adults in their homes. Videoconferencing has the potential to expand the reach, scalability, and dissemination of interventions to older cancer survivors, and potentially other older adults, especially in rural areas.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: University-affiliated fertility center. PATIENT(S): Patients who underwent FET at the New York University Langone Fertility Center. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was incidence of SCH by protocol in FET cycles. RESULT(S): There were 1,273 FET cycles that met criteria for inclusion. The frequency of SCH was lower in natural compared with programmed cycles (P<.05; relative risk = 0.4 [0.27-0.78]; odds ratio = 0.4 [0.23-0.75]). Serum estrogen level was higher in programmed compared with natural cycles on day of progesterone initiation (P<.001) and cycle day 28 (P<.001). However, serum estrogen levels at the same time points were not associated with formation of SCH in programmed or natural cycles. CONCLUSION(S): This is the first study to evaluate the formation of SCHs by FET protocol type. Our results highlight that high serum estradiol levels do not independently lead to an increase in rate of SCH. Further research must be done to understand other clinical, or perhaps molecular, differences between natural and programmed FET cycle preparations that can be better associated with SCH formation.","Reich, Jenna; Blakemore, Jennifer K; Grifo, James A",Fertil. steril,,351

In this work, IoT based wearable monitoring device is designed to measure various vital signs related to COVID-19. Moreover, the system automatically alerts the concerned medical authorities about any violations of quarantine for potentially infected patients by monitoring their real time GPS data. The wearable sensor placed on the body is connected to edge node in IoT cloud where the data is processed and analyzed to define the state of health condition. The proposed system is implemented with three layered functionalities as wearable IoT sensor layer, cloud layer with Application Peripheral Interface (API) and Android web layer for mobile phones. Each layer has individual functionality, first the data is measured from IoT sensor layer to define the health symptoms. The next layer is used to store the information in the cloud database for preventive measures, alerts, and immediate actions. The Android mobile application layer is responsible for providing notifications and alerts for the potentially infected patient family respondents. The integrated system has both API and mobile application synchronized with each other for predicting and alarming the situation. The design serves as an essential platform that defines the measured readings of COVID-19 symptoms for monitoring, management, and analysis. Furthermore, the work disseminates how digital remote platform as wearable device can be used as a monitoring device to track the health and recovery of a COVID-19 patient.","Al Bassam, Nizar; Shaik Asif, Hussain; Al Qaraghuli, Ammar; Khan, Jibreal; Sumesh, E P; Lavanya, Vidhya",Inform Med Unlocked,,351

One added benefit when using representations from multilingual models is that they facilitate zero-shot polylingual topic modeling. However, while it has been widely observed that pre-trained embeddings should be fine-tuned to a given task, it is not immediately clear what supervision should look like for an unsupervised task such as topic modeling. Thus, we propose several methods for fine-tuning encoders to improve both monolingual and zero-shot polylingual neural topic modeling. We consider fine-tuning on auxiliary tasks, constructing a new topic classification task, integrating the topic classification objective directly into topic model training, and continued pre-training. We find that fine-tuning encoder representations on topic classification and integrating the topic classification task directly into topic modeling improves topic quality, and that fine-tuning encoder representations on any task is the most important factor for facilitating cross-lingual transfer.","Mueller, Aaron; Dredze, Mark",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05064v1.pdf,351

The clinical course, outcomes, and significance of immunosuppression regimen in heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: We included the first 99 heart transplant recipients at participating centers with COVID-19 and followed patients until resolution. We collected baseline information, symptoms, laboratory studies, vital signs, and outcomes for included patients. The association of immunosuppression regimens at baseline with severe disease were compared using logistic regression, adjusting for age and time since transplant. RESULTS: The median age was 60 years, 25% were female, and 44% were white. The median time post-transplant to infection was 5.6 years. Overall, 15% died, 64% required hospital admission, and 7% remained asymptomatic. During the course of illness, only 57% of patients had a fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms were common. Tachypnea, oxygen requirement, elevated creatinine and inflammatory markers were predictive of severe course. Age &#8805; 60 was associated with higher risk of death and the use of the combination of calcineurin inhibitor, antimetabolite, and prednisone was associated with more severe disease compared to the combination of calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite alone (adjusted OR = 7.3, 95% CI 1.8-36.2).

338637,Worsening of heart failure by coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with high mortality,2021,"Adipose tissue inflammation appears to be a risk factor for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the effect of CKD on adipose tissue inflammation is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify the involvement of uremic toxins (indoxyl sulfate (IS), 3-indoleacetic acid, p-cresyl sulfate and kynurenic acid) on CKD-induced adipose tissue inflammation. IS induces monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the differentiated 3T3L-1 adipocyte. An organic anion transporter (OAT) inhibitor, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor or an antioxidant suppresses the IS-induced MCP-1 expression and ROS production, suggesting the OAT/NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway is involved in the action of IS. Co-culturing 3T3L-1 adipocytes and mouse macrophage cells showed incubating adipocytes with IS increased macrophage infiltration. An IS-overload in healthy mice increased IS levels, oxidative stress and MCP-1 expression in epididymal adipose tissue compared to unloaded mice. Using 5/6-nephrectomized mice, the administration of AST-120 suppressed oxidative stress and the expression of MCP-1, F4/80 and TNF-&#945; in epididymal adipose tissue. These collective data suggest IS could be a therapeutic target for the CKD-related inflammatory response in adipose tissue, and that AST-120 could be useful for the treatment of IS-induced adipose tissue inflammation.","Tanaka, Shoma; Watanabe, Hiroshi; Nakano, Takehiro; Imafuku, Tadashi; Kato, Hiromasa; Tokumaru, Kai; Arimura, Nanaka; Enoki, Yuki; Maeda, Hitoshi; Tanaka, Motoko; Matsushita, Kazutaka; Fukagawa, Masafumi; Maruyama, Toru",Toxins (Basel),,351

Methods: A total of 137 consecutive patients without pre-existing HF and hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled into the current research. The main outcome of the research was the in-hospital death. The independent parameters linked with the in-hospital death were determined by multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 26 deaths with an in-hospital mortality rate of 18.9% was noted. Those who died were older with an increased frequency of co-morbidities such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke and dementia. They had also increased white blood cell (WBC) counts and had elevated glucose, creatinine, troponin I, and NT-pro-BNP levels but had decreased levels of hemoglobin. By multivariable analysis;age, NT-pro-BNP, WBC, troponin I, and creatinine levels were independently linked with the in-hospital mortality. After ROC evaluation, the ideal value of the NT-pro-BNP to predict the in-hospital mortality was found as 260 ng/L reflecting a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 93% (AUC:0.86;95%CI:0.76-0.97). Conclusion: The current research clearly shows that the NT-proBNP levels are independently linked with the in-hospital mortality rates in subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia and without HF. Thus, we believe that this biomarker can be used as a valuable prognostic parameter in such cases.","Selçuk, M.; Keskin, M.; Çinar, T.; Günay, N.; Dogan, S.; Çiçek, V.; Kiliç, S.; Asal, S.; Yavuz, S.; Keser, N.; Orhan, A.

347284,The Pan London Emergency Cardiac Surgery service blueprint,2020,"Adipose cell-free derivatives have been recently gaining attention as potential therapeutic agents for various human diseases. In this context, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs), adipocyte mesenchymal stem cells (Ad-MSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) possessing potent immunomodulatory activities are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 represents a global concern of public health caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in which there is not actually any specific therapy. MSCs exert an immunomodulation effect due to the secretion of endogenous factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin growth factor (IGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß and growth differentiation factor (GDF)-11. Recent reports are promising for further studies and clinical applications of ADSCs and Ad-MSCs in COVID-19 patients. Experimental and clinical studies are exploring the therapeutic potential of both MSCs and derived-exosomes in moderating the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. In this field, more preclinical and clinical studies are warranted to find an effective treatment for the patients suffering from COVID-19 infection.","Mazini, Loubna; Rochette, Luc; Malka, Gabriel",J Transl Med,,351

To ensure high production through effective decision-making and auditable standards, producers are required to have better traceability and record systems. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) reviewing the current recording/data management and animal traceability systems used by small-scale farmers in developing countries and (2) analyzing how data management systems should be designed to enhance efficient decision-making and animal traceability from farm to fork. This study found that, still, a majority of small-scale farmers do not keep records leading to poor decision-making on the farm and policymaking. We also found that those who keep records do not store their data in electronic format, which again poses another challenge in data analysis. Moreover, this study found that the majority of traceability tools used by farmers in developing countries do not meet international standards based on tools they use for tracing animals; farmers were reported to use tools like branding and ear tagging, which provide very little information about the animal. Such tools lack the capability to keep track of useful information about an animal, e.g., information about feeding and animal health. In conclusion, this study recommended a better electronic system to be used at the farm level to facilitate data analysis, hence promoting informed decision-making and adherence to the international animal traceability standards. Otherwise, there is a need for researchers to conduct more studies in developing different analytical models for exploring on-farm data in order to improve the decision-making process by farmers and other stakeholders.","Mwanga, G; Mbega, E; Yonah, Z; Chagunda, M G G",ScientificWorldJournal,,351

From the beginning of 2020 it rapidly spread, affecting the whole world, but with a major impact in Europe and North America. At the moment of writing, there are more than 2 million confirmed cases with more than 125.000 confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 globally. In Croatia, there are currently 1.741 confirmed cases with 34 deaths related to the virus. The COVID-19 rapid spread and magnitude of pandemic unleashed panic among people which warrants public health officials to also address the epidemic of fear. Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological factors may play a role in coronaphobia. Nov-elty and uncertainty what the unknown brings is likely the cause of COVID-19 fear. With the sharp increase in number of affected persons by pandemic, both infected or suspected cases in isolation, fear and anxiety grew in general population, which warranted a significant increase in need for psychiatric support for both patients and medical staff. After initial stabilization of the situation and a prompt response to increased needs for mental support, during this time of pandemic, self-isolations and imposed social distancing, the strongest earthquake this city has experienced in the last 140 years hit Croatian capital Zagreb. During these trying times, maintaining good mental health of both medical personnel as well as the general population is crucial for both health and mental damage control. In Croatia, crisis interventions aimed for those most exposed to mental impact of pandemic and natural disasters is limited.","Peitl, Vjekoslav; Zatezalo, Vedrana Golubić; Karlović, Dalibor",Arch.

351029,Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Patients With Non-severe Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Have Similar Clinical Features and Virological Courses: A Retrospective Single Center Study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Understanding public perceptions of government responses to COVID-19 may foster improved public cooperation. Trust in government and population risk of exposure may influence public perception of the response. Other population-level characteristics, such as country socio-economic development, COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and degree of democratic government, may influence perception. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a novel ten-item instrument that asks respondents to rate key aspects of their government's response to the pandemic (COVID-SCORE). We examined whether the results varied by gender, age group, education level, and monthly income. We also examined the internal and external validity of the index using appropriate predefined variables. To test for dimensionality of the results, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) for the ten survey items. We found that Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 and that the first component of the PCA explained 60% of variance with the remaining factors having eigenvalues below 1, strongly indicating that the tool is both reliable and unidimensional. Based on responses from 13,426 people randomly selected from the general population in 19 countries, the mean national scores ranged from 35.76 (Ecuador) to 80.48 (China) out of a maximum of 100 points. Heterogeneity in responses was observed across age, gender, education and income with the greatest amount of heterogeneity observed between countries. National scores correlated with respondents' reported levels of trust in government and with country-level COVID-19 mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-SCORE survey instrument demonstrated satisfactory validity. It may help governments more effectively engage constituents in current and future efforts to control COVID-19. Additional country-specific assessment should be undertaken to measure trends over time and the public perceptions of key aspects of government responses in other countries.","Lazarus, Jeffrey V; Ratzan, Scott; Palayew, Adam; Billari, Francesco C; Binagwaho, Agnes; Kimball, Spencer; Larson, Heidi J; Melegaro, Alessia; Rabin, Kenneth; White, Trenton M; El-Mohandes, Ayman",PLoS One,,351

359411,Pancreatic Injury Patterns in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 19 Pneumonia,2020,"Background: One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. Methods: We examined immune parameters in CSF and blood samples from a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications (n=6), compared to SARS-CoV-2 uninfected controls (Fig1A). Immune cells were characterized by single cell RNA and repertoire sequencing. Intrathecal antibodies were assessed for anti-viral and auto-reactivity by ELISA, mouse brain immunostaining, phage display, and IP-MS. Results: Through single cell and parallel cytokine analyses of CSF and paired plasma, we found divergent T cell responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-1B and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation (Fig1B). We found evidence of clonal expansion of B cells in the CSF, with B cell receptor sequences that were unique from those observed in peripheral blood B cells (Fig1C), suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-antibodies. Next, we directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies targeted self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. COVID-19 CSF produced immunoreactive staining of specific anatomic regions of the brain including cortical neurons, olfactory bulb, thalamus, and cerebral vasculature. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients' CSF and peripheral blood, and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens-including one CSF-derived mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue (Fig1D). Conclusion: This immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS in COVID-19 patients with neurologic symptoms. We identified both innate and adaptive anti-viral immune responses, as well as humoral autoimmunity that appears to be unique to the CNS during SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data suggest a potential role for autoimmunity in contributing to neurological symptoms, and merit further investigation to the potential role of autoantibodies in post-acute COVID-19 neurological symptoms.","Song, E.; Bartley, C.; Chow, R.; Ngo, T.; Jiang, R.; Zamecnik, C.; Dandekar, R.; McAlpine, L.; Spudich, S.

While the platform economy provides immigrants with quick access into a host country?s labour market, the income insecurity and high risks associated with such work put them in a state of precariousness. Through the framework of Engels? proposed action lines and analysis of observations and interviews with immigrant riders working for the food delivery platforms Glovo and Deliveroo, the paper highlights the negative impacts that this contemporary capitalist model of work, the municipal housing plan and the ongoing Covid-19 crisis have on the immigrant riders? residential and working conditions in Barcelona, Spain, a city facing a severe rental housing shortage. Lastly, it suggests that, while the social market economy in Spain can be reformed to ameliorate the negative impacts of the platform economy on immigrant riders, bridging the gap between immigrant housing provision and employment inclusion would need to consider decent labour and housing as rights for residents, immigrants included, asserting the currency of Engels? ideas.","Metawala, Prachi Golda-Pongratz Kathrin Irazábal Clara",Human Geography,,351

363351,The impact of increased awareness of acute kidney injury in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on acute kidney injury incidence and reporting: results of a retrospective cohort study,2020,"Virtual encounters have experienced an exponential rise amid the current COVID-19 crisis. This abrupt change, seen in response to unprecedented medical and environmental challenges, has been forced upon the orthopaedic community. However, such changes to adopting virtual care and technology were already in the evolution forecast, albeit in an unpredictable timetable impeded by regulatory and financial barriers. This adoption is not meant to replace, but rather augment established, traditional models of care while ensuring patient/provider safety, especially during the pandemic. While our department, like those of other institutions, has performed virtual care for several years, it represented a small fraction of daily care. The pandemic required an accelerated and comprehensive approach to the new reality. Contemporary literature has already shown equivalent safety and patient satisfaction, as well as superior efficiency and reduced expenses with musculoskeletal virtual care (MSKVC) versus traditional models. Nevertheless, current literature detailing operational models of MSKVC is scarce. The current review describes our pre-pandemic MSKVC model and the shift to a MSKVC pandemic workflow that enumerates the conceptual workflow organization (patient triage, from timely care provision based on symptom acuity/severity to a continuum that includes future follow-up). Furthermore, specific setup requirements (both resource/personnel requirements such as hardware, software, and network connectivity requirements, and patient/provider characteristics respectively), and professional expectations are outlined. MSKVC has already become a pivotal element of musculoskeletal care, due to COVID-19, and these changes are confidently here to stay. Readiness to adapt and evolve will be required of individual musculoskeletal clinical teams as well as organizations, as established paradigms evolve.

363583,Proliferation of Papers and Preprints During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: Progress or Problems With Peer Review?,2020,"Background: This was a phase 1, dose-escalation open-label trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901, a SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein vaccine adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and CpG 1018. Methods: Between September 28 and November 13 2020, 77 participants were screened. Of these, 45 healthy adults from 20 to 49 years of age were to be administered two doses of MVC-COV1901 in doses of 5 µg, 15 µg, or 25 µg of spike protein at 28 days apart. There were 15 participants in each dose group; all were followed for 28 days after the second dose at the time of the interim analysis. Adverse events and laboratory data were recorded for the safety evaluation. Blood samples were collected for humoral, and cellular immune response at various time points. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04487210. Findings: Solicited adverse events were mostly mild and similar. No subject experienced fever. After the second dose, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) for SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific immunoglobulin G were 7178.2, 7746.1, 11,220.6 in the 5 µg, 15 µg, and 25 µg dose groups, respectively. The neutralizing activity were detected in both methods. (Day 43 GMTs, 538.5, 993.1, and 1905.8 for pseudovirus; and 33.3, 76.3, and 167.4 for wild-type virus). The cellular immune response induced by MVC-COV1901 demonstrated substantially higher numbers of IFN-Î³- producing cells, suggesting a Th1-skewed immune response. Interpretation: The MVC-COV1901 vaccine was well tolerated and elicited robust immune responses and is suitable for further development.

In this paper, we argue that the redundancy and ambiguity of subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples in open information extraction systems has to be treated as an equally important step in order to ensure the quality and preciseness of generated triples. To this end, we propose a pipeline approach for information extraction from large corpora, encompassing a series of natural language processing tasks. Our methodology consists of four steps: i. in-place coreference resolution, ii. extractive text summarization, iii. parallel triple extraction, and iv. entity enrichment and graph representation. We manifest our methodology on a large medical dataset (CORD-19), relying on state-of-the-art tools to fulfil the aforementioned steps and extract triples that are subsequently mapped to a comprehensive ontology of biomedical concepts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our information extraction method by comparing it in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score with state-of-the-art OIE engines and demonstrate its capabilities on a set of data exploration tasks.","Papadopoulos, Dimitris; Papadakis, Nikolaos; Litke, Antonis",Appl.

364875,Telemedicine In Vascular Surgery During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic - A Multi-Site Healthcare System Experience,2020,"The severe forms and worsened outcomes of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) are closely associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Endothelial cells express Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the entrance door for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The hallmarks of severe illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are increased levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, neutrophilia and lymphopenia, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy and microthrombi of alveolar capillaries. The endothelial glycocalyx, a proteoglycan- and glycoprotein-rich layer covering the luminal side of endothelial cells, contributes to vascular homeostasis. It regulates vascular tonus and permeability, prevents thrombosis, and modulates leukocyte adhesion and inflammatory response. We hypothesized that cytokine production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation associated with COVID-19 leads to glycocalyx degradation. A cohort of 20 hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis and healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Mechanisms associated with glycocalyx degradation in COVID-19 were investigated. Increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and IL1-ß, as well as increased lipid peroxidation and glycocalyx components were detected in plasma from COVID-19 patients compared to plasma from healthy subjects. Plasma from COVID-19 patients induced glycocalyx shedding in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and disrupted redox balance. Treatment of HUVECs with low molecular weight heparin inhibited the glycocalyx perturbation. In conclusion, plasma from COVID-19 patients promotes glycocalyx shedding and redox imbalance in endothelial cells, and heparin treatment potentially inhibits glycocalyx disruption.","Potje, Simone R; Costa, Tiago J; Fraga-Silva, Thais F C; Martins, Ronaldo B; Benatti, Maira N; Almado, Carlos E L; de Sá, Keyla S G; Bonato, Vânia L D; Arruda, Eurico; Louzada-Junior, Paulo; Oliveira, Rene D R; Zamboni, Dario S; Becari, Christiane; Auxiliadora-Martins, Maria; Tostes, Rita C",Life Sci,,351

We generate a linear epitope landscape of the Spike protein by analyzing the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) response of 1,051 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with a peptide microarray. We reveal two regions rich in linear epitopes, i.e., C-terminal domain (CTD) and a region close to the S2' cleavage site and fusion peptide. Unexpectedly, we find that the receptor binding domain (RBD) lacks linear epitope. We reveal that the number of responsive peptides is highly variable among patients and correlates with disease severity. Some peptides are moderately associated with severity and clinical outcome. By immunizing mice, we obtain linear-epitope-specific antibodies; however, no significant neutralizing activity against the authentic virus is observed for these antibodies. This landscape will facilitate our understanding of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral responses and might be useful for vaccine refinement.","Li, Yang; Ma, Ming-Liang; Lei, Qing; Wang, Feng; Hong, Wei; Lai, Dan-Yun; Hou, Hongyan; Xu, Zhao-Wei; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Hong; Yu, Caizheng; Xue, Jun-Biao; Zheng, Yun-Xiao; Wang, Xue-Ning; Jiang, He-Wei; Zhang, Hai-Nan; Qi, Huan; Guo, Shu-Juan; Zhang, Yandi; Lin, Xiaosong; Yao, Zongjie; Wu, Jiaoxiang; Sheng, Huiming; Zhang, Yanan; Wei, Hongping; Sun, Ziyong; Fan, Xionglin; Tao, Sheng-Ce",Cell Rep,,351

366117,Pos-003 Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19 Experience of a Icu Bolivian Center Reference,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 infection carries high morbidity and mortality in individuals with chronic disorders. Its impact in rare disease populations such as Gaucher disease (GD) is unknown. In GD, decreased acid ß-glucosidase activity leads to the accumulation of inflammatory glycosphingolipids and chronic myeloid cell immune activation which a priori could predispose to the most severe effects of SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2 infection in GD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in a large cohort. 181 patients were enrolled, including 150 adults and 31 children, with a majority of patients on treatment (78%). Information on COVID-19 exposure, symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or antibody testing was obtained during the peak of the pandemic in the New York City metropolitan area. Forty-five adults reported a primary exposure to someone with COVID-19 and 17 (38%) of these patients reported at least one COVID-19 symptom. A subset of adults was tested (n = 88) and in this group 18% (16/88) were positive. Patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 had significantly more symptoms (4.4 vs 0.3, p < 0.001) than patients testing negative. Among patients who were antibody-positive, quantitative titers indicated moderate to high antibody response. In GD adults, male gender, older age, increased BMI, comorbidities, GBA genotype, prior splenectomy and treatment status were not associated with the probability of reporting symptoms or testing positive. No patient required COVID-19-specific treatments and there were no deaths. Our data suggests that GD does not confer a heightened risk for severe effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection feared based on the known chronic inflammatory state in these patients.","Fierro, Luca; Nesheiwat, Nora; Naik, Hetanshi; Narayanan, Praveena; Mistry, Pramod K; Balwani, Manisha",Mol Genet Metab,,351

However, a recent study found that the Rhadinorhynchidae is paraphyletic, due to the basal position of Rhadinorhynchus biformis Smales, 2014 relative to the Rhadinorhynchidae + Transvenidae. We reassess these relationships with new single-gene and concatenated phylogenetic analyses utilising cox1 mtDNA, 18S rDNA and 28S rDNA, including recently available sequences. Although topologies differed among single-gene analyses, the overall results support R. biformis as representative of a lineage distinct from those of the Rhadinorhynchidae and Transvenidae. Examination of additional specimens of R. biformis allowed us to identify morphological characters that further support this hypothesis. These results lead us to propose transfer of R. biformis to a new genus (Spinulacorpus n. g.) and family (Spinulacorpidae n. fam.) to resolve the paraphyly of the Rhadinorhynchidae.","Huston, Daniel C; Smales, Lesley R",Syst. parasitol,,351
368679,Coronavirus Disease-19 Vaccines Best Reflect Effective Pharmaceuticals,2021,"Momentum strategies are an important part of alternative investments and are at the heart of commodity trading advisors (CTAs). These strategies have however been found to have difficulties adjusting to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the response to regime change, we introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online change-point detection (CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised changepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid, continuous futures contracts over the period 1990-2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe ratio of one-third. Even more notably, this module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the performance boost is approximately two-thirds. This is especially interesting as traditional momentum strategies have been underperforming in this period.","Wood, Kieran; Roberts, Stephen; Zohren, Stefan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13727v2.pdf,351

Interestingly, T-705 was devoid of anti-CHIKV activity in mosquito cells, despite being effective against CHIKV in Vero cells. By investigating the metabolic activation profile, we showed that, unlike Vero cells, mosquito cells were not able to convert T-705 into its active form. To explore whether alternative metabolization pathways might exist in vivo, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were infected with CHIKV and administered T-705 via an artificial blood meal. Virus titrations of whole mosquitoes showed that T-705 was not able to reduce CHIKV infection in mosquitoes.

In mathematics education studies, where collaborative problem‐solving is considered a necessary pedagogical approach, lecturers have had challenges incorporating collaborative problem‐solving in an authentic manner. There are now also complex living and learning contexts in which the students have to undertake their learning processes. This paper examines students’ experiences of the rapid transition to online learning and their perceptions of the advantages and barriers that ensued. A small comparative case study was used to explore the complexity of the situation, within rich, authentic settings. Questionnaires and semi‐structured interviews were used. The participants found that personal circumstances related to having children and partners at home while they studied, and aspects such as not interacting directly with other students to clarify and mediate their thinking, led to major initial frustrations with collaborating. While some of these continued throughout lockdown they did adjust and recognize that the advantages, such as a mix of formal and informal digital pedagogical media, gave them greater flexibility and led to deeper reflective thinking. We contend that some elements related to the adaptions made should become permanent features of face‐to‐face learning. © 2021 by the authors.

Evidence of clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir is controversial. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical outcomes and virological monitoring of the first five COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital, Paris, France, for severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 and treated with remdesivir. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was used to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in blood plasma and the lower and upper respiratory tract. Among the five patients treated, two needed mechanical ventilation and one needed high-flow cannula oxygen. A significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract was observed in most cases, but two patients died with active SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract. Plasma samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 in only one patient. Remdesivir was interrupted before the initialy planned duration in four patients, two because of alanine aminotransferase elevations (3 to 5 normal range) and two because of renal failure requiring renal replacement.

This commentary will briefly clear the myth that CBD can ameliorate a wide range of COVID-19 associated health effects including anxiety, depression, or any substance use disorder, and show that there is a clear lack of sufficient unbiased clinical evidence from well-designed double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials to prove the antianxiety or antidepression therapeutic properties of CBD and support its wide use as medicine to treat COVID-19- associated mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Finally, we suggest that addiction physicians must play an important role in dealing with their patients requesting CBD prescription for treating any of these conditions.","Khalsa, Jag H; Bunt, Greg; Maggirwar, Sanjay B; Kottilil, Shyam",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,351

382860,Follow-up strategy with long-term veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for complicated severe acute respiratory distress related to COVID-19 and recovery of the lungs,2021,"The outbreak of a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which appeared in late 2019 and eventually resulted in the announcement of a pandemic by the World Health Organization, led to global fear and panic as well as the spread of false information and fake news from different sources. As a result, a sharp increase in prejudice, discrimination, and xenophobia against different groups of people was observed in different geographical locations. This chapter presents the psychological and social sources of stereotypes and prejudices that take forms in the COVID-19 pandemic. These sources can be located in psychosocial processes, such as (i) socially generated and reinforced fears; (ii) human responses to stress induced by certain types of stimuli; (iii) sense of helplessness based on the lack of control over reality; (iv) psychological responses reinforced by conformism (crowd psychology); and (v) the stigmatization process. The chapter also presents the main groups of increased risk of experiencing prejudice and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic (Asians, health-care workers, COVID-19 patients, and their relatives). Moreover, it provides a documented example of such behaviors. The groups at higher risk of more adverse effects of COVID-19 due to pre-pandemic discrimination are also discussed. Finally, initiatives taken to mitigate the discrimination associated with COVID-19 are presented, as well as the recommendations and good practices for preventing these behaviors during future outbreaks and for limiting discrimination against COVID-19 until the disease can be contained.","Rzymski, Piotr; Mamzer, Hanna; Nowicki, Michal",Adv Exp Med Biol,,351

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect databases. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) comparing gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) with placebo in patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopic surgery were retrieved. The primary endpoint was the visual analogue scale (VAS) score at 24 hours and cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours. The secondary outcomes were complications of nausea/vomiting, sedation and dizziness. After tests for publication bias and heterogeneity among studies were performed, data were aggregated for random-effects models when necessary. RESULTS: Five clinical studies (gabapentin group n = 4 and pregabalin group n = 1) were ultimately included in the meta-analysis. Gabapentinoids were associated with reduced pain scores at 24 hours. Similarly, gabapentinoids were associated with a reduction in cumulative morphine consumption at 24 hours. Furthermore, gabapentinoids can significantly reduce the occurrence of nausea/vomiting. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of sedation and dizziness. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative use of gabapentinoids was able to reduce postoperative pain, total morphine consumption, and morphine-related complications following arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Further studies should determine the optimal dose and whether pregabalin is superior to gabapentin in controlling acute pain after shoulder surgery.","Galindo-Ávalos, J; Colin-Vázquez, A; López-Valencia, J; Gómez-Gómez, J M; Bernal-Fortich, L D",Acta Ortop Mex,,351

We here describe the course and the outcome of COVID-19 in a cohort of patients undergoing treatment with calcineurin inhibitors. In this monocentric cohort study, data were collected from the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy up to April 28th2020. Patients were followed at our hospital for solid organ transplantation or systemic rheumatic disorders (RMDs) and were on calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based therapy. Selected patients were referred from the North of Italy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical course of COVID-19 in this setting. We evaluated 385 consecutive patients (220 males, 57%; median age 61 years, IQR 48–69); 331 (86%) received solid organ transplantation and 54 (14%) had a RMD. CNIs were the only immunosuppressant administered in 47 patients (12%). We identified 14 (4%) COVID-19 patients, all transplanted, mainly presenting with fever (86%) and diarrhea (71%). Twelve patients were hospitalized and two of them died, both with severe comorbidities. No patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome or infectious complications. The surviving 10 patients are now fully recovered. The clinical course of COVID-19 patients on CNIs is generally mild, and the risk of superinfection seems low.","Cavagna, Lorenzo; Seminari, Elena; Zanframundo, Giovanni; Gregorini, Marilena; Di Matteo, Angela; Rampino, Teresa; Montecucco, Carlomaurizio; Pelenghi, Stefano; Cattadori, Barbara; Pattonieri, Eleonora Francesca; Vitulo, Patrizio; Bertani, Alessandro; Sambataro, Gianluca; Vancheri, Carlo; Biglia, Alessandro; Bozzalla-Cassione, Emanuele; Bonetto, Valentina; Monti, Maria Cristina; Ticozzelli, Elena; Turco, Annalisa; Oggionni, Tiberio; Corsico, Angelo; Bertuccio, Francesco; Zuccaro, Valentina; Codullo, Veronica; Morosini, Monica; Marena, Carlo; Gnecchi, Massimiliano; Pellegrini, Carlo; Meloni, Federica",Microorg.,,351

While understanding of the incidence and case-fatality rates has increased, there are limited data concerning seroprevalence of antibodies against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in healthcare workers during the pre-pandemic period. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in healthcare workers in the southern part of Kyoto city, Japan. Methods: We prospectively recruited healthcare workers from a single hospital between April 10 and April 20, 2020. We collected serum samples from these participants and quantitatively evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Results: Five (5.4%), 15 (16.3%), and 72 (78.3%) participants showed positive, borderline, and negative serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody status, respectively. We found the mean titer associated with each antibody status (overall, positive, borderline, and negative) was clearly differentiated. Participants working at the otolaryngology department and/or with a history of seasonal common cold symptoms had a significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer (p = 0.046, p = 0.046, respectively). Conclusions: Five (5.4%) and 15 (16.3%) participants tested positive and borderline, respectively, for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody during the COVID-19 pre-pandemic period. These rates were higher than expected, based on government situation reports. These findings suggest that COVID-19 had already spread within the southern part of Kyoto city at the early stage of the pandemic.","Fujita, Kohei; Kada, Shinpei; Kanai, Osamu; Hata, Hiroaki; Odagaki, Takao; Satoh-Asahara, Noriko; Tagami, Tetsuya; Yasoda, Akihiro",Front Public Health,,351

Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought rapid changes to the healthcare community. While a few studies have examined the early pandemic experiences of nurses in China and Europe, nurses' experiences across the United States have remained relatively underexplored. Design A qualitative study design was used. Methods Using a constructivist grounded theory methodology and methods, we conducted eight focus groups across four hospital sites in the eastern, midwestern and western United States. Registered nurses with a minimum of six months' experience working in all clinical specialties were eligible. Forty-three nurses participated. Data were analysed iteratively using the constant comparative method. The COREQ guidelines supported the work and reporting of this study. Results The nurses experiencing a pandemic (NEXPIC) grounded theory emerged positing associations between four interrelated themes: Challenges, Feelings, Coping and Ethics. Nurses reported Challenges associated with changes in the work environment, community and themselves. They expressed more negative than positive feelings. Nurses coped using self-care techniques, and teamwork within the healthcare organisation. Moral dilemmas, moral uncertainty, moral distress, moral injury and moral outrage were ethical issues associated with nurses' Challenges during the pandemic. Moral courage was associated with positive Coping. Conclusions Awareness of frontline nurses' complex and interrelated needs may help healthcare organisations protect their human resources. This new theory provides preliminary theoretical support for future research and interventions to address the needs of frontline nurses. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses face added distress as frontline at-risk caregivers. Interventions to promote nurses' ability to cope with personal and professional challenges from the pandemic and address ethical issues are needed to protect the nursing workforce. This study offers a new substantive theory that may be used to underpin future interventions.","Kelley, Marjorie M.; Zadvinskis, Inga Miller Pamela S.; Monturo, Cheryl Norful Allison A.; O’Mathúna, Dónal Roberts Haley Smith Julia Tucker Sharon Zellefrow Cindy Chipps Esther",Journal of Clinical Nursing,,351

In this article, the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Preventive Behaviors Index (CPBI), including its development and validation in two samples in the United Kingdom, are described. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed on data from 470 participants in the United Kingdom who provided demographic information and completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the COVID-19 Own Risk Appraisal Scale (CORAS) and the CPBI. Results showed that a unidimensional, 10-item model fits the data well, with satisfactory fit indices, internal consistency and high item loadings onto the factor. The CPBI correlated positively with both fear and perceived risk of COVID-19, suggesting good concurrent validity. The CPBI is a measure of the likelihood of engaging in preventive activity, rather than one of intention or actual action. It is adaptable enough to be used over time as a monitoring instrument by policy makers and a modeling tool by researchers.","Breakwell, Glynis M; Fino, Emanuele; Jaspal, Rusi",Eval Health Prof,,351

Over 40 are now undergoing clinical evaluation, ten of these are in Phase III clinical trials, three of them have ended Phase III with positive results. A few of these new vaccines are being approved for emergency use. Existing data suggest that new vaccine candidates may be instrumental in protecting individuals and reducing the spread of pandemic. The conceptual and technological platforms exploited are diverse, and it is likely that different vaccines will show to be better suited to distinct groups of the human population. Moreover, it remains to be elucidated whether and to what extent the capacity of vaccines under evaluation and of unrelated vaccines such as BCG can increase immunological fitness by training innate immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and pathogen-agnostic protection. Due to the short development time and the novelty of the technologies adopted, these vaccines will be deployed with several unresolved issues that only the passage of time will permit to clarify. Technical problems connected with the production of billions of doses and ethical ones connected with the availably of these vaccines also in the poorest countries, are imminent challenges facing us. It is our tenet that in the long run more than one vaccine will be needed to ensure equitable global access, protection of diverse subjects and immunity against viral variants.","Forni, Guido; Mantovani, Alberto",Cell Death Differ,,351

Flow-diverting efficacy, by preserving flow through the parent artery, was approved for its use in unruptured cerebral aneurysms, but no consensus was reached on its use for BBAs ruptured in the acute setting. We report a multicenter experience of use of flow diversion in acute setting of ruptured BBA, to analyze the safety and efficacy of these devices. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of 6 consecutive intracranial BBAs treated with flow diverter devices (FDD) between 2018 and 2020 at 3 italian institutions. Materials, therapy used, complications, clinical and radiographic outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: We used different FDD, in all cases immediate change in contrast opacification at the end of the procedure was reported. Intraprocedural IIb/IIIa inhibitor agent was the major antiplatelet protocol administered. Any complications occurred.

405119,The hearth of mathematical and statistical modelling during the Coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Over 40% of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) COVID-19 patients were asymptomatically infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the immune responses of these asymptomatic individuals is a critical factor for developing the strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determined the viral dynamics and antibody responses among 143 asymptomatic individuals identified in a massive screening of more than 5 million people in eight districts of Wuhan in May 2020. Asymptomatic individuals were admitted to the government-designated centralized sites in accordance with policy. The incidence rate of asymptomatic infection is ~2.92/100,000. These individuals had low viral copy numbers (peaked at 315 copies/mL) and short-lived antibody responses with the estimated diminish time of 69 days. The antibody responses in individuals with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection is much longer with the estimated diminish time of 257 days. These results imply that the immune responses in the asymptomatic individuals are not potent enough for preventing SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, which has recently been reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. This casts doubt on the efficacy of forming ""herd-immunity"" through natural SARS-CoV-2 infection and urges for the development of safe and effective vaccines.","Sui, Zhiwei; Dai, Xinhua; Lu, Qingbin; Zhang, Yulan; Huang, Min; Li, Shufen; Peng, Tao; Xie, Jie; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Wu, Chunchen; Xia, Jianbo; Dong, Lianhua; Yang, Jiayi; Huang, Wenfeng; Liu, Siyuan; Wang, Ziquan; Li, Ke; Yang, Qingfang; Zhou, Xi; Wu, Ying; Liu, Wei; Fang, Xiang; Peng, Ke",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,351

While these measures were crucial to stop the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, numerous voices highlighted their disorderly psychological, social, and economic impacts on food consumption behavior and lifestyle. Therefore, this paper aims to understand how consumers' food-related habits in Russia have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential problems and opportunities this might bring for the Russian food system. The study is based on an online cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Russian through the Survey Monkey platform. A total of 1297 valid answers was collected. The results reveal that diet and food shopping, preparation, and use have been widely affected. Indeed, the survey results suggested (i) a change in the modality of acquiring food, consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and buying more on each trip to minimize store visits; (ii) a surge of stockpiling of non-perishable food items; (iii) a shift toward healthier diets; (iv) an increase in culinary capabilities; (v) a decrease of food waste. The results are expected to inform current emergency plans as well as long-term food-related strategies in Russia.","Ben Hassen, Tarek; El Bilali, Hamid; Allahyari, Mohammad S; Berjan, Sinisa; Fotina, Oksana",Appetite,,351

409443,An increase in acute heart failure offsets the reduction in acute coronary syndrome during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak,2020,"COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that has affected all African countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Formidable challenges limit precautionary measures which were instituted by the government to curb the pandemic. Insufficient COVID-19 testing laboratories, limited medical and personal protective equipment, and an inadequate number of health workers leave the country ill-equipped in the fight against the pandemic. Lack of assistance from the government to those who lost their jobs due to lockdown forced these individuals to go outside to find provisions, thus increasing the spread of the virus. Moreover, the fragile healthcare system is overburdened by civil conflicts and other epidemics and endemics amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The conflicts have led to thousands of deaths and hundreds of thousands of displacements and deprived many people of basic health services. The 11th outbreak of Ebola has been increasing at an alarming pace, and it is expected to soar because of a shortfall of funds and insufficient numbers of health workers. The DRC with the cooperation of regional powers needs to address these challenges in a manner similar to that used in the previous Ebola epidemics. Moreover, the government should have a balance in shifting the available resources between COVID-19 and other diseases. Until a vaccine is available, the DRC needs to be prudent when lifting restrictions to prevent explosion of new cases.","Juma, Carl Agisha; Mushabaa, Nestor Kalume; Abdu Salam, Feruzi; Ahmadi, Attaullah; Lucero-Prisno, Don Eliseo",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,351
410954,Systemic In Silico Screening in Drug Discovery for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) with an Online Interactive Web Server,2020,"PURPOSE: To examine multilevel predictors on American public response to COVID-19. DESIGN: Multilevel study. SETTING: A national survey was conducted by Qualtrics from August 24 to September 11, 2020. The state-level variables were constructed on data from multiple sources. SUBJECTS: 2,440 respondents 18 years and older from all 50 states and D.C. MEASURES: The outcome variable is the public response to COVID-19 measured by threat perception, behavioral adjustment, and policy support. The predictors include individual-level sociodemographic factors and state-level indicators about public health conditions, political context, and economic recovery. ANALYSIS: Multilevel structural equation modeling is used for statistical estimation. RESULTS: People from states with more COVID-19 cases (ß = 0.020, p < 0.1), mandatory face mask policies (ß = 0.069, p < 0.05), and liberal governments (ß = 0.002, p < 0.05) are more likely to respond while people from states whose economies have recovered closer to the pre-pandemic level are less likely to do so (ß = -0.005, p < 0.05). Regarding individual-level predictors, older people (ß = 0.005, p < 0.001) and people with better education (ß = 0.029, p < 0.01), leaning toward the Democrat Party (ß = 0.066, p < 0.001) and liberal political ideology (ß = 0.094, p < 0.001), and have stronger generalized trust (ß = 0.033, p < 0.001) are more likely to respond than their counterparts. CONCLUSION: Differences in the public response to the pandemic stem from variations in individual characteristics and contextual factors of states where people live. These findings contribute to the rapidly growing literature and have implications for public health policies.","Hao, Feng; Shao, Wanyun",Am J Health Promot,,351
414217,The Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on Irritable Bowel Syndrome,2021,"BACKGROUND COVID-19, the disease entity caused by the novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to pose a major therapeutic challenge for clinicians. At present, an effective treatment regimen and vaccination has not been established. Many patients develop severe symptoms requiring endotracheal intubation and a prolonged stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). In early postmortem examinations of COVID-19 patients, profuse viscous secretions were observed throughout the respiratory tract. Thus, oxygen supplementation without aggressive pulmonary hygiene management may be suboptimal. In the present case series, pulmonary hygiene management encompassed mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning. We report 3 severe cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in cruise ship employees who were admitted to the ICU and responded to supportive mechanical ventilation and pulmonary hygiene management. CASE REPORT Three cruise ship employees with COVID-19 underwent endotracheal intubation and were admitted to the ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Initial chest X-rays suggested multifocal pneumonia with superimposed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A regimen of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and dexamethasone was initiated on admission in all cases. Additionally, medications used for pulmonary hygiene were administered through a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) in line with the ventilator circuit. Endotracheal suctioning was performed prior to medication administration. The duration from endotracheal intubation to extubation ranged from 9 to 24 days. All 3 patients reached 30-day survival. CONCLUSIONS The cases reported highlight the importance of the use of airway hygiene with mucolytics, bronchodilators, and tracheal suctioning for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ventilatory support.","Farooqi, Faryal I; Morgan, Richard C; Dhawan, Naveen; Dinh, John; Yatzkan, George; Michel, George",Am J Case Rep,,351
414278,"Persistent congestion, renal dysfunction and inflammatory cytokines in acute heart failure: a prognosis study",2020,"Conversation agents, commonly referred to as chatbots, are increasingly deployed in many domains to allow people to have a natural interaction while trying to solve a specific problem. Given their widespread use, it is important to provide their users with methods and tools to increase users awareness of various properties of the chatbots, including non-functional properties that users may consider important in order to trust a specific chatbot. For example, users may want to use chatbots that are not biased, that do not use abusive language, that do not leak information to other users, and that respond in a style which is appropriate for the user's cognitive level. In this paper, we address the setting where a chatbot cannot be modified, its training data cannot be accessed, and yet a neutral party wants to assess and communicate its trustworthiness to a user, tailored to the user's priorities over the various trust issues. Such a rating can help users choose among alternative chatbots, developers test their systems, business leaders price their offering, and regulators set policies. We envision a personalized rating methodology for chatbots that relies on separate rating modules for each issue, and users' detected priority orderings among the relevant trust issues, to generate an aggregate personalized rating for the trustworthiness of a chatbot. The method is independent of the specific trust issues and is parametric to the aggregation procedure, thereby allowing for seamless generalization. We illustrate its general use, integrate it with a live chatbot, and evaluate it on four dialog datasets and representative user profiles, validated with user surveys.","Srivastava, Biplav; Rossi, Francesca; Usmani, Sheema; Bernagozzi, and Mariana",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10067v1.pdf,351
414358,Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic on Gastrointestinal Procedures and Cancers in the United States: A Multicenter Research Network Study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Studies have documented AKI with high-grade proteinuria in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In some patients, biopsies have revealed collapsing glomerulopathy, a distinct form of glomerular injury that has been associated with other viruses, including HIV. Previous patient reports have described patients of African ancestry who developed nephrotic-range proteinuria and AKI early in the course of disease. METHODS: In this patient series, we identified six patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), AKI, and nephrotic-range proteinuria. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We examined biopsy specimens from one transplanted kidney and five native kidneys. Three of the six patients underwent genetic analysis of APOL1, the gene encoding the APOL1 protein, from DNA extracted from peripheral blood. In addition, we purified genomic DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue and performed APOL1 genotype analysis of one of the native biopsies and the donor kidney graft. RESULTS: All six patients were of recent African ancestry. They developed COVID-19-associated AKI with podocytopathy, collapsing glomerulopathy, or both. Patients exhibited generally mild respiratory symptoms, and no patient required ventilator support. Genetic testing performed in three patients confirmed high-risk APOL1 genotypes. One APOL1 high-risk patient developed collapsing glomerulopathy in the engrafted kidney, which was transplanted from a donor who carried a low-risk APOL1 genotype; this contradicts current models of APOL1-mediated kidney injury, and suggests that intrinsic renal expression of APOL1 may not be the driver of nephrotoxicity and specifically, of podocyte injury. CONCLUSIONS: Glomerular disease presenting as proteinuria with or without AKI is an important presentation of COVID-19 infection and may be associated with a high-risk APOL1 genotype.","Shetty, Aneesha A; Tawhari, Ibrahim; Safar-Boueri, Luisa; Seif, Nay; Alahmadi, Ameen; Gargiulo, Richard; Aggarwal, Vikram; Usman, Irtaza; Kisselev, Sergey; Gharavi, Ali G; Kanwar, Yahspal; Quaggin, Susan E",J.

Currently, over 13 million individuals around the world have contracted the disease and over 573,000 individuals have died as a result of the disease. If individuals contract COVID-19, comorbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and obesity make individuals more susceptible to severe illnesses or even death. Nationally, the death rate of COVID-19 in African Americans is more than twice that of Whites and Latinos. To better understand the devastating effects of COVID-19 on the African American community, our goal is to examine data from the Jackson Heart Study, which currently investigates risk factors associated with CVD in African Americans, a comorbidity of COVID-19. The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity in participants of the Jackson Heart Study is 62.9%, 18.8%, 32.2%, and 53.3%, respectively. African Americans account for approximately 37.8% of the population in MS;however, they account for approximately 50% of the cases and 51% of the deaths related to COVID-19. In the Jackson, MS area, African Americans account for 72%, 56%, and 45% of COVID-19 related deaths in Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties, respectively.

428624,A review of Covid-19 and acute kidney injury: from pathophysiology to clinical results,2021,"Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 dynamics has been subject of intense research in the last months. In particular, accurate modeling of lockdown effects on human behaviour and epidemic evolution is a key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency management. In this regard, the compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the lockdown varies in time. Our estimation strategy does not require significant Bayes prior information and exploits regularization theory. Hospitalized data are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This also permits to reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a resolution never reached before in the literature. When applied to data collected in Lombardy, the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic. Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around [Formula: see text] of people in Lombardy and [Formula: see text] in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2, with the fatality rate being 1.14%. Then, we discuss how the situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction number dangerously increased in the summer, due to holiday relax, reaching values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Finally, we also document how Italy faced the second wave of infection in the last part of 2020. Since several countries still observe a growing epidemic and others could be subject to other waves, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be of great help to health care authorities to prevent SARS-CoV-2 diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions on human behaviour to contain the spread.","Pillonetto, G; Bisiacco, M; Palù, G; Cobelli, C",Sci Rep,,351

430407,"Incidence, Pathophysiology, and Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on Acute Ischemic Stroke",2020,"OBJECTIVE: To describe how the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC hospitals were managed during the COVID-19 state of alert and to analyse the results obtained to assess the usefulness of telephone consultations in our specialty. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From March 16, the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals began telephone consultations. Due to the disparity in the actions of the different department members, the decision was made to create a protocol to manage these consultations which started to be implemented March 23. RESULTS: During the study period, 1054 patients were attended in the consultations of both departments; 663 (62.9%) were first visits and 391 (37.10%) were successive visits. Twenty-one percent (229) of the consultations could be resolved by telephone, 10.82% (114) required face-to-face care, 57.40% (605) were indicated for an on-demand check-up depending on their disease course, and 10.05% (106) of the patients could not be reached by telephone. DISCUSSION: The state of alarm caused by COVID-19 has been a determining factor in how we undertake our care work. In the ENT and Head and Neck departments of the HMM and HVC Hospitals we decided to carry out consultations by telephone as an alternative to the traditional consultation. During this period, we have observed that up to 21.73% of the consultations could be dealt with by telephone. CONCLUSION: The telephone consultation seems to be a very useful tool to attend our patients avoiding the risk of COVID-19 infection during the state of alarm. Furthermore, according to the data analysed and the different studies, it seems a good alternative to the traditional consultation in selected patients.","Gómez González, María Del Rosario; Piqueras Pérez, Francisco M; Guillamón Vivancos, Laura; Galindo Iñiguez, Lorena; Jara Maquilón, Alejandra; Martínez Alonso, Jesús Aaron",Acta otorrinolaringol. esp,,351
431004,Coronavirus disease (COVID 2019): protocol for a living overview of systematic reviews,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of infections, prevalence of hospitalisation due to infections, the vaccination status and perceived screening of infections prior to the start of biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) of a patient cohort with chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases (CIRD). METHODS: Consecutive CIRD patients reporting to our specialised centre were prospectively included (n=975) in this cross-sectional study. Data on comorbidities including infections, treatment, vaccination status, screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and hepatitis B (HepB) were collected. Antibodies against measles and HepB were measured by ELISA. The vaccination status was assessed by a predefined vaccination score (0-26) categorising patients into four immunisation states: low (0-6), moderate (7-13), good (14-20), high (21-26). RESULTS: All patients on bDMARDs (n=499) were screened for LTBI, and 469 for HepB (94%). All LTBI patients (n=16) received isoniazid (3.2%) and 16 chronic HepB patients received lamivudine (3.4%). Protective measles specific IgG-antibodies were found in 901 patients (92.4%). Although 629 patients were educated about vaccination strategies (64.5%), only 540 showed a vaccination card (55.4%). Only 49% of patients had undergone pneumococcal vaccination and less than 30% were protected against HepB and influenza, while 7.6% have not protective antibody titres against measles. No patient met the German national vaccination recommendations requiring a complete documentation of vaccines. The mean vaccination score was 13.3±4.2 with 5.7% of patients having a low, 43.9% a moderate, 47.0% a good and 3.3% a high score. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of CIRD patients are n0t sufficiently vaccinated against pneumococci, HepB, influenza and measles. Although CIRD patients and general practitioners regularly receive professional information about the need of vaccination, vaccination rates were low to moderate. Interdisciplinary quality projects should be planned to change that inacceptable result.","Kiltz, Uta; Celik, Aylin; Tsiami, Styliani; Buehring, Bjoern; Baraliakos, Xenofon; Andreica, Ioana; Kiefer, David; Braun, Juergen",,,351

The influence of meteorological factors on the transmission and spread of COVID-19 is of interest. This study sought to examine the associations of daily average temperature (AT) and relative humidity (ARH) with the daily counts of COVID-19 cases in 30 Chinese provinces (in Hubei from December 1, 2019 to February 11, 2020 and in other provinces from January 20, 2020 to Februarys 11, 2020). A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was fitted to quantify the province-specific associations between meteorological variables and the daily cases of COVID-19 during the study periods. In the model, the 14-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of AT and ARH, and their interaction were included with time trend and health-seeking behavior adjusted. Their spatial distributions were visualized. AT and ARH showed significantly negative associations with COVID-19 with a significant interaction between them (0.04, 95% confidence interval: 0.004-0.07) in Hubei. Every 1 °C increase in the AT led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 36% to 57% when ARH was in the range from 67% to 85.5%. Every 1% increase in ARH led to a decrease in the daily confirmed cases by 11% to 22% when AT was in the range from 5.04 °C to 8.2 °C. However, these associations were not consistent throughout Mainland China.","Qi, Hongchao; Xiao, Shuang; Shi, Runye; Ward, Michael P; Chen, Yue; Tu, Wei; Su, Qing; Wang, Wenge; Wang, Xinyi; Zhang, Zhijie",Sci Total Environ,,351

METHODS: Retrospective review of DS + MMC and trabeculectomy + MMC at a single centre between February 2015 and March 2018. Patients with a minimum of 12-month follow-up were included. Post-operative follow-up: day 1, week 1, months 1/3/6/12/18/24. Primary outcomes: changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and changes in LogMAR visual acuity (BCVA) pre- and post-procedure. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: changes in number of eye drops, number of follow-up clinic visits, post-operative complications and further surgical interventions. Complete success: IOP &#8804; 21 mmHg off all IOP-lowering medications. Qualified success: IOP &#8804; 21 mmHg on medication. Failure: IOP > 21 mmHg at 24 months or &#8804; 5 mmHg on 2 consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months +/- additional incisional glaucoma surgery +/- loss of light perception. Statistical analysis performed using Microsoft Excel + SPSS. RESULTS: 90 eyes: DS + MMC = 46 eyes, Trab + MMC = 44 eyes. DS + MMC v Trab + MMC: mean pre-op IOP = 19.57 mmHg v 18.89 mmHg, significantly reduced at all post-operative time-points for both groups (p < 0.001). Mean IOP reduction from baseline = 33.94% v 38.39%; > 30% IOP reduction = 54.35% v 68.18%. IOP &#8804; 16 mmHg = 82.61% (38/46) v 95.46% (42/44), IOP &#8804; 12 mmHg = 52.17% (24/46) v 72.72% (32/44). Complete success = 67.39% v 61.36%, qualified success = 26.09% v 29.55%, failure = 6.52% v 9.09%. Post-op BCVA: no statistically significant differences between two groups (p = 0.09). Mean pre-op drops v post-op drops = 2.98 v 0.38 (DS + MMC; p < 0.001); 2.68 v 0.39 (Trab + MMC; p < 0.001). Further surgical intervention = 13% v 29.55%. Mean number of post-op clinic visits DS + MMC v Trab + MMC = 10.09 v 13.02 (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Both procedures achieve sustained intraocular pressure and drop reduction at 2 years post-op. DS + MMC has lower complication rates requiring less intervention and significantly fewer clinic visits, which may be an important factor for deciding surgical management of glaucoma patients in the era of Covid-19 to reduce patient/clinician exposure to the virus.","Dwivedi, Rahul; Somerville, Tobi; Cheeseman, Robert; Rogers, Clare; Batterbury, Mark; Choudhary, Anshoo",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,351

To effectively harness promising new technologies and address these and other public health challenges ahead, public health professionals must be trained on evidence-based practices for protecting and improving public health. This project sought to understand the network of health departments and organizations that provide training in order to inform strategic efforts to fill training gaps and improve access to training for local health departments (LHDs), thereby strengthening the public health system. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a Web-based survey of 501 LHDs in the 6 states constituting Region V of the Department of Health & Human Services. The survey focused on the training relationship between LHDs and state and national organizations that provide public health training, allowing for a social network analysis. We used data visualization and descriptive statistics to examine the network. RESULTS: Of 290 participating health departments (58% response rate), 248 had monthly or more frequent contact with at least 1 organization for the purpose of training. Altogether, the 248 LHDs were connected to 47 state-level organizations and 10 national-level organizations. In 5 of 6 states, more LHDs were connected to the state health department for training than to any other organization type. Universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations provided training to the fewest LHDs. Local health department characteristics did not have a clear relationship with its number of training connections. CONCLUSIONS: State health departments may benefit from the support of universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations by partnering to offer training or by recommending training from these organizations to LHDs. Additional qualitative information from local and state health departments would be useful to determine the best strategies for universities, national nonprofits, and national membership organizations to participate in training local practitioners to improve LHD capacity.","Harris, Jenine K; Leider, Jonathon P; Kulik, Phoebe; Beck, Angela",J. public health manag. pract.

Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S 2domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in S D domain) and G1124V (in S 2subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed.

We here present the final results and extend the analyses. METHODS: Board-certified neurosurgeons of European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) member countries were asked to review their residency case logs and participate in a 31-question electronic survey (SurveyMonkey Inc., San Mateo, CA). The responses received between April 25, 2018, and April 25, 2020, were considered. We excluded responses that were incomplete, from non-EANS member countries, or from respondents that have not yet completed their residency. RESULTS: Of 430 responses, 168 were considered for analysis after checking in- and exclusion criteria. Survey responders had a mean age of 42.7 ± 8.8 years, and 88.8% were male. Responses mainly came from surgeons employed at university/teaching hospitals (85.1%) in Germany (22.0%), France (12.5%), the United Kingdom (UK; 8.3%), Switzerland (7.7%), and Greece (7.1%). Most responders graduated in the years between 2011 and 2019 (57.7%). Thirty-eight responders (22.6%) graduated before and 130 responders (77.4%) after the European WTD 2003/88/EC came into effect. The mean number of surgical procedures performed independently, supervised or assisted throughout residency was 540 (95% CI 424-657), 482 (95% CI 398-568), and 579 (95% CI 441-717), respectively. Detailed numbers for cranial, spinal, adult, and pediatric subgroups are presented in the article. There was an annual decrease of about 33 cases in total caseload between 1976 and 2019 (coeff. - 33, 95% CI - 62 to - 4, p = 0.025). Variables associated with lesser total caseload during residency were training abroad (1210 vs. 1747, p = 0.083) and female sex by trend (947 vs. 1671, p = 0.111), whereas case numbers were comparable across the EANS countries (p = 0.443). CONCLUSION: The final results of this survey largely confirm the previously reported numbers. They provide an opportunity for current trainees to compare their own case logs with. Again, we confirm a significant decline in surgical exposure during training between 1976 and 2019. In addition, the current analysis reveals that female sex and training abroad may be variables associated with lesser case numbers during residency.","Stienen, Martin N; Freyschlag, Christian F; Schaller, Karl; Meling, Torstein",Acta neurochir,,351

Although the care of these patients focused on mechanical ventilation, an increasing number of people will not receive this support due to the underlying health conditions and will require conservative management. On the other hand, with all the attention and resources occupying the emergency, the care of vulnerable, marginalized groups, and numerous patients with chronic, progressive, complex, oncological, or multimorbid diseases that warrant palliative care, came to the background. During the care of COVID-19 patients, health personnel may experience complex ethical dilemmas due to the scarcity of resources, the rapid deterioration of the patients, urgent decision-making and the lack of effective treatments. Palliative patients can adapt to this possibility, put yourself at the forefront and contribute to better decision-making, to provide multidimensional care (biological, psychoactive, socioeconomic, spiritual) to patients, families and to temper this tsunami of suffering.","Guevara-López, Uría",Rev.

445104,Fish oil and COVID-19 thromboses,2020,"Purpose: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on world healthcare system and economy is unprecedented. Currently routine surgical procedures are at a halt globally, but whether one can delay cancer procedures remains an ethical issue, and still there is no clarity on how women with gynaecological cancers should be managed in these critical times. Methods: Currently available literature on impact of COVID-19 on cancer was reviewed with special reference to its applicability to the Indian context. Results: Cancer cases are more susceptible for COVID-19 infection and rapid deterioration if they get infected. A tumour board should plan their management with a “do no harm” approach as the guiding principle. Teleconsultation may be used to advise patients for therapy and symptom control measures, as well as to advise new patients regarding diagnostic tests. Surgical decision making may be stratified into three categories: patients with low (not life threatening) or intermediate (potential for future morbidity or mortality) acuity may be delayed; those with high acuity may be taken up for planned therapy after explaining the risks. Assessment of the severity of disease, comorbid conditions, and logistic challenges, along with COVID census in their area are important variables for informed and individualized decision making. Safety of healthcare personnel needs to be ensured at the same time. Conclusion: Currently available evidence is limited by small sample size, and full impact of this pandemic on cancer is yet to be seen. However, cancer care needs to be individualized taking all variables into consideration.","Bhatla, Neerja; Singhal, Seema",Indian J. Gynecol. Oncol.,,351
445469,Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in Coronavirus Disease-19: The Real Savior or a False-positive Testament,2021,"Importance: Suicide, a leading cause of death with devastating emotional and societal costs, is a generally preventable cause of death and a critical global public health issue. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Observations: Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era requires addressing not only pandemic-specific suicide risk factors, but also prepandemic risk factors. This Special Communication provides prioritized, evidence-based strategies for clinicians and health care delivery systems, along with national and local policy and educational initiatives tailored to the COVID-19 environment. If implemented to scale, these interventions could significantly mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on suicide risk.","Moutier, Christine","JAMA psychiatry (Chic. Ill., Online)",,351

This is particularly important for groups with higher rates of high-risk health conditions, including those aged 65 and over and people with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We examined trust in information sources and associated adherence to COVID-19 public health recommendations among people with disabilities living in metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore counties. METHODS: We recruited participants using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and screened for disability status (n = 408). We compared sociodemographic groups with t-tests, Pearson's correlations, and Chi-square, as appropriate. We used linear regression to examine factors associated with trust in information and compliance with CDC recommended COVID-19 practices. RESULTS: Nonmetro respondents had the lowest trust ratings among all demographic groups, and reported significantly less trust in most information sources. Respondents aged 65 and over reported the highest compliance with CDC recommended practices, while those from nonmetro areas reported the lowest. A regression model for adherence to CDC recommended practices was significant (F = 11.87, P &#8804; .001), and explained 33% of the variance. Specifically, increased adherence was associated with being over 65, female, and higher general trust scores. Decreased practices were associated with being nonwhite, nonmetro, higher trust scores in President Trump, and having a communication disability. CONCLUSIONS: Trust in information sources is associated with action. It is important to provide clear, consistent, and non-polarizing messages during public health emergencies to promote widespread community action.","Ipsen, Catherine; Myers, Andrew; Sage, Rayna",Disabil Health J,,351

449652,Relationship Between Obesity and Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia: A Post Hoc Analysis of the NUTRIREA2 Trial,2021,"Mechanical ventilation is an effective medical means in the treatment of patients with critically ill, COVID-19 and other pulmonary diseases. During the mechanical ventilation and the weaning process, the conduct of pulmonary rehabilitation is essential for the patients to improve the spontaneous breathing ability and to avoid the weakness of respiratory muscles and other pulmonary functional trauma. However, inappropriate mechanical ventilation strategies for pulmonary rehabilitation often result in weaning difficulties and other ventilator complications. In this article, the mechanical ventilation strategies for pulmonary rehabilitation are studied based on the analysis of patient-ventilator interaction. A pneumatic model of the mechanical ventilation system is established to determine the mathematical relationship among the pressure, the volumetric flow, and the tidal volume. Each ventilation cycle is divided into four phases according to the different respiratory characteristics of patients, namely, the triggering phase, the inhalation phase, the switching phase, and the exhalation phase. The control parameters of the ventilator are adjusted by analyzing the interaction between the patient and the ventilator at different phases. A novel fuzzy control method of the ventilator support pressure is proposed in the pressure support ventilation mode. According to the fuzzy rules in this research, the plateau pressure can be obtained by the trigger sensitivity and the patient's inspiratory effort. An experiment prototype of the ventilator is established to verify the accuracy of the pneumatic model and the validity of the mechanical ventilation strategies proposed in this article. In addition, through the discussion of the patient-ventilator asynchrony, the strategies for mechanical ventilation can be adjusted accordingly. The results of this research are meaningful for the clinical operation of mechanical ventilation. Besides, these results provide a theoretical basis for the future research on the intelligent control of ventilator and the automation of weaning process.","Hao, LiMing; Li, Xiao; Shi, Yan; Cai, MaoLin; Ren, Shuai; Xie, Fei; Li, YaNa; Wang, Na; Wang, YiXuan; Luo, ZuJin; Xu, Meng",Sci China Technol Sci,,351

Oocistos de T. gondii podem esporular na água do mar e manter a infectividade por até seis meses. Moluscos bivalves podem filtrar e reter oocistos de T. gondii da água do mar em condições experimentais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi investigar a presença de T. gondii em ostras (Crassostrea rhizophorae) e mariscos (Mytella guayanensis) em condições naturais. Um total de 300 ostras e 300 mariscos foram adquiridos no Mercado de Peixes do município de Santos no estado de São Paulo no período de 05/03/2008 a 29/08/08 e divididos em 60 grupos de cinco ostras e 20 grupos de 15 mariscos. Para o isolamento do parasita, cinco camundongos foram inoculados oralmente com homogenados dos tecidos de cada grupo de ostras ou mariscos. Para a detecção molecular, o DNA dos tecidos dos mariscos foi extraído pelo método de fenol-clorofórmio e o das ostras, pelo método de isotiocianato de guanidina, Em seguida, foi realizada a nested-PCR (Reação em Cadeia pela Polimerase) baseada na amplificação de um fragmento de 155pb do gene B1 de T. gondii. A genotipagem das amostras de T. gondii detectadas foi feita usando a PCR-RFLP (Polimorfismo de Comprimento de Fragmentos de DNA gerados por Enzimas de Restrição) usando os marcadores SAG1, SAG2, SAG3, BTUB, GRA6, c22-8, c29-2, L358, PK1, CS3 e Apico. Não houve isolamento do parasita pelo bioensaio em camundongos. Nos grupos de mariscos, o T. gondii não foi detectado pela n-PCR e, nos grupos de ostras, houve detecção do T. gondii em dois grupos (3,3%). Não foi possível a genotipagem das amostras de T. gondii detectadas. O presente estudo permitiu concluir que ostras da espécie Crassostrea rhizophorae podem filtrar e reter oocistos de T. gondii e que o ambiente marinho do litoral do estado de São Paulo encontra-se contaminado com oocistos desse parasita.

Twice daily irrigation of J&J in hypertonic saline, hypertonic saline alone, or no intervention were compared (n = 24/group). Despite demonstrated safety and robust efficacy in in vitro virucidal assays, J&J irrigations had no impact on viral titers or symptom scores in treated subjects relative to controls. Similar findings were observed administering J&J to infected cultured human airway epithelia using protocols mimicking the clinical trial regimen. Additional studies of cultured human nasal epithelia demonstrated that lack of efficacy reflected pharmacokinetic failure, with the most virucidal J&J detergent components rapidly absorbed from nasal surfaces.

While the two Gumbel parameters, as determined bit fits to the data, vary from country to country (and even within different regions of the same country), reflecting the diversity and efficacy of the adopted containment measures, the functional form of the evolution of N/dN appears to be universal. The result of the fit in a given region or country appears to be stable against variations of the selected time interval. This makes it possible to robustly estimate the two parameters from the data data even over relatively small time periods. In turn, this allows one to predict with large advance and well-controlled confidence levels, the time of the peak in the daily new infections, its magnitude and duration (hence the total infections), as well as the time when the daily new infections decrease to a pre-set value (e.g. less than about 2 new infections per day per million people), which can be very useful for planning the reopening of economic and social activities.

This signature is characterized by lung accumulation of naïve lymphoid cells associated with a systemic expansion and activation of myeloid cells. Myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution, highlighting arginase-1 expression with immune regulatory features of monocytes. Monocyte-dependent and neutrophil-dependent immune suppression loss is associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe patients. Additionally, our analysis shows a lung CXCR6+ effector memory T cell subset is associated with better prognosis in patients with severe COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd 2020, all consecutive adult patients referred to the ""Covid-19 clinic"" of our Emergency Department with the availability of chest CT and of at least one RT-PCR result were retrospectively included in the present study. Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily. CT diagnostic performance were calculated and variations between phases were tested for equivalence or difference using Bayesian methods. RESULTS: 2194 consecutive chest CT were analyzed. Overall CT diagnostic performance was Se = 84.2 [82.0 ; 86.3], Sp = 86.6 [84.5 ; 88.5], PPV = 86.1 [84.0 ; 88.1], NPV = 84.7 [82.6 ; 86.7] and accuracy = 85.4 [83.9 ; 86.8], with no significant differences between chest and non-chest radiologists. Variations between the ascending (11 days, 281 chest CT, disease prevalence 37.0 %), the peak (18 days, 1167 chest CT, disease prevalence 64 %) and the descending phases (19 days, 746 chest CT, disease prevalence 32.2 %) were highest for PPV and NPV with a probability of difference >99.9 %, and smallest for accuracy and specificity with a probability of equivalence >98.8 %. CONCLUSION: In a homogenous cohort of 2194 consecutive chest CT performed over a 7-week epidemic wave, we observed significant variations of CT predictive values whereas CT specificity appeared marginally affected.","Ohana, Mickaël; Muller, Joris; Severac, François; Bilbault, Pascal; Behr, Martin; Oberlin, Mathieu; Leyendecker, Pierre; Roy, Catherine",Eur J Radiol,,351

The goal of this study is to offer an empirical contribution that comparatively explores the presence and features of hate speech in the social media discourse of the radical right (leaders and parties) in Italy and the UK during the first year of the pandemic. This mixed-methods study analyses 21,360 tweets using wordcloud analysis (to conceptually map the social media discourse of the radical right and mainstream parties), topic modelling (to identify the main topics of the radical right’s tweets and how they relate to Covid-19) and formalised content analysis (to better understand how hate speech is related to the virus). We find that radical right leaders have managed to bring exclusion-oriented issues to the agenda at this time of crisis, albeit in different ways, by emphasising different understandings of in-groups and out-groups in relation to Covid-19.

468896,The patient with heart failure in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: an expert opinion of the Heart Failure Working Group of the Polish Cardiac Society,2020,"Sound principles of statistical inference dictate that uncertainty shapes learning. In this work, we revisit the question of learning in volatile environments, in which both the first and second-order statistics of observations dynamically evolve over time. We propose a new model, the volatile Kalman filter (VKF), which is based on a tractable state-space model of uncertainty and extends the Kalman filter algorithm to volatile environments. The proposed model is algorithmically simple and encompasses the Kalman filter as a special case. Specifically, in addition to the error-correcting rule of Kalman filter for learning observations, the VKF learns volatility according to a second error-correcting rule. These dual updates echo and contextualize classical psychological models of learning, in particular hybrid accounts of Pearce-Hall and Rescorla-Wagner. At the computational level, compared with existing models, the VKF gives up some flexibility in the generative model to enable a more faithful approximation to exact inference. When fit to empirical data, the VKF is better behaved than alternatives and better captures human choice data in two independent datasets of probabilistic learning tasks. The proposed model provides a coherent account of learning in stable or volatile environments and has implications for decision neuroscience research.","Piray, Payam; Daw, Nathaniel D",PLoS Comput Biol,,351

Here, we explored whether elevated D-dimer level was related to multiple organ failure and a higher risk of death. This study included 158 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China between January 20, 2020 and February 26, 2020. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. The relationship between D-dimer elevation and organ dysfunction was analyzed, as were dynamic changes in inflammation and lipid metabolism. Approximately 63.9% of patients with COVID-19 had an elevated D-dimer level on ICU admission. The 14 day ICU mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with a high D-dimer level than in those with a normal D-dimer level. Patients with a D-dimer level of 10-40µg/mL had similar organ function on ICU admission to those with a D-dimer level of 1.5-10µg/mL. However, patients with higher levels of D-dimer developed organ injuries within 7 days. Furthermore, significant differences in inflammation and lipid metabolism markers were observed between the two groups. In conclusion, the D-dimer level is closely related to COVID-19 severity and might influence the likelihood of rapid onset of organ injury after admission.","Zhang, Wang; Sang, Ling; Shi, Jiaran; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Song, Bin; Kang, Liang; Zhang, Yun; Zhang, Dingyu; Yu, Yunsong; Zheng, Xia",Aging (Albany NY),,351

470490,Rheumatic diseases in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to a spectrum of symptoms. Understanding the basis for severity remains crucial for better management and therapy development. So far, older age, associated-comorbidities, and IL-6 have been associated with severity/mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: As a primary step, we analyzed the frequency and functional profile of innate immune cells (NK cells/dendritic cells/monocytes) and adaptive immunity-driving lymphocytes (B cells/T cells/follicular T helper cells) by flow cytometry. Sixty cases of SARS CoV-2 infection (25 severe, 35 mild) and ten healthy subjects without SARS CoV-2 IgG were included. Disease-duration based analysis of immune profile was explored for early events differentiating the two disease forms. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by PRNT. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Disease severity was found to be associated with impaired maturation of mDCs and hyperactivation of NK, follicular T helper cells, and CD8 T cells. Lower IL-21 receptor expression on memory B cells indicated an imbalance in IL-21/IL-21 R ratio. Lower BCMA positive plasmablast cells in severe cases did suggest a probable absence of long-term humoral immunity. Multivariate analysis revealed a progressive association of PD-1+CD4 T cells with PRNT50 titers. Thus, in addition to identifying probable prognostic markers for severity, our study emphasizes the definite need for in-depth viral antigen-specific functional analyses in a larger patient cohort and with multiple sampling.","Kulkarni-Munje, Archana; Palkar, Sonali; Shrivastava, Shubham; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh C; Arankalle, Vidya A",Immun.

472063,"Anosmia and dysgeusia in SARS-CoV-2 infection: Incidence and effects on COVID-19 severity and mortality, and the possible pathobiology mechanisms - a systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"The aim was to examine the psychological effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnant women, as well as the factors influencing these effects. The study design was cross-sectional and the participants were 200 pregnant women. The first group called the Pandemic Group (PG) included 100 women who were evaluated with psychological assessment instruments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second group titled Pre-Pandemic Group (PPG) consisted of 100 women who were evaluated prior to the pandemic. Perceived stress, prenatal concerns and psychopathological symptoms were evaluated and compared. Pandemic Group scored significantly higher than Pre-Pandemic Group in the depression dimension of the SCL-90, in the phobic anxiety dimension, and in the Perceived Stress Scale. In addition, insomnia, along with having recently suffered the loss of a loved one explained 25% of the score variance in the depression dimension of the SCL-90. Insomnia also explained 13% of the variance of the results found in the Perceived Stress Scale. The fear of contagion by COVID-19 increased the scores obtained in the phobic anxiety dimension, explaining 11% of the variance. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could produce an increase in psychopathological symptomatology and stress, which can lead to negatively affecting pregnant women's mental health.","Puertas-Gonzalez, Jose A; Mariño-Narvaez, Carolina; Peralta-Ramirez, Maria Isabel; Romero-Gonzalez, Borja",Psychiatry Res,,351

Methods: An online survey with a random sample of 407 Internet users aged 60 years and over (Mean = 69.14). Results: Participants reported a significant increase in 7 of 12 Internet-based functions following the pandemic onset. Stress levels were moderate-to-high and participants appeared more worried about others than about themselves. Significant positive associations were found between stress and increase in Internet use for interpersonal communication and online errands. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant negative association between stress and subjective wellbeing, but it was only increased Internet use for leisure that associated significantly with enhanced wellbeing. Conclusion: The changes in Internet use clearly reflected coping efforts that were apparently ineffective in enhancing wellbeing. Paradoxically, the only online functions that could improve wellbeing, Internet use for leisure, are precisely those whose use hardly increased.

474269,The role of probiotics in coronavirus disease-19 infection in Wuhan: A retrospective study of 311 severe patients,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic performance of deep transfer learning (DTL) to detect liver cirrhosis from clinical MRI. METHODS: The dataset for this retrospective analysis consisted of 713 (343 female) patients who underwent liver MRI between 2017 and 2019. In total, 553 of these subjects had a confirmed diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, while the remainder had no history of liver disease. T2-weighted MRI slices at the level of the caudate lobe were manually exported for DTL analysis. Data were randomly split into training, validation, and test sets (70%/15%/15%). A ResNet50 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on the ImageNet archive was used for cirrhosis detection with and without upstream liver segmentation. Classification performance for detection of liver cirrhosis was compared to two radiologists with different levels of experience (4th-year resident, board-certified radiologist). Segmentation was performed using a U-Net architecture built on a pre-trained ResNet34 encoder. Differences in classification accuracy were assessed by the &#967;2-test. RESULTS: Dice coefficients for automatic segmentation were above 0.98 for both validation and test data. The classification accuracy of liver cirrhosis on validation (vACC) and test (tACC) data for the DTL pipeline with upstream liver segmentation (vACC = 0.99, tACC = 0.96) was significantly higher compared to the resident (vACC = 0.88, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.91, p = 0.01) and to the board-certified radiologist (vACC = 0.96, p < 0.01; tACC = 0.90, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of DTL for detecting cirrhosis based on standard T2-weighted MRI. The presented method for image-based diagnosis of liver cirrhosis demonstrated expert-level classification accuracy. KEY POINTS: â¢ A pipeline consisting of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pre-trained on an extensive natural image database (ImageNet archive) enables detection of liver cirrhosis on standard T2-weighted MRI. â¢ High classification accuracy can be achieved even without altering the pre-trained parameters of the convolutional neural networks. â¢ Other abdominal structures apart from the liver were relevant for detection when the network was trained on unsegmented images.","Nowak, Sebastian; Mesropyan, Narine; Faron, Anton; Block, Wolfgang; Reuter, Martin; Attenberger, Ulrike I; Luetkens, Julian A; Sprinkart, Alois M",Eur. radiol,,351

Little is known about the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To determine the average shedding times of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in children. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies reporting real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) results in children with COVID-19, then extracted and synthesized data on duration of viral shedding from symptom onset in respiratory and gastrointestinal samples. RESULTS: Based on data compiled from 69 pediatric cases, the duration of viral shedding through the respiratory tract is up to 24 days from symptom onset with a mean of 11.1 ± 5.8 days. Of the children who underwent testing with stool PCR, rectal swab or anal swab, 86% returned a positive result. The mean duration of viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract was 23.6 ± 8.8 days from symptom onset. In 89% of cases, viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract persisted after nasopharyngeal or throat swabs became negative, for as long as 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically review the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients. These findings may have important implications for infection control strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Cecilia L H; Raval, Manjri; Schnall, Jesse A; Kwong, Jason C; Holmes, Natasha E",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,351

This is highlighted by the inefficiency of energy saving measures that have recently been set owing to the the marketability failure and unsuccessful design integration of existing ICT based solutions. Specifically, the factors that affect energy efficiency comprise natural and socio-economic restrictions, technological advances, and last but not least the human behavior. Energy efficiency based on behavioral change has attracted an increasing interest in the recent years, unfortunately, solutions in this area suffer from the lack of marketability because of the absence of both prospective studies and consumer awareness. This work, focuses on a key cost-effective technology for monitoring power consumption and for contributing to the behavioral change through smart, personalized, and on the moment, action recommendations. In order to examine the marketability of the proposed solution, we begin with a market and research analysis of the domain of energy efficiency systems in the building sector that target behavioral change. Moving forward, various factors that affect the commercialization of the final product are considered before proceeding with recommended actions to ensure its successful marketability via conducting a Go/No-Go analysis. Finally, based on the comprehensive commercialization study, a GO decision is concluded for the subject technology.","Himeur, Yassine; Alsalemi, Abdullah; Bensaali, Faycal; Amira, Abbes; Varlamis, Iraklis; Bravos, George; Sardianos, Christos; Dimitrakopoulos, George",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.10460v1.pdf,351

Although COVID-19 is known as a respiratory disease, some atypical manifestations have been seen, different from those seen in other types of viral respiratory infections. This paper aims to describe designing, launching, and implementing a data collection system for all respiratory diseases, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 from the onset of this pandemic. METHOD: The current registry is designed in compliance with the standard Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines, along with the declaration of Helsinki principles. RESULTS: A respiratory disease registry, with an emphasis on COVID-19 and other co-infections, was developed. Data consisted of demographic, clinical, and supporting information about SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral diseases. CONCLUSION: It is hoped that the current data registry will facilitate patient evaluation and improve the outcomes of cases of respiratory infection defined by a particular condition, disease, or exposure. Moreover, the registry can harmonize data about the treatment, outcomes, and well-being of patients who receive care over time, and identify best practices.","Emami, Amir; Akbari, Ali; Javanmardi, Fatemeh; Lotfi, Mehrzad; Moghadami, Mohsen; Sharifi, Mehrdad; Bakhtiari, Hamid; Falahati, Farshad",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,351

Nanoluciferase (Nluc) insertion was used to compare the replication efficiencies of all constructs after electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA from the different clones. Deletion of C, E1, E2, or the complete structural protein genome region (C-ERNS-E1-E2) prevented the production of infectious progeny virus, whereas deletion of ERNS still allowed the generation of infectious particles. However, those &#916;ERNS viral particles were defective in virus assembly and/or egress and could not be further propagated for more than three additional passages in porcine SK-6 cells. These ""defective-in-third-cycle"" BuPV &#916;ERNS mutants were subsequently used to express the classical swine fever virus envelope protein E2, the N-terminal domain of the Schmallenberg virus Gc protein, and the receptor binding domain of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein. The constructs could be efficiently complemented and further passaged in SK-6 cells constitutively expressing the BuPV ERNS protein. Importantly, BuPVs are able to infect a wide variety of target cell lines, allowing expression in a very wide host spectrum. Therefore, we suggest that packaged BuPV &#916;ERNS replicon particles have potential as broad-spectrum viral vectors.IMPORTANCE The proteins NPRO and ERNS are unique for the genus Pestivirus, but only NPRO has been demonstrated to be nonessential for in vitro growth. While this was also speculated for ERNS, it has always been previously shown that pestivirus replicons with deletions of the structural proteins ERNS, E1, or E2 did not produce any infectious progeny virus in susceptible host cells. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that BuPV ERNS is dispensable for the generation of infectious virus particles but still important for efficient passaging. The ERNS-defective BuPV particles showed clearly limited growth in cell culture but were capable of several rounds of infection, expression of foreign genes, and highly efficient trans-complementation to rescue virus replicon particles (VRPs). The noncytopathic characteristics and the absence of preexisting immunity to BuPV in human populations and livestock also provide a significant benefit for a possible use, e.g., as a vector vaccine platform.","Dalmann, Anja; Reimann, Ilona; Wernike, Kerstin; Beer, Martin",J. virol,,351

The machine learning efforts to augment this workflow have been long challenged due to deficiencies in reporting, model evaluation, and failure mode analysis. To address some of those shortcomings, we model radiological features with a human-interpretable class hierarchy that aligns with the radiological decision process. Also, we propose the use of a data-driven error analysis methodology to uncover the blind spots of our model, providing further transparency on its clinical utility. For example, our experiments show that model failures highly correlate with ICU imaging conditions and with the inherent difficulty in distinguishing certain types of radiological features. Also, our hierarchical interpretation and analysis facilitates the comparison with respect to radiologists' findings and inter-variability, which in return helps us to better assess the clinical applicability of models.","Bannur, Shruthi; Oktay, Ozan; Bernhardt, Melanie; Schwaighofer, Anton; Jena, Rajesh; Nushi, Besmira; Wadhwani, Sharan; Nori, Aditya; Natarajan, Kal; Ashraf, Shazad; Alvarez-Valle, Javier; Castro, Daniel C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06618v1.pdf,351

Among the most important of these involve using social distancing to prevent contact. Restricted social contacts have important effects on activity participation and on travel demand. The current study examined an array of less-studied factors, such as attitudes and beliefs toward train use, including risk perception of flu-type infection, alongside more traditional factors, which together affect decisions whether to continue using the train. Data was collected using an internet survey application. The study was based on two surveys that were conducted approximately seven months apart, the first completed by 237 participants and the second by 149. We developed a structural equation model to better understand the influence of various factors on decisions whether to continue to use the train. We found a correlation between perception of the risk of infection and the decision to continue train travel. Study results also demonstrate the relation between trip purpose and the decision to use public transportation. The study results highlight the importance of many attributes favorably associated with train travel, including saving time, reliability, and comfort. Therefore, in contrast to the existing situation where the railway company makes its own decisions to decrease trip frequencies and to cancel some lines, government policy makers and the railway company should maintain a strong frequency schedule and increase the number of lines in order to accommodate social distancing. In addition, we found that the most effective measures for encouraging people to keep travelling by train required mask use, preventing people with flu-like symptoms from traveling by train, and fining those who do not comply. In order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles it is important to decrease the risk perception of being infected by coronavirus and other kinds of infected diseases while traveling by train. This can be addressed by creating a clean and reasonably sterile environment. These results highlight the need for serious intervention by decision-makers in order to sustain the train use as a viable alternative to using private vehicles.","Elias, Wafa; Zatmeh-Kanj, Sunbola",,,351
494116,Pediatric Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Meta-analyzing Literature Versus Natural History,2020,"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a critical need during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Alternative sources of surgical masks, including 3-dimensionally (3D) printed approaches that may be reused, are urgently needed to prevent PPE shortages. Few data exist identifying decontamination strategies to inactivate viral pathogens and retain 3D-printing material integrity. OBJECTIVE: To test viral disinfection methods on 3D-printing materials. METHODS: The viricidal activity of common disinfectants (10% bleach, quaternary ammonium sanitizer, 3% hydrogen peroxide, or 70% isopropanol and exposure to heat (50°C, and 70°C) were tested on four 3D-printed materials used in the healthcare setting, including a surgical mask design developed by the Veterans' Health Administration. Inactivation was assessed for several clinically relevant RNA and DNA pathogenic viruses, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 and all viruses tested were completely inactivated by a single application of bleach, ammonium quaternary compounds, or hydrogen peroxide. Similarly, exposure to dry heat (70°C) for 30 minutes completely inactivated all viruses tested. In contrast, 70% isopropanol reduced viral titers significantly less well following a single application. Inactivation did not interfere with material integrity of the 3D-printed materials. CONCLUSIONS: Several standard decontamination approaches effectively disinfected 3D-printed materials. These approaches were effective in the inactivation SARS-CoV-2, its surrogates, and other clinically relevant viral pathogens. The decontamination of 3D-printed surgical mask materials may be useful during crisis situations in which surgical mask supplies are limited.","Welch, Jennifer L; Xiang, Jinhua; Mackin, Samantha R; Perlman, Stanley; Thorne, Peter; O039,; Shaughnessy, Patrick; Strzelecki, Brian; Aubin, Patrick; Ortiz-Hernandez, Monica; Stapleton, Jack T",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,351

We report the lasting symptom burden of COVID-19 patients from the first wave of the pandemic. All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from a large teaching hospital trust were offered follow-up. We assessed symptom burden at follow-up using a standardised data collection technique during virtual outpatient clinic appointments. Eighty-six percent of patients reported at least one residual symptom at follow-up. No patients had persistent radiographic abnormalities. The presence of symptoms at follow-up was not associated with the severity of the acute COVID-19 illness. Females were significantly more likely to report residual symptoms including anxiety (p = 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.004), and myalgia (p = 0.022). The presence of long-lasting symptoms is common in COVID-19 patients. We suggest that the phenomenon of Long-COVID may not be directly attributable to the effect of SARS-CoV-2, and believe the biopsychosocial effects of COVID-19 may play a greater role in its aetiology.","Sykes, Dominic L; Holdsworth, Luke; Jawad, Nadia; Gunasekera, Pumali; Morice, Alyn H; Crooks, Michael G",Lung,,351

We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Methods: 100 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared to reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second exam was performed in case of clinical deterioration. Results: Thirty two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared to patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral vein thrombosis (DVT) was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. Conclusions:In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without DVT, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in &#8776;20%.","Szekely, Yishay; Lichter, Yael; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Hochstadt, Aviram; Merdler, Ilan; Gal Oz, Amir; Rothschild, Ehud; Baruch, Guy; Peri, Yogev; Arbel, Yaron; Topilsky, Yan",Circulation,,351

Here, we report structure-activity studies of improved GC376 derivatives with nanomolar affinities and therapeutic indices >200. Crystallographic structures of inhibitor-Mpro complexes reveal that an alternative binding pocket in Mpro, S4, accommodates the P3 position. Alternative binding is induced by polar P3 groups or a nearby methyl. NMR and solubility studies with GC376 show that it exists as a mixture of stereoisomers and forms colloids in aqueous media at higher concentrations, a property not previously reported.

495882,Child Care in the Time of Coronavirus Disease-19: A Period of Challenge and Opportunity,2020,"SARS-Cov-2 infection, a pandemic disease since March 2020, is associated with a high percentage of cardiovascular complications mainly of a thromboembolic (TE) nature. Although clinical patterns have been described for the assessment of patients with increased risk, many TE complications occur in patients with apparently moderate risk. Notably, a recent statement from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) atherosclerosis and vascular biology working group pointed out the key role of vascular endothelium for the recruitment of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways responsible for both disseminated intravascular coagulation and cardiovascular complications. Therefore, a better understanding of the pathophysiological process linking infection to increased TE risk is needed in order to understand the pathways of this dangerous liaison and possibly interrupt it with appropriate treatment. In this review, we describe the histological lesions and the related blood coagulation mechanisms involved in COVID-19, we define the laboratory parameters and clinical risk factors associated with TE events, and propose a prophylactic anticoagulation treatment in relation to the risk category. Finally, we highlight the concept that a solid risk assessment based on prospective multi-center data would be the challenge for a more precise risk stratification and more appropriate treatment.","Palazzuoli, A.; Giustozzi, M.; Ruocco, G.; Tramonte, F.; Gronda, E.; Agnelli, G.",Life,,351

The pathogen has been identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to perform the first holistic scientometric evaluation of coronavirus publications. METHODS: Our main source for this study was Web of Science Collection database. All items published between 1980 and 2019 were included. A distribution map of global production in coronavirus literature and scientometric networks were generated. RESULTS: The United States, China, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Netherlands were the most productive countries. Publications in coronavirus literature have been produced from almost every country in the world, except for some countries in Asia and Africa. CONCLUSION: While in the 1980s, the United States and developed countries from Europe were major source countries and the virus was identified only as an animal disease in the literature and its biological and genetic structure was investigated, in the 2000s, China became a major contributor of coronavirus literature because the SARS outbreak originated from southern China.

It describes how telerehabilitation can be leveraged to fill in the gaps in service, training, and research arms of the physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty. The ITAWAG (""to call"") telerehabilitation program is the response of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at Philippine General Hospital, which is the country's national university hospital, to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis that continues to limit face-to-face access to physical medicine and rehabilitation services throughout the country. With the significant decline in the number of patients served since the start of the pandemic, the ITAWAG program aimed to bridge the physical distance between patients and clinicians after a set of eligibility criteria for teleconsultation or teletherapy and a step-by-step process used before, during, and after each virtual encounter. However, because many physical medicine and rehabilitation consultants, residents, and therapists were not trained for the virtual approach to patient care, a telerehabilitation curriculum was developed to help in providing quality and competent services. Finally, despite the growing awareness of telerehabilitation throughout the country, several research gaps about this emerging technology are identified to determine its acceptance, applicability, and cost-effectiveness among others.","Leochico, Carl Froilan D; Mojica, Jose Alvin P; Rey-Matias, Reynaldo R; Supnet, Isabella E; Ignacio, Sharon D",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,351

Participants were 5065 adults from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based Internet panel representative of the US adult population. The main exposure was survey completion date (March 10-16, 2020). The outcome was mental distress measured via the 4-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire.Results. Among states with 50 or more COVID-19 cases as of March 10, each additional day was significantly associated with an 11% increase in the odds of moving up a category of distress (odds ratio = 1.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.01, 1.21; P = .02). Perceptions about the likelihood of getting infected, death from the virus, and steps taken to avoid infecting others were associated with increased mental distress in the model that included all states.

Materials and MethodsUsing an original data set (n=1,854,968 SARS-CoV-2 tests) and its synthetic derivative, we compared key indicators of COVID-19 community spread through analysis of aggregate and zip-code level epidemic curves, patient characteristics and outcomes, distribution of tests by zip code, and indicator counts stratified by month and zip code. Similarity between the data was statistically and qualitatively evaluated. ResultsIn general, synthetic data closely matched original data for epidemic curves, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Synthetic data suppressed labels of zip codes with few total tests (mean=2.9{+/-}2.4; max=16 tests; 66% reduction of unique zip codes). Epidemic curves and monthly indicator counts were similar between synthetic and original data in a random sample of the most tested (top 1%; n=171) and for all unsuppressed zip codes (n=5,819), respectively. In small sample sizes, synthetic data utility was notably decreased. DiscussionAnalyses on the population-level and of densely-tested zip codes (which contained most of the data) were similar between original and synthetically-derived data sets. Analyses of sparsely-tested populations were less similar and had more data suppression. ConclusionIn general, synthetic data were successfully used to analyze geospatial and temporal trends. Analyses using small sample sizes or populations were limited, in part due to purposeful data label suppression -an attribute disclosure countermeasure. Users should consider data fitness for use in these cases.","Thomas, Jason A; Foraker, Randi E; Zamstein, Noa; Payne, Philip RO; Wilcox, Adam B; Consortium, - N3C",,,351

500544,"The Incidence, Risk Factors and Clinical Outcomes of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: A Multicenter Study",2020,"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has spread from China and quickly transmitted to most other countries around the world. The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a pandemic that is spreading steadily and soon in most states. Coronavirus genomic characterization showed that it most closely resembled another bat-origin beta-coronavirus. Coronavirus has the largest genome of viruses that have RNA. Spike (S) glycoprotein is present in the virus and is responsible for virus entry into the host cell. COVID-19 can spread through the droplet, direct contact, and aerosol transmission in humans. It can remain in the environment and exists on plastic and steel for the longest time, making it a dangerous and contagious disease that can kill other individuals. The virus has an incubation time of 2 to 14 days. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 have evolved exponentially in the world. Possible preventive steps for disease control include more mask use, hand sanitization, and social distancing. There is no antiviral therapy and only symptomatic care. Many inhibitors of HIV protease and other antimalarial drugs have tested. There is currently no vaccine available for COVID-19 prevention, though others are available in clinical trials. Scientists often use spike proteins for vaccine production. Research is needed to develop a new innovative vaccine and targeted medicine, which will meet people's demands.","Bhole, R P; Sarode, V I; Bonde, C G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,351

501125,Predictors of Pneumothorax/Pneumomediastinum in Mechanically Ventilated COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: To explore the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 in targeting the prostate gland, leading to exacerbation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms and greater risks of BPH complications such as acute urinary retention. METHODS: A categorized and comprehensive search in the literature has been conducted by 10 April 2021 using international databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library in line with the PRISMA guidelines recommendations. PICO strategy was used to formulate the research question. The following terms were used: urology, COVID-19, coronavirus, BPH, inflammation, androgen receptors, LUTS, IPSS, PSA, and SARS-CoV-2 or a combination of them. Studies with irrelevant purposes and duplicates were excluded. The selected studies were performed on humans and published in English. RESULTS: The research revealed 89 articles. After title screening and considering exclusion criteria, 52 papers were included for the systematic review. BPH is a common condition affecting older men. SARS-CoV-2 infects the host cell by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). A hyperactivated RAS system during infection with SARS-CoV-2 may lead to activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and increased cytokine release. Thus, this virus can lead to exacerbation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and trigger inflammatory processes in the prostate gland. Since androgen receptors (AR) play an important role in the BPH pathophysiology and infection with SARS-CoV-2 may be androgen-mediated, BPH progression and its related symptoms can be a complication of COVID-19 through AR involvement and metabolic disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current findings, SARS-CoV-2 can possibly damage the prostate and worsen BPH and its related LUTS through ACE2 signaling, AR-related mechanisms, inflammation, and metabolic derangement. We encourage future studies to investigate the possible role of COVID-19 in the progression of BPH-related LUTS and examine the prostatic status in susceptible patients with relevant available questionnaires (e.g., IPSS) and serum biomarkers (e.g., PSA).","Haghpanah, Abdolreza; Masjedi, Fatemeh; Salehipour, Mehdi; Hosseinpour, Alireza; Roozbeh, Jamshid; Dehghani, Anahita",Prostate cancer prostatic dis,,351
502020,Immune Phenotyping Based on the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio and IgG Level Predicts Disease Severity and Outcome for Patients With COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Oncological care has faced several challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, e.g. treatment delay and worsening symptoms. Patient-reported anxiety, depression and sleep quality might have changed due to these special circumstances. Therefore, we analyzed the symptom burden of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 50 consecutive patients and the results were compared to those obtained in a previous pre-COVID study. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was employed to assess the preradiotherapy symptoms. RESULTS: The highest mean scores were reported for pain in activity (3.2) and dry mouth (3.1). Regarding anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep, the corresponding scores were 1.5, 1.2 and 2.7, respectively. Compared to the previous study, no significant increases were found. Most items had numerically lower mean values, e.g. anxiety (1.5 vs. 2.7). Both study populations had comparable median age (70.5 vs. 70 years), gender distribution and proportion of patients with bone metastases. However, there were two significant imbalances, namely a lower proportion of patients with prostate cancer (12 vs. 30%, p=0.02) and breast cancer (0 vs. 12%, p=0.02). CONCLUSION: In patients who showed up for radiation treatment planning, the suspected increase in anxiety, sadness/depression and sleep disturbance was not demonstrable. It is not known whether or not patients with substantial worries chose to decline referral to palliative radiotherapy. Therefore, comprehensive large-scale studies of patterns of care are needed to fully understand the impact of COVID-19-related measures.","Nieder, Carsten; Johnsen, Silje K; Winther, Annette M",Anticancer Res,,351
502935,Starting Kidney Replacement Therapy in Critically III Patients with Acute Kidney Injury,2021,"A density functional theory (DFT) study of the 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of the geometric isomers of 18:2 &#969;-7 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and nine model compounds is presented, using five functionals and two basis sets. The results are compared with available experimental data from solution high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The experimental 1H chemical shifts exhibit highly diagnostic resonances due to the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds. The ""inside"" olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are deshielded than those of the ""outside"" protons. Furthermore, in the cis/trans isomers, the signals of the cis bonds are more deshielded than those of the trans bonds. These regularities of the experimental 1H chemical shifts of the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are reproduced very accurately for the lowest energy DFT optimized single conformer, for all functionals and basis sets used. The other low energy conformers have negligible effects on the computational 1H-NMR chemical shifts. We conclude that proton NMR chemical shifts are more discriminating than carbon, and DFT calculations can provide a valuable tool for (i) the accurate prediction of 1H-NMR chemical shifts even with less demanding functionals and basis sets; (ii) the unequivocal identification of geometric isomerism of CLAs that occur in nature, and (iii) to derive high resolution structures in solution.","Venianakis, Themistoklis; Oikonomaki, Christina; Siskos, Michael G; Varras, Panayiotis C; Primikyri, Alexandra; Alexandri, Eleni; Gerothanassis, Ioannis P",Molecules (Basel),,351
503794,COVID-19 Infection and Acute Kidney Injury: Cause or Complication?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The tendency of parents to consume alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to be moderated by pandemic-related stress combined with the ongoing demands of childcare and home-based education, which are reported to be more burdensome for females than males. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe alcohol-related content posted by mothers on Instagram during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using two popular hashtags, #momjuice and #winemom, 50 Instagram posts on each were collected from the ""top posts"" tab. The coding categories were created inductively and were as follows: displays alcohol (drinking/holding alcohol or alcohol itself), person is making alcoholic beverages, type of alcohol featured or discussed, highlights anxiety and/or depression/mental state, highlights struggling (in general), highlights parenting challenges, encourages alcohol consumption, discourages alcohol consumption, features a person wearing clothing or shows products promoting alcohol, promotes alcohol rehabilitation, highlights caffeine to alcohol daily transition throughout the day, and highlights other drugs besides caffeine and alcohol. RESULTS: Overall, the 100 selected posts had a total of 5108 comments and 94,671 likes. The respective averages were 51.08 (SD 77.94) and 946.71 (SD 1731.72). A majority (>50%) of the posts reviewed encouraged alcohol consumption (n=66) and/or displayed alcohol (n=56). Of the 66 that encouraged and/or displayed alcohol, the common type of alcohol discussed or featured was wine (n=55). Only 6 posts discouraged alcohol use and only 4 provided the audience with a disclaimer. None of the videos promoted or endorsed alcohol rehabilitation in any way. Only 37 posts highlighted struggle. However, these posts garnered more than a majority of the likes (n=50,034, 52.3%). Posts that showed struggle received an average of 1359.57 (SD 2108.02) likes. Those that did not show struggle had an average of 704.24 (SD 1447.46) likes. An independent one-tailed t test demonstrated this difference to be statistically significant (P=.0499). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this investigation suggest that though these hashtags ostensibly exist to valorize excess alcohol consumption, they may be serving as a support system for mothers who are experiencing increased burdens and role stress during the pandemic. Given the strains placed on mothers overall and especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts must be taken to increase access to and affordability of telehealth-based mental health care.","Basch, Corey H; Meleo-Erwin, Zoe C; Mohlman, Jan; Fera, Joseph; Quinones, Nasia",JMIR Pediatr Parent,,351

504007,Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the heart transplant population: a single-centre experience,2020,"Background: SARS-COVID-2 has recently been one of the most life-threatening problems which urgently needs new therapeutic antiviral agents, especially those of herbal origin. Purpose: The study aimed to load acaciin (ACA) into the new self-assembled nanofibers (NFs) followed by investigating their possible antiviral effect against bovine coronavirus (BCV) as a surrogate model for SARS-COV-2. Methods: ACA was identified using 1H-NMR and DEPT-Q 13C-NMR spectroscopy, the molecular docking study was performed using Autodock 4 and a modification of the traditional solvent injection method was applied for the synthesis of the biodegradable NFs. Different characterization techniques were used to inspect the formation of the NFs, which is followed by antiviral investigation against BCV as well as MTT assay using MDBK cells. Results: Core/shell NFs, ranging between 80-330 nm with tiny thorn-like branches, were formed which attained an enhanced encapsulation efficiency (97.5 ± 0.53%, P<0.05) and a dual controlled release (a burst release of 65% at 1 h and a sustained release up to >24 h). The antiviral investigation of the formed NFs revealed a significant inhibition of 98.88 ± 0.16% (P<0.05) with IC50 of 12.6 µM against BCV cells. Conclusion: The results introduced a new, time/cost-saving strategy for the synthesis of biodegradable NFs without the need for electric current or hazardous cross-linking agents. Moreover, it provided an innovative avenue for the discovery of drugs of herbal origin for the fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Mohamad, Soad A; Zahran, Eman Maher; Abdel Fadeel, Maha Raafat; Albohy, Amgad; Safwat, Mohamed A",Int J Nanomedicine,,351

We explored the impact on hypertension care in the Excellence Center (EC) network of the European Society of Hypertension. METHODS: We conducted a 17-question electronic survey among ECs. RESULTS: Overall, 52 ECs from 20 European and three non-European countries participated, providing hypertension service for a median of 1500 hypertensive patients per center per year. Eighty-five percent of the ECs reported a shutdown lasting for 9 weeks (range 0-16). The number of patients treated per week decreased by 90%: from a median of 50 (range 10-400) before the pandemic to a median of 5.0 (range 0-150) during the pandemic (P < 0.0001). 60% of patients (range 0-100%) declared limited access to medical consultations. The majority of ECs (57%) could not provide 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, whereas a median of 63% (range 0-100%) of the patients were regularly performing home BP monitoring. In the majority (75%) of the ECs, hypertension service returned to normal after the first wave of the pandemic. In 66% of the ECs, the physicians received many questions regarding the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers. Stopping RAS-blocker therapy (in a few patients) either by patients or physicians was reported in 27 and 36.5% of the ECs. CONCLUSION: Patient care in hypertension ECs was compromised during the Covid-19-related shutdown. These data highlight the necessity to develop new strategies for hypertension care including virtual clinics to maintain services during challenging times.",,J Hypertens,,351

However, a meta-analysis on the efficacy of steroids in treating these coronavirus infections is lacking. (2) Purpose: We assessed a methodological criticism on the quality of previous published meta-analyses and the risk of misleading conclusions with important therapeutic consequences. We also examined the evidence of the efficacy of corticosteroids in reducing mortality in SARS, MERS and COVID-19. (3) Methods: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were used to identify studies published until 25 April 2020, that reported associations between steroid use and mortality in treating SARS/MERS/COVID-19. Two investigators screened and extracted data independently. Searches were restricted to studies on humans, and articles that did not report the exact number of patients in each group or data on mortality were excluded. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) under the fixed-and random-effect model. (4) Results: Eight articles (4051 patients) were eligible for inclusion. Among these selected studies, 3416 patients were diagnosed with SARS, 360 patients with MERS, and 275 with COVID-19; 60.3% patients were administered steroids. The meta-analyses including all studies showed no differences overall in terms of mortality (OR 1.152, 95% CI 0.631–2.101 in the random effects model, p = 0.645). However, this conclusion might be biased, because, in some studies, the patients in the steroid group had more severe symptoms than those in the control group. In contrast, when the meta-analysis was performed restricting only to studies that used appropriate adjustment (e.g., time, disease severity), there was a significant difference between the two groups (HR 0.378, 95% CI 0.221–0.646 in the random effects model, p &lt; 0.0001). Although there was no difference in mortality when steroids were used in severe cases, there was a difference among the group with more underlying diseases (OR 3.133, 95% CI 1.670–5.877, p &lt; 0.001). (5) Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis providing the most accurate evidence on the effect of steroids in coronavirus infections. If not contraindicated, and in the absence of side effects, the use of steroids should be considered in coronavirus infection including COVID-19.","Lee, Keum Hwa; Yoon, Sojung; Jeong, Gwang Hun; Kim, Jong Yeob; Han, Young Joo; Hong, Sung Hwi; Ryu, Seohyun; Kim, Jae Seok; Lee, Jun Young; Yang, Jae Won; Lee, Jinhee; Solmi, Marco; Koyanagi, Ai; Dragioti, Elena; Jacob, Louis; Radua, Joaquim; Smith, Lee; Oh, Hans; Tizaoui, Kalthoum; Cargnin, Sarah; Terrazzino, Salvatore; Ghayda, Ramy Abou; Kronbichler, Andreas; Shin, Jae Il",J.

This global health crisis imposes limitations on daily movements, which have deteriorated every sector in our society. Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. We aim to provide tangible evidence of the human mobility trends by comparing the day-by-day variations across the U.S. from January 2020 to early April 2020. Large-scale public mobility at an aggregated level is observed by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. Our study captures spatial and temporal heterogeneity as well as the sociodemographic variations and teleworking trends regarding the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical mobility interventions. All metrics adapted capture decreased public movements after the national emergency declaration. The population staying home has increased in all states before the stay-at-home mandates implemented and becomes more stable after the order with a smaller range of fluctuation. The public had been taking active responses, voluntarily staying home more, to the in-state confirmed cases while the stay-at-home orders stabilize the variations. As the estimated teleworking rates also continue to incline throughout the study period, the teleworking trend can be another driving factor for the growing stay-at-home population. We confirm that there exists overall mobility heterogeneity between the income or population density groups. The study suggests that public mobility trends are in line with the government message urging to stay home. We anticipate our data-driven analysis offers integrated perspectives and serves as evidence to raise public awareness and, consequently, reinforce the importance of social distancing while assisting policymakers.","Lee, Minha; Zhao, Jun; Sun, Qianqian; Pan, Yixuan; Zhou, Weiyi; Xiong, Chenfeng; Zhang, Lei",PLoS One,,351

We report on the safety of elective orthopaedic surgery with high rates of community transmission. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study on consecutive NHS patients attending three private hospitals between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020. Patients attended preoperative assessment, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptom screening, were instructed to self-isolate for 14 days and had a negative COVID-19 swab within 72 hours of surgery. Patient age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, body mass index, surgery performed, type of anaesthetic and length of stay were collected. Our primary outcome was a positive COVID-19 swab, secondary outcomes were COVID-19 symptoms, readmission, surgical complications and mortality. RESULTS: Between 4 May 2020 and 16 June 2020, 191 patients were admitted to three private hospitals for elective surgery; 121 (67%) patients underwent general or regional anaesthetic, 179 patients were ASA grades 1 or 2 (94%) and 12 (6%) were ASA 3. In total, 187 (98%) patients were successfully contacted at 30 days postoperative and no COVID-19 symptoms, positive COVID-19 swabs or mortality or were recorded. One patient was readmitted following a pulmonary embolism and two patients were treated as outpatients for a deep vein thrombosis and a superficial infection.

METHODS: Clinical information and chest CT data of 149 COVID-19 patients between January 9, 2020 and March 15, 2020 and 97 patients with S. pneumoniae pneumonia between January 23, 2011 and March 18, 2020 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, CT features were comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: According to the chest CT images, the probability of lung segmental and lobar pneumonia in S. pneumoniae pneumonia was higher than that in COVID-19(P<0.001); the probabilities of ground-glass opacity (GGO), the ""crazy paving"" sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa in COVID-19 were higher than those in S. pneumoniae pneumonia(Pâ¯=â¯0.005, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively); and the probabilities of consolidation lesions, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, and pleural effusion in S. pneumoniae pneumonia were higher than those in COVID-19 (P<0.001, Pâ¯=â¯0.001, Pâ¯=â¯0.003, Pâ¯=â¯0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The findings of GGO, the crazy paving sign, and abnormally thickened interlobular septa on chest CT were significantly higher in COVID-19 than S. pneumoniae pneumonia. The most important differential points on chest CT signs between COVID-19 and S. pneumoniae pneumonia were whether disease lesions were distributed in entire lung lobes and segments and whether the crazy paving sign, interlobular septal thickening, and consolidation lesions were found.","Zhou, Jun; Liao, Xingnan; Cao, Jia; Ling, Gonghao; Ding, Xun; Long, QingYun",Clin Imaging,,351

METHODS: a descriptive, exploratory, quantitative and qualitative study, which applied psychometric scales and interview script. RESULTS: nurses (95.24%) had depressive symptoms by the assessment scales by the observer, most with mild and moderate intensity. Inadequate working conditions led to suffering. Factors that trigger depressive symptoms were: disorganized work; harmful relationship with immediate management; inappropriate physician behavior; aggressions; lack of inputs, infrastructure and human resources; professional devaluation. Identified professionals with depressive symptoms who, because they were unaware of being affected by the disorder, did not seek treatment, continued to perform activities that compromised their physical and mental health, promoting damage to the assistance provided. Final considerations: high frequency of depressive symptoms. The precarious work environment negatively influenced the care and development of depressive symptoms.","Silva, Márcia Regina Guedes; Marcolan, João Fernando",Rev Bras Enferm,,351

Despite the promise of COVID-19 vaccines, the community is highly distrustful of the vaccine and institutions given a history of mistreatment and many other current concerns. Trusted messengers such as Black pastors are crucial to protecting the community that faces a disproportionate amount of disease. We present a framework to build trust and acceptance including understanding history and context; listening and empathy; engaging pastors as trusted messengers; creating partnerships with shared responsibility and power; and co-creation of solutions with faith leaders and their community, governments and institutions to create sustainable, long-term change. Efforts to support vaccine acceptance must be customized to the variety of needs and realities of the African American community, not just the topic of concern to the institution. Evaluations are needed to help ensure the community is engaged and feeling heard. Pastors and other religious leaders can work with government and institutions to bring information, facilitate discussion, build trust and develop measurable improvement efforts. Although acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines may not be achieved overnight, the process of focusing on issues that are important to the community is an important step in laying the foundation for both COVID-19 vaccines and future interventions.","Privor-Dumm, Lois; King, Terris",J Health Commun,,351

This objective is achievable by acting on fuel-related factors, such as the driving behaviour style. In this study, we developed an Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) model to predict fuel consumption of different types of industrial vehicles, using real-world data collected from 2020 to 2021. This Machine Learning model also explains the relationship between the input factors and fuel consumption, quantifying the individual contribution of each one of them. The explanations provided by the model are compared with domain knowledge in order to see if they are aligned. The results show that the 70% of the categories associated to the fuel-factors are similar to the previous literature. With the EBM algorithm, we estimate that optimizing driving behaviour decreases fuel consumption between 12% and 15% in a large fleet (more than 1000 vehicles).","Barbado, Alberto; Corcho, 'Oscar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06031v3.pdf,351

517146,Mammalian enteral ventilation ameliorates respiratory failure,2021,"In the advent of the novel coronavirus epidemic since December 2019, governments and authorities have been struggling to make critical decisions under high uncertainty at their best efforts. In computer science, this represents a typical problem of machine learning over incomplete or limited data in early epidemic Composite Monte-Carlo (CMC) simulation is a forecasting method which extrapolates available data which are broken down from multiple correlated/casual micro-data sources into many possible future outcomes by drawing random samples from some probability distributions. For instance, the overall trend and propagation of the infested cases in China are influenced by the temporal-spatial data of the nearby cities around the Wuhan city (where the virus is originated from), in terms of the population density, travel mobility, medical resources such as hospital beds and the timeliness of quarantine control in each city etc. Hence a CMC is reliable only up to the closeness of the underlying statistical distribution of a CMC, that is supposed to represent the behaviour of the future events, and the correctness of the composite data relationships. In this paper, a case study of using CMC that is enhanced by deep learning network and fuzzy rule induction for gaining better stochastic insights about the epidemic development is experimented. Instead of applying simplistic and uniform assumptions for a MC which is a common practice, a deep learning-based CMC is used in conjunction of fuzzy rule induction techniques. As a result, decision makers are benefited from a better fitted MC outputs complemented by min-max rules that foretell about the extreme ranges of future possibilities with respect to the epidemic.","Fong, Simon James; Li, Gloria; Dey, Nilanjan; Crespo, Rubén González; Herrera-Viedma, Enrique",Appl Soft Comput,,351

This crisis situation crisis forced deep changes in health care. At dental care level, it became necessary for both public health services and private consultations to plan changes to enable them to face this healthcare challenge. Material and Methods: SESPO and the General Council of Dentists of Spain (CGDE) appointed a Working Group to prepare a protocol for dental clinics after the lockdown stage. Continuing with this teamwork task, a series of recommendations addressed to public health managers and the dental workforce were agreed, according to the COVID-19 protection protocols, with the evidence available at the time of their preparation. Results: The SESPO Working Group prepared a schedule with recommendations to be taken. The CGDE presented this document to the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Welfare, and SESPO emailed it to all the Health Councils of the autonomous regions. The document was also uploaded to the CGDE and SESPO websites and was emailed to all SESPO associated members. Conclusions: Keeping in mind the existing territorial variation, both at the organization level of dental public health services, and at the care level (especially in child preventive programs and care for pregnant women), this health crisis has highlighted the importance of teamwork. It is necessary to unify the standards for all dental health care units in the national territory in challenging times.

520579,A Fully-Automated Method to Evaluate Coronavirus Disease Progression with COVID-19 Cough Sounds Using Minimal Phase Information,2021,"Waterborne diseases are a major global problem, resulting in high morbidity and mortality, and massive economic costs. The ability to rapidly and reliably detect and monitor the spread of waterborne diseases is vital for early intervention and preventing more widespread disease outbreaks. Pathogens are, however, difficult to detect in water and are not practicably detectable at acceptable concentrations that need to be achieved in treated drinking water (which are of the order one per million litre). Furthermore, current clinical-based surveillance methods have many limitations such as the invasive nature of the testing and the challenges in testing large numbers of people. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), which is based on the analysis of wastewater to monitor the emergence and spread of infectious disease at a population level, has received renewed attention in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The present review will focus on the application of WBE for the detection and surveillance of pathogens with a focus on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the waterborne protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium and Giardia. The review highlights the benefits and challenges of WBE and the future of this tool for community-wide infectious disease surveillance.","Zahedi, Alireza; Monis, Paul; Deere, Daniel; Ryan, Una",Parasitol. res,,351

We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in order to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19-induced liver injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library, for studies reporting laboratory data about COVID-19 patients, with last update on 25th March 2020. The primary outcome was the pooled prevalence of COVID- 19-induced liver damage, mainly represented by increase in serum transaminases and bilirubin. The secondary outcome was the description of abnormalities in serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT). We focused on laboratory data only on hospital admission, and adopted random-effects model for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Out of 793 included patients, the pooled prevalence of COVID-19-related liver damage was 22.17% (95% CI 17.64 to 27.07), mostly indicated by hypertransaminasemia. Serum bilirubin was increased in 5.53% (95% CI 3.60 to 7.85) of cases. Abnormal serum albumin was observed in 78.92% (95% CI 39.82 to 99.56), and increased PT value in 19.98% (95% CI 2.49 to 78.23), but these results derived from significantly heterogeneous studies. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-induced liver injury must not be ignored, as it is observed in one fifth of infected patients. Prospective studies evaluating liver function during the course of COVID-19 are needed to provide a complete overview of hepatic involvement during this viral infection.","Merola, E; Pravadelli, C; de Pretis, G",Acta Gastroenterol Belg,,351

Todos os animais apresentaram boas condições físicas gerais, parâmetros clínicos normais para a espécie e não tiveram cólica no ano anterior ao estudo, demonstrando a preocupação dos tratadores com a saúde física dos animais. Contudo, 36,7% dos animais estudados apresentavam estereotipias. Apesar da alta incidência de indivíduos com ritmo circadiano do cortisol (RCC) alterado dentro do grupo de animais com comportamentos anormais (63,64%), não foi encontrada diferença estatística (P>0,05) quando comparado com a incidência do grupo de animais sem estereotipia (31,58%). Quatro animais com estereotipia portavam dispositivos para restringir a expressão de anomalias. Desses, todos apresentaram RCC alterado, permitindo demonstrar que equinos restringidos fisicamente de realizar sua estereotipia apresentam 18 vezes mais chances de ter alteração no RCC do que um animal de comportamento normal. Conclui-se que os equinos do Jockey Club do Paraná, apesar de apresentarem condições físicas satisfatórias comparados a estudos nacionais anteriores, possuíam alterações comportamentais e de função adrenocortical compatíveis com estresse crônico. Os achados também corroboram noções prévias de que a estereotipia é uma forma de tentar aliviar o estresse crônico em equinos, e que o uso de meios físicos para restringir sua manifestação aumenta a chance de distúrbios no metabolismo do cortisol.(AU)","Gontijo, Lilian A; Cassou, Fabiane; Duarte, Patrícia C; Lago, Luiz A; Alves, Geraldo E.

The disease rapidly expanded and led to an epidemic throughout China, followed by the rising number of cases worldwide. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19, rapid and accurate diagnostic methods are immediately needed to identify, isolate and treat the patients as soon as possible, decreasing mortality rates and the risk of public contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Alborz Province in Iran. All recruited cases in this study were symptomatic adults hospitalized as COVID-19 patients with compatible Computed tomographic (CT) scan findings and available rRT-PCR results. The patients were recruited in this study. The patients were categorized into positive and negative rRT-PCR groups and evaluated for symptoms, initial vital signs, comorbidity, clinical and laboratory findings. Finally, the results were assessed by SPSS software. RESULTS: Between March 5 to April 5, 2020, 164 symptomatic COVID-19 patients were studied. In total, there were 111 rRT-PCR positive (67.6%) and 53 rRT-PCR negative patients (32.4%). In terms of statistics, the frequency of symptoms revealed no difference, except for cough (P.V:0.008), dizziness (PV: 0.048), and weakness (P.V:0.022). Among initial vital signs, PR (P.V:0.041) and O2 Saturation (PV: 0.014) were statistically different between the two groups.

Existing methods were modified to cope with the shortcomings of the experimental data: inaccessibility of information from half of the detector and a small fraction of single hits. The general SPI analysis workflow was upgraded with the expectation-maximization based classification of diffraction patterns and mode decomposition on the final virus-structure determination step. The presented processing pipeline allowed us to determine the 3D structure of bacteriophage PR772 without symmetry constraints with a spatial resolution of 6.9 nm.

The novel betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in December 2019 and has since caused a pandemic. Both viral and host factors determine the extent and severity of virus-induced lung damage. The host’s response to viral infection is necessary for viral clearance but may be deleterious and contribute to severe disease phenotypes. Similarly, tissue repair mechanisms are required for recovery from infection across the spectrum of disease severity; however, dysregulated repair responses may lead to chronic lung dysfunction. Understanding of the mechanisms of immunopathology and tissue repair following viral lower respiratory tract infection may broaden treatment options. In this Review, we discuss the pathogenesis, the contribution of the host response to severe clinical phenotypes and highlight early and late epithelial repair mechanisms following influenza virus infection, each of which has been well characterized.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to create a repeatable modeling process to identify regional population centers with pandemic vulnerability. METHODS: Using readily available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable data sets, we used stepwise linear regression techniques to build predictive models during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated later in the pandemic timeline using actual COVID-19 mortality rates in high population density states. The mean sample size was 43 and ranged from 8 (Connecticut) to 82 (Michigan). RESULTS: The New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan, and Pennsylvania models provided the strongest predictions of top counties in densely populated states with a high likelihood of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality rates. For all of these models, P values were less than .05. CONCLUSIONS: The models have been shared with the Department of Health Commissioners of each of these states with strong model predictions as input into a much needed “pandemic playbook” for local health care agencies in allocating medical testing and treatment resources.

A bilingual (Dari and English) questionnaire was used for data collection. The first section of the questionnaire collected sociodemographic information of the respondents and the second comprised a self-report standardized scale, i.e. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) to assess symptoms of anxiety. The survey form was distributed through online platforms. All residents of Kabul who used social apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook were eligible to participate in the study and participation was voluntary and non-commercial. RESULTS: Altogether 1135 complete responses were received. The majority of them were males and aged 18–34 years. Almost 18% were healthcare workers. Overall, 28.2% of the respondents reported symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety, 38.8% reported symptoms of mild anxiety, and nearly one third of the respondents reported no symptoms. Female participants reported significantly higher levels of anxiety compared with males (39.7% versus 25.6%; p = 0.0001). No significant association was noted between anxiety levels and age groups, occupations, and healthcare workers versus non-healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that a gender-specific psychosocial protocol needs be integrated into the public health emergency plans to fight against the current pandemic.","Rasib, Aziz Rahman; Nemat, Arash; Azimi, Mahmoodullah; Zaki, Naqeebullah; Sediqi, Mohammad Faiq; Raufi, Nahid; Asady, Abdullah",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511914/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ndt.s329224,351

OBJECTIVE: To understand clinician perspectives on adaptations to end-of-life care for dying patients and their families during the pandemic. DESIGN: Mixed-methods embedded study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04602520) SETTING: 3 acute care medical units in a tertiary care hospital from 16 March to 1 July 2020. PARTICIPANTS: 45 dying patients, 45 family members, and 45 clinicians. INTERVENTION: During the pandemic, clinicians continued an existing practice of collating personal information about dying patients and “what matters most,” eliciting wishes, and implementing acts of compassion. MEASUREMENTS: Themes from semistructured clinician interviews that were summarized with representative quotations. RESULTS: Many barriers to end-of-life care arose because of infection control practices that mandated visiting restrictions and personal protective equipment, with attendant practical and psychological consequences. During hospitalization, family visits inside or outside the patient's room were possible for 36 patients (80.0%); 13 patients (28.9%) had virtual visits with a relative or friend. At the time of death, 20 patients (44.4%) had a family member at the bedside. Clinicians endeavored to prevent unmarked deaths by adopting advocacy roles to “fill the gap” of absent family and by initiating new and established ways to connect patients and relatives. LIMITATION: Absence of clinician symptom or wellness metrics; a single-center design. CONCLUSION: Clinicians expressed their humanity through several intentional practices to preserve personalized, compassionate end-of-life care for dying hospitalized patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

To aid understanding of the impact of these public health measures on different social groups we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries ('SEBCOV' - Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19). Here we report the results of the SEBCOV anonymous online survey of adults. Overall, 5,058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Post-stratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Among the five countries, Thai respondents appeared to have been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. Overall, lower education levels, larger households, having children under 18 in the household, being 65 years or older and having flexible/no income were associated with worse economic impact. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, and mental health and wellbeing. There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents reporting a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work, with 60% and 26% respectively able to cope with 29 days or longer. Many respondents reported seeing news that seemed fake to them, the proportion varying between countries, and with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. Our data showed that COVID-19 public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences on people's lives.","Osterrieder, A.; Cuman, G.; Pan-ngum, W.; Cheah, P.

To gain systems-level insights into its pathogenesis, we compared the blood proteome and phosphoproteome of ICU patients with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and healthy control subjects by quantitative mass spectrometry. We find that COVID-19 is marked with hyperactive T cell and B cell signaling, compromised innate immune response, and dysregulated inflammation, coagulation, metabolism, RNA splicing, transcription and translation pathways. SARS-CoV-2 infection causes global reprogramming of the kinome and kinase-substrate network, resulting in defective antiviral defense via the CK2-OPN-IL-12/IFN-I axis, lymphocyte cell death via aberrant JAK/STAT signaling, and inactivation of innate immune cells via inhibitory SIRPA, SIGLEC and SLAM family receptor signaling. Our work identifies CK2, SYK, JAK3, TYK2 and IL-12 as potential targets for immunomodulatory treatment of severe COVID-19 and provides a valuable approach and resource for deciphering the mechanism of pathogen-host interactions.","Kaneko, T.; Esmail, S.; Voss, C.; Martin, C.

Protein-based biosensors allow screening to be performed using routine molecular laboratory equipment without a need for expensive chemical reagents. Here we present a biosensor for the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2, comprising a FRET-capable pair of fluorescent proteins held in proximity by a protease cleavable linker. We demonstrate the utility of this biosensor for inhibitor discovery by screening 1280 compounds from the Library of Pharmaceutically Active Compounds collection. The screening identified 65 inhibitors, with the 20 most active exhibiting sub-micromolar inhibition of 3CL(pro) in follow-up EC(50) assays. The top hits included several compounds not previously identified as 3CL(pro) inhibitors, in particular five members of a family of aporphine alkaloids that offer promise as new antiviral drug leads.","Brown, Alistair S.; Ackerley, David F.; Calcott, Mark J.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33066278/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25204666,351

COVID‐19 symptoms are polymorphic and may include upper respiratory symptoms. However, COVID‐19 symptoms may be mistaken with the common cold or allergic rhinitis. An ARIA‐EAACI study group attempted to differentiate upper respiratory symptoms between the three diseases. METHODS: A modified Delphi process was used. The ARIA members who were seeing COVID‐19 patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire on the upper airway symptoms of COVID‐19, common cold and allergic rhinitis. RESULTS: Among the 192 ARIA members who were invited to respond to the questionnaire, 89 responded and 87 questionnaires were analysed. The consensus was then reported. A two‐way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the symptom intensity between the three diseases (p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This modified Delphi approach enabled the differentiation of upper respiratory symptoms between COVID‐19, the common cold and allergic rhinitis.

Under normal circumstances, samples would be processed using commercial proprietary reagents in Biosafety 2 (BSL-2) or higher facilities. A pandemic at the scale of COVID-19 has caused a global shortage of proprietary reagents and BSL-2 laboratories to safely perform testing. Therefore, alternative solutions are urgently needed to address these challenges. We developed an open-source method called Magnetic- nanoparticle-Aided Viral RNA Isolation of Contagious Samples (MAVRICS) that is built upon reagents that are either readily available or can be synthesized in any molecular biology laboratory with basic equipment. Unlike conventional methods, MAVRICS works directly in samples inactivated in acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (e.g., TRIzol), thus allowing infectious samples to be handled safely without biocontainment facilities. Using 36 COVID-19 patient samples, 2 wastewater samples and 1 human pathogens control sample, we showed that MAVRICS rivals commercial kits in validated diagnostic tests of SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. MAVRICS is scalable and thus could become an enabling technology for widespread community testing and wastewater monitoring in the current and future pandemics.","Ramos-Mandujano, G.; Salunke, R.; Mfarrej, S.; Rachmadi, A.; Hala, S.; Xu, J.; Alofi, F.

SARS‐CoV‐2 has been found in cardiac tissue, and myocardial dysfunction post‐COVID‐19 may occur. However, the association between SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in plasma and cardiovascular biomarkers remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID MECH (COVID‐19 Mechanisms) was a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive, hospitalized patients with laboratory‐confirmed infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 and symptoms of COVID‐19. Biobank plasma samples used to measure SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and cardiovascular and inflammatory biomarkers were collected in 123 patients at baseline, and in 96 patients (78%) at day 3. Patients were aged 60±15 (mean ± SD) years, 71 (58%) were men, 68 (55%) were White, and 31 (25%) received mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was detected in plasma from 48 (39%) patients at baseline. Patients with viremia were more frequently men, had more diabetes mellitus, and lower oxygen saturation. Patients with viremia had higher concentrations of interleukin‐6, C‐reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin (all <0.001), but comparable levels of cTnT (cardiac troponin T; P=0.09), NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide; P=0.27) and D‐dimer (P=0.67) to patients without viremia. SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was present in plasma at either baseline or day 3 in 50 (52%) patients, and these patients experienced increase from baseline to day 3 in NT‐proBNP and D‐dimer concentrations, while there was no change in cTnT.

While data suggests that COVID-19 is not associated with significant adverse health outcomes for pregnant women and newborns, the psychological impact on pregnant women is likely to be high. Aim The aim was to explore the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian pregnant women, especially regarding concerns and birth expectations. Methods A cross-sectional online survey of pregnant women in Italy was conducted. Responses were analysed for all women and segregated into two groups depending on previous experience of pregnancy loss. Analysis of open text responses examined expectations and concerns before and after the onset of the pandemic. Findings Two hundred pregnant women responded to the first wave of the survey. Most (n = 157, 78.5%) had other children and 100 (50.0%) had a previous history of perinatal loss. ‘Joy’ was the most prevalent emotion expressed before COVID-19 (126, 63.0% before vs 34, 17.0% after; p < 0.05); fear was the most prevalent after (15, 7.5% before vs 98, 49.0% after; p < 0.05). Positive constructs were prevalent before COVID-19, while negative ones were dominant after (p < 0.05). Across the country, women were concerned about COVID-19 and a history of psychological disorders was significantly associated with higher concerns (p < 0.05). A previous pregnancy loss did not influence women’s concerns. Conclusions Women’s expectations and concerns regarding childbirth changed significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. Women with a history of psychological disorders need particular attention as they seem to experience higher levels of concern.","Ravaldi, Claudia; Wilson, Alyce; Ricca, Valdo; Homer, Caroline; Vannacci, Alfredo",Women Birth,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2020.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871519220302808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32684343/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871519220302808?v=s5,351

Prolongued oro-tracheal intubation is associated to an increased risk of dysphagia and bronchial aspiration. Purpose of this study was to investigate swallowing disorders in critically ill COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study analysing a consecutive cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital. Data concerning dysphagia were collected according to the Gugging Swallowing Screen (GUSS) and related to demographic characteristics, clinical data, ICU Length-Of-Stay (LOS) and MV parameters. RESULTS: From March 2 to April 30, 2020, 31 consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU were evaluated by speech and language therapists (SLT). Twenty-five of them were on MV (61% through endotracheal tube and 19% through tracheostomy); median MV length was 11 days. Seventeen (54.8%) patients presented dysphagia; a correlation was found between first GUSS severity stratification and MV days (p < 0.001), ICU LOS (p < 0.001), age (p = 0.03) and tracheostomy (p = 0.042). No other correlations were found. At 16 days, 90% of patients had fully recovered; a significant improvement was registered especially during the first week (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Compared to non-COVID-19 patiens, a higher rate of dysphagia was reported in COVID-19 patients, with a more rapid and complete recovery. A systematic early SLT evaluation of COVID-19 patients on MV may thus be useful to prevent dysphagia-related complications.","Ceruti, Samuele; Glotta, Andrea; Galli, Anna; Biggiogero, Maira; Bona, Giovanni; Mauri, Romano; Saporito, Andrea; Capdevila, Xavier",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080121007871?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512968/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102837; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080121007871,351
604652,Lipase Elevation in Patients With COVID-19,2020-06-03,"INTRODUCTION: In recent months, some attempts were made to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. Despite recent research that suggests COVID-19 and lockdown measures may eventually impact sexual response and sexually related behaviors, we are missing clinical sexologists’ perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health. Such perspectives could inform a preliminary framework aimed at guiding future research and clinical approaches in the context of COVID-19. AIM: To explore the perspectives of clinical sexologists about the impact of COVID-19 on their patients’ sexual health, as well as the professional challenges they have faced during the current pandemic. Findings are expected to inform a preliminary framework aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. METHODS: We conducted an online qualitative exploratory survey with 4 open-ended questions with 39 clinical sexologists aged between 32 and 73 years old. The survey was advertised among professional associations’ newsletters. We performed a Thematic Analysis using an inductive, semantic, and (critical) realist approach, leading to a final thematic map. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome is the thematic map and the corresponding table that aggregates the main themes, subthemes, and codes derived from participants’ answers and that can serve as a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. RESULTS: The final thematic map, expected to serve as a preliminary framework on the impact of COVID-19 in sexual health, revealed 3 main themes: Clinical Focus, Remapping Relationships, and Reframing Technology Use. These themes aggregate important interrelated issues, such as worsening of sexual problems and dysfunctions, mental health, relationship management, the rise of conservatism, and the use of new technology that influences sexuality and sexual health-related services. CONCLUSION: The current study allowed us to develop a preliminary framework to understand the impact of COVID-19 on sexual health. This framework highlights the role of mental health, as well as the contextual nature of sexual problems, and subsequently, their relational nature. Also, it demonstrates that the current pandemic has brought into light the debate of e-Health delivery within clinical sexology. PM Pascoal, J Carvalho, CF Raposo, et al.

A comparison can be drawn between the synthesis of both CaMV proteins and the fusion protein in a yeast retrotransposon, Ty, resulting from a +1 frameshifting event which fuses two out-of-phase ORFs encoding the structural protein and the reverse transcriptase of Ty. For this reason, we constructed a yeast expression vector containing CaMV ORF VII fused to CaMV ORF III by a fragment of 452 bp including the overlapping region of ORF IV and ORF V, ORF VII and ORF III being used as reporter genes. We characterized two proteins (22 and 50 kDa) synthesized from this plasmid in the yeast expression system. We demonstrated that the 50-kDa polypeptide is not synthesized from a +1 frameshifting event but is probably a dimeric form of the 22-kDa protein. From this result we conclude that the CaMV reverse transcriptase is not produced by a mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting.","Wurch, T.; Guidasci, T.; Geldreich, A.; Lebeurier, G.; Mesnard, J.-M.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004268229190103I; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/004268229190103I; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1703375/,351

In this scenario, the effects of weather conditions that can influence the spread of the virus are not clearly understood. This study aimed to analyse the influence of meteorological (temperature, wind speed, humidity and specific enthalpy) and human mobility variables in six cities (Barranquilla, Bogota, Cali, Cartagena, Leticia and Medellin) from different biomes in Colombia on the coronavirus dissemination from March 25, 2020, to January 15, 2021. Rank correlation tests and a neural network named self-organising map (SOM) were used to investigate similarities in the dynamics of the disease in the cities and check possible relationships among the variables. Two periods were analysed (quarantine and post-quarantine) for all cities together and individually. The data were classified in seven groups based on city, date and biome using SOM. The virus transmission was most affected by mobility variables, especially in the post-quarantine. The meteorological variables presented different behaviours on the virus transmission in different biogeographical regions. The wind speed was one of the factors connected with the highest contamination rate recorded in Leticia. The highest new daily cases were recorded in Bogota where cold/dry conditions (average temperature <14 °C and absolute humidity >9 g/m(3)) favoured the contagions. In contrast, Barranquilla, Cartagena and Leticia presented an opposite trend, especially with the absolute humidity >22 g/m(3). The results support the implementation of better local control measures based on the particularities of tropical regions.","Gómez-Herrera, Santiago; Sartori Jeunon Gontijo, Erik; Enríquez-Delgado, Sandra M.; Rosa, André H.",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34461424/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463921001486; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2021.113833; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463921001486?v=s5,351

A lung-protective mechanical ventilation strategy using low tidal volumes is a cornerstone to management, but uncontrolled hypercapnia is a life-threatening consequence among severe cases. A mechanism to prevent progressive hypercapnia may offset hemodynamic instability among patients who develop hypercapnia. We present the case of a woman in her mid-60's with severe acute hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia who was successfully treated with early implementation of lung-protective ventilation facilitated by extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R). This patient's multiple comorbid conditions included obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. On her fifth day of admission at the referring hospital, her worsening hypoxemia prompted endotracheal intubation during which she developed pneumothorax. She was transferred to our institution for advanced care where upon arrival, she had profound hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis. She met the criteria for treatment with an investigational ECCO(2)R device (Hemolung Respiratory Assist System) available through FDA Emergency Use Authorization. ECCO(2)R is similar to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) but operates at much lower blood flows (350–550 mL/min) through a smaller 15.5 French central venous catheter. Standard heparinization was provided intravenously to achieve appropriate levels of anticoagulation during ECCO(2)R therapy. Unlike ECMO, ECCO(2)R does not provide clinically meaningful oxygenation but is simpler to implement and manage. The use of ECCO(2)R successfully corrected and controlled the patient's hypercapnia and acidosis and enabled meaningful reductions in ventilator tidal volumes, respiratory rates, and mean airway pressures. The patient was weaned from ECCO(2)R after 17 days and from mechanical ventilation 10 days later. With low tidal volume ventilation facilitated by expeditious implementation of ECCO(2)R, the patient survived to discharge despite her many risk factors for a poor outcome and an extended duration of invasive mechanical ventilation.","Saavedra-Romero, Ramiro; Paz, Francisco; Litell, John M.; Weinkauf, Julia; Benson, Carina C.; Tindell, Lisa; Williams, Kari",Case Rep Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327027/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9958343,351

This may worsen the quality of hemodialysis and contribute to a shortage of dialysis machines as well as plastic disposables during the pandemic. This study describes a simple and safe protocol of anticoagulation with low-molecular-weight heparin in combination with bedside sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis in coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Monocentric observational cross-over trial investigating sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis with unfractionated heparin following sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis with low-molecular-weight heparin. SETTING: Coronavirus disease 2019-ICU in a German Tertiary Care University Hospital. PATIENTS: Three consecutive severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients receiving nine sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis therapies with unfractionated heparin followed by 18 sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis therapies with low-molecular-weight heparin. INTERVENTIONS: Switch from IV unfractionated heparin to subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin in therapeutic doses for patients receiving bedside sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nine renal replacement therapy sessions in patients anticoagulated with high doses of unfractionated heparin had to be discontinuated prematurely because of clotting of tubes or membrane and poor quality of hemodialysis. In the same patients, the switch to anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin allowed undisturbed bedside sustained low-efficiency hemodialysis for at least 12 hours. Quality of hemodialysis was excellent, no bleeding event was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic anticoagulation with subcutaneous enoxaparin provides an effective and safe renal replacement procedure in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and hypercoagulability. The protocol reduces the risk of filter clotting, blood loss, and poor dialysis quality and may also prevent systemic thromboembolism.","Neumann-Haefelin, Elke; Widmeier, Eugen; Bansbach, Joachim; Kaufmann, Kai; Heinrich, Sebastian; Walz, Gerd; Bürkle, Hartmut; Kalbhenn, Johannes",Crit Care Explor,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32696014/; https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000155,351

However, many neighbourhoods around the world are distressed by neighbourhood nuisances or unacceptable behaviour of the residents. While interventionist approaches and incentives have been adopted in many countries to curb these problems, a punitive measure is used in Hong Kong instead. The Housing Department launched the Marking Scheme for Tenancy Enforcement in Public Housing Estates immediately after the SARS epidemic. The scheme operates as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants will be expelled from public housing if they receive sixteen points for the misdeeds they have committed. Yet, the marking scheme itself was put onto the stage without any prior public consultation. Besides, it has been criticised for its unfair and tenure-biased enforcement. Also, whether the scheme is widely accepted is highly doubtful. Against this background, this study aims to explore the tenants’ views regarding residents’ unacceptable behaviour and the marking scheme in Hong Kong’s public housing.

612159,"Development, implementation and preliminary evaluation of clinical dashboards in a department of anesthesia",2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND: Detection of HIV-1 transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and subtype diversity (SD) are public health strategies to assess current HIV-1 regimen and ensure effective therapeutic outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-1 patients. Globally, limited data exist on TDR and SD among blood donors. In this study, drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and SD amongst HIV-1 sero-positive blood donors in Accra, Ghana were characterized. METHODS: Purposive sampling method was used to collect 81 HIV sero-positive blood samples from the Southern Area Blood Center and confirmed by INNO-LIA as HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. Viral RNA was only extracted from plasma samples confirmed as HIV-1 positive. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the RNA as a template and subsequently amplified by nested PCR with specific primers. The expected products were verified, purified and sequenced. Neighbour-joining tree with the Kimura’s 2-parameter distances was generated with the RT sequences using Molecular Evolutionary Genetic Analysis version 6.0 (MEGA 6.0). RESULTS: Out of the 81 plasma samples, 60 (74%) were confirmed as HIV-1 sero-positive by INNO-LIA HIVI/II Score kit with no HIV-2 and dual HIV-1/2 infections. The remaining samples, 21 (26%) were confirmed as HIV sero-negative. Of the 60 confirmed positive samples, (32) 53% and (28) 47% were successfully amplified in the RT and PR genes respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of amplified samples revealed the presence of major drug resistance mutations in two (2) samples; E138A in one sample and another with K65R. HIV-1 Subtypes including subtypes A, B, CRF02_AG and CRF09_cpx were found. CONCLUSION: This study found major drug resistance mutations, E138A and K65R in the RT gene that confer high level resistance to most NNRTIs and NRTI respectively. CRF02_AG was most predominant, the recorded percentage of subtype B and the evolutionary relationship inferred by phylogenetic analysis may suggest possible subtype importation. However, a more prospective and detailed analysis is needed to establish this phenomenon. The data obtained would inform the selection of drugs for ART initiation to maximize therapeutic options in drug-naïve HIV-1 patients in Ghana.","Obeng, Billal Musah; Bonney, Evelyn Yayra; Asamoah-Akuoko, Lucy; Nii-Trebi, Nicholas Israel; Mawuli, Gifty; Abana, Christopher Zaab-Yen; Sagoe, Kwamena William Coleman",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709248/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-020-01386-y,351

With the uncontrolled circulating information about medications, supplements, and herbs that are believed to treat COVID-19, self-medication and misused might escalate. Therefore, this study aims to determine the consumption of “anti-COVID” agents and the mental health of mothers with school-age children in Indonesia. METHODS: Online questionnaires regarding medications/supplements for COVID-19 prevention and treatment of “anti-COVID” consumption behavior and mental health using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) were distributed among Indonesian mothers with school-age children. Data (n = 610) were analyzed; descriptive and association between sociodemographic factors, “anti-COVID” medications consumption, and mental health were presented. RESULTS: A quarter of the respondents were categorized as having mental disorders, with higher scores of DASS-21 was higher in the housewives’ group. The incidence associated with age, family expenses, and marital status in the working mothers’ group, and only with family expense in the housewives’ group. Moreover, the result showed 80% of the respondents consumed “anti-COVID” medications or supplements to prevent COVID-19, with 75% did self-medication without consulting with a healthcare professional. Friends/family and social media were two primary sources of information regarding the “anti-COVID” products. In the housewives’ group, their consumption behavior was influenced by education. Meanwhile in the working mothers’ group, the consumption behavior was influenced by age, family income, and family expense. In addition, there was no association between the usage of medications/supplements with the respondents’ mental health status. CONCLUSION: This study showed the importance of controlling information and expanding the mother’s knowledge to find the correct information to minimize the unwanted effect in the post COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing awareness of mental health issues in the community, especially in the vulnerable population such as mother with school-age children, is necessary to avoid detrimental effects that might occur in the future.","d’Arqom, Annette; Sawitri, Brihastami; Nasution, Zamal; Lazuardi, Riko",Int J Womens Health,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijwh.s316417; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34285594/,351

Interestingly, while viral genomic RNAs persisted in infected cells over 14 subsequent passages with concomitant synthesis of viral subgenomic mRNAs and structural proteins, no infectious virus was isolated beyond passage 2. Further biochemical and electron microscopic analyses revealed that virions, while assembled, contained little spike in the envelope, indicating that lack of infectivity during persistence was likely due to deficiency in spike incorporation. This type of non-lytic, non-productive persistence in oligodendrocytes is unique among animal viruses and resembles MHV persistence previously observed in the mouse central nervous system. Thus, establishment of such a culture system that can recapitulate the in vivo phenomenon will provide a powerful approach for elucidating the mechanisms of coronavirus persistence in glial cells at the cellular and molecular levels.","Liu, Yin; Herbst, Werner; Cao, Jianzhong; Zhang, Xuming",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682210006422; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.10.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682210006422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21035161/,351

Recently, a multitude of studies have reported that viral infections may have complex interconnections with the autophagic process. These observations strongly imply that autophagy has virus-specific roles relating to viral replication, host innate and adaptive immune responses, virus-induced cell death programs, and viral pathogenesis. Autophagy can supply internal membrane structures necessary for viral replication or may prolong cell survival during viral infections and postpone cell death. It can influence the survival of both infected and bystander cells. This process has also been linked to the recognition of viral signature molecules during innate immunity and has been suggested to help rid the cell of infection.

615990,"Reply to ""Spectral CT for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Diagnosis: More Is Yet to Be Known""",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted economic activity in India. Adjusting policies to contain transmission while mitigating the economic impact requires an assessment of the economic situation in near real-time and at high spatial granularity. This paper shows that daily electricity consumption and monthly nighttime light intensity can proxy for economic activity in India. Energy consumption is compared with the predictions of a consumption model that explains 90 percent of the variation in normal times. Energy consumption declined strongly after a national lockdown was implemented on March 25, 2020 and remained a quarter below normal levels throughout April. It recovered subsequently, but electricity consumption remained lower even in September. Not all states and union territories have been affected equally. While electricity consumption halved in some, it declined very little in others. Part of the heterogeneity is explained by the prevalence of COVID-19 infections, the share of manufacturing, and return migration. During the national lockdown, higher COVID-19 infection rates at the district level were associated with larger declines in nighttime light intensity. Without effectively reducing the risk of a COVID-19 infection, voluntary reductions of mobility will hence prevent a return to full economic potential even when restrictions are relaxed. Together, daily electricity consumption and nighttime light intensity allow monitoring economic activity in near real-time and high spatial granularity.","Beyer, Robert C.M.; Franco-Bedoya, Sebastian; Galdo, Virgilio",World Dev,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305750X20304149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305264/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X20304149; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2020.105287,351

Exploration of trends within the existing COVID-19 data may guide directions for further study and novel treatment development. As the world faces COVID-19 disease, it is essential to study its epidemiological and clinical characteristics further to better understand and aid in its detection and containment. Methods We aimed to study the clinical characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Dubai, a multi-national Society. Results Our findings demonstrate that during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic, age, gender, and country of origin were associated with more severe cases of COVID-19, higher risk for hospitalization and death. Male individuals between 41-60 years of age from India had the most significant hospitalization and death predictor (p =.0001). The predictors for COVID-19 related deaths were slightly less than UAE Nationals by individuals from GCC (p =.02) that were followed closely behind by Pilipino (p =.02) and Arabs (p =.001). Conclusion The vulnerability of individuals to infection and in the spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms remains to be understood. There are large variations in disease severity, one component of which may be genetic variability in responding to the virus. Genomics of susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and the wide variation in clinical response to COVID-19 in patients should become active investigation areas.","Farajallah, Halah Mohammed; AlSuwaidi, Sara Khamis; AlSuwaidi, Shatha Mohammad; Ali, Ghada AlAhmdani Al; AlZubaidi, Amani Salem; Carrick, Frederick Robert; Abdulrahman, Mahera",J Infect Public Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187603412100099X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2021.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118740/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S187603412100099X,351

Previous studies suggest that women process and express affective experiences, such as fear, with a greater intensity compared to men. We administered an online survey to a sample of participants in the United States that measures fear of COVID-19, perceptions about health and financial risks, and preventative measures taken. Despite the empirical fact that men are more likely to experience adverse health consequences from COVID-19, women report greater fear and more negative expectations about health-related consequences of COVID-19 than men. However, women are more optimistic than men regarding the financial consequences of the pandemic. Women also report more negative emotional experiences generally during the pandemic, particularly in situations where other people or the government take actions that make matters worse. Though women report taking more preventative measures than men in response to the pandemic, gender differences in behavior are reduced after controlling for fear. These results shed light on how differences in emotional experiences of the pandemic may inform policy interventions.","Alsharawy, Abdelaziz; Spoon, Ross; Smith, Alec; Ball, Sheryl",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421741/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.689467,351

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Medline+Journal (via OVID) were conducted for relevant journal publications from database inception to May 4, 2020. Articles that reported the fatality rates and clinical outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection were included. Nine clinical reports (four SARS reports and five COVID-19 reports) with a total of 851 patients (367 and 484 patients with SARS and COVID-19, respectively) were analyzed. A greater proportion of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had bilateral pneumonia (90.0% [76.3%–96.2%] vs. 35.9% [21.4%–53.6%], p < 0.001) and required ventilators (23.8% [18.8%–29.6%] vs. 15.3% [11.9%–19.4%], p = 0.010) compared with hospitalized patients with SARS.

We estimated the adverse maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes among COVID-19 infected women and determined heterogeneity in the estimates and associated factors. STUDY DESIGNS: PubMed search was performed of confirmed COVID-19 pregnant cases and related outcomes were ascertained prior to July 8, 2020, in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Studies reporting premature birth, low birth weight, COVID-19 infection in neonates, or mode of delivery status were included in the study. Two investigators independently performed searches, assessed quality of eligible studies as per the Cochrane handbook recommendations, extracted and reported data according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled proportions of maternal and neonatal outcomes were estimated using meta-analyses for studies with varying sample sizes while a systematic review with descriptive data analysis was performed for case report studies. Maternal and neonatal outcomes included C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, adverse pregnancy events and COVID transmission in neonates. RESULTS: A total of 790 COVID-19 positive females and 548 neonates from 61 studies were analyzed. The rates of C-section, premature birth, low birth weight, and adverse pregnancy events were estimated as 72 %, 23 %, 7 %, and 27 % respectively. In the heterogeneity analysis, the rate of C-section was substantially higher in Chinese studies (91 %) compared to the US (40 %) or European (38 %) studies. The rates of preterm birth and adverse pregnancy events were also lowest in the US studies (12 %, 15 %) compared to Chinese (17 %, 21 %), and European studies (19 %, 19 %). In case reports, the rates of C-section, preterm birth, and low birth weight were estimated as 69 %, 56 %, and 35 %, respectively. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were associated with infection acquired at early gestational ages, more symptomatic presentation, myalgia symptom at presentation, and use of oxygen support therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse pregnancy outcomes were prevalent in COVID-19 infected females and varied by location, type, and size of the studies. Regular screening and early detection of COVID-19 in pregnant women may provide more favorable outcomes.","Dubey, Pallavi; Reddy, Sireesha; Manuel, Sharron; Dwivedi, Alok K.",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0301211520304760; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301211520304760?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32795828/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.034,351

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao(2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.","Lien, Te-Cheng; Sung, Chun-Sung; Lee, Chen-Hsen; Kao, Hsin-Kuo; Huang, Ying-Che; Liu, Cheng-Yi; Perng, Reury-Perng; Wang, Jia-Horng",J Crit Care,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944107000792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056023/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2007.05.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0883944107000792,351

It is the largest of all twenty amino acids in the translational toolbox. Its side chain is indole, which is aromatic with a binuclear ring structure, whereas those of Phe, Tyr, and His are single-ring aromatics. In part due to these elaborate structural features, the biosynthetic pathway of Trp is the most complex and the most energy-consuming among all amino acids. Essential in the animal diet, Trp is also the least abundant amino acid in the cell, and one of the rarest in the proteome. In most eukaryotes, Trp is the only amino acid besides Met, which is coded for by a single codon, namely UGG. Due to the large and hydrophobic π-electron surface area, its aromatic side chain interacts with multiple other side chains in the protein, befitting its strategic locations in the protein structure. Finally, several Trp derivatives, namely tryptophylquinone, oxitriptan, serotonin, melatonin, and tryptophol, have specialized functions. Overall, Trp is a scarce and precious amino acid in the cell, such that nature uses it parsimoniously, for multiple but selective functions. Here, the various aspects of the uniqueness of Trp are presented in molecular terms.","Barik, Sailen",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21228776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233627/,351

Here we provided a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying influenza‐associated exacerbations risk for occupational asthmatics, based on a combination of published distributions of viral shedding and symptoms scores and lung respiratory system properties characterized by long‐range peak expiratory flow (PEF) dynamics. Using a coupled detrended fluctuation analysis‐experimental human influenza approach, we estimated the conditional probability of moderate or severe lung airway obstruction and hence the exacerbations risk of influenza‐associated occupational asthma in individuals. The long‐range correlation exponent (α) was used as a predictor of future exacerbations risk of influenza‐associated asthma. For our illustrative distribution of PEF fluctuations and influenza‐induced asthma exacerbations risk relations, we found that the probability of exacerbations risk can be limited to below 50% by keeping α to below 0.53. This study also found that limiting wheeze scores to 0.56 yields a 75% probability of influenza‐associated asthma exacerbations risk and a limit of 0.34 yields a 50% probability that may give a representative estimate of the distribution of chronic respiratory system properties.

We analyzed data obtained from physical market survey data for 2,782 individuals from 27 species, with 2,420 individuals reported in early surveys (1968-1988) and 362 individuals reported in later surveys (2003-2015) and online surveys (February 2017 to January 2019). We compared information on asking prices and what species were traded using two comparative approaches to analyze how species composition may have changed over time (physical markets and online platforms; pre-Internet and Internet era). In comparison with the five previous market surveys, we did not find a statistically significant difference between species and availability of species offered for sale when comparing physical bird markets and online markets. In all data sets, biological factors such as wingspan were significant factors in explaining price variation. We conclude that sustained monitoring is needed to make direct comparisons between the trade platforms.

Three CNNs (AlexNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet-50) were trained, validated and tested (in the MATLAB 2020b software) for the recognition of selected liquids (ethanol, propanol and pentane) using photographs of the flames they produce. For training, validation and test photographs of the liquids under investigation burning in a 106-mm-diameter vessel were used. The accuracy of all the CNNs under investigation during the tests was above 99%. In addition the trained CNNs were tested using photographs of the flames generated by the liquids under investigation burning in a vessel with a diameter of 75 mm. The accuracy of the trained CNNs in this additional test ranged from 37 to 42% (GoogLeNet) through 62–73% (ResNet-50) up to 51–80% (AlexNet) – the results varied dependent upon the relative size of the flame in the photograph under analysis (in most cases an increase in the relative size caused an increase in accuracy). The accuracy of the AlexNet can be improved from 80% to almost 96% using an algorithm. The principle of the algorithm is the analysis of 10 photographs of the same liquid in the same vessel (taken over a few seconds) followed by the recognition based on an identical classification for at least 6 out of 10 photographs. An accuracy of 96% is sufficient for the rapid recognition of burning liquids in practical applications.

This wave of the outbreak has been more serious than the first wave pandemic in 2020, which suggests that some new transmission characteristics may exist. COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets, aerosols, and contact with infected surfaces. Air pollutants are also considered to be associated with COVID-19 transmission. However, the roles of indoor transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of these factors in indoor environments are still poorly understood. Our study focused on reveal the role of indoor transmission in the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our results indicated that human mobility in the home environment had the highest relative influence on COVID-19 daily growth rate in the country. The COVID-19 daily growth rate was significantly positively correlated with the residential percent rate in most state-level areas in India. A significant positive nonlinear relationship was found when the residential percent ratio ranged from 100 to 120%. Further, epidemic dynamics modelling indicated that a higher proportion of indoor transmission in the home environment was able to intensify the severity of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India. Our findings suggested that more attention should be paid to the indoor transmission in home environment. The public health strategies to reduce indoor transmission such as ventilation and centralized isolation will be beneficial to the prevention and control of COVID-19.","Tang, Liwei; Liu, Min; Ren, Bingyu; Chen, Jinghong; Liu, Xinwei; Wu, Xilin; Huang, Weiren; Tian, Jing",Environ Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464619/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111910; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121012056; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121012056?v=s5,351

It is characterized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has quickly influenced all over the world since it spreads easily. Common symptoms are fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and muscle aches. Despite the urgent need to find an effective antiviral treatment, already available agents are being used alone or in combination all over the world. At the beginning of the pandemic, death rates of infection caused by COVID-19 are high but ""is COVID-19 responsible for all deaths?"", or ""are there any contributions of the frequently used drugs in this period to these deaths?"" Surely herd immunity plays a major role and has the contribution in the decline in mortality rates. Meanwhile, it is kept in mind that due to safety concerns, changes have also been made to the dosage and combined use of frequently used drugs. OBJECTIVE: In this review, answers to two questions above and the safety of treatments, toxicities of agents involving chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, lopiravir/ritonavir, sarilumab, tocilizumab, siltuximab, corticosteroids and bromhexine which are the most frequently used in both Turkey and all over the world will be summarized.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate trends and disparities in access to pharmacies in 4 largest cities in the United States, New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, and Chicago, by neighborhood racial and ethnic composition from 2015 to 2020. METHODS Data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (2015-2020) and the American Community Survey (2015-2019) were used. We examined neighborhoods (i.e., census tracts) and evaluated disparities in ""pharmacy deserts"" (low-income neighborhoods (1) whose average distance to the nearest pharmacy was at least 1 mile or (2) whose average distance to the nearest pharmacy was at least 0.5 mile and at least 100 households had no vehicle access). We also evaluated the differences in pharmacy closures and the availability of pharmacy services. RESULTS From 2015 to 2020, the percent of neighborhoods with pharmacy deserts declined in New York City (from 1.6% to 0.9% of neighborhoods, P < 0.01), remained stable in Los Angeles (13.7% to 13.4%, P = 0.58) and Houston (27.0% to 28.5%, P = 0.18), and increased in Chicago (15.0% to 19.9%, P < 0.01). Pharmacy deserts were persistently more common in Black and Latino neighborhoods in all 4 cities. As of 2020, pharmacies in Black and Latino neighborhoods were also more likely to close and less likely to offer immunization, 24-hour, and drive-through services than pharmacies in other neighborhoods.

634950,Comparison of the Diagnostic Value of Immunochromatography Kits in Corona Virus Disease 2019 Patients: A Prospective Pilot Study,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: The recognition, prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a major challenge in the face of the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has been associated with significant cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and hematologic complications related to hypercoagulability. There has been little literature thus far on the utility of screening ultrasound and the role of the clinical pharmacist in treating these patients. METHODS: We present a prospective pilot program of thirty-one consecutive COVID-19 patients who were provided four extremity screening ultrasounds for VTE on admission. This was coordinated by a clinical pharmacist as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were recorded with the goal of describing the utility of the clinical pharmacist in ultrasound screening. Data collected include demographics, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during the hospitalization from each individual electronic medical record. RESULTS: Nine of the thirty-one patients presented with VTE. Of the nine patients, there were twenty-two total clotted vessels, all of which were asymptomatic. The clinical pharmacist, as the coordinator for a multidisciplinary COVID-19 associated coagulopathy management team, drafted a screening and treatment protocol for anticoagulation prophylaxis and therapy of VTE after ultrasound findings. CONCLUSION: VTE screening of hospitalized COVID-19 patients reveals a significant number of asymptomatic VTEs and justifies diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment measures coordinated by a clinical pharmacist.","Gillespie, Laura; Khan, Rashid Z.; Stillson, John E.; Bunch, Connor M.; Shariff, Faisal Salim; Speybroeck, Jacob; Grisoli, Anne; Schmidt, Meredith Wierman; Phyu, Htay; Jablonski, Jason; Wells, Byars; Fulkerson, Daniel H.; Oancea, Lyndsay; Leiser, Abraham; Walsh, Mark",J Pharm Health Care Sci,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40780-021-00201-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795030/,351

We prospectively tracked relevant data from oncology clinical trials at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2020, including the number of open trials, new patient enrollments, in-person and virtual patient visits, dispensed investigational infusions, dispensed/shipped oral investigational agents, research biopsies, and blood samples. We ascertained why patients came off trials and determined on-site clinical research staffing levels. We used two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests to assess the statistical significance of the reported changes. Nearly all patients on interventional treatment trials were maintained, and new enrollments continued at just under half the pre-pandemic rate. The median number of investigational prescriptions shipped to patients increased from 0-74 (range: 22-107) per week from March-June 2020. The median number of telemedicine appointments increased from 0-107 (range: 33-267) per week from March-June 2020. Research biopsies and blood collections decreased dramatically after DFCI implemented COVID-19-related policies in March 2020. The number of research nurses and clinical research coordinators on-site also decreased after March 2020. Substantial changes were required to safely continue clinical research during the pandemic; yet, we observed no increases in serious adverse events or major violations related to drug dosing. Lessons learned from adapting research practices during COVID-19 can inform industry sponsors and governmental agencies to consider altering practices to increase operational efficiency and convenience for patients.","Tolaney, Sara M; Lydon, Christine A; Li, Tianyu; Dai, Jiale; Standring, Andrea; Legor, Kristen A; Caparrotta, Caryn M; Schenker, Matthew P; Glazer, Daniel I; Tayob, Nabihah; DuBois, Steven G; Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A; Taplin, Mary-Ellen; Johnson, Bruce E",J Natl Cancer Inst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959883/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaa144,351

Methods A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel, positive-controlled trial included 72 CCWHS patients was performed. The participants were randomly assigned to two groups, Reduqing (RDQ) group and Lianhuaqingwen (LHQW) group, in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in RDQ group received Reduqing granules and dummy Lianhuaqingwen capsules three times a day and patients in LHQW group received Lianhuaqingwen capsules and dummy Reduqing granules three times daily. The duration of treatment and follow-up were four days. Results There were no statistically significant differences in total markedly effective rate and total effective rate between RDQ group and LHQW group after treatment. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptom score was significantly reduced after treatment in RDQ group, as well as in LHQW group. However, the difference of change in TCM symptom score between two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences between two groups in the median time to fever relief [RDQ group (4 ± 8) h vs LHQW group (4 ± 5) h] or the median time to fever clearance (RDQ group 47 h vs LHQW 36 h). No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Conclusion Compared with Lianhuaqingwen capsules, Reduqing granules achieved similar therapeutic effect in the treatment of CCWHS and no drug-related adverse events were reported during the study. Therefore, Reduqing granules might be effective and safe in the treatment of CCWHS.","Yanjiao, Ma; Zhongyi, Zhang; Lianbo, Wei; Shuai, He; Xun, Deng; Aimin, Ji; Benjie, Zhou; Deqi, Jiang; Mingxing, Li; Yong, Wang",Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0254627217300432; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0254627217300432,351

A detailed analysis of the electron spin resonance spectra from spin-labeled phospholipids revealed that the major effect of the peptide on the dynamic membrane structure is to induce highly ordered membrane domains that are associated with electrostatic interactions between the peptide and negatively charged lipids. Two highly conserved residues in the peptide were identified as being important for the membrane ordering effect. Aggregation of large unilamellar vesicles induced by the peptide was also found to be correlated with the membrane ordering effect of the peptide, indicating that an increase in membrane ordering, i.e., membrane dehydration, is important for vesicle aggregation. The possibility that hydrophobic interaction between the highly ordered membrane domains plays a role in vesicle aggregation and viral fusion is discussed.","Ge, Mingtao; Freed, Jack H.",Biophysical Journal,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3010018?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2010.11.014; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349510013834; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21190660/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349510013834,351

We conducted a retrospective review of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients requiring oxygen who received these drugs. OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential efficacy and safety of theophylline and pentoxifylline in COVID‐19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: Adults with a positive test for SARS‐COV2 and were hospitalized due to pneumonia requiring either high flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation were included. Patients with a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were preferentially given theophylline. All other patients received pentoxifylline 400 mg orally TID. A group of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients receiving standard of care acted as a comparison group. The coprimary outcomes were a change in C‐reactive protein (CRP) and ROX score between groups from day 1 to day 4 of therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred and nine inpatients were reviewed. Fifty‐eight patients received pentoxifylline/theophylline, with 151 patients serving as the comparison group. Active therapy was associated with an increase in the ROX score (mean: 2.9 (95% CI: 0.6, 5.1)) and decrease in CRP (mean: −0.7 (95% CI: −4.7, 3.2). Mortality rates were theophylline/pentoxifylline 24% and comparison group had a 26%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, theophylline and pentoxifylline were associated with an increase in ROX score and nominal decreases in CRP and mortality. Treatment was safe with few adverse reactions documented. We believe that this study could the basis for randomized‐controlled trials to further explore these drugs’ role in COVID‐19.","Wall, Geoffrey C.; Smith, Hayden L.; Trump, Matthew W.; Mohr, Jason D.; DuMontier, Samuel P.; Sabates, Becca L.; Ganapathiraju, Iaswarya; Kable, Tim J.",Clin Respir J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33735520/; https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13363,351

In the present study, a retrospective analysis was performed in a cohort of 306 confirmed COVID‐19 patients admitted to Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 10 to March 15, 2020. Whole blood levels of essential and/or toxic metal(loid)s were analyzed, including magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, thallium, and lead according to the disease severity and outcome. Compared to the non‐severe COVID‐19 patients, severe cases showed significant higher levels of whole blood calcium, chromium, and copper, but lower levels of magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, arsenic, thallium, and lead. These differences were further found consistently across the clinical course since the disease onset by longitudinal analysis. Among the severe patients, chromium and cadmium were higher in the deceased group compared to the recovered group, while arsenic was lower. Whole blood iron, age, and sex were determined to be independent factors associated with the disease severity, while chromium, cadmium, and the comorbidity of cardiovascular disease were determined to be independent factors associated with the mortality. These results suggest that variations of whole blood metal(loid)s may be associated with the severe illness and fatal outcome of COVID‐19, which could be persistently monitored and would be helpful in the evaluation of the dynamic changes in patients with COVID‐19.","Zeng, Hao‐Long; Yang, Qing; Yuan, Peihong; Wang, Xu; Cheng, Liming",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577131/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202002346rr,351

Globally, intense efforts are going on to discover a vaccine or new drug molecules to control the COVID‐19. However, till today, there is no effective therapeutics or treatment available for COVID‐19. In this study, we aim to find out potential small molecule inhibitors for SARS‐CoV‐2 main protease (M(pro)) from the known DrugBank database version 5.1.8. We applied structure‐based virtual screening of the database containing 11875 numbers of drug candidates to identify potential hits for SARS‐CoV‐2 M(pro) inhibitors. Seven potential inhibitors having admirable XP glide score ranging from −15.071 to −8.704 kcal/mol and good binding affinity with the active sites amino acids of M(pro) were identified. The selected hits were further analyzed with 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to examine the stability of protein‐ligand complexes. The root mean square deviation and potential energy plot indicates the stability of the complexes during the 50 ns MD simulation. The MM‐GBSA analysis also showed good binding energy of the selected hits (−83.2718 to −58.6618 kcal/mol). Further analysis revealed critical hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between compounds and the target protein.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Swedish population-based cohort including 29 955 participants. EXPOSURES: Cardiometabolic risk factors assessed between 2014 and 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19, as registered in nationwide registers from 31 January 2020 through 12 September 2020. Associations of cardiometabolic risk factors with the outcome were assessed using logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, birthplace and education. RESULTS: Mean (SD) age was 61.2 (4.5) and 51.5% were women. 69 participants experienced hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19. Examples of statistically significant associations between baseline factors and subsequent hospitalisation or death due to COVID-19 included overweight (adjusted OR (aOR) vs normal weight 2.73 (95% CI 1.25 to 5.94)), obesity (aOR vs normal weight 4.09 (95% CI 1.82 to 9.18)), pre-diabetes (aOR vs normoglycaemia 2.56 (95% CI 1.44 to 4.55)), diabetes (aOR vs normoglycaemia 3.96 (95% CI 2.13 to 7.36)), sedentary time (aOR per hour/day increase 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.17)), grade 2 hypertension (aOR vs normotension 2.44 (95% CI 1.10 to 5.44)) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (aOR per mmol/L increase 0.33 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.65)).

The occurrence and the diversity of swine PV were therefore investigated in pig slurry collected in Italy, to contribute towards filling this gap in knowledge. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty‐two slurry samples underwent analysis by nested PCR and DNA sequencing using published and newly designed specific primer pairs for Sus scrofa papillomavirus (SsPV) type 1 and 2 (SsPV1 and 2), along with degenerate PV‐specific primers targeting the major coat protein L1 and the helicase protein E1. Overall, three samples (13·6%) were positive for SsPV1 by specific primers, and nucleotide (nt) sequences showed 99–100% nt identity with SsPV1 variant a (EF395818), while SsPV2 was not found in any sample. Using generic primers, eight samples (36·4%) were tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV), and were characterized as follows: β1‐HPV8, β1‐HPV14, β1‐HPV206, β2‐HPV113, β2‐HPV120 and γ1‐HPV173. Moreover, one unclassified γ‐type was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Both swine and human PVs were detected in pig slurry in this study. The unexpected presence of HPV in pig waste could be explained as the result of an improper use of the sewage collection pits and/or with improper procedures of the operators.

METHODS: The internal and external attributes affecting the vaccination rollout identifed by reviewing the scientific literature, government guidelines, and press statements, along with media reports, were categorized into the SWOT matrix. RESULTS: The existing immunization program, indigenous vaccine production, setting up of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19, updated guidelines, and training followed by dry runs were identified as strengths. The weaknesses identified in the program were knowledge gap about vaccines, apprehensions, lack of temperature loggers and vaccine vial monitors, space contraints in health care set up, demand supply gap, and digital divide. The experience of conducting the general elections, intersectoral coordination forged during the pandemic response, Information Technology platform, and vaccine eagerness present opportunities to strengthen the program. The emergence of virus variants, commercial interests, laxity in COVID-19 appropriate behavior, and receding wave of the pandemic can pose significant threats to the implementation of the vaccination campaign. CONCLUSION: The study identified factors that can aid designing effective measures and countermeasures for the COVID-19 vaccination rollout.

652069,Prevalence and Persistent Shedding of Fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Patients With COVID-19 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021-04-09,"Background: Every year, millions of people are hospitalized and thousands die from influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection. Most cases of hospitalizations and death occur among the elderly. Many of these elderly patients are reliant on medical treatment of underlying chronic diseases, such as arthritis, diabetes, and hypertension. We hypothesized that the commonly prescribed medicines for treatment of underlying chronic diseases can affect host responses to FLUAV infection and thus contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine whether commonly prescribed medicines could affect host responses to virus infection in vitro. Methods: We first identified 45 active compounds from a list of commonly prescribed medicines. Then, we constructed a drug–target interaction network and identified the potential implication of these interactions for FLUAV–host cell interplay. Finally, we tested the effect of 45 drugs on the viability, transcription, and metabolism of mock- and FLUAV-infected human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Results: In silico drug–target interaction analysis revealed that drugs such as atorvastatin, candesartan, and hydroxocobalamin could target and modulate FLUAV–host cell interaction. In vitro experiments showed that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these compounds affected the transcription and metabolism of FLUAV- and mock-infected cells. Conclusion: Many commonly prescribed drugs were found to modulate FLUAV–host cell interactions in silico and in vitro and could therefore affect their interplay in vivo, thus contributing to the morbidity and mortality of patients with influenza virus infections.","Ianevski, Aleksandr; Yao, Rouan; Zusinaite, Eva; Lysvand, Hilde; Oksenych, Valentyn; Tenson, Tanel; Bjørås, Magnar; Kainov, Denis",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452402/,351

An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on substance use, sociodemographic and psychosocial variables. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses showed that street-connected adolescents in Ghana reported higher prevalence of lifetime alcohol use and past-month alcohol use than those in South Africa. The protective effect of male gender was not observed in South Africa but significantly more pronounced in Ghana for all substances except past-month marijuana use. Sexual assault, indirect sexual victimization, physical beating, robbery, assault with a weapon and survival sex increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use and past-month alcohol use in Ghana. However, in South Africa, only robbery and assault with a weapon increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use while robbery and sexual assault increased the odds of past-month alcohol use.

Irreversible retinal damage can occur if the exposure to the safe doses is >5 years. It is not known whether exposure to high doses over a short period of time can also cause the damage. We recommend that before prescribing CQ or HCQ, history of ocular disease should be obtained to avoid the prescription if appropriate. If either agent is to be used, routine baseline ocular examination is not absolutely necessary. Patients who do not have ocular disease should also be informed about the potential risk of retinal toxicity. Both agents, however, have not yet been proven to be beneficial to COVID-19.","Ruamviboonsuk, Paisan; Lai, Timothy Y. Y.; Chang, Andrew; Lai, Chi-Chun; Mieler, William F; Lam, Dennis S.

However, with limited understanding of the effects of COVID-19 during pregnancy, clinicians and patients are forced to make uninformed decisions. OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the literature and report the maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY: PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched from November 1(st), 2019 and March 28(th), 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: Primary studies, reported in English, investigating COVID-19-positive pregnant women and reporting their pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data in relation to clinical presentation, investigation were maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted and analysed using summary statistics. Hypothesis testing was performed to examine differences in time-to-delivery. Study quality was assessed using the ICROMS tool. MAIN RESULTS: Of 73 identified articles, nine were eligible for inclusion (n = 92). 67.4% (62/92) of women were symptomatic at presentation. RT-PCR was inferior to CT-based diagnosis in 31.7% (26/79) of cases. Maternal mortality rate was 0% and only one patient required intensive care and ventilation. 63.8% (30/47) had preterm births, 61.1% (11/18) fetal distress and 80% (40/50) a Caesarean section. 76.92% (11/13) of neonates required NICU admission and 42.8% (40/50) had a low birth weight. There was one indeterminate case of potential vertical transmission. Mean time-to-delivery was 4.3±3.08 days (n = 12) with no difference in outcomes (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-positive pregnant women present with fewer symptoms than the general population and may be RT-PCR negative despite having signs of viral pneumonia. The incidence of preterm births, low birth weight, C-section, NICU admission appear higher than the general population.","Smith, Vinayak; Seo, Densearn; Warty, Ritesh; Payne, Olivia; Salih, Mohamed; Chin, Ken Lee; Ofori-Asenso, Richard; Krishnan, Sathya; da Silva Costa, Fabricio; Vollenhoven, Beverley; Wallace, Euan",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497090/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234187,351

658416,Current Evidence of the Pharmacological Treatments for Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) A Scoping Review,2020-05-18,"BACKGROUND: Since the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019, the scientific and public health community around the world have sought to better understand, surveil, treat, and prevent the disease, COVID-19. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many countries responded aggressively and decisively with lockdown measures and border closures. Such actions may have helped prevent large outbreaks throughout much of the region, though there is substantial variation in caseloads and mortality between nations. Additionally, the health system infrastructure remains a concern throughout much of SSA, and the lockdown measures threaten to increase poverty and food insecurity for the subcontinent’s poorest residents. The lack of sufficient testing, asymptomatic infections, and poor reporting practices in many countries limit our understanding of the virus’s impact, creating a need for better and more accurate surveillance metrics that account for underreporting and data contamination. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to improve infectious disease surveillance by complementing standardized metrics with new and decomposable surveillance metrics of COVID-19 that overcome data limitations and contamination inherent in public health surveillance systems. In addition to prevalence of observed daily and cumulative testing, testing positivity rates, morbidity, and mortality, we derived COVID-19 transmission in terms of speed, acceleration or deceleration, change in acceleration or deceleration (jerk), and 7-day transmission rate persistence, which explains where and how rapidly COVID-19 is transmitting and quantifies shifts in the rate of acceleration or deceleration to inform policies to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 and food insecurity in SSA. METHODS: We extracted 60 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries and employed an empirical difference equation to measure daily case numbers in 47 sub-Saharan countries as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa have the most observed cases of COVID-19, and the Seychelles, Eritrea, Mauritius, Comoros, and Burundi have the fewest. In contrast, the speed, acceleration, jerk, and 7-day persistence indicate rates of COVID-19 transmissions differ from observed cases. In September 2020, Cape Verde, Namibia, Eswatini, and South Africa had the highest speed of COVID-19 transmissions at 13.1, 7.1, 3.6, and 3 infections per 100,0000, respectively; Zimbabwe had an acceleration rate of transmission, while Zambia had the largest rate of deceleration this week compared to last week, referred to as a jerk. Finally, the 7-day persistence rate indicates the number of cases on September 15, 2020, which are a function of new infections from September 8, 2020, decreased in South Africa from 216.7 to 173.2 and Ethiopia from 136.7 to 106.3 per 100,000. The statistical approach was validated based on the regression results; they determined recent changes in the pattern of infection, and during the weeks of September 1-8 and September 9-15, there were substantial country differences in the evolution of the SSA pandemic. This change represents a decrease in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a de-escalation in the pandemic for the sub-Saharan African continent in general. CONCLUSIONS: Standard surveillance metrics such as daily observed new COVID-19 cases or deaths are necessary but insufficient to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 transmission. Public health leaders also need to know where COVID-19 transmission rates are accelerating or decelerating, whether those rates increase or decrease over short time frames because the pandemic can quickly escalate, and how many cases today are a function of new infections 7 days ago. Even though SSA is home to some of the poorest countries in the world, development and population size are not necessarily predictive of COVID-19 transmission, meaning higher income countries like the United States can learn from African countries on how best to implement mitigation and prevention efforts.

Although SARS-CoV-2 differs in many respects from HIV-1, the same technology displays regions with a high base order-dependent folding energy component, which are also highly conserved. This indicates structural invariance (SI) sustained by natural selection. While the regions are often also protein-encoding (e. g.

Host defense against IA relies on lung-infiltrating neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Here, we demonstrate that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are prototypically antiviral cells, participate in innate immune crosstalk underlying mucosal antifungal immunity. Aspergillus-infected murine Mo-DCs and neutrophils recruited pDCs to the lung by releasing the CXCR3 ligands, CXCL9 and CXCL10, in a Dectin-1 and Card9- and type I and III interferon signaling-dependent manner, respectively. During aspergillosis, circulating pDCs entered the lung in response to CXCR3-dependent signals. Via targeted pDC ablation, we found that pDCs were essential for host defense in the presence of normal neutrophil and Mo-DC numbers. Although interactions between pDC and fungal cells were not detected, pDCs regulated neutrophil NADPH oxidase activity and conidial killing. Thus, pDCs act as positive feedback amplifiers of neutrophil effector activity against inhaled mold conidia.","Guo, Yahui; Kasahara, Shinji; Jhingran, Anupam; Tosini, Nicholas L.; Zhai, Bing; Aufiero, Mariano A.; Mills, Kathleen A.M.; Gjonbalaj, Mergim; Espinosa, Vanessa; Rivera, Amariliz; Luster, Andrew D.; Hohl, Tobias M.",Cell Host Microbe,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312820302535; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312820302535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32485165/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.05.002,351

The optimum management of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 remains uncertain. MATERIAL/METHODS: We conducted a multicenter cohort study of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in Saudi Arabia. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to study predictors of graft and patient outcomes at 28 days after coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 130 kidney transplant recipients, with a mean age of 48.7(±14.4) years. Fifty-nine patients were managed at home with daily follow-up utilizing a dedicated clinic, while 71 (54.6%) required hospital admission. Acute kidney injury occurred in 35 (26.9%) patients. Secondary infections occurred in 38 (29.2%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing was carried out in 84 patients, of whom 70 tested positive for IgG and/or IgM. Fourteen patients died (10.8%). A multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age, creatinine at presentation, acute kidney injury, and use of azithromycin were significantly associated with worse patient survival. Graft loss was associated with requiring renal replacement therapy and development of secondary infections. CONCLUSIONS: Despite kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection having higher rate of hospital admission and mortality compared to the general population, a significant number of them can be managed using a telemedicine clinic. Most kidney transplant patients seem to mount an antibody response following coronavirus disease 2019 infection, and it remains to be seen if they will have a similar response to the incoming vaccines.","Alshaqaq, Ali; Al Abadi, Abdulnaser; Altheaby, Abdulrahman; Bukhari, Mohammed A.; Nasrallah, Basil; Alamoudi, Alaa; Arabi, Ziad; Alhejaili, Fayez; Saad, Khalid Bin; Busbaih, Ahmed; Idris, Mohammed Abdelrahim; Askandarani, Sumayah; AlBugami, Meteb M.; Alotaibi, Fahad E.; Hamawi, Khaled; Akkari, Khalid Bel’eed",Ann Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083502/; https://doi.org/10.12659/aot.931832,351

In this study, we investigated the prevalence of job burnout among medical staff in Liaoning province, China; performed a survey of subjective perception ranking for the main stressors among respondents; estimated the effect of stresses from work tasks and the relationship with patients on job burnout in order to provide improved strategy and suggestion for hospital administrators. METHODS: The respondents were from 8 hospitals in 3 cities in Liaoning province, China. Data were collected and analyzed including the following sections: (1) demographic characteristics; (2) work situations; (3) ranking of six stressors; (4) job burnout scale; (5) effort-reward imbalance scale; (6) work violence scale; (7) fear of malpractice scale. A total of 1056 individuals became the study objects. A statistical analysis and hierarchical linear regression analysis were performed to explore the prevalence of burnout and the effects of stressors. RESULTS: The prevalence of job burnout was 20.5, and 72.9% of all respondents reported a least one symptom of burnout. The respondents who were male, 30–39 years old, had a master’s degree or high and working hours > 60 h per week, came from obstetrics and gynecology or pediatrics profession prone to job burnout. The relationship with patients and work tasks are the top two ranking stressors in the subjective perception survey. Regression analysis showed that the relationship with patients explained 19.2, 16.8 and 2.0% of variance in burnout subscales EE, DP and PA, respectively and work tasks explained 23.5, 16.0 and 5.24% of variance in burnout subscales EE, DP and PA, respectively. CONCLUSION: The Chinese medical staff had high prevalence of job burnout. Some factors of demographic and work situations were associated with job burnout. The medical staff considered the relationship with patients and work tasks are the two major stressors. These two stressors are also the major indicators associated with job burnout. The hospital administrators should be aware of the risk of burnout.

They provide an effective way to address the imbalance between teaching supply and demand for older adults. However, few studies have investigated which factors contribute to older adults’ intention to use mobile social media for learning. This study uses a sequential explanatory mixed method to investigate the factors impacting older Chinese adults’ adoption of mobile social media for learning. Results of the quantitative phase indicated that Technology Anxiety (TA), Self-efficacy (SE), Previous Experience (PE), and Subjective Norm (SN) had significant effects on Perceived Usefulness (PU). TA, SE, PE, and Facilitating Conditions (FC) had significant effects on Perceived Ease of Use (PEU). PU and PEU are significant predictors of Behavioral Intention (BI), and PEU had a positive effect on PU. In the qualitative study, the significant effects of these extension factors on PU and/or PEU were investigated further. Perceptions and concerns about using mobile social media for learning were analyzed based on the participants’ interview data. On the basis of these results, recommendations are made to promote the use of mobile social media for learning by older adults. Specifically, teachers and colleges should: (a) select appropriate social media applications and set up relevant courses, and (b) supply inexpensive network service and high-quality learning support service.

Between 6 and 10 March 2020, several MGEs related to the Falles festival took place in Borriana, a municipality in the province of Castellon (Spain). The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 and its association with these MGEs, and to quantify the potential risk factors of its occurrence. METHODS: During May and June 2020, a population-based retrospective cohort study was carried out by the Public Health Center of Castelló and the Hospital de la Plana in Vila-real. Participants were obtained from a representative sample of 1663 people with potential exposure at six MGEs. A questionnaire survey was carried out to obtain information about attendance at MGEs and COVID-19 disease. In addition, a serologic survey of antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 was implemented. Inverse probability weighted regression was used in the statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1338 subjects participated in the questionnaire survey (80.5%), 997 of whom undertook the serologic survey. Five hundred and seventy cases were observed with an attack rate (AR) of 42.6%; average age was 36 years, 62.3% were female, 536 cases were confirmed by laboratory tests, and 514 cases were found with SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Considering MGE exposure, AR was 39.2% (496/1264). A dose-response relationship was found between MGE attendance and the disease, (adjusted relative risk [aRR] = 4.11 95% confidence interval [CI]3.25–5.19). Two MGEs with a dinner and dance in the same building had higher risks. Associated risk factors with the incidence were older age, obesity, and upper and middle class versus lower class; current smoking was protective. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests the significance of MGEs in the COVID-19 transmission that could explain the subsequent outbreak in Borriana.","Domènech-Montoliu, Salvador; Pac-Sa, Maria Rosario; Vidal-Utrillas, Paula; Latorre-Poveda, Marta; Del Rio-González, Alba; Ferrando-Rubert, Sara; Ferrer-Abad, Gema; Sánchez-Urbano, Manuel; Aparisi-Esteve, Laura; Badenes-Marques, Gema; Cervera-Ferrer, Belén; Clerig-Arnau, Ursula; Dols-Bernad, Claudia; Fontal-Carcel, Maria; Gomez-Lanas, Lorna; Jovani-Sales, David; León-Domingo, Maria Carmen; Llopico-Vilanova, Maria Dolores; Moros-Blasco, Mercedes; Notari-Rodríguez, Cristina; Ruíz-Puig, Raquel; Valls-López, Sonia; Arnedo-Pena, Alberto",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34437628/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256747,351

Primary outcomes of the analysis were postoperative mortality for all patients and amputation rates only in those COVID-19 patients suffering from acute lower limb ischemia. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of the disease among admitted COVID-19 patients, and any possible correlation between inflammatory parameters, thrombolytic status, and the presence of acute ischemia or DVT. RESULTS: We observed 38 patients (28 male) with severe COVID-19 infection (6 with lower limb arterial thrombosis and 32 with DVT). The median age was 64 years (range 30-94 years). In the arterial group, 3 had thrombosis on plaque and 3 on healthy arteries (""simple"" arterial thrombosis). All underwent operative or hybrid (open/endo) revascularization; 1 patient died from major organ failure (MOF) and one patient underwent major amputation. In the DVT group, 9 (28%) patients died from MOF, despite aggressive medical therapy. In patients with ""simple"" arterial thrombosis and those with DVT, we observed a decrease in inflammatory parameters (CRP) and in D-dimer and fibrinogen after aggressive therapy (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that critically ill, COVID-19 patients who develop arterial and deep vein thrombosis are at high risk of mortality, but if treated properly, there is an improvement in overall survival rate, especially in patients of 60 years of age or younger.","Bozzani, Antonio; Arici, Vittorio; Tavazzi, Guido; Franciscone, Mila Maria; Danesino, Vittorio; Rota, Monica; Rossini, Rosa; Sterpetti, Antonio V.; Ticozzelli, Giulia; Rumi, Elisa; Mojoli, Francesco; Bruno, Raffaele; Ragni, Franco",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.09.009; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606020306127?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039110/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039606020306127,351

AIM: To explore patterns of mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for palliative care, service planning and research. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis and population-based modelling of routine data. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All deaths registered in England and Wales between 7 March and 15 May 2020. We described the following mortality categories by age, gender and place of death: (1) baseline deaths (deaths that would typically occur in a given period); (2) COVID-19 deaths and (3) additional deaths not directly attributed to COVID-19. We estimated the proportion of people who died from COVID-19 who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic using simple modelling with explicit assumptions. RESULTS: During the first 10 weeks of the pandemic, there were 101,614 baseline deaths, 41,105 COVID-19 deaths and 14,520 additional deaths. Deaths in care homes increased by 220%, while home and hospital deaths increased by 77% and 90%, respectively. Hospice deaths fell by 20%. Additional deaths were among older people (86% aged ⩾ 75 years), and most occurred in care homes (56%) and at home (43%). We estimate that 22% (13%–31%) of COVID-19 deaths occurred among people who might have been in their last year of life in the absence of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in palliative care needs.

We use qualitative data from the Healthy Neighborhoods Study to illustrate how rising and unaffordable housing costs are experienced by residents in municipalities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. We then predict municipal-level COVID-19 case rates as a function of home value increases and housing cost burden prevalence among low-income households, controlling for previously identified community-level risk factors. We find that housing value increase predicts higher COVID-19 case rates, but that associations are ameliorated in areas with higher home values.

To date, however, there has been no report describing the regulation of JE progression using immunomodulatory tools for developing therapeutic strategies. We tested whether blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway would regulate JE progression using murine JE model. METHODS: Infected wild-type and 4-1BB-knockout (KO) mice were examined daily for mortality and clinical signs, and neuroinflammation in the CNS was evaluated by infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes and cytokine expression. In addition, viral burden, JEV-specific T cell, and type I/II IFN (IFN-I/II) innate responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway significantly increased resistance to JE and reduced viral burden in extraneural tissues and the CNS, rather than causing a detrimental effect. In addition, treatment with 4-1BB agonistic antibody exacerbated JE. Furthermore, JE amelioration and reduction of viral burden by blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway were associated with an increased frequency of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells as well as increased infiltration of mature Ly-6C(hi) monocytes in the inflamed CNS. More interestingly, DCs and macrophages derived from 4-1BB KO mice showed potent and rapid IFN-I innate immune responses upon JEV infection, which was coupled to strong induction of PRRs (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF7), and antiviral ISG genes (ISG49, ISG54, ISG56). Further, the ablation of 4-1BB signaling enhanced IFN-I innate responses in neuron cells, which likely regulated viral spread in the CNS. Finally, we confirmed that blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway in myeloid cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) played a dominant role in ameliorating JE. In support of this finding, HSC-derived leukocytes played a dominant role in generating the IFN-I innate responses in the host. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking the 4-1BB signaling pathway ameliorates JE via divergent enhancement of IFN-II-producing NK and CD4(+) Th1 cells and mature Ly-6C(hi) monocyte infiltration, as well as an IFN-I innate response of myeloid-derived cells. Therefore, regulation of the 4-1BB signaling pathway with antibodies or inhibitors could be a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of JE.","Kim, Seong Bum; Choi, Jin Young; Kim, Jin Hyoung; Uyangaa, Erdenebelig; Patil, Ajit Mahadev; Park, Sang-Youel; Lee, John Hwa; Kim, Koanhoi; Han, Young Woo; Eo, Seong Kug",J Neuroinflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597582/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0438-x,351

674213,"Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Outcomes of Pneumomediastinum in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Case-Control Study",2021,"Purpose Patients with COVID-19 show variable clinical course; transplant patients often show worse outcomes. The effect of COVID-19 on the allograft and the sources of tissue injury that contribute to such poor outcomes are poorly defined. This study leverages cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to measure allograft injury as donor-derived cfDNA (ddcfDNA) and injury from different tissue types using tissue-specific DNA methylomic signatures. Methods 14 consecutive COVID-19 transplant patients (8 Kidney, 3 Lung, 1 Heart, 1 Liver, and one multi-organ transplant patients) and 30 healthy controls were included. Plasma nuclear cfDNA (ncfDNA) and mitochondrial cfDNA (mtcfDNA) level were measured via digital droplet PCR, and ddcfDNA using AlloSure (CareDx). cfDNA whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was performed to identify cfDNA tissues of origin leveraging tissue specific DNA methylomes and deconvolution algorithm. Results 75% of the COVID-19 transplant patients showed high ddcfDNA level compared to published quiescent values, including all lung, 50% of the kidney, liver and multi-organ transplant patients (8.5, 4.4, 30 and 16-X fold change, respectively). Total ncfDNA and mtcfDNA were 15X and 310X higher in COVID-19 transplant patients compared to controls, respectively; < 0.0001.The predominant tissues contributing to cfDNA were hematopoietic cells (80%) (Figure). More importantly, COVID-19 transplant patients showed 10 to 100 fold higher tissue specific cfDNA derived from monocyte, neutrophil, erythroblast, vascular endothelium, adipocyte, hepatocyte, kidney, heart and lung compared to controls. Analysis comparing cfDNA in transplant and non-transplant COVID-19 patients is on-going. Conclusion The allograft undergoes significant injury following COVID-19. Further, cfDNA from multiple tissue types is significantly higher in COVID-19 transplant patients. Future studies in a larger cohorts of transplant and non-transplant patients are needed to elucidate why transplant patients show worse COVID-19 outcomes.","Andargie, T.

674853,Association of “initial CT” findings with mortality in older patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020-06-10,"Due to changes in the livestock sector and the rise of consumer demand for comprehensive and integrated food security and safety, there has been a concern on the use of farm data in enhancing animal traceability and decision-making by farmers and other decision-makers in the livestock sector. To ensure high production through effective decision-making and auditable standards, producers are required to have better traceability and record systems. Therefore, this study aimed at (1) reviewing the current recording/data management and animal traceability systems used by small-scale farmers in developing countries and (2) analyzing how data management systems should be designed to enhance efficient decision-making and animal traceability from farm to fork. This study found that, still, a majority of small-scale farmers do not keep records leading to poor decision-making on the farm and policymaking. We also found that those who keep records do not store their data in electronic format, which again poses another challenge in data analysis. Moreover, this study found that the majority of traceability tools used by farmers in developing countries do not meet international standards based on tools they use for tracing animals; farmers were reported to use tools like branding and ear tagging, which provide very little information about the animal. Such tools lack the capability to keep track of useful information about an animal, e.g., information about feeding and animal health. In conclusion, this study recommended a better electronic system to be used at the farm level to facilitate data analysis, hence promoting informed decision-making and adherence to the international animal traceability standards. Otherwise, there is a need for researchers to conduct more studies in developing different analytical models for exploring on-farm data in order to improve the decision-making process by farmers and other stakeholders.","Mwanga, G.; Mbega, E.; Yonah, Z.; Chagunda, M.

676513,Recovering Coronavirus Disease Patients in the Active Duty Military Population: A Review of Current Evidence and Special Considerations for Uniformed Providers,2021-06-24,"Coronaviruses are a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses that includes important pathogens of humans and other animals. The large coronavirus genome (26–31 kb) encodes 15–16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that are derived from two replicase polyproteins by autoproteolytic processing. The nsps assemble into the viral replication–transcription complex and nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 are believed to anchor this enzyme complex to modified intracellular membranes. The largest part of the coronavirus nsp4 subunit is hydrophobic and is predicted to be embedded in the membranes. In this report, a conserved C-terminal domain (∼100 amino-acid residues) has been delineated that is predicted to face the cytoplasm and has been isolated as a soluble domain using library-based construct screening. A prototypical crystal structure at 2.8 Å resolution was obtained using nsp4 from feline coronavirus. Unmodified and SeMet-substituted proteins were crystallized under similar conditions, resulting in tetragonal crystals that belonged to space group P4(3). The phase problem was initially solved by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS), followed by molecular replacement using a SIRAS-derived composite model. The structure consists of a single domain with a predominantly α-helical content displaying a unique fold that could be engaged in protein–protein interactions.","Manolaridis, Ioannis; Wojdyla, Justyna A.; Panjikar, Santosh; Snijder, Eric J.; Gorbalenya, Alexander E.; Berglind, Hanna; Nordlund, Pär; Coutard, Bruno; Tucker, Paul A.",Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,https://doi.org/10.1107/s0907444909018253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19622868/,351

To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi.

The types of infections that occur in PIDD patients are largely dictated by the nature of the immune deficiency, which can be defined by dysfunction of cellular or humoral defenses. An increasing number of PIDDs, including those with both cellular and humoral defects, have antibody deficiency as a major feature and can benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy as a result. In fact, the most common PIDDs worldwide are antibody deficiencies and include common variable immunodeficiency, congenital agammaglobulinemia, hyper IgM syndrome, specific antibody deficiency, and Good syndrome. While immunoglobulin replacement therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for the majority of these conditions, a thorough understanding of the specific infections for which these patients are at increased risk can hasten diagnosis and guide additional therapies. Moreover, the infection trends in some PIDD patients with profound defects of cellular immunity, such as autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (Job’s/Buckley’s Syndrome) or dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency, suggest that select patients might benefit from immunoglobulin replacement therapy even if their immune deficiency is not limited to antibody defects.

METHODS: Observational studies in COVID‐19 patients reporting data on raised body mass index at admission and associated clinical outcomes were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library up to 16 May 2020. Mean differences and relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were aggregated using random effects models. RESULTS: Eight retrospective cohort studies and one cohort prospective cohort study with data on of 4,920 patients with COVID‐19 were eligible. Comparing BMI ≥ 25 vs <25 kg/m(2), the RRs (95% CIs) of severe illness and mortality were 2.35 (1.43‐3.86) and 3.52 (1.32‐9.42), respectively. In a pooled analysis of three studies, the RR (95% CI) of severe illness comparing BMI > 35 vs <25 kg/m(2) was 7.04 (2.72‐18.20). High levels of statistical heterogeneity were partly explained by age; BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2) was associated with an increased risk of severe illness in older age groups (≥60 years), whereas the association was weaker in younger age groups (<60 years). CONCLUSIONS: Excess adiposity is a risk factor for severe disease and mortality in people with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. This was particularly pronounced in people 60 and older. The increased risk of worse outcomes from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in people with excess adiposity should be taken into account when considering individual and population risks and when deciding on which groups to target for public health messaging on prevention and detection measures.

The concentration resulting in 50% inhibition (IC(50,) 2 µM) was >35x higher than the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after oral administration of the approved dose of ivermectin when given fasted. Simulations were conducted using an available population pharmacokinetic model to predict total (bound and unbound) and unbound plasma concentration‐time profiles after a single and repeat fasted administration of the approved dose of ivermectin (200 μg/kg), 60 mg, and 120 mg. Plasma total Cmax was determined and then multiplied by the lung:plasma ratio reported in cattle to predict the lung Cmax after administration of each single dose. Plasma ivermectin concentrations of total (bound and unbound) and unbound concentrations do not reach the IC(50), even for a dose level 10x higher than the approved dose. Even with the high lung:plasma ratio, ivermectin is unlikely to reach the IC(50) in lungs after single oral administration of the approved dose (predicted lung: 0.0873 µM) or at doses 10x higher that the approved dose administered orally (predicted lung: 0.820 µM). In summary, the likelihood of a successful clinical trial using the approved dose of ivermectin is low. Combination therapy should be evaluated in vitro.

683726,High Monocyte-To-Lymphocyte Ratio Is Associated With Stroke-Associated Pneumonia,2020-10-06,China has been stockpiling international reserves at an extremely rapid pace since the late 1990s and has surpassed Japan to become the largest reserve holder in the world. This paper undertakes an empirical investigation to assess the extent of de facto sterilization and capital mobility using monthly data between mid 2000 and late 2008. We find that China has been able to successfully sterilize a large portion of these reserve increases thus making it a reserve sink such as Germany was under the Bretton Wood system.,"Ouyang, Alice Y.; Rajan, Ramkishen S.; Willett, Thomas D.",J Int Money Finance,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560609001387; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jimonfin.2009.12.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0261560609001387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287756/,351
686902,"Clinical and laboratory predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19: a cohort study in Wuhan, China",2020-05-03,"In the wake of dynamic economic and political transitions worldwide, the Institute of Medicine recently released its report advocating investments in global health from the United States (US). The expert panel reinforces the ‘transnational and interdisciplinary’ nature of global health research and practice as an endeavor ‘to improve health and achieve greater equity for all people worldwide.’ This report was judiciously timed given the growing recognition of global health, and is also acknowledged for incorporating themes that are particularly pertinent to the twenty-first century. New paradigms are introduced, denouncing the dichotomous distinction between rich and poor countries with the rapidly transitioning countries emerging as global powers, and affirming the need for models of respectful partnership and wider translation of science into practice. Cultivating sustainable partnerships and investing in the understanding and combat of diseases worldwide will become increasingly important for the US to maintain its global competitiveness, and may offer lessons in innovation, efficiency, and organization of institutions and human resources.","Ali, Mohammed K.; Venkat Narayan, K.M.",Glob Health Action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20027251/; https://doi.org/10.3402/gha.v2i0.2035,351
686984,Road toward rapid-molecular point of care test to detect novel SARS-coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): Review from updated literature,2020-07-01,"PURPOSE: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is increasingly reported in patients with influenza admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Classification of patients with influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) using the current definitions for invasive fungal diseases has proven difficult, and our aim was to develop case definitions for IAPA that can facilitate clinical studies. METHODS: A group of 29 international experts reviewed current insights into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of IAPA and proposed a case definition of IAPA through a process of informal consensus. RESULTS: Since IAPA may develop in a wide range of hosts, an entry criterion was proposed and not host factors. The entry criterion was defined as a patient requiring ICU admission for respiratory distress with a positive influenza test temporally related to ICU admission. In addition, proven IAPA required histological evidence of invasive septate hyphae and mycological evidence for Aspergillus. Probable IAPA required the detection of galactomannan or positive Aspergillus culture in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or serum with pulmonary infiltrates or a positive culture in upper respiratory samples with bronchoscopic evidence for tracheobronchitis or cavitating pulmonary infiltrates of recent onset. The IAPA case definitions may be useful to classify patients with COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA), while awaiting further studies that provide more insight into the interaction between Aspergillus and the SARS-CoV-2-infected lung. CONCLUSION: A consensus case definition of IAPA is proposed, which will facilitate research into the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of this emerging acute and severe Aspergillus disease, and may be of use to study CAPA.","Verweij, Paul E.; Rijnders, Bart J.
