7,"The 21st International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, Brussels, Belgium, 20-23 March 2001",2001-05-02,"The 21st International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The promise of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy and noninvasive ventilation were other areas of interest. Ethical issues also received attention. Overall, the 'state of the art' lectures, pro/con debates, seminars and tutorials were of a high standard. The meeting was marked by a sense of renewed enthusiasm that positive progress is occurring in intensive care medicine.","Ball, Jonathan; Venn, Richard",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC137274/,7

5663,"40th International Symposium on Intensive Care & Emergency Medicine: Brussels, Belgium. 24-27 March 2020",2020-03-24,"BACKGROUND: V. parahaemolyticus is autochthonous to the marine environment and causes seafood-borne gastroenteritis in humans. Generally, V. parahaemolyticus recovered from the environment and/or seafood is thought to be non-pathogenic and the relationship between environmental isolates and acute diarrhoeal disease is poorly understood. In this study, we explored the virulence potential of environmental V. parahaemolyticus isolated from water, plankton and assorted seafood samples collected from the Indian coast. RESULTS: Twenty-two V. parahaemolyticus isolates from seafood harboured virulence associated genes encoding the thermostable-direct haemolysin (TDH), TDH-related haemolysin (TRH), and Type 3 secretion systems (T3SS) and 95.5% of the toxigenic isolates had pandemic strain attributes (toxRS/new(+)). Nine serovars, with pandemic strain traits were newly identified and an O4:K36 tdh(−)trh(+)V. parahaemolyticus bearing pandemic marker gene was recognised for the first time. Results obtained by reverse transcription PCR showed trh, T3SS1 and T3SS2β to be functional in the seafood isolates. Moreover, the environmental strains were cytotoxic and could invade Caco-2 cells upon infection as well as induce changes to the tight junction protein, ZO-1 and the actin cytoskeleton. CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence that environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus are potentially invasive and capable of eliciting pathogenic characteristics typical of clinical strains and present a potential health risk. We also demonstrate that virulence of this pathogen is highly complex and hence draws attention for the need to investigate more reliable virulence markers in order to distinguish the environmental and clinical isolates, which will be crucial for the pathogenomics and control of this pathogen.","Meparambu Prabhakaran, Divya; Ramamurthy, Thandavarayan; Thomas, Sabu",BMC Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7092547/,7

The severity of gambling in Australia is characterised by unprecedented gambling expenditures and losses representing the highest gambling rates in the world, which has led to renewed interests in understanding the factors influencing gambling behaviours. We contribute to the debate on the determinants of gambling by providing the first study that examines the impact of ethnic diversity on gambling. Using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey, we find that ethnic diversity is positively associated with gambling. This result is robust to alternative estimation approaches, alternative ways of measuring ethnic diversity and irrespective of whether gambling is measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index, gambling expenditures or number of gambling activities. Our results also suggest stronger effects of ethnic diversity for problem gamblers compared to gamblers in other risk categories. These results support the need for policies that promote social capital in diverse communities to reduce the risks of social isolation, which is an important motivator of gambling behaviour.","Awaworyi Churchill, Sefa; Farrell, Lisa",J Gambl Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222045/,7
13222,Less daily oral hygiene is more in the ICU: yes,2020-10-10,"INTRODUCTION: Several clinical trials have demonstrated that low-level light therapy (LLLT), a method of photobiomodulation, is an effective analgetic treatment. However, the mechanism of action has not yet been finally clarified. In particular, unanswered questions include whether it only affects peripheral or whether it also affects the spinal or supraspinal level. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of low-level light therapy on primary and secondary hyperalgesia in a human pain model. METHODS: This study was planned as a randomized, sham-controlled, and double-blinded trial with repeated measures within subject design. Capsaicin was applied on both forearms of ten healthy volunteers to induce peripheral and central sensitization. One forearm was treated with low-level light therapy; the other served as sham control. RESULTS: Low-level light therapy significantly increased the mechanical pain threshold, heat pain threshold, and decreased pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that low-level light therapy is effective at reducing the heat and mechanical pain threshold in a human pain model, pointing to a significant modulating effect on peripheral and central sensitization. These effects—especially in the absence of reported side effects—make low-level light therapy a promising tool in pain management. The application of low-level light therapy to treat chronic pain should be considered for further clinical trials.","Lang-Illievich, Kordula; Winter, Raimund; Rumpold-Seitlinger, Gudrun; Schicho, Kurt; Dorn, Christian; Klivinyi, Christoph; Bornemann-Cimenti, Helmar",Pain Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7547817/,7

Both cytosine and adenine analogues (tC, tC(O), 2CNqA, and pA) were incorporated into a 16mer ASO sequence with a 3-10-3 cEt-DNA-cEt (cEt = constrained ethyl) gapmer design. In addition to a comprehensive photophysical characterization, we assess the label-induced effects on the gapmers’ RNA affinities, RNA-hybridized secondary structures, and knockdown efficiencies. Importantly, we find practically no perturbing effects for gapmers with single FBA incorporations in the biologically critical gap region and, except for pA, the FBAs do not affect the knockdown efficiencies. Incorporating two cytosine FBAs in the gap is equally well tolerated, while two adenine analogues give rise to slightly reduced knockdown efficiencies and what could be perturbed secondary structures. We furthermore show that the FBAs can be used to visualize gapmers inside live cells using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, enabling comparative assessment of their uptake. This altogether shows that FBAs are functional ASO probes that provide a minimally perturbing in-sequence labeling option for this highly relevant drug modality.","Nilsson, Jesper R.; Baladi, Tom; Gallud, Audrey; Baždarević, Dženita; Lemurell, Malin; Esbjörner, Elin K.; Wilhelmsson, L.

18984,"Characteristics of Deaths Among Individuals in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Detention Facilities, 2011-2018",2021-07-07,"BACKGROUND: Children receiving home medical care need special attention to prevent unexpected death. The aim of this study was to clarify the factors contributing to death in children receiving home medical care from the child death review database. METHODS: Children receiving home medical care were enrolled from the child death review database from 2014 to 2016 in Aichi prefecture, Japan, with a population of one million children. Types of medical care and factors contributing to death were examined. RESULTS: Of the 631 children who died, 40 children (6%) were receiving home medical care (21: tracheostomy; 19: ventilator; 26: suctioning of naso-oral secretions; 19: oxygen inhalation; 32: tube feeding; 6: urethral catheterization; and 1: peritoneal dialysis). The death rate was 50 times that in the general population of children. Ten children had contributory factors that seemed to be preventable. In four children, the families could not replace the tracheostomy tubes during an accident. In three, oxygen saturation or ventilator alarms were not set appropriately. In two, an oxygen cylinder became empty. One child fell down from a seat in a car. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of devices and correct guidance to caregivers may reduce the death rate in children receiving home medical care. IMPACT: Children receiving home medical care, such as tracheostomy care, mechanical ventilation, or tube feeding, need special attention to prevent unexpected death. In this population-based child death review, 6% of children received home medical care, and it was estimated that 1 of 100 children receiving home medical care died per year. One-quarter of the deaths could be preventable by caregiver education or development of devices.","Natsume, Jun; Numaguchi, Atsushi; Ohno, Atsuko; Mizuno, Mihoko; Takahashi, Yoshiyuki; Okumura, Akihisa; Yoshikawa, Tetsushi; Saitoh, Shinji; Miura, Kiyokuni; Noda, Masaharu",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8265292/,7

The oligonucleotide microarray is immobilized on the inner surface of the cap. A small vessel is placed in an Eppendorf tube for storing hybridization solutions. With the microarray system, the full biochemical processes, including gene fragment amplification, fluorescence labeling, hybridization, and fluorescence detection, have been performed in the sealed tube without opening the cap. The images are obtained from a fluorescence microscope and captured by a CCD, and the data are transported to a computer through the universal serial bus (USB). After noise reduction, signal intensity is determined from hybridization image and the presence of gene fragments is identified. The final data output includes sample information, process steps, and hybridization results. A lab-in-a-tube microarray system for detecting ten respiratory viruses at a single detection is designed.

23419,Highlights from the Current Issue – Audiovisual Summary,2014-08-01,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial Stewardship is a coordinated effort to improve and measure the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Antibiotic resistance is an emerging world health problem and unnecessary prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major contributor to this. Skin and soft-tissue infections are a common reason to receive a prescription for antibiotics. Currently there exists a trend for using broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for moderate to severe infections when more narrow-spectrum options would be adequate. This study aimed to characterize the choice of antibiotic being prescribed for the management of outpatient cellulitis requiring intravenous antibiotics and evaluate the success of a clinical order set outlining optimal therapy. METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review looking at antibiotic prescribing through the Emergency Department at The Moncton Hospital, in Moncton, New Brunswick. Charts were reviewed before and after the introduction of a clinical order set outlining optimal antibiotic therapy. The goal was to review charts from the pre- and post-intervention group and compare antibiotic usage, treatment failure rates, and adverse events. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients receiving IV antibiotics in the pre-intervention group, 3 received cefazolin, 50 received ceftriaxone, while 1 received levofloxacin. The median duration of IV therapy was four days. After the introduction of the clinical order set there was an absolute increase of 53.8% (n = 35) in the use of cefazolin and absolute decrease of 53.7% (n = 23) in the use of ceftriaxone in the post-intervention group of 59 patients. Both results were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The median duration of IV therapy in this group was 3.5 days. In eligible patients, the clinical order set was utilized 61.1% of the time. There was no significant difference in rates of treatment failure or adverse events between cefazolin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a clinical order set outlining the preferential use of once-daily cefazolin plus probenecid for the treatment of outpatient cellulitis lead to a statistically significant increase use of cefazolin, and decrease use of ceftriaxone, thus demonstrating a positive stewardship effect at a local level.

25454,The Role of Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) in Infection,2011-03-26,"This chapter goes into the unproductive metamorphosis of fear, and analyses the defence mechanisms that it generates: namely denial and projection. In the case of global risks, fear provokes self-defensive strategies based on denial (in the face of the nuclear challenge) and self-deception (in the face of global warming); and, in the case of the threat of the other, projective and persecutory strategies based on reactivating the dynamic of the ‘scapegoat’. They are two contrasting but specular responses which, at the emotional level, reflect the divarication between (unlimited) individualism and (endogamous) communitarianism. The first, implosive response converts into an absence of fear, attested to above all by the figure of the global spectator, while the second, explosive response converts into an excess of fear (fear of the other, fear of contamination), fuelled by forms of reinventing community. These responses are defined as irrational since in the first case they inhibit the spectator’s capacity to recognize himself as also a potential victim of the threats, thus preventing his mobilization, and in the second case they give rise to dynamics of demonization-dehumanization of the other, which result in a spiral of violence and impede forms of solidarity.","Pulcini, Elena",Care of the World,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122052/,7

While the brain may be ‘immunologically privileged’, the privilege is not absolute; both immune and autoimmune responses can occur. While the blood-brain barrier contributes to this immunological isolation, other factors are also important. One is the normal absence of products of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) from neural tissue. Without these cell surface proteins, neural cells are protected from T cell-mediated immune surveillance. MHC expression and modulation in neural tissue, and the implications for understanding and control of the immune response to neural antigens, are reviewed below.","Lampson, Lois A.",Trends Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7172952/,7
31889,Considerations for Medications Commonly Utilized in the Oncology Population in the Intensive Care Unit,2019-07-09,"Public health is generally regarded as the typical domain of national if not local governments, which takes into account local necessities arising from the epidemiologic situation, the health-care system and the government structures. Therefore in theory, public health policy is in the sovereignty of countries. However, the spread of infectious diseases has never been restricted to national borders; thus the principle of national sovereignty is largely theoretical. This is especially true in a world with unprecedented international mobility of goods and persons. Moreover, particularly public health actions in the field of infectious diseases within one country may well affect public health issues in other countries. One of the best recent examples is the Chinese management of the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, which was characterised by failing surveillance structures, insufficient control measures and restricted public information policy. Abba Ebban has described it as a paradox that in order for countries to effectively execute their public health sovereignty, they would consequently have to give up some of their sovereignty to intergovernmental organisations (Ebban 1995).","Krause, Gérard",Modern Infectious Disease Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178902/,7

MATERIALS AND METHODS The tissue surface data of maxillary and mandibular edentulous gypsum models were obtained through a 3D scanner to design the digital custom trays in Geomagic software. The custom trays were then printed with FDM and SLA technologies, and handmade custom trays were used as control. The scanned data of printing trays were registered with their digital data, and the printing errors were analyzed using the deviation analysis function. The distances between the tissue surface of gypsum models and the custom trays were measured in ImageWare and represented by 3D deviation. RESULTS None of the six groups revealed a significant difference (P > .05) compared to the set value of 1.00 mm. In the SLA group, the deviation of the mandibular area was significantly closer to the set value than for the HM group (P < .05), while no significant difference was displayed between the other groups. For the printing error between the two 3D groups, the SLA method showed significantly less error and better stability (P < .001). CONCLUSION 3D-printed custom trays can meet clinical needs in the adaptability of tissue surfaces, and SLA-printed trays revealed better precision and less error than the other two methods. Accordingly, the use of SLA technology to make a 3D-printed custom tray is expected to be promoted in clinical practice.","Wang, Xin; Su, Jiansheng",The International journal of prosthodontics,https://doi.org/10.11607/ijp.7101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33570526/,7

72280,Bedside diagnostic laparoscopy to diagnose intraabdominal pathology in the intensive care unit.,2009,"CONTEXT Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs have recently been promoted as antihyperglycemic agents in critically ill patients with systemic inflammation, but the effects of TNF-α on glucose metabolism during GLP-1 administration are unknown. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to determine whether the infusion of TNF-α at high physiological levels impairs GLP-1's effects on glucose metabolism. DESIGN This was a randomized, controlled, cross-over trial. SETTING The study was conducted at a hospital clinical research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS Twelve healthy males (aged 24 ± 3 y; body mass index 22.9 ± 1.3 kg/m(2)). INTERVENTIONS After an overnight fast, either saline (0.9%) or recombinant human TNF-α (1000 ng/m(2) · h) was infused from t = 0-6 hours. At t = 2 hours, GLP-1 infusion (0.5 pmol/kg · min) began. From t = 4-6 hours, the GLP-1 infusion rate was increased to 1.2 pmol/kg · min. Plasma glucose was clamped at 5 mmol/L throughout via a variable rate 20% dextrose infusion. Trials were 7-14 days apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Endogenous glucose production (EGP) was measured by the [6,6-(2)H2]glucose isotope tracer dilution method. RESULTS GLP-1 infusion suppressed plasma glucagon (P < .01), elevated plasma insulin, and C-peptide (P < .01) and suppressed EGP (P < .001) during the saline infusion. In contrast, the infusion of TNF-α increased plasma TNF-α and IL-6, elevated body temperature, and blunted the GLP-1-induced suppression of EGP during high-dose GLP-1 infusion (all P < .05, TNF-α vs saline). However, TNF-α infusion lowered plasma GLP-1 during high-dose GLP-1 infusion (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS TNF-α induces systemic inflammation and reduces plasma GLP-1, thereby reducing the suppression of EGP during GLP-1 infusion. This may have clinical relevance if GLP-1 analog drugs are used for the treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients.","Lehrskov-Schmidt, Louise; Lehrskov-Schmidt, Lars; Nielsen, Signe T; Holst, Jens J; Møller, Kirsten; Solomon, Thomas P J",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-4244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25675385/,7

Although evidence from then-classified studies of World War 2 showed that most people managed the stress of bombing, those vulnerable and exposed to substantial trauma had lasting or severe mental illness. Studies of different towns and occupational groups identified the proportion of people killed and wounded, the percentage of housing destroyed, and the loss of paid employment as risk factors for psychological breakdown. Mothers and children suffered not only with evacuation, but also from the trauma of bombing and damage to schools. A general association between civilian physical and psychological casualties suggests that population groups with high rates of infection and mortality might be susceptible to mental illness as a result of the pandemic.

76700,Clinical Pearls.,2018,"CONTEXT There is growing concern that during their education medical students come to believe that ""race"" is a biological construct and that differential treatment of patients based on ""race"" is clinically beneficial. How ""race"" is presented to medical students may influence both their implicit biases and future clinical practices, potentially widening racial disparities in care. METHODS We conducted in-depth interviews with twenty-two preclinical mostly non-white medical students attending a public medical school in a major metropolitan area in the northeastern United States. Interview content focused on how medical students experience the presentation of race in medical education, use race in their learning experiences, and envision using race as physicians in future clinical encounters. Transcripts were analyzed using the framework method and emergent themes were identified. RESULTS Participants described being most aware of the presentation of race in board-style questions and least aware of the presentation of race during lectures. They described being aware of race in problem-based learning (PBL) modules if the case revolved around a likely race-disease association. They identified imprecision in how race was presented during lectures and insufficient explanations of causes of racial disparities in health. Participants described feeling ill-prepared to obtain racial self-identification and receiving mixed messages around the utility of race in diagnosing a patient. Participants reported experiences of cognitive dissonance around the presentation of race in board-style questions and lectures. CONCLUSIONS Critical evaluation of the presentation of and instruction around ""race"" is needed to address whether it is presented as a biological vs. social construct, the level of precision of racial categorization in curricular content, and the causes of and mechanisms behind race-disease associations. This has the potential to minimize false beliefs about race as a biological construct and the resultant negative impacts on clinical care. Future research could evaluate whether problem-based or experiential (OSCE) learning, in contrast to board-style questions and didactic lectures, are the most effective way to educate students around race in health and illness. Additionally, future research can investigate if the mission (i.e. social) and composition (Predominantly White Institution or Historically Black College/University) of the faculty impacts student experiences of the presentation of race.","Mosley, Marcus P; Tasfia, Nowshin; Serna, Kimberly; Camacho-Rivera, Marlene; Frye, Victoria",Medical education,https://doi.org/10.1111/medu.14443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354809/,7
81853,Caring for Patients Using Standardized Checklists.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopy is the procedure of choice for the resection of gastric Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) smaller than 2 cm; there is still debate regarding the most appropriate operative approach for larger GISTs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and long-term efficacy of laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs larger than 2 cm. METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, we prospectively enrolled all patients affected by gastric GIST larger than 2 cm. Exclusion criteria for the laparoscopic approach were the presence of metastases and the absence of any involvement of the esophago-gastric junction, the pyloric canal, or any adjacent organ. Final diagnosis of GIST was confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Follow-up assessment included abdominal CT scans every 6 months for the first 2 years and yearly thereafter. RESULTS Twenty-four consecutive patients were enrolled. Twenty-one patients (87.5%) were symptomatic. The most common symptoms were gastrointestinal bleeding and abdominal pain. The mean tumor size was 5.51 cm (range 2.5-12.0 cm). GISTs were located in the lesser curvature in five cases (20.8%), in the greater curvature in seven cases (29.1%), in the posterior wall in one case (4.1%), in the anterior wall in eight cases (33.3%), and in the fundus in 3 cases (12.5%). Laparoscopic resection was possible in all cases and took on average of 55 min (range 30-105 min). Median blood loss was 24 ml. No major intraoperative complications were observed. Mortality rate was 0%. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. No patients were lost to follow-up. No recurrences occurred after a median follow-up period of 75 months. CONCLUSION Although larger randomized controlled trials comparing different surgical strategies for large gastric GISTs are warranted, our study supports the evidence that laparoscopic resection of gastric GISTs is feasible, safe, and effective on long-term clinical outcome even for lesions up to 12 cm.","Masoni, Luigi; Gentili, Ivan; Maglio, Riccardo; Meucci, Massimo; D'Ambra, Giancarlo; Di Giulio, Emilio; Di Nardo, Giovanni; Corleto, Vito Domenico",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3552-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879133/,7
84664,Proning During COVID-19: The Importance of Teamwork.,2020-11-01,"Background: Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a large shift in health care toward virtual platforms. This study analyzed patient and physician satisfaction with telehealth during the height of the pandemic within the division of sports medicine. Methods: All sports medicine patients who completed a telemedicine visit from March 30, 2020, through April 30, 2020, were sent a 14-question Likert scale (1-5/5) survey. Sports medicine physicians who used telemedicine were sent a separate 14-question Likert scale (1-5/5) survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using a multivariate linear regression model. Results: A total of 143 patients and 9 sports medicine attendings completed the surveys. Most patients were ""satisfied"" (4/5) or ""very satisfied"" (5/5) (88.8%). A multivariate linear regression determined that patients who believed they had a greater ability to adopt new technology and were more effective at communicating questions/concerns to their physicians had greater satisfaction (p = 0.009 and p = 0.015, respectively). Most physicians were either ""satisfied"" (4/5) or ""very satisfied"" (5/5) (75.0%). On average, physicians felt that physical examinations conducted through telemedicine were ""moderately effective"" (2.75/5.00 ± 1.3), that they were ""fairly confident"" (3.86/5.00 ± 0.83) in their diagnoses, and that most sports medicine attendings plan to use telemedicine in the future (87.5%). Conclusion: Telehealth emerged as a valuable tool for the delivery of health care to sports medicine patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and physicians reported high levels of satisfactions with its use, and this study further identifies areas that can improve the patient and physician experience.","Kirby, David J; Fried, Jordan W; Buchalter, Daniel B; Moses, Michael J; Hurly, Eoghan T; Cardone, Dennis A; Yang, S Steven; Virk, Mandeep S; Rokito, Andrew S; Jazrawi, Laith M; Campbell, Kirk A",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512302/,7

95149,Is Postoperative Intensive Care Unit Care Necessary following Cranial Vault Remodeling for Sagittal Synostosis?,2017,"PURPOSE To investigate the effects of the combination of centhaquin and 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (HES 130/0.4) in a swine model of hemorrhagic shock. METHODS Twenty Landrace-Large White pigs were instrumented and subjected to hemorrhagic shock. The animals were randomly allocated in two experimental groups, the control (group CO, n = 10) and the centhaquin groups (0.015 mg/kg, n = 10, group CH). Acute hemorrhage was induced by stepwise blood withdrawal (18 mL/min) from the internal jugular vein until MAP decreased to 40-45 mmHg, whereas anesthesia remained constant. All animals received HES 130/0.4 solution in the resuscitation phase until their mean arterial pressure (MAP) reached 90% of the baseline. The animals were observed for 60 min, during which no further resuscitation was attempted. RESULTS The total amount of blood and the bleeding time did not differ significantly between group CO and group CH (120 ± 13 vs. 120 ± 14 mL, p = 0.6; 20 ± 2 vs. 20 ± 1 min, p = 0.62, respectively). During the hemorrhagic phase, only a difference in heart rate (97.6 ± 4.4 vs. 128.4 ± 3.6 beats/min, p = 0.038) was observed between the two groups. The time required to reach the target MAP was significantly shorter in the centhaquin group compared to controls (13.7 ± 0.4 vs. 19.6 ± 0.84 min, p = 0.012). During the resuscitation phase, a statistical significant difference was observed in MAP (75.2 ± 1.6 vs. 89.8 ± 2.1 mmHg, p = 0.02) between group CO and group CH. During the observation phase, a statistical significant difference was observed in SVR (1109 ± 32.65 vs. 774.6 ± 21.82 dyn s/cm5, p = 0.039) and cardiac output (5.82 ± 0.31 vs. 6.9 ± 0.78 L/min, p = 0.027) between the two groups. Two animals of group CO and seven animals of group CH survived for 24 h (p = 0.008). We observed a marked increase in microvascular capillary permeability in group CO compared to group CH, with the wet/dry weight ratio being significantly higher in group CO compared to group CH (4.8 ± 1.6 vs. 3.08 ± 0.6, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The combination of centhaquin 0.015 mg/kg and HES 130/0.4 resulted in shorter time to target MAP, lower wet-to-dry ratio, and better survival rates after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock.","Kontouli, Zinais; Staikou, Chryssoula; Iacovidou, Nicoletta; Mamais, Ioannis; Kouskouni, Evaggelia; Papalois, Apostolos; Papapanagiotou, Panagiotis; Gulati, Anil; Chalkias, Athanasios; Xanthos, Theodoros",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00068-018-0980-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006694/,7

Associated with photodynamic therapy (PDT), HYP has shown a broad therapeutic potential against microorganisms and cancer cells. Due to the low water solubility of HYP, its application in the biological medium becomes limited. To solve this limitation, our research group has been used copolymeric micelles to carrier HYP with high efficiency. However, there is no elucidated mechanism for HYP delivery mediated by copolymeric micelles. In this sense, we believed that the study of binding-sites of copolymeric micelles and HYP is the first step to its understanding. For this purpose, in this work, we employed 1D and 2D NMR techniques to investigate the behaviour of HYP-loaded P84 micelles in different concentrations . 1D and 2D NMR analysis revealed that HYP molecules were arrangement in a π-stacked aggregation form with a specific location on the core of P84 micelles.","Gonçalves, Renato Sonchini; de Oliveira, Ana Carolina Vieira; Hioka, Noboru; Caetano, Wilker",Natural product research,https://doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2020.1817923; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911984/,7

Gaining clinical work experience via various previously available opportunities from healthcare centres has currently become more challenging and less accessible due to the COVID-19 pandemic-related limitations and resource shortages. In order to provide experience in the healthcare field, we conducted a case study by inviting two secondary school students to participate in Simulation via Instant Messaging -Birmingham Advance (SIMBA) as moderators. Despite no previous clinical knowledge, they found it accessible and to be an excellent alternative to the more traditional types of work experience, which had become unavailable to them. We, therefore, propose SIMBA can act as an alternative and/or an adjunct to work experience for healthcare-related courses.","Evans, Nia; Davitadze, Meri; Narendran, Arjun; Evans, Seren; Thomas, Lucretia; Blaggan, Parisha; Melson, Eka; Kempegowda, Punith",Future healthcare journal,https://doi.org/10.7861/fhj.2020-0219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791494/,7

147671,The importance of tracheostomy progression in the intensive care unit.,2014,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze new telehealth benefits offered by Medicare Advantage (MA) plans in 2020 and examine plan characteristics associated with the provision of the new telehealth benefits. RESEARCH DESIGN Using publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, we identified unique MA plans with at least 1 enrollee in January 2020. We examined whether plans offered any new telehealth benefits in 2020, the 20 most common types of telehealth services covered, and cost-sharing. Next, we used multivariable logistic regression to identify associations between offering any telehealth benefits and plan characteristics. We conducted a similar analysis for each of the 3 most commonly covered telehealth services. RESULTS Of 2992 unique MA plans, 58.1% offered new telehealth benefits in 2020. The most frequently covered services were primary care, mental health, and urgent care. Coverage for other types of services was limited. Our multivariable logistic regression showed that offering any new telehealth benefits was not more common among plans in rural areas, but was more likely among national plans, those with a monthly premium, those with >3540 enrollees, and those with a star rating of 4.0-4.5. The new telehealth benefits were less likely to be provided by for-profit plans. Overall, findings remained similar when analyzed according to the type of services. CONCLUSIONS MA plans are embracing new telehealth benefits, but there is room for improvement. Policymakers should consider how to accelerate the adoption curve of telehealth in MA plans.","Park, Sungchul; Langellier, Brent A; Burke, Robert E",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925464/,7

149505,Temperature of gas delivered from ventilators.,2013,"A twin-column Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) process has been developed for the purification of a therapeutic peptide, glucagon, from a crude synthetic mixture. This semi-continuous process uses two identical columns operating either in interconnected or in batch mode, thus enabling the internal recycle of the portions of the eluting stream which do not comply with purity specifications. Because of this feature, which actually results in the simulated countercurrent movement of the stationary phase with respect to the mobile one, the yield-purity trade-off typical of traditional batch preparative chromatography can be alleviated. Moreover, the purification process can be completely automatized. Aim of this work is to present a simple procedure for the development of the MCSGP process based on a single batch experiment, in the case of a therapeutic peptide of industrial relevance. This allowed to recover roughly 90% of the injected glucagon in a purified pool with a purity of about 90%. A comparison between the performance of the MCSGP process and the classical single column batch process indicates that percentage increase in the recovery of target product is +23% when transferring the method from batch conditions to MCSGP, with an unchanged purity of around 89%. This improvement comes at the expenses of a reduction of about 38% in productivity.","Luca, Chiara De; Felletti, Simona; Lievore, Giulio; Buratti, Alessandro; Vogg, Sebastian; Morbidelli, Massimo; Cavazzini, Alberto; Catani, Martina; Macis, Marco; Ricci, Antonio; Cabri, Walter",Journal of chromatography.

151822,Correction to: Epidemiology and patient predictors of infection and sepsis in the prehospital setting.,2020-06-30,"PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter) is a major urban air pollutant worldwide. Its effects on the respiratory system of the susceptible population have been less characterized. This study aimed to estimate the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with respiratory outcomes of the retired adults, and to examine whether these associations were stronger among the subjects with GSTT-null genotype. 32 healthy subjects (55-77 years) were recruited for five follow-up examinations. Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 were monitored consecutively for 7 days prior to physical examination. Pulmonary outcomes including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal fluid concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2α), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-1β were measured. A linear mixed-effect model was introduced to evaluate the associations of PM2.5 concentrations with respiratory outcomes. Additionally, GSTT1 genotype-based stratification was performed to characterize modification on PM2.5-related respiratory outcomes. We found that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with decreases of 0.52 L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.002), 0.64 L (95% CI: -1.13, -0.16), 0.1 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.04) and 2.87 L/s (95% CI: -5.09, -0.64) in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and PEF at lag 2, respectively. Meanwhile, marked increases of 80.82% (95% CI: 5.13%, 156.50%) in IL-8, 77.14% (95% CI: 1.88%, 152.40%) in IL-1β and 67.87% (95% CI: 14.85%, 120.88%) in 8-epi-PGF2α were observed as PM2.5 concentration increased by 10 μg/m3 at lag 2. Notably, PM2.5-associated decreases in FVC and PEF and increase in FeNO were stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype. In summary, short-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with nasal inflammation, oxidative stress and lung function reduction in the retired subjects. Lung function reduction and inflammation are stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype.","Sun, Beibei; Song, Jie; Wang, Ya; Jiang, Jing; An, Zhen; Li, Juan; Zhang, Yange; Wang, Gui; Li, Huijun; Alexis, Neil E; Jaspers, Ilona; Wu, Weidong",Environmental pollution,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932759/,7

159207,Patient questionnaire following closure of tracheotomy fistula: percutaneous vs. surgical approaches.,2014,"WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVES In November 2019, several patients were diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. So far, there are no specific treatments with proven high efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Presently, several drugs, such as hydroxychloroquine, ribavirin, favipiravir (FVP), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), remdesivir and oseltamivir, have been suggested as effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience with FPV and LPV/r in critically ill patients with COVID-19 at Sakarya University Education and Research Hospital. METHODS The study included 107 consecutive patients who had a laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 19 March and 19 May 2020. Follow-up continued through 30 May 2020 when the last observed patients were discharged. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Of the 107 patients, 65 received FPV (Group FPV) and 42 received LPV/r (Group LPV/r). The two groups were similar in terms of demographic data and clinical findings. 43 (66.2%) of the 65 patients in the FPV group and 23 (54.8%) of the 42 patients in the LPV/r group died (p = 0.237). The median ICU stay was 6.6 (IQR, 3-10) days in the FPV group and 9 (IQR, 6-16) days in the LPV/r group, which was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.010). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION The length of hospital stay was significantly lower in the FVP group compared to the LPV/r group among patients who were discharged from the ICU. Although the analysis was done with a limited number of patients and the observed difference in mortality rate is of some concern, FVP treatment may be more beneficial than LPV/r in terms of effective use in the ICU.","Kocayiğit, Havva; Özmen Süner, Kezban; Tomak, Yakup; Demir, Gürkan; Yaylacı, Selçuk; Dheir, Hamad; Güçlü, Ertuğrul; Erdem, Ali Fuat",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.13305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128482/,7

First, we develop a general purpose multi-modal neural fusion network model MSNF for learning students' academic information representation by fusing spatial and temporal unstructured advising notes with spatiotemporal structured data. MSNF combines a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based document embedding framework to represent each advising note, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal advising note embeddings, LSTM network to model students' temporal performance variables and students' static demographics altogether. The final fused representation from MSNF has been utilized on a Multi-Task Cascade Learning (MTCL) model towards building MSNF-MTCL for predicting 5 student retention risks. We evaluate MSNFMTCL on a large educational database consists of 36,445 college students over 18 years period of time that provides promising performances comparing with the nearest state-of-art models.

244753,COVID-19 Pandemic and Obstetric Anaesthesia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The extreme social circumstances caused by declared COVID-19 pandemic deeply intervene people's everyday life and should not be neglected but seen through the view of social reality pinpointing the ""ordinary"" people. In this paper, authors explored basic segments of everyday and their subjective perception to what extent sleeping habits, physical inactivity, physical activity, nutritional habits and smoking have changed. METHODS: The online survey was conducted in nine European countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain) in 4108 participants, aged 15-82 years. The survey took place 30 to 40 days after WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic state, from April 15th to May 3rd, 2020. RESULTS: The results have shown 30 minutes longer sleeping time, 50% longer physical inactivity time, 65% longer screen time, 43% shorter walking time, 24% shorter sport time and 37% longer physical work time. Additionally, body mass gains (0.3 kg) could be explained in 20.6% with meals sizes, unhealthy food consumption, screen time and sport time. Further, respondents reported more regular meals (44%) and healthier meals with less alcohol consumption and less smoking, which have been positive outcomes of home confinement. CONCLUSION: The findings draw attention to negative changes in everyday praxis (inactivity, body mass gain) after such a short period. Because of possible risk to population's health (especially of countries such as Italy and Spain with serious threat and more stringent measures), findings enable development of recommendations for maintaining healthy lifestyle habits with minimal negative health consequences in similar pandemic circumstances.","Pisot, Sasa; Milovanovic, Ivana; Simunic, Bostjan; Gentile, Ambra; Bosnar, Ksenija; Prot, Franjo; Bianco, Antonino; Lo Coco, Gianluca; Bartoluci, Suncica; Katovic, Darko; Bakalár, Peter; Slancová, Terézia Kovalik; Tlucáková, Lenka; Casals, Cristina; Feka, Kaltrina; Christogianni, Aikaterini; Drid, Patrik",Eur. j. public health,,7

244802,Assessment of patient recognition of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated olfactory loss and recovery: a longitudinal study,2021,"The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in water and wastewater has recently been reported. According to the updated literature, the stools and masks of the patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were considered as the primary route of coronavirus transmission into water and wastewater. Most of coronavirus types which attract human (possible for SARS-CoV-2) are often inactivated rapidly in water (i.e., the survival of human coronavirus 229E in water being seven days at 23 °C). However, the survival period of coronavirus in water and wastewater strongly depends on temperature, kinds of wastewater, concentration of suspended solids and organic matter, solution pH, and the dose of disinfectant used. The World Health Organization has claimed that the current disinfection process of drinking water could effectively inactivate most of the bacterial and viral communities present in water, especially SARS-CoV-2 (more sensitive to disinfectant like free chlorine). A recent study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in inflow wastewater (but not detected in outflow one). Although the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in the water influent has been confirmed, an important question is whether it can survive or infect after the disinfection process of drinking water. To date, there is one study confirming that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in water for people was null based on the absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) in infectivity tests. Therefore, further studies should focus on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater under different operational conditions (i.e., temperature and water matrix) and whether the transmission from COVID-19-contaminated water to human is an emerging concern. Although paper-based devices have been suggested for detecting traces of SARS-CoV-2 in water, the protocols and appropriate devices should be developed soon. Wastewater and sewage workers should follow the procedures for safety precaution against SARS-CoV-2 exposure.","Tran, Hai Nguyen; Le, Giang Truong; Nguyen, Dong Thanh; Juang, Ruey-Shin; Rinklebe, Jörg; Bhatnagar, Amit; Lima, Eder C; Iqbal, Hafiz M N; Sarmah, Ajit K; Chao, Huan-Ping",Environ Res,,7

The viral main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (Mpro), known to control coronavirus replication and essential for viral life cycle, has been established as an essential drug discovery target for SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we employed computationally screening of Druglib database containing FDA approved drugs against active pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using MTiopen screen web server, yields a total of 1051 FDA approved drugs with docking energy >-7 kcal/mol. The top 10 screened potential compounds against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were then studied by re-docking, binding affinity, intermolecular interaction, and complex stability via 100 ns all atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulation followed by post-simulation analysis, including end point binding free energy, essential dynamics, and residual correlation analysis against native crystal structure ligand N3 inhibitor. Based on comparative molecular simulation and interaction profiling of the screened drugs with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro revealed R428 (-10.5 kcal/mol), Teniposide (-9.8 kcal/mol), VS-5584 (-9.4 kcal/mol), and Setileuton (-8.5 kcal/mol) with stronger stability and affinity than other drugs and N3 inhibitor; and hence, these drugs are advocated for further validation using in vitro enzyme inhibition and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

266941,Multiple Peaked Cytokine Storm: Is Multiple Exposures to the COVID-19 Virus a Possible Cause?,2021,"Background: The on going COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30thJanuary 2020 and called for collaborative efforts from all countries to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19. In pandemic conditions like today, dentists can be the first people to contact with an infected person; these people can become carriers and infect others. COVID-19 transmission during dental treatment can occur through aerosol inhalation or direct contact with saliva, contaminated instruments and surface, especially for children patient in pediatric dentistry. Objective: To review the impact of COVID-19 in pediatric dentistry. Literature Review: In the dental environment associated with pediatric dental care, oral fluids from patients or contaminated dental instruments or environmental surfaces create a potential pathway to spread the virus. Dental care procedures which include the use of instruments such as high-speed turbine handpieces and scalers for oral hygiene are associated with the formation of aerosols and large droplets of saliva and blood from patients. Discussion: For children able to split, pre-procedural mouth rinse with 0.5%–1% hydrogen peroxide should be used, as it has non specific virucidal activity against corona viruses. Dentists should avoid or minimize operations that can produce droplets or aerosols. Conclusion: On the other hand, if faced with a dental emergency, immediate intervention is needed, adherence to the strict protection protocols of each individual involved and environmental disinfection is very important to minimize the risk of cross infection.","Achmad, Harun; Djais, Arni Irawaty; Syahrir, Syakriani; Inayah, Yayah; Wiwik Elnangti, W.; Fitri, Amelia; Ramadhany, Yunita Feby",Int.

This special issue integrates ideas and efforts across different fields into a more unified framework to study and design for what we call Learning on the Move. Approaches used in these studies reflect various ontological and epistemological standpoints, especially with regard to the role of moving bodies, place, and lands/waters in learning, teaching, and development. The heterogeneity of approaches in this special issue potentially helps us to see the complexity of human, more-than-human, and technological relations across time. The specificity of each project necessarily foregrounds certain aspects of activity and history, while backgrounding others. Rather than casting this as problematic, we see this heterogeneity as an opportunity to generate dialogue across research programs that are guided by frameworks of power, historicity, relationality, respect, reciprocity, and accountability. We also take this as an opportunity to raise questions about historical, present-day, and future relationships to lands/waters, place, socio-ecological systems, and socio-technical arrangements. At a practical level, this means having conversations about the differences and similarities between ontological and epistemological conceptions of time, space, place, and lands/waters when studying or designing for Learning on the Move.

Minimizing the spread of coronavirus and its economic consequences, and creating a new and safe lifestyle has now become the common goals of governments all over the world. Although governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing various rules while interacting with relevant organizations to provide health service, vaccine research, and production of essential items, the complexities in the interactions between various stakeholders have proved to be challenging to have efficient and timely outputs. When different stakeholders (i.e. governments, organizations, and the public) are interacting with each other, a systems thinking process needs to be applied to capture the nuances of the interactions and the subsequent emergent behavior to effectively contribute to the system output (i.e. a safer way of life). This paper applied a system-thinking-inspired process called System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to analyze the current response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis treated various stakeholders as a part of the system, and it focused on the interactions among different stakeholders (i.e. functional blocks) within the system - i.e. 'Government', 'Foreign Governments', 'Organizations', and 'General Public', as well as the interactions with 'W.H.O'.

A virtual screening strategy to search for potential drugs was proposed, using molecular docking to explore a library of approved drugs available in the DrugBank database in order to identify possible NSP15 inhibitors to treat Covid19 disease. We found from the docking analysis that the antiviral drugs: Paritaprevir and Elbasvir, currently both approved for hepatitis C treatment which showed some of the lowest free binding energy values were considered as repositioning drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations of the Apo and Holo-Nsp15 systems were performed in order to get insights about the stability of these protein-ligand complexes.","Sixto-López, Yudibeth; Martínez-Archundia, Marlet",J Comput Chem,,7

We examined bereaved families' perceptions of the quality of end-of-life communication among Veterans, families and staff in Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study using data from a survey of bereaved family members of Veterans administered from March-June 2020. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. SETTING: VA medical centers with the highest numbers of COVID-19 cases during the study period. PARTICIPANTS: Next-of-kin of 328 Veterans who died in one of 37 VA medical centers' acute care, intensive care, nursing home, or hospice units. MEASUREMENTS: Open-ended survey questions (response rate = 37%) about family member's perceptions of: (1) communication with the healthcare team about the patient, (2) communication with the patient, and (3) use of remote communication technologies. RESULTS: Bereaved family members identified contextual factors perceived to impact communication quality including: allowing family at the bedside when death is imminent, fears that the patient died alone, and overall perceptions of VA care. Characteristics of perceived high-quality communication included staff availability for remote communication and being kept informed of the patient's condition and plan of care. Low-quality communication with staff was perceived to result from limited access to staff, insufficient updates regarding the patient's condition, and when the family member was not consulted about care decision-making. Communication quality with the patient was facilitated or impeded by the availability and use of video-enabled remote technologies. CONCLUSION: Communication between patients, families, and healthcare teams at the end of life remains critically important during times of limited in-person visitation. Families report that low-quality communication causes profound distress that can affect the quality of dying and bereavement. Innovative strategies are needed to ensure that high-quality communication occurs despite pandemic-related visitation restrictions.","Feder, Shelli; Smith, Dawn; Griffin, Hilary; Shreve, Scott T; Kinder, Daniel; Kutney-Lee, Ann; Ersek, Mary",,,7

Here, we demonstrate that a surface-agnostic, non-destructive, polymer-based coating can significantly enhance the capture of aerosols and droplets. The water-based formulation contains only cosmetic ingredients and yields uniform and conformal coatings on a broad range of indoor environmental surfaces, regardless of the material composition, wettability, and texture. The coating remains transparent and haze free even after extensive droplet deposition. Additives can be incorporated to bring additional functions, such as coloration and sanitization. The strategy enhances the function of transparent protective barriers and can repurpose large areas of barely touched indoor environmental surfaces for droplet removal, eliminating these infectious sources from the chain of transmission.","Yu, Zhilong Kadir Murat Liu Yihan Huang Jiaxing",Chem,,7

We find that host-switching occurs more frequently and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and is more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance.

421470,Fatigue as long-term consequence of ARDS in COVID-19 patients,2020,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the present status of anxiety among nurses fighting the spread of COVID-19 and its association with perceived stress and insomnia. BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of COVID-19, nurses have been caring for infected patients for a considerable length of time in Wuhan, China. Previous COVID-19 studies generally focused on patients' medical treatment, but few considered healthcare workers' psychological needs while working with a pandemic involving an unfamiliar infectious disease. Numerous nurses have experienced mental health problems, such as anxiety. DESIGN: The STROBE guidelines for a cross-sectional questionnaire were implemented. METHODS: An online survey of 643 frontline nurses working with COVID-19 patients was conducted from March 3 to 10, 2020. Sociodemographic data were collected, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, the Chinese Perceived Stress Scale, and the Athens Insomnia Scale were administered. RESULTS: One-third (33.4%) of participants reported anxiety, which was associated with perceived stress and insomnia among Chinese frontline nurses in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant associations were found between anxiety, perceived stress, insomnia, working four-night shifts per week, experience working during more than two epidemics, and fear of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a substantial proportion of frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients experienced anxiety. We recommend that nurse managers focus on working conditions and cultivate safe and satisfactory work environments. Meanwhile, frontline nurses should foster awareness of mental health and rely on online resources for psychological training to alleviate anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings of this study could facilitate better understanding of anxiety among frontline nurses; more importantly, health care authorities and nursing managers need to pay more attention to ensuring intervention training to reduce anxiety for frontline nurses worldwide.","Shen, Yue; Zhan, Yuxin; Zheng, Hong; Liu, Huan; Wan, Yonghui; Zhou, Wei",J. clin. nurs,,7

The total number of the infected has reached 313,844 and the number of deaths has reached 4,379 as of 16 January 2021. This article reviews the characteristics of and responses to the three waves of COVID-19 in Japan during 2020-2021 in order to provide a reference for the next step in epidemic prevention and control. The Japanese Government declared a state of emergency on 7 April 2020, which suppressed the increase in the number of the infected by curtailing economic activity. The first wave peaked at 701 new cases a day and it decreased to 21 new cases on May 25 when the state of emergency was lifted. However, the number of the infected increased again due to the resumption of economic activity, with a peak of 1,762 new cases a day during the second wave. Although the situation was worse than that during the first wave, the government succeeded in limiting the increase without declaring a state of emergency again, and that may be attributed to a decrease in crowd activities and an increase in the number of inspections. During the third wave, the number of the infected continued to exceed the peak during previous waves for two months. Major factors for this rise include the government's implementation of further policies to encourage certain activities, relaxed immigration restrictions, and people not reducing their level of activity. An even more serious problem is the bed usage for patients with COVID-19; bed usage exceeds 50% not only in major cities but also in various areas. On 7 January 2021, 5,953 new cases were reported a day; this greatly exceeded the previous peak, and the state of emergency was declared again.

Here, using a live-virus neutralization assay, we compared the neutralization of a non-VOC variant with the 501Y.V2 VOC (also known as B.1.351) using plasma collected from adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the two waves of infection in South Africa, the second wave of which was dominated by infections with the 501Y.V2 variant. Sequencing demonstrated that infections of plasma donors from the first wave were with viruses that did not contain the mutations associated with 501Y.V2, except for one infection that contained the E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain. The 501Y.V2 virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from individuals who were infected during the second wave. The first-wave virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from first-wave infections. However, the 501Y.V2 variant was poorly cross-neutralized by plasma from individuals with first-wave infections; the efficacy was reduced by 15.1-fold relative to neutralization of 501Y.V2 by plasma from individuals infected in the second wave. By contrast, cross-neutralization of first-wave virus variants using plasma from individuals with second-wave infections was more effective, showing only a 2.3-fold decrease relative to neutralization of first-wave virus variants by plasma from individuals infected in the first wave. Although we tested only one plasma sample from an individual infected with a SARS-CoV-2 variant with only the E484K substitution, this plasma sample potently neutralized both variants. The observed effective neutralization of first-wave virus by plasma from individuals infected with 501Y.V2 provides preliminary evidence that vaccines based on VOC sequences could retain activity against other circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages.","Cele, Sandile; Gazy, Inbal; Jackson, Laurelle; Hwa, Shi-Hsia; Tegally, Houriiyah; Lustig, Gila; Giandhari, Jennifer; Pillay, Sureshnee; Wilkinson, Eduan; Naidoo, Yeshnee; Karim, Farina; Ganga, Yashica; Khan, Khadija; Bernstein, Mallory; Balazs, Alejandro B; Gosnell, Bernadett I; Hanekom, Willem; Moosa, Mahomed-Yunus S; Lessells, Richard J; de Oliveira, Tulio; Sigal, Alex",Nature,,7

458932,Left ventricular dysfunction in COVID-19: A diagnostic issue,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: COVID-19 affects the brain in various ways, amongst which delirium is worrying. An assessment was made of whether a specific, long-lasting, COVID-19-related brain injury develops in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients after life-saving re-oxygenation. METHODS: Ten COVID+ patients (COVID+) with unusual delirium associated with neuroimaging suggestive of diffuse brain injury and seven controls with non-COVID encephalopathy were studied. The assessment took place when the intractable delirium started at weaning off ventilation support. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed followed by standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses and assessment of CSF erythropoietin concentrations (as a marker for the assessment of tissue repair), and of non-targeted CSF metabolomics using liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Patients were similar as regards severity scores, but COVID+ were hospitalized longer (25 [11.75; 25] vs. 9 [4.5; 12.5] days, p = 0.03). On admission, but not at MRI and lumbar puncture performance, COVID+ were more hypoxic (p = 0.002). On MRI, there were leptomeningeal enhancement and diffuse white matter haemorrhages only in COVID+. In the latter, CSF erythropoietin concentration was lower (1.73 [1.6; 2.06] vs. 3.04 [2.9; 3.91] mIU/ml, p = 0.01), and CSF metabolomics indicated (a) increased compounds such as foodborne molecules (sesquiterpenes), molecules from industrialized beverages and micro-pollutants (diethanolamine); and (b) decreased molecules such as incomplete breakdown products of protein catabolism and foodborne molecules (glabridin). At 3-month discharge, fatigue, anxiety and depression as well as MRI lesions persisted in COVID+. CONCLUSIONS: Some COVID+ are at risk of a specific delirium. Imperfect brain repair after re-oxygenation and lifestyle factors might influence long-lasting brain injuries in a context of foodborne micro-pollutants.","Schneider, Francis; Agin, Arnaud; Baldacini, Mathieu; Maurer, Loïc; Schenck, Maleka; Alemann, Mathieu; Solis, Morgane; Helms, Julie; Villette, Claire; Artzner, Thierry; Kremer, Stéphane; Heintz, Dimitri",Eur. j. neurol,,7

It originated from Wuhan City of China in the late 2019. Proper vaccines have still been in progress; the spread of the virus is contracted by lockdown and social distancing protocols. These lockdowns resulted in significant benefits, improving the quality of air and reducing the level of environmental pollution. In this context, the study proposes to identify the air quality in the region and its relation with COVID-19-affected people in metropolitan cities of India during COVID-19 lockdowns using a geographical information system (GIS), where over 90% of commercial and industrial sites and 100% school and colleges were closed. The study outcomes highlight the areas encountering high levels of pollution under the pre-lockdown scenario and have seen a higher number of cases. The relation is most evident for PM2.5, which is responsible for respiratory disorders and is the place of attack of SARS-CoV-2. This approach provides comparable outcomes with other decision-making tools. Our primary precedence should be to develop communities to enable people to remain healthy and stay. Healthy societies are crucial not only for people's health, but also for sustainable development.

Para tanto, este trabalho foi subdividido em introdução e três capítulos. Inicialmente, procurou-se esclarecer sobre os aspectos etiológicos e fisiopatológicos da doença, dando ênfase para a ativação crônica de mecanismos compensatórios e desenvolvimento de arritmogênese, assim como seu papel no que tange à evolução e prognóstico. No primeiro capítulo, investigou-se o uso do índice de tônus vasovagal (VVTI), um indicador não convencional de atividade parassimpática, e seu comportamento nos diferentes estágios da doença mitral. Resultados mostraram que o referido índice é capaz de diferenciar cães em estágios diferentes da doença, no que diz respeito ao remodelamento cardíaco e à presença de sintomatologia clínica atribuída à insuficiência cardíaca congestiva. O segundo capítulo está centrado na avaliação do prejuízo no equilíbrio autonômico que acompanha a progressão da insuficiência valvar mitral. Para tanto, empregou-se uma manobra vagal amplamente descrita para demonstrar a resposta parassimpática fisiológica e, à medida que a insuficiência mitral se agrava, a atenuação dessa resposta. O estudo mostrou que é possível identificar indivíduos com doença cardíaca avançada com base na resposta individual ao reflexo óculo-cardíaco. Não obstante, os resultados obtidos ajudam a compreender a complexa desregulação autonômica na síndrome insuficiência cardíaca congestiva.

Os achados deste estudo reforçam a presença de distúrbios de repolarização na doença valvar mitral e chamam a atenção para o potencial prognóstico dos índices ligados à instabilidade do QT, haja vista a constatação de que o aumento de tais parâmetros está associado com menor sobrevida do cão com doença valvar mitral. 7","BRULER, BRUNA CRISTINA",,,7
515467,Anticoagulation in COVID-19: not strong for too long?,2021,"In the twelve months leading up to May 2020, over 81,000 people have died due to drug overdoses. Since then, these numbers have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, demonstrating an urgent need to develop novel and effective pharmacotherapies for individuals with substance use disorders. Recently, an inflammation associated chemokine receptor, CC Chemokine Receptor 5 (CCR5), has been linked to opioid abuse. We therefore hypothesized that inhibiting CCR5 could reduce opioid-taking in a food versus drug (fentanyl) choice procedure. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats (n=8) were trained to respond for either food (a grain pellet) on one lever, or increasing doses of fentanyl on the alternate lever under a multiple component, fixed ratio (FR) 5, choice procedure. Food was available in each of five components, with component 1 serving as a no drug control, and increasing unit doses of fentanyl (0.32-10 ?g/kg/infusion) available in components 2-5. At baseline, rats responded exclusively on the food lever during the first component, but gradually reallocated their responding towards the fentanyl lever as the unit dose of fentanyl increased, with exclusive choice of fentanyl occurring at the largest dose of fentanyl (10 µg/kg/inf). Pretreatment with the ?-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 and 3.2 mg/kg) significantly reduced choice of fentanyl while increasing both choice of food and trials completed. Pretreatment with haloperidol, a dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist (0.1 and 0.32 mg/kg), did not alter fentanyl choice at doses that did not also reduce trials completed. Pretreatment with Maraviroc (1-10 mg/kg) dose dependently reduced choice of fentanyl while also increasing choice of food and trials completed in later components. These results suggest that Maraviroc may selectively reduce fentanyl's reinforcing effects without affecting behavior maintained by a non-drug reinforcer (food). Future work will seek to determine whether the effects of Maraviroc persist across repeated dosing, and whether the anti-opioid effects of Maraviroc are impacted by opioid dependence and withdrawal.","Mason, Briana Seaman Jr Robert Collins Gregory",The FASEB Journal,,7

The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) and Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were validated for the Portuguese population and correlations with issues related to travel, tourism and hospitality were established. CAS and FCV-19S presented a good adjustment model and solid reliability and validity. Correlations between CAS and FCV-19S and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 in travel, tourism and hospitality were found. Participants considered that COVID-19 mainly affected their holidays and leisure time. However, the strongest correlation established was between total FCV-19S and emotional fear FCV-19S and the fear of attending hotel facilities. The Portuguese versions of CAS and FCV-19S are reliable psychological tools to assess anxiety and fear in relation to COVID-19 for the general population.

The rGO/Au nanohybrid exhibits much lower detection limit of 0.51 nM for L-Cys with higher selectivity. The fluorescence sensing mechanism arose from the fluorescence recovery due to the stronger interaction between Au NPs and L-Cys, and consequently, the energy transfer was prevented between rGO and Au NPs.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed on the hospitalized patients with SARS-COV-2 recruited from four hospitals in Hubei Province, China from 18 January to 10 March 2020. The patients with CNS symptoms were determined. Data regarding clinical symptoms and laboratory tests were collected from medical records. Results Of 1268 patients studied, 162 (12.8%) had CNS symptoms, manifested as unconsciousness (71, 5.6%), coma (69, 5.4%), dysphoria (50, 3.9%), somnolence (34, 2.7%) and convulsion (3, 0.2%), which were observed at median of 14 (interquartile range 9-18) days after symptom onset and significantly associated with older age (OR=5.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.78-11.73), male (OR=1.73, 95% CI 1.22-2.47) and preexisting hypertension (OR=1.78, 95% CI 1.23-2.57).

651506,Highlights From the Current Issue – Audiovisual Summary,2020-12-01,"In this paper, we study the dynamics of a vector-borne disease model with two transmission paths: direct transmission through contact and indirect transmission through vector. The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. In addition, increase in transmission heterogeneity will increase the chance of disease eradication.","Nadim, Sk Shahid; Ghosh, Indrajit; Chattopadhyay, Joydev",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/486720,7
651866,"Prevention and Control of Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, United States, 2021–22 Influenza Season",2021-08-27,"One year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the first vaccines are being rolled out under emergency use authorizations. It is of great concern that newly emerging variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can escape antibody-mediated protection induced by previous infection or vaccination through mutations in the spike protein. The glutamate (E) to Lysine (K) substitution at position 484 (E484K) in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is present in the rapidly spreading variants of concern belonging to the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages. We performed in vitro microneutralization assays with both the USA-WA1/2020 virus and a recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 virus that is identical to USA-WA1/2020 except for the E484K mutation introduced in the spike RBD. We selected 34 sera from study participants based on their SARS-CoV-2 spike ELISA antibody titer (negative [N=4] versus weak [N=8], moderate [N=11] or strong positive [N=11]). In addition, we included sera from five individuals who received two doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2. Serum neutralization efficiency was lower against the E484K rSARS-CoV-2 (vaccination samples: 3.4 fold; convalescent low IgG: 2.4 fold, moderate IgG: 4.2 fold and high IgG: 2.6 fold) compared to USA-WA1/2020. For some of the convalescent donor sera with low or moderate IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the drop in neutralization efficiency resulted in neutralization ID50 values similar to negative control samples, with low or even absence of neutralization of the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. However, human sera with high neutralization titers against the USA-WA1/2020 strain were still able to neutralize the E484K rSARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it is important to aim for the highest titers possible induced by vaccination to enhance protection against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Two vaccine doses may be needed for induction of high antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2. Postponing the second vaccination is suggested by some public health authorities in order to provide more individuals with a primer vaccination. Our data suggests that this may leave vaccinees less protected against newly emerging variants.","Jangra, Sonia; Ye, Chengjin; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Stadlbauer, Daniel; Krammer, Florian; Simon, Viviana; Martinez-Sobrido, Luis; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Schotsaert, Michael",medRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33532796/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.26.21250543; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.26.21250543v1?rss=1,7

This paper describes how the lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak in 2014 informed the emergency preparedness of the State ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak and guided response. DISCUSSION: Following the Ebola outbreak in 2014, the Lagos State government provided governance by developing a policy on emergency preparedness and biosecurity and provided oversight and coordination of emergency preparedness strategies. Capacities for emergency response were strengthened by training key staff, developing a robust surveillance system, and setting up a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and biobank. Resource provision, in terms of finances and trained personnel for emergencies was prioritized by the government. With the onset of COVID-19, Lagos state was able to respond promptly to the outbreak using the centralized Incident Command Structure and the key activities of the Emergency Operations Centre. Contributory to effective response were partnerships with the private sectors, community engagement and political commitment. CONCLUSION: Using the lessons learned from the 2014 Ebola outbreak, Lagos State had gradually prepared its healthcare system for a pandemic such as COVID-19. The State needs to continue to expand its preparedness to be more resilient and future proof to respond to disease outbreaks. Looking beyond intra-state gains, lessons and identified best practices from the past and present should be shared with other states and countries.","Abayomi, Akin; Balogun, Mobolanle R.; Bankole, Munir; Banke-Thomas, Aduragbemi; Mutiu, Bamidele; Olawepo, John; Senjobi, Morakinyo; Odukoya, Oluwakemi; Aladetuyi, Lanre; Ejekam, Chioma; Folarin, Akinsanya; Emmanuel, Madonna; Amodu, Funke; Ologun, Adesoji; Olusanya, Abosede; Bakare, Moses; Alabi, Abiodun; Abdus-Salam, Ismail; Erinosho, Eniola; Bowale, Abimbola; Omilabu, Sunday; Saka, Babatunde; Osibogun, Akin; Wright, Ololade; Idris, Jide; Ogunsola, Folasade",Global Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34243790/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-021-00728-x,7

Most of these toxicities develop insidiously. However, in rare cases, these toxicities manifest with more acute symptoms. We present an unusual case of amiodarone toxicity which manifested with multiorgan failure and systemic inflammatory response syndrome that mimicked sepsis. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man who was being treated with chronic oral amiodarone for atrial fibrillation presented with flu-like symptoms and fever, pulmonary infiltrate, acute kidney injury, and thrombocytopenia. The patient did not improve with antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. The results of an extensive infectious and non-infectious workup were negative. His symptoms worsened during hospitalization, which correlated with the loading of intravenous amiodarone given for his acute worsening of atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone-induced drug toxicity was contemplated by the treating medical team. Amiodarone was stopped, and the patient was treated with steroids, which improved his symptoms and organ dysfunctions. Subsequent bronchoscopy with lung biopsy showed foamy macrophages with organizing pneumonia and fibrinoid changes. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights an atypical and rare presentation of a complication of chronic amiodarone use that presented with acute onset of fever, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and multiorgan failure masquerading as sepsis. The patient’s symptoms and organ dysfunctions improved with the discontinuation of amiodarone and institution of steroids.","Kugasia, Irfanali R.; Ijaz, Mohsin; Khan, Ahsan; Jasti, Yashwanth",Am J Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095757/; https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.926929,7

After a long calm of many years, an unexpected eruption of the Cat Que Virus in China is a source of our concern. Cat Que Virus is an Arbovirus and belongs to the Simbu serogroup of the Orthobunyavirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family. The Simbu serogroup is an extremely diverse group of Arbovirus. The arboviruses are causing the infection in multiple hosts including humans and various livestock. They can cause mild to life-threatening infections. Arboviruses expand their spectrum and are more observable in recent times. Human actions have the most significant geophysical impact on the environment. Changes in rainfall patterns, floods, and the risk of extreme weather events are all consequences of climate change. These events may be connected to the extension of permissive vectors, geographic ranges, and therefore provide more chance of growth and spread of potential vector. Arboviruses are responsible for the health hazard to millions of people globally. It is critical to concentrate research and surveillance on these emerging and re-emerging viruses, particularly arthropod-borne viral infections. The appropriate research and surveillance on them will help us for the development of effective control and treatment strategies and also reduce health problems.

662110,Emergency front-of-neck airway in the COVID-19 patient: cannula or surgical cricothyroidotomy?,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: While the evidence supporting the effectiveness of community health worker (CHW) programmes is substantial, there is also considerable evidence that many of these programmes have notable weaknesses that need to be addressed in order for them to reach their full potential. Thus, considerations about CHW programme performance and its assessment must be taken into account as the importance of these programmes is becoming more widely appreciated. In this paper, the tenth in our 11-paper series, “Community health workers at the dawn of a new era”, we address CHW programme performance and how it is assessed from a systems perspective. METHODS: The paper builds on the 2014 CHW Reference Guide, a compendium of case studies of 29 national CHW programmes, the 2018 WHO guideline on health policy and system support to optimize CHW programmes, and scientific studies on CHW programme performance published in the past 5 years. RESULTS: The paper provides an overview of existing frameworks that are useful for assessing the performance of CHW programmes, with a specific focus on how individual CHW performance and community-level outcomes can be measured. The paper also reviews approaches that have been taken to assess CHW programme performance, from programme monitoring using the routine health information system to national assessments using quantitative and/or qualitative study designs and assessment checklists. The paper also discusses contextual factors that influence CHW programme performance, and reflects upon gaps and needs for the future with regard to assessment of CHW programme performance. CONCLUSION: Assessments of CHW programme performance can have various approaches and foci according to the programme and its context. Given the fact that CHW programmes are complex entities and part of health systems, their assessment ideally needs to be based on data derived from a mix of reliable sources.

The unique and novel genetic makeup of SARS-CoV-2 has been created puzzle in biological research, due to which the potential drug/vaccine candidates have not yet been discovered by the scientific community. Meanwhile, the advantages of bioinformatics in viral research had created a milestone since last few decades. The exploitation of bioinformatics tools and techniques has successfully interpreted this viral genomics architecture. Some major in silico studies involving next-generation sequencing, genome-wide association studies, computer-aided drug design etc. have been effectively applied in COVID-19 research methodologies and discovered novel information on SARS-CoV-2 in several ways. Nowadays the implementation of in silico studies in COVID-19 research has not only sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome but also properly analyzed the sequencing errors, evolutionary relationship, genetic variations, putative drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 viral genes etc. within a very short time period. These would be very needful towards further research on COVID-19 pandemic and essential for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 which will save public health.","Ray, Manisha; Sable, Mukund Namdev; Sarkar, Saurav; Hallur, Vinay Kumar",Meta Gene,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214540020301997; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214540020301997?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349792/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mgene.2020.100844,7

In most of the countries, Covid‐19 upsurge is uncontrolled with a significant mortality rate. Currently no treatment effective for Covid‐19 is available in the form of vaccines or antiviral drugs and patients are currently treated symptomatically. Although majority of the patients develop mild symptoms and recover without mechanical ventilation for respiratory management, severe respiratory illness develops in a significant portion of affected patients and may result in death. While the scientific community is working to develop vaccines and drugs against Covid‐19 pandemic, novel alternative therapies may reduce mortality rate. Recent use of stem cells for critically ill Covid‐19 patients in a small group of patients in China and subsequent Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of stem cells by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to GIOSTAR (Global Institute of Stem Cell Therapy and Research) and Athersys has created excitement among medical community. As a result, several clinical trials have been registered using stem cells for Covid‐19 treatment that aim to use different cell sources, dosage and importantly diverse targeted patient groups.

Here we have utilized the Caputo time-fractional derivatives and mechanical laws (generalized shear stress constitutive equation and generalized Fourier’s and Fick’s laws) are being used to fractionalize the presented model. The effects of radiative heat flux, Ohmic dissipation, and internal absorption are presented through generalized Fourier’s law while Fick’s law or mass transfer equation offers the effects of first order chemically reactive species. The finite element method and finite difference method are being utilized to numerically solve the nonlinear coupled differential equations. It is established, through compression of numerical and analytical solutions, that the presented model is convergent. Further, error analysis of the subject model is also carried out. Moreover, for better illustration of results, we have also offered a graphical and tabular presentation of impacts of the parameters of interest on velocity, temperature, concentration profile, local skin friction coefficient, and heat and mass transfer. It is evident from the obtained results that velocity near and away from the surface increases with the enhancement of fractional derivative parameter whereas an opposite trend is observed in the case of temperature. Furthermore, it is noticed that temperature shows a decreasing behavior for the value [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , on the other hand entirely opposite trend is witnessed for [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] . From an engineering perspective, we have acquired comprehensive outcomes such that the heat transfer offers an increasing trend in the case of T(R) and thermal fractional parameter [Formula: see text] . Additionally, the chemical reaction parameter and Sc significantly contribute towards the mass transfer rate. Since, in literature, one cannot refer to such results with non-integer Caputo fractional derivatives thus the results obtained through the current assessment hold significance for future research avenues. Moreover, the numerical inferences of the subject study may contribute to an advanced thermal processing method in the food industry to swiftly increase the temperature for cooking or sterilization drives.","Khan, Mumtaz; Rasheed, Amer",Int J Appl Comput Math,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40819-021-01027-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34056052/,7

An Entrustable Professional Activities guided framework,2020-08-13,"Development of the mammary gland requires the coordinated action of proteolytic enzymes during two phases of remodelling. Firstly, new ducts and side-branches thereof need to be established during pregnancy to generate an extensive ductal tree allowing the secretion and transport of milk. A second wave of remodelling occurs during mammary involution after weaning. We have analysed the role of the cell surface protease aminopeptidase N (Anpep, APN, CD13) during these processes using Anpep deficient and Anpep over-expressing mice. We find that APN deficiency significantly delays mammary gland morphogenesis during gestation. The defect is characterised by a reduction in alveolar buds and duct branching at mid-pregnancy. Conversely over-expression of Anpep leads to accelerated ductal development. This indicates that Anpep plays a critical role in the proteolytic remodelling of mammary tissue during adult mammary development.","Kolb, Andreas F.; Sorrell, David; Lassnig, Caroline; Lillico, Simon; Carlisle, Ailsa; Neil, Claire; Robinson, Claire; Müller, Mathias; Whitelaw, C.

Recent studies suggested blood cells participate in the maintenance of HTN. Platelets—anucleated cell fragments derived from megakaryocytes—exert diverse functions, including their well-characterized role in the formation of hemostatic clots. However, platelets from patients with HTN exhibit altered membrane lipid and protein compositions that impact platelet function and lead to formation of aggregates and vascular obstructions. Here, for the first time, we have identified, by proteomic analyses, the most relevant 11 proteins that show the greatest difference in their expression in platelets derived from patients with HTN, in comparison with those from normotensive individuals. These proteins are involved in cytoskeletal organization and the coagulation cascade that contributes to platelet activation, release of granule contents, and aggregation, which culminate in thrombus formation. These results have important implications in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of HTN, and in consequence, the development of new strategies to counteract the cardiovascular disorders associated with constitutive activation of platelets in HTN.","Armenta-Medina, Yobana; Martínez-Vieyra, Ivette; Medina-Contreras, Oscar; Benitez-Cardoza, Claudia G.; Jiménez-Pineda, Albertana; Reyes-López, César A.; Cerecedo, Doris",J Hum Hypertens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218268/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41371-021-00555-y,7

The oral microbiome plays a role in the gastro-intestinal carcinogenesis and fusobacteria are the most investigated bacteria involved. This paper aims to review the current knowledge and report the preliminary data on salivary levels of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Candida albicans in subjects with different gastro-intestinal conditions or pathologies, in order to determine any differences. The null hypothesis was “subjects with different gastro-intestinal diseases do not show significant differences in the composition of the oral microbiota”. Twenty-one subjects undergoing esophagastroduodenoscopy or colonscopy were recruited. For each subject, a salivary sample was collected before the endoscopy procedure, immediately stored at −20 °C and subsequently used for genomic bacterial DNA extraction by real-time PCR. Low levels of F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis were peculiar in the oral microbiota in subjects affected by Helicobater pylori-negative chronic gastritis without cancerization and future studies will elucidate this association. The level of C. albicans did not statistically differ among groups. This preliminary study could be used in the future, following further investigation, as a non-invasive method for the search of gastrointestinal diseases and associated markers.","Contaldo, Maria; Fusco, Alessandra; Stiuso, Paola; Lama, Stefania; Gravina, Antonietta Gerarda; Itro, Annalisa; Federico, Alessandro; Itro, Angelo; Dipalma, Gianna; Inchingolo, Francesco; Serpico, Rosario; Donnarumma, Giovanna",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069179/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9051064,7

In this study, global COVID‐19 data were used to examine the dynamical variations from the perspectives of immunity and contact of 84 countries across the five climate regions: tropical, arid, temperate, and cold. A new approach named Yi Hua Jie Mu is proposed to obtain the transmission rates based on the COVID‐19 data between the countries with the same climate region over the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Our results suggest that the COVID‐19 pandemic will persist over a long period of time or enter into regular circulation in multiple periods of 1–2 years. Moreover, based on the simulated results by the COVID‐19 data, it is found that the temperate and cold climate regions have higher infection rates than the tropical and arid climate regions, which indicates that climate may modulate the transmission of COVID‐19. The role of the climate on the COVID‐19 variations should be concluded with more data and more cautions.

Specifically, we must deeply re‐evaluate how scientists and clinicians think about race in the transplant context, and we must actively shift our efforts from merely observing disparities to acknowledging and acting on racism as a root cause underlying the vast majority of these disparities.

677250,"Cultivating Empathy and Soft Skills Among Intensive Care Residents: Effects of a Mandatory, Simulation-Based, Experiential Training",2021-08-13,"ABSTRACT: The continuous emergence of infectious pathogens along with antimicrobial resistance creates a need for an alternative approach to treat infectious diseases. Targeting host factor(s) which are critically involved in immune signaling pathways for modulation of host immunity offers to treat a broad range of infectious diseases. Upon pathogen-associated ligands binding to the Toll-like/ IL-1R family, and other cellular receptors, followed by recruitment of intracellular signaling adaptor proteins, primarily MyD88, trigger the innate immune responses. But activation of host innate immunity strongly depends on the correct function of MyD88 which is tightly regulated. Dysregulation of MyD88 may cause an imbalance that culminates to a wide range of inflammation-associated syndromes and diseases. Furthermore, recent reports also describe that MyD88 upregulation with many viral infections is linked to decreased antiviral type I IFN response, and MyD88-deficient mice showed an increase in survivability. These reports suggest that MyD88 is also negatively involved via MyD88-independent pathways of immune signaling for antiviral type I IFN response. Because of its expanding role in controlling host immune signaling pathways, MyD88 has been recognized as a potential drug target in a broader drug discovery paradigm. Targeting BB-loop of MyD88, small molecule inhibitors were designed by structure-based approach which by blocking TIR–TIR domain homo-dimerization have shown promising therapeutic efficacy in attenuating MyD88-mediated inflammatory impact, and increased antiviral type I IFN response in experimental mouse model of diseases. In this review, we highlight the reports on MyD88-linked immune response and MyD88-targeted therapeutic approach with underlying mechanisms for controlling inflammation and antiviral type I IFN response. HIGHLIGHTS: • Host innate immunity is activated upon PAMPs binding to PRRs followed by immune signaling through TIR domain–containing adaptor proteins mainly MyD88. • Structure-based approach led to develop small-molecule inhibitors which block TIR domain homodimerization of MyD88 and showed therapeutic efficacy in limiting severe inflammation-associated impact in mice. • Therapeutic intervention of MyD88 also showed an increase in antiviral effect with strong type I IFN signaling linked to increased phosphorylation of IRFs via MyD88–independent pathway. • MyD88 inhibitors might be potentially useful as a small-molecule therapeutics for modulation of host immunity against inflammatory diseases and antiviral therapy. • However, prior clinical use of more in-depth efforts should be focused for suitability of the approach in deploying to complex diseases including COPD and COVID-19 in limiting inflammation-associated syndrome to infection.","Saikh, Kamal U.",Immunol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-021-09188-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834387/,7
678857,Effects of intensive care unit ambient sounds on healthcare professionals: results of an online survey and noise exposure in an experimental setting,2020-07-23,"The capsid precursor P1 constitutes the N-terminal part of the enterovirus polyprotein. It is processed into VP0, VP3, and VP1 by the viral proteases, and VP0 is cleaved autocatalytically into VP4 and VP2. We observed that poliovirus VP0 is recognized by an antibody against a cellular autophagy protein, LC3A. The LC3A-like epitope overlapped the VP4/VP2 cleavage site. Individually expressed VP0-EGFP and P1 strongly colocalized with a marker of selective autophagy, p62/SQSTM1. To assess the role of capsid proteins in autophagy development we infected different cells with poliovirus or encapsidated polio replicon coding for only the replication proteins. We analyzed the processing of LC3B and p62/SQSTM1, markers of the initiation and completion of the autophagy pathway and investigated the association of the viral antigens with these autophagy proteins in infected cells. We observed cell-type-specific development of autophagy upon infection and found that only the virion signal strongly colocalized with p62/SQSTM1 early in infection. Collectively, our data suggest that activation of autophagy is not required for replication, and that capsid proteins contain determinants targeting them to p62/SQSTM1-dependent sequestration. Such a strategy may control the level of capsid proteins so that viral RNAs are not removed from the replication/translation pool prematurely.","Zimina, Anna; Viktorova, Ekaterina G.; Moghimi, Seyedehmahsa; Nchoutmboube, Jules; Belov, George A.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452452/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081587,7

The prevalence of hyponatremia associated with coronavirus disease 2019 and the impact on outcome is unknown. We aimed to identify the prevalence, predictors, and impact on outcome of mild, moderate, and severe admission hyponatremia compared with normonatremia among coronavirus disease 2019 patients. DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study. SETTING: Four New York City hospitals that are part of the same health network. PATIENTS: Hospitalized, laboratory-confirmed adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients admitted between March 1, 2020, and May 13, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hyponatremia was categorized as mild (sodium: 130–134 mmol/L), moderate (sodium: 121–129 mmol/L), or severe (sodium: ≤ 120 mmol/L) versus normonatremia (135–145 mmol/L). The primary outcome was the association of increasing severity of hyponatremia and in-hospital mortality assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Secondary outcomes included encephalopathy, acute renal failure, mechanical ventilation, and discharge home compared across sodium levels using Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. In exploratory analysis, the association of sodium levels and interleukin-6 levels (which has been linked to nonosmotic release of vasopressin) was assessed. Among 4,645 patient encounters, hyponatremia (sodium < 135 mmol/L) occurred in 1,373 (30%) and 374 of 1,373 (27%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Mild, moderate, and severe hyponatremia occurred in 1,032 (22%), 305 (7%), and 36 (1%) patients, respectively. Each level of worsening hyponatremia conferred 43% increased odds of in-hospital death after adjusting for age, gender, race, body mass index, past medical history, admission laboratory abnormalities, admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, renal failure, encephalopathy, and mechanical ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08–1.88; p = 0.012). Increasing severity of hyponatremia was associated with encephalopathy, mechanical ventilation, and decreased probability of discharge home (all p < 0.001). Higher interleukin-6 levels correlated with lower sodium levels (p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Hyponatremia occurred in nearly a third of coronavirus disease 2019 patients, was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, and was associated with increased risk of encephalopathy and mechanical ventilation.","Frontera, Jennifer A.; Valdes, Eduard; Huang, Joshua; Lewis, Ariane; Lord, Aaron S.; Zhou, Ting; Kahn, D.
