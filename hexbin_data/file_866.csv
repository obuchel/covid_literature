101575,The impact of the built environment on health behaviours and disease transmission in social systems.,2018,"Interindividual variability in outcomes across individuals poses great challenges for the application of noninvasive brain stimulation in psychological research. Here, we examined how the effects of high-frequency transcranial random-noise stimulation (tRNS) on sustained attention varied as a function of a well-studied electrocortical marker: spontaneous theta:beta ratio. Seventy-two participants received sham, 1-mA, and 2-mA tRNS in a double-blind, crossover manner while they performed a sustained-attention task. Receiving 1-mA tRNS was associated with improved sustained attention, whereas the effect of 2-mA tRNS was similar to the effect of sham tRNS. Furthermore, individuals' baseline theta:beta ratio moderated the effects of 1-mA tRNS and provided explanatory power beyond baseline behavioral performance. The tRNS-related effects on sustained attention were also accompanied by reductions in theta:beta ratio. These findings impart novel insights into mechanisms underlying tRNS effects and emphasize how designing studies that link variability in cognitive outcomes to variability in neurophysiology can improve inferential power in neurocognitive research.","Harty, Siobhán; Cohen Kadosh, Roi",Psychological science,https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797619856658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31322974/,866

The authors hypothesized that recreation of the tendinous insertion of the linea alba through components separation results in expansion of the rectus muscle with potential atrophy of the external obliques. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective study analyzing preoperative and long-term postoperative computed tomographic scans for consecutive patients undergoing bilateral components separation at a single institution over a 5-year period. Standardized measurements (area, width, and thickness) were recorded for the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis at the L3-L4 level on axial imaging. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients with a mean time to follow-up computed tomographic scan of 17.4±1.6 months were reviewed. After reconstruction of the linea alba, the right and left rectus muscles significantly increased in area (right, 38.8±6.3 percent; left, 35.7±6.6 percent; p<0.0001) and width (right, 51.8±9.9 percent; left, 39.9±7.4 percent; p<0.0001) while decreasing in thickness (right, -17.8±7.8 percent; left, -12.8±5.0 percent; p≤0.02). The right and left external oblique muscles significantly decreased in area (right, -10.7±4.7 percent; left, -8.92±4.01 percent; p≤0.03). In contrast, the internal oblique (right, 21.6±4.9 percent; left, 16.4±4.5 percent; p≤0.001) and transversus abdominis (right, 23.0±4.7 percent; left, 24.2±6.2 percent; p<0.0001) muscles increased significantly in area following surgery. CONCLUSIONS Reestablishing the midline with components separation results in expansion of the rectus muscle, atrophy of the external oblique muscle, and presumed compensatory hypertrophy of the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Future studies are needed to determine the functional implications of these changes.

METHODS The purpose of this study was to analyze our initial experience with SPIDER(®) sleeve gastrectomy and to present the technical details of this new minimally invasive approach, performed in ten patients at the La Casamance Private Hospital between November 2012 and April 2013. All patients were reviewed at scheduled post-operative consultations at 1, 3 and 6 months. In addition to clinical examination, the post-operative consultation at one month also included a satisfaction survey using the Moorehead-Ardelt questionnaire. RESULTS An initial series of ten sleeve gastrectomies were performed in female patients with a mean age of 41.5 years (range: 2-52). The mean BMI was 40.11 (range: 37.25-44.3). The intervention was performed through a single trocar in all patients with no ""conversion"" to classic laparoscopy or open surgery. The mean operative time was 61 ± 15.22 minutes (SD=standard deviation) (range: 43-96 min). The mean BMI at one month was 35.5 (SD:± 3.58, SEM: ± 1.13) (SEM=standard error of mean) with an average percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) of 32.9% (SD:± 8.56%, SEM:± 2.71%). The mean BMI at three months was 32.4 (SD: ± 2.78, SEM: ± 0.88) with an average %EWL of 52.7% (SD: ± 8.64%, SEM: ± 2.73%). The mean BMI at six months was 29.9 (SD:± 2.60, SEM: ± 0.98) with a mean %EWL of 68.8% (SD: ± 8.38%, SEM:± 3.17%). Complete remission of co-morbid conditions was observed in four patients, improvement in three others, and no change in a single patient. The mean duration of hospitalization was 3.1 days. The mean follow-up period was 161 days (SD:± 57.4 days, range: 90-243 days). There was no mortality and no intra-operative and post-operative complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS The SPIDER(®) surgical platform seems to be a usable and effective method for performance of minimally invasive single-access sleeve gastrectomy, offering an easy and efficient operative procedure compared to other single-port systems. Prospective long-term studies are recommended before this approach can be validated to be of comparable efficiency to conventional multi-port laparoscopic surgery.","Noel, P; Nedelcu, M; Gagner, M",Journal of visceral surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviscsurg.2014.01.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559683/,866

Introduction to the theme issue, part 2.",2021-08-16,"The advance of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies allows high-throughput genotyping at a reasonable cost, although, in the case of peach, this technology has been scarcely developed. To date, only a standard Genotyping by Sequencing approach (GBS), based on a single restriction with ApeKI to reduce genome complexity, has been applied in peach. In this work, we assessed the performance of the double-digest RADseq approach (ddRADseq), by testing 6 double restrictions with the restriction profile generated with ApeKI. The enzyme pair PstI/MboI retained the highest number of loci in concordance with the in silico analysis. Under this condition, the analysis of a diverse germplasm collection (191 peach genotypes) yielded 200,759,000 paired-end (2 × 250 bp) reads that allowed the identification of 113,411 SNP, 13,661 InDel and 2133 SSR.

Hepatic injury was manifested in CCl4 group by elevation of biochemical parameters; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hepatic fibrosis was evident histopathologically by increased METAVIR score and immunostaining expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), also, increased liver tissue oxidative stress parameters, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Linagliptin was able to stop the progression of liver fibrosis; evident histopathologically with reduced METAVIR score and α-SMA expression. The possible mechanism may be via suppression of oxidative stress, TGF-β1, and mTOR, this was associated with improvement of serum biochemical parameters; ALT and AST. In conclusion, linagliptin might help to protect the liver against persistent injury-related consequences.","Abd Elmaaboud, Maaly; Khattab, Haidy; Shalaby, Shahinaz",Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1139/cjpp-2020-0049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726558/,866

This paper analyses how the lockdown affected electricity generation in European countries and how it will reshape future energy generation. Monthly electricity generation from total renewables and non-renewables in France, Germany, Spain, Turkey, and the UK from January 2017 to September 2020 were evaluated and compared. Four seasonal grey prediction models and three machine learning methods were used for forecasting;the quarterly results are presented to the end of 2021. Additionally, the share of electricity generation from renewables in total electricity generation from 2017 to 2021 for the selected countries was compared. Electricity generation from total non-renewables in the second quarter of 2020 for France, Germany, Spain, and the UK decreased by 21%–25% compared to the same period of 2019;the decline in Turkey was approximately 11%. Additionally, electricity generation from non-renewables in the third quarter of 2020 for all countries, except Turkey, decreased compared to the same period of the previous year. All grey prediction models and support vector machine method forecast that the share of renewables in total electricity generation will increase continuously in France, Germany, Spain, and the UK to the end of 2021. The forecasting methods provided by this study open new avenues for research on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the future of the energy sector.","Şahin, Utkucan Ballı Serkan Chen Yan",Applied Energy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.117540,866

One plausible outcome of this approach is that students may feel ownership of their projects. We define ownership as a dynamic relationship between students and their projects characterized by three student-project interactions that evolve over three project phases. Student-project interactions include students' contributions to, emotional responses to, and new understanding of the project. Phases include choosing the topic and team, carrying out the research, and creating and presenting end-of-project deliverables. Drawing on interviews with students collected as part of a multi-year, multi-institutional study, this paper will elaborate on the evolution of students' own new knowledge about the project across different project phases. Throughout our work, we compare the type of ownership that manifests when students work on projects in a lab course to the type of ownership gardeners feel when tending to plots in a community garden. We end with recommendations for instructors wishing to foster project ownership in their lab courses.","Lassen, Ira Ch'e; Arielle-Evans, Acacia; R'ios, Laura; Lewandowski, H.

184240,[The Leon Fredericq Foundation against COVID-19 in Liege].,2020,"Abstract Research in this article presents a computational analysis of effects of defects in 2.5D lattice structures fabricated by Additive Manufacturing (AM). Components resulting from AM often suffer from rough surfaces and porosity defects. This complicates their response which must be understood for their service deployment. The core of the methodology used in this research is a workflow for generating various defects such as surface roughness and porosity analogous to those that naturally result from AM-fabricated lattices. Surface roughness is introduced by either discretizing a sinusoidal function or fitting experimental roughness data by Fourier Transforms. Porosity defects are implemented by drawing ellipses with assigned center position, radius and aspect ratio. A plane stress Finite Element Method (FEM) model is used under a uniform displacement boundary condition. Stress-strain and stiffness of the lattices are characterized as a function of the implanted defect. This methodology enables characterization of the effect of: (i) surface roughness, (ii) porosity defect density, (iii) porosity defect size, and (iv) algorithms with which random defects can be generated in simulated specimens. Effectiveness of this workflow also provides an efficient way to generate an adequate data pool for future machine learning and other data processing work.","Jiang, Panwei; Rifat, Mustafa; Basu, Saurabh",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920315663; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920315663,866

184922,[Management of emergency department inflows during the COVID-19 outbreak in the CHU of Liege : efficiency of an advanced triage center].,2020,"Background Daily testing using a rapid Lateral Flow Device (LFD) has been suggested as an alternative to self-isolation. A randomised trial comparing daily contact testing (DCT) in schools with self-isolation found that SARS-CoV-2 transmission within school was comparable and low in both groups. However, if this approach is to be adopted widely, it is critical that we understand the perspective of those who will be delivering and receiving DCT. The aim of this qualitative process study embedded in the randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to improve understanding of a range of behavioural factors that could influence implementation. Methods Interviews were conducted with 63 participants, including staff, students, and parents of students who had been identified as being in close contact with someone with COVID-19. The topic guide explored perceptions of daily testing, understanding of positive and negative test results, and adherence to guidance. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Results Results were organised under three main headings: (1) factors influencing daily testing (2) interpretation of test results (3) behaviour during testing period. Participants recognized that daily testing may allow students to remain in school, which was viewed as necessary for both education and social needs. Whilst some felt safer as a result of daily testing, others raised concerns about safety. Participants did not always understand how to interpret and respond to test results, and although participants reported high levels of adherence to the guidance, improved communications were desired. Conclusion Daily testing may be a feasible and acceptable alternative to self-isolation among close contacts of people who test positive. However, improved communications are needed to ensure that all students and parents have a good understanding of the rationale for testing, what test results mean, how test results should be acted on, and how likely students are to test positive following close contact. Support is needed for students and parents of students who have to self-isolate and for those who have concerns about the safety of daily testing.","Denford, S.; Towler, L.; Ali, B.; Treneman-Evans, G.; Bloomer, R.; Peto, T.

Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.","Schreiber, Sebastian J.; Ke, Ruian; Loverdo, Claude; Park, Miran; Ahsan, Prianna; Lloyd-Smith, James O.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/066688,866

The comparison of our sequence data with the sequence of the same ORF of BCV Quebec strain previously published revealed a major difference in the length of the C-terminal part of the NS2 protein. In vitro transcription and translation of ORF2 resulted in the synthesis of a single protein migrating with a Mr of 31 kDa. The ORF2 was fused in frame with the glutathione S transferase gene (GSH) in the pGEX vector. The fusion protein was synthesized as inclusion bodies which were concentrated and used to raise a monospecific antiserum. Alternatively the fusion protein was solubilized, purified by affinity chromatography and cleaved with Factor Xa to yield pure recombinant NS2. The ORF2 was also expressed in the baculovirus system and the recombinant proteins expressed in pro- and eukaryotic systems were compared on the basis of their size and immunoreactivity. Immunoprecipitation performed with the monospecific antiserum allowed us to identify NS2 in HRT18 infected cells, to follow its kinetic of synthesis, and to ascertain that NS2 was not incorporated in the virion as a minor structural component.","Boireau, P; Madelaine, M F; Saulnier, D; Laporte, J; Vautherot, J F",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209773/,866

METHODS The detail data of 1 278 SARS patients and borderline cases were collected. Four hundred and two confirmed SARS cases were recruited in our study. Out of them, 358 cases were assigned to the severe SARS group based on the criteria issued by Ministry of Health. Subjects who received steroid (which was converted into methylprednisolone) treatment were further divided into three groups: small dose group (<80 mg/day); moderate dose group (80-320 mg/day); high dose group (>or=320 mg/day). A Logistic regression model was applied to investigate the outcome variables:death, complications, subsequent lung infection and other infections and COX regression was made. RESULTS (1) Small dose of steroid seemed to have protective effect, but it did not reach significant level. (2) COX regression revealed that steroid was not related to instant mortality rate. (3) Length of stay in hospital of patients steroid usage in medium dosage seemed to be 0.619 time less risky than in patients without steroid usage (chi (2)=7.262, P=0.007), and that in patients with immunomodulator (including gamma globulin, thymic peptide and interferon) was 0.671 time less risky than in patients without immunomodulator (chi (2)=10.252, P=0.001). (4)Incidence of infections in patients with steroid was 3.095 times higher than in patients without steroid (chi (2)=4.289, P=0.038). CONCLUSION There is no significant difference in mortality, instant death incidence between steroid treatment and non-steroid treatment group of SARS patients diagnosed with the diagnostic criteria issued by Ministry of Health. However, steroid seem to shorten the length of hospital stay. But attention should be paid that infection rate could be increased in such cases.","Xu, Yuan-da; Jiang, Mei; Chen, Rong-Chang; Fang, Ji-Qian",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18279590/,866

Both viruses induced the secretion of neutralizing antibodies of different classes in the sows' milk, but these protected suckling piglets against TGEV to different degrees. Quantitative differences in the induction of IgA by both viruses were found among the different viral antigenic sites and subsites of glycoprotein S. In TGEV-vaccinated sows, antigenic subsite A was the best inducer of IgA, followed by antigenic site D. After vaccination with PRCV, lower levels of IgA were detected on colostrum and milk, antigenic site D and subsite Ab being the immunodominant sites. This quantitative difference in epitope recognition could explain the differences in newborn piglet protection found using Ig classes purified from the milk of sows immunized with both viruses. Apparently only IgA recognizing at least antigenic sites A and D confers good protection in vivo, whereas any Ig class recognizing only one antigenic site may neutralize the virus in cell culture. These results indicate that the formulation of a subunit vaccine against TGEV has to consider the inclusion of more than one antigenic site involved in virus neutralization.","De Diego, M; Rodríguez, F; Alcaraz, C; Gómez, N; Alonso, C; Escribano, J M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7523577/,866

METHODS Data from the national prescription databases comprising the entire population of Denmark, Norway and Sweden between 2007 and 2015 were used to assess prescription medicine use and sold amount (in defined daily doses (DDDs)) of tramadol, other opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RESULTS From 2007 to 2015 the prevalence of tramadol users increased in Denmark from 45 to 52 per 1,000 residents, and in Norway from 20 to 41 per 1,000 residents. In Sweden, the prevalence decreased from 36 to 17 per 1,000 residents. In comparison, the prevalence of other opioid users decreased in Denmark and Norway, but increased in Sweden. During the study period, there were more female than male tramadol users in all three countries, and the prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age. The average tramadol DDD per treated patient remained fairly constant in Norway, while it increased in Denmark and Sweden. In Denmark and Norway, women received a higher DDD than men. The amount of sold tramadol and other opioids combined per 1,000 residents was highest in Denmark. CONCLUSIONS From 2007 to 2015, the prescription patterns of tramadol and other opioids differed between the three countries. Tramadol was generally used more frequently by women. Women received higher DDD then men in Norway and Denmark, but not in Sweden. The prevalence of tramadol users tended to increase with age in all countries. FUNDING none.

Nine chicken and six turkey flocks from Croatian farms were tested for parvovirus presence. Intestinal samples from one turkey and seven chicken flocks were found positive, and were sequenced. Natural parvovirus infection was more frequently detected in chickens than in turkeys examined in this study. Sequence analysis of 400 nucleotide fragments of the nonstructural gene (NS) showed that our sequences had more similarity with chicken parvovirus (ChPV) (92.3%-99.7%) than turkey parvovirus (TuPV) (89.5%-98.9%) strains. Phylogenetic analysis grouped our sequences in two clades. Also, the higher prevalence of ChPV than TuPV in tested flocks was defined. The necropsy findings suggested a malabsorption syndrome followed by a preascitic condition.

We selected these POEMs through a crowdsourcing strategy of the daily POEMs information service for the Canadian Medical Association's physician members. We present recommendations from these top POEMs of primary research or meta-analysis that identify interventions to encourage or consider avoiding in practice. The recommendations cover musculoskeletal conditions (e.g., do not recommend platelet-rich plasma injections for rotator cuff disease or knee osteoarthritis), respiratory disease (e.g., in clinically stable patients with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotics can be stopped after five days), screening or preventive care (e.g., patients who take their blood pressure at home or in a pharmacy should know what to do when they have an elevated reading), and miscellaneous topics (e.g., in healthy adults treated for dermatophyte infection, do not obtain baseline or follow-up alanine transaminase level, aspartate transaminase level, or complete blood count). These POEMs describe interventions whose benefits are not superior to other options, are sometimes more expensive, or put patients at increased risk of harm.

DESIGN Analysis of recipient myocardial tissue and serum from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and controls undergoing cardiac transplantation for end-stage cardiac disease. SETTING University virology department and transplantation unit. METHODS Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis of myocardial RNA and DNA; enterovirus-specific in situ hybridization; enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M detection. RESULTS Enterovirus RNA was detected in myocardial tissue from only a small proportion of (five of 75) hearts. However, although enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses were detected in 22 (28%) of 39 controls patients, a significantly higher prevalence was observed among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (22 (56%) of 39 patients; P < 0.005). All enteroviruses detected in myocardium showed greatest nucleotide sequence homology with coxsackievirus type B3. Detection of enterovirus RNA in myocardium by the polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridisation gave comparable results. Other potentially cardiotropic virus genomes, including human cytomegalovirus, influenzaviruses, and coronaviruses were not detected in myocardium. CONCLUSION This study found that enterovirus-specific immunoglobulin M responses provided the strongest evidence of enterovirus involvement in patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the high background prevalence of these responses limits their diagnostic value. The finding that enteroviruses detected in myocardium were coxsackievirus type B3 accords with recent findings in patients with acute myocarditis, and indicates that this serotype is the major cardiotropic human enterovirus.","Muir, P; Nicholson, F; Illavia, S J; McNeil, T S; Ajetunmobi, J F; Dunn, H; Starkey, W G; Reetoo, K N; Cary, N R; Parameshwar, J; Banatvala, J E",Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8868984/,866

This study focuses on the development of three-dimensional separated flow over the wing. We discuss the flow structures formed on the wing surface as well as in the far-field wake. Vorticity is introduced from the wing surface into the flow in a predominantly two-dimensional manner. The vortex sheet from the wing tip rolls up around the free end to form the tip vortex. At its inception, the tip vortex is weak and its effect is spatially confined. As the flow around the tip separates, the tip effects extend farther in the spanwise direction, generating noticeable three dimensionality in the wake. For low-aspect-ratio wings (), the wake remains stable due to the strong tip-vortex induced downwash over the entire span. Increasing the aspect ratio allows unsteady vortical flow to emerge away from the tip at sufficiently high angles of attack. These unsteady vortices shed and form closed vortical loops. For higher-aspect-ratio wings (), the tip effects retard the near-tip shedding process, which desynchronizes from the two-dimensional shedding over the midspan region, yielding vortex dislocation. At high angles of attack, the tip vortex exhibits noticeable undulations due to the strong interaction with the unsteady shedding vortices. The spanwise distribution of force coefficients is found to be related to the three-dimensional wake dynamics and the tip effects. Vortical elements in the wake that are responsible for the generation of lift and drag forces are identified through the force element analysis. We note that at high angles of attack, a stationary vortical structure forms at the leading edge near the tip, giving rise to locally high lift and drag forces. The analysis performed in this paper reveals how the vortical flow around the tip influences the separation physics, the global wake dynamics, and the spanwise force distributions.","Zhang, Kai; Hayostek, Shelby; Amitay, Michael; He, Wei; Theofilis, Vassilios; Taira, Kunihiko",J.

We also find that variation in NVPS is unique, in that it cannot be explained by variation in general speed, perceptual decision thresholds, short-term visual memory, or three networks of attention (alerting, orienting and executive). Finally, we find that NVPS is correlated with subjective measures of sensitivity, as they are measured by the Highly Sensitive Person scale.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among married men and women in the month of April 2020. Data regarding socio-demographic profile, domestic violence, and coping strategies used during lockdown were collected thorough Google Forms. A total of 97.9% of the forms were completely filled by the respondents. A descriptive analysis was done. RESULTS: Of 94 study participants, approximately 7.4% (n = 7) had faced domestic violence during lockdown. Of these 7 participants, approximately 85.7% (n = 6) reported increased frequency of domestic violence during lockdown. Approximately half of the victims chose to ignore it (57.1%; n = 4) or used yoga/meditation (42.9%; n = 3) to cope.

The interview technique was used to collect data. The data were collected through a semi-structured interview form developed by the researchers. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The study results showed that the ERE activity that teachers experienced the most was the online lessons. Teachers have done the ERE activities through various applications such as EIN (Education Information Network), Zoom, WhatsApp, YouTube. Teachers emphasized that ERE was ineffective due to low student participation, insufficient infrastructure, lack of responsibility and motivation for learning, low ICT competency of students and teachers, low socioeconomic status, and inappropriateness of planning and curriculums. In addition, teachers stated that education in the COVID-19 pandemic process should be done in diluted classrooms, hybrid or face to face. It is concluded that the lack of infrastructure, lack of responsibility and motivation for learning created inequality of opportunity for participation in ERE.

340440,A period of fears and challenges: Toward a better world?,2020,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and deadly disease, spreading worldwide. There are limited data about the clinical course of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients infected with COVID-19. However, previous cohort studies showed a high mortality rate of ESRD patients infected with COVID-19. We report here two Japanese ESRD patients confirmed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Case 1 was a 60-year-old man with ESRD due to diabetic nephropathy who were infected with COVID-19 and exhibited acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. He was treated with tocilizumab and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). After 6 days of treatment in ICU, he was extubated. Case 2 was a 68-year-old woman undergoing maintenance hemodialysis for 17 years who also exhibited ARDS due to COVID-19. Her clinical course resembles case 1. Our experience of these two cases indicates that anti-cytokine therapy might be effective for severe COVID-19 pneumonia in ESRD patients.","Abe, Tatsuki; Izumo, Takehiro; Ueda, Akihiro; Hayashi, Munehiro; Ishibashi, Yoshitaka",CEN case reports,,866

356725,Mental illnesses: the playground for new technologies,2021,"Widely reported statistics on Covid-19 across the globe fail to take account of both the uncertainty of the data and possible explanations for this uncertainty. In this article, we use a Bayesian Network (BN) model to estimate the Covid-19 infection prevalence rate ((Formula presented.)) and infection fatality rate ((Formula presented.)) for different countries and regions, where relevant data are available. This combines multiple sources of data in a single model. The results show that Chelsea Mass. USA and Gangelt Germany have relatively higher IPRs than Santa Clara USA, Kobe, Japan, and England and Wales. In all cases the infection prevalence is significantly higher than what has been widely reported, with much higher community infection rates in all locations. For Santa Clara and Chelsea, both in the USA, the most likely (Formula presented.) values are 0.3–0.4%. Kobe, Japan is very unusual in comparison with the others with values an order of magnitude less than the others at, 0.001%. The (Formula presented.) for Spain is centred around 1%. England and Wales lie between Spain and the USA/German values with an (Formula presented.) around 0.8%. There remains some uncertainty around these estimates but an (Formula presented.) greater than 1% looks remote for all regions/countries. We use a Bayesian technique called ‘virtual evidence’ to test the sensitivity of the (Formula presented.) to two significant sources of uncertainty: survey quality and uncertainty about Covid-19 death counts. In response the adjusted estimates for (Formula presented.) are most likely to be in the range 0.3–0.5%.","Neil, Martin; Fenton, Norman; Osman, Magda; McLachlan, Scott",J. Risk Res.,,866
357060,[Cardiology],2021,"The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has led to strict and generalized transmission prevention measures that may have changed the epidemiological landscape of common seasonal respiratory virus (CSRV). Through a prospective CSRV survey program conducted from 2016 onwards in allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) recipients with respiratory symptoms, we aimed to analyze and compare the epidemiology and characteristics of CSRV over three consecutive periods [from February 1 to September 30 of 2018 (P1), 2019 (P2), and 2020 (P3)]. CSRV screening was performed through multiplex PCR assays during the study period. We identified 188 consecutive allo-HSCT recipients with 406 episodes screened for CSRV during the study period, of which 147 developed 300 CSRV. In P1 and P2 we diagnosed 115 (38.3%) and 145 (48.3%) CSRV episodes, respectively, whereas in P3 only 40 (13.3%) episodes were detected (p < 0.001). During P3, we observed a reduction of 80.2% in Ev/Rh, 93.3% in RSV, 80% in hIV, 96.3% HPIV, 68.4% in hMPV, 77.7% in ADV, 100% in HBoV, and 53.6% in HCoV as compared to P1 and P2. Consequently, we also observed a decline in absolute numbers of lower respiratory tract disease (68.1%), co-infections (91.7%), and hospitalizations (72.6%) during P3. We diagnosed SARS-COV-2 in nine allo-HSCT recipients, representing 23% of all CSRV detections in that period. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a significant drop in CSRV circulation during the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in our allo-HSCT recipients, indicating that prevention measures in the general population are highly effective in reducing CSRV prevalence and its complications in immunocompromised patients.","De la Puerta, Rosalía; Montoro, Juan; Aznar, Carla; Lorenzo, Ignacio; González-Barberá, Eva María; Balaguer-Roselló, Aitana; Guerreiro, Manuel; Domínguez, Lara; Salavert, Miguel; Aguilar, Cristóbal; de la Rubia, Javier; Sanz, Jaime; Gómez, María Dolores; Piñana, José Luis",Bone marrow transplant,,866

Our results indicate that the risk spillover has reached the highest level during the COVID-19 period, compared to the pre-COVID period, which means that the COVID-19 pandemic enforced the risk spillover between U.S. stock markets and the remains assets. We confirm the economic benefit of diversification in both tranquil and crisis periods (e.g., a negative dynamic conditional correlation between the VIX and SP500). Moreover, the hedging analysis exhibits that the Dow Jones Islamic has the highest hedging effectiveness either before or during the recent COVID19 crisis, offering better resistance to uncertainty caused by unpredictable turmoil such as the COVID19 outbreak. Our finding may have some implications for portfolio managers and investors to reduce their exposure to the risk in their portfolio construction.","Yousfi, Mohamed Dhaoui Abderrazak Bouzgarrou Houssam",Journal of Risk and Financial Management,,866

Due to the number of options based on distance education, it is aimed to provide a higher quality to service users. One of the important methods to increase the quality of distance education services is SWOT analysis. SWOT Analysis enables organizations to see their strengths (S) and weaknesses (W) and position them according to Opportunity (O) and Threats (T) that may occur in the external environment. The method of this research is phenomenology, one of the qualitative research methods. The study group of the research was selected by purposeful sampling technique. The analysis forms were collected from the lecturers via digital mail on a voluntary basis. Therefore, the study reached 48 instructors teaching Turkish as a foreign language in different regions of Turkey. In the research, a SWOT analysis form (4 questions) was used to understand distance education practices. The data were analyzed using content analysis and descriptive analysis technique. According to the results, the strength of teaching Turkish as a foreign language in distance education is ""flexibility in time and place"" with a ratio of 58%. Again, ""flexibility in time and space"" was evaluated as an opportunity with a rate of 42%. The weakest aspect of teaching Turkish in distance education seems to be ""technical problems"" with a rate of 29%. The instructors rated the ""lack of the classroom environment"" as the biggest threat with 30%. Finally, it can be asserted that the findings of the study sheds light on distance education practices in the COVID-19 pandemic process in terms of teaching Turkish to foreigners.","Ustabulut, Mete Yusuf",Educational Policy Analysis and Strategic Research,,866

486167,[Swiss Precision and Global Predictions],2021,"CONTEXT: COVID-19 represents a global health emergency and infected patients with chronic diseases often present with a severe impairment. Adrenal insufficiency (AI) is supposed to be associated with an increased infection risk which could trigger an adrenal crisis. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms and complications in AI patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective case-control study. All patients were on active follow-up and lived in Lombardy, one of the most affected areas. PATIENTS: We enrolled 279 patients with primary and secondary AI and 112 controls (patients with benign pituitary lesions without hormonal alterations). All AI patients had been previously trained to modify their replacement therapy on stress doses. INTERVENTION: By administering a standardized questionnaire by phone, we collected data on COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and consequences. RESULTS: In February-April 2020, the prevalence of symptomatic patients (complaining at least one symptom of viral infection) was similar between the two groups (24% in AI and 22.3% in controls, p 0.79). Highly suggestive COVID-19 symptoms (at least two including fever and/or cough) also occurred equally in AI and controls (12.5% in both groups). No patient required hospitalization and no adrenal crisis was reported. Few nasopharyngeal swabs were performed (n=12) as indicated by sanitary regulations, limiting conclusions on the exact infection rate (two positive results in AI and none in controls, p 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: AI patients who are adequately treated and trained, seem to display the same incidence of COVID-19 suggestive symptoms and disease severity as controls.","Carosi, Giulia; Morelli, Valentina; Del Sindaco, Giulia; Serban, Andreea Liliana; Cremaschi, Arianna; Frigerio, Sofia; Rodari, Giulia; Profka, Eriselda; Indirli, Rita; Mungari, Roberta; Resi, Veronica; Orsi, Emanuela; Ferrante, Emanuele; Dolci, Alessia; Giavoli, Claudia; Arosio, Maura; Mantovani, Prof Giovanna",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,866

The study aimed to gather information about positive and negative attitudes towards TMH, perceptions and correlates based on the modality of care, and beliefs about the overall effectiveness of TMH as compared to face-to-face care. The current study is part of a larger mixed methods project utilizing a repeated cross-sectional design. An online survey was administered to a sample of 1448 mental health providers and included demographic and professional information, experiences with and perceptions of TMH prior to and during the COVID-19 Pandemic, as well as a brief measure of pandemic-related stress. The COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in an increased use of TMH in the study sample. During COVID-19, providers reported increased agreement with TMH being necessary, important, and effective for care delivery. Providers who primarily used video, compared with telephone, reported that TMH was more useful, satisfying, and effective. While negative attitude towards TMH was predicted only by prior attitudes and belief in TMH effectiveness, positive attitude towards TMH was also predicted by female sex and current level of pandemic related stress. TMH use during the pandemic was predicted by primary use of video platform and previous TMH use. The 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in increased use of TMH and significantly increased positive perceptions about TMH among mental health providers.","Doran, Jennifer M; Lawson, Jessica L",Psychiatr. q,,866
