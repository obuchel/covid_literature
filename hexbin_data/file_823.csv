The article presents the results of analysis of population mortality rate of the Russian Federation, the Central Federal Okrug and City of Moscow during the first eight months of 2020 towards to concurrent period of 2019. In January-March 2020, the population total mortality rate, retaining prevalent trends of number of preceding years, decreased in the Russian Federation by 3.8%, in the Central Federal Okrug by 3.0% and in City of Moscow by 3.9%. However, since April-May the situation has changed dramatically and, according to the results of January-August, mortality by this time has increased, and its growth made up to 6.5% in the Russian Federation, 7.8% in the Central Federal Okrug and 15.6% in the City of Moscow. In May 2020, the gain of absolute number of the deceased in the Russian Federation by months (towards to concurrent month of 2019) made up to 11.9%, in June to 18.6%, in July to 19.7% and in August to 9.6%. In Moscow, the peak values of this increase were noted in May - 57.2% and in June - 41.6% In the conditions of new coronavirus infection pandemic, the share of COVID-19, as main cause of death (ICD-10 codes U07.1 and U07.2), in the structure of total mortality in April-August consisted 3.2% and in the structure of excess deaths in May-August - 28.6%. The increase of mortality and continued decrease of birth rate resulted in increasing of natural population loss by 1.5 times and more and reached such values as -3.6 in the Russian Federation, -4.9 in the Central Federal Okrug and -1.6 in the City of Moscow (per 1000 of population). The process of depopulation of the Russian nation not only retained, but significantly has become significantly aggravated.","Shchepin, V O; Khabriev, R U","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",823,17

Data on 104 patients admitted to hospital with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection from 10 January 2020 to 26 February 2020 were collected. Clinical information and laboratory findings were collected and compared between the outcomes of improved patients and non-improved patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistics regression model and two-way stepwise strategy in the multivariate logistics regression model were used to select prognostic factors for predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The concordance index (C-index) was used to assess the discrimination of the model, and internal validation was performed through bootstrap resampling. A novel predictive nomogram was constructed by incorporating these features. Of the 104 patients included in the study (median age 55 years), 75 (72.1%) had improved short-term outcomes, while 29 (27.9%) showed no signs of improvement. There were numerous differences in clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between patients with improved outcomes and patients without improved outcomes. After a multi-step screening process, prognostic factors were selected and incorporated into the nomogram construction, including immunoglobulin A (IgA), C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine kinase (CK), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), and interaction between CK and APACHE II. The C-index of our model was 0.962 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.931-0.993) and still reached a high value of 0.948 through bootstrapping validation. A predictive nomogram we further established showed close performance compared with the ideal model on the calibration plot and was clinically practical according to the decision curve and clinical impact curve. The nomogram we constructed is useful for clinicians to predict improved clinical outcome probability for each COVID-19 patient, which may facilitate personalized counselling and treatment.","Xie, Jiaojiao; Shi, Ding; Bao, Mingyang; Hu, Xiaoyi; Wu, Wenrui; Sheng, Jifang; Xu, Kaijin; Wang, Qing; Wu, Jingjing; Wang, Kaicen; Fang, Daiqiong; Li, Yating; Li, Lanjuan",,823,17

We aimed to determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic changed patient response, hospital treatment and mortality from AMI. METHODS AND RESULTS: Admission were classified as non ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) or STEMI at 99 hospitals in England through live feeding from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project between 1st January, 2019 and 22nd May, 2020. Time series plots were estimated using a 7-day simple moving average, adjusted for seasonality. From 23rd March, 2020 (UK lockdown) median daily hospitalisations decreased more for NSTEMI (69 to 35; IRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.54) than STEMI (35 to 25; IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.80) to a nadir on 19th April, 2020. During lockdown, patients were younger (mean age 68.7 years vs. 66.9 years), less frequently diabetic (24.6% vs. 28.1%) or had cerebrovascular disease (7.0% vs. 8.6%). STEMI more frequently received primary PCI (81.8% vs 78.8%%), thrombolysis was negligible (0.5% vs. 0.3%), median admission-to-coronary angiography duration for NSTEMI decreased (26.2 vs. 64.0 hours), median duration of hospitalisation decreased (4 to 2 days), secondary prevention pharmacotherapy prescription remained unchanged (each >94.7%). Mortality at 30 days increased for NSTEMI (from 5.4% to 7.5%; OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.08-1.80), but decreased for STEMI (from 10.2% to 7.7%; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19, there was a substantial decline in admissions with AMI. Those who presented to hospital were younger, less co-morbid and, for NSTEMI, had higher 30-day mortality.","Wu, Jianhua; Mamas, Mamas; Rashid, Muhammad; Weston, Clive; Hains, Julian; Luescher, Tom; de Belder, Mark A; Deanfield, John E; Gale, Chris P",Eur.
