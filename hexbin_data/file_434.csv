4176,Causes and countermeasures for repeated outbreaks of hepatitis A among adults in Korea,2019-09-22,"The 2019 hepatitis A outbreak has become increasingly prevalent among adults in Korea and is the largest outbreak since that in 2009-2010. The incidence in the current outbreak is highest among adults aged 35-44 years, corresponding to the peak incidence among those aged 25-34 years 10 years ago. This may indicate a cohort effect in the corresponding age group. Causes of these repeated outbreaks of hepatitis A in Korea are low level of immunity among adults, Korean food culture that consumes raw seafood such as salted clam and inadequate public health system. Among countermeasures, along with general infectious disease control measures including control of the infectious agent, infection spread, and host, urgent actions are needed to review the vaccination policy and establish an adequate public health system.","Ki, Moran; Son, Hyunjin; Choi, Bo Youl",Epidemiol Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6883026/,434
6283,"SARS, pandemic influenza and Ebola: The disease control styles of Britain and the United States",2015-05-27,"Total microbial burden and diversity associated with commercial airliner cabin air was assessed by molecular methods in 125 air samples from the business-class sections of 16 domestic and international flights. Viable microbial burden within these cabin air parcels constituted only 1–10% of the total microbial population and ranged from below detection limits to 1.2 × 10(4) cells m(–3) as determined with a validated ATP-based technology. Cultivable bacterial diversity was almost entirely limited to Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus. In contrast, cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA gene directly from the samples without cultivation indicated a significantly broader diversity, as sequences representing more than 100 species, and encompassing 12 classes of bacteria, were retrieved in varying abundance. Sequences of proteobacterial and Gram-positive lineage were retrieved most frequently (58% and 31% of all clone sequences, respectively), with Gram-positive and α-proteobacterial sequences dominating international flight samples and β- and γ-proteobacterial sequences comprising the largest portion of those retrieved from domestic flights. Significant differences in bacterial load and diversity were noted between samples obtained on domestic and international flights. The disparities observed in microbial abundance and diversity further underscore the immense value of state-of-the art molecular assays in augmenting traditional culture-based techniques.

10006,"100 years on: the Spanish Flu, pandemics and keeping nurses safe",2018-08-22,"Summary. Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates have revolutionized the treatment of patients with haemophilia A. Concerns over the transmission of viral infections through these products have been addressed through stringent, donor‐screening procedures and robust antiviral manufacturing steps. Bio Products Laboratory has developed a high‐purity FVIII product with von Willebrand factor, Optivate(®). Its safety, tolerability and efficacy as prophylaxis and treatment of bleeds have been established in long‐term studies. Seventy previously treated patients with severe haemophilia A, with ≥20 exposure days, were recruited into two long‐term, multicentre, open‐label studies. The protocols were virtually identical. Patients received Optivate(®) either prophylactically or on‐demand. A mean of 159.0 EDs were experienced over 11 320 infusions. Under both conditions, Optivate(®) was well tolerated. Only 10% of patients experienced a treatment‐related adverse event; the most commonly reported were headache (4% of patients) and dizziness (3% of patients). The mean number of bleeds/patient over the 2 year treatment period was 23.5 during prophylactic use and 70.4 during on‐demand use. In patients treated prophylactically, clinical responses to breakthrough bleeds were rated by physicians as excellent or good and as very helpful or helpful by patients in 95% of bleeds. Clinical responses for on‐demand patients were rated as excellent or good by physicians and helpful or very helpful by the patients for 91% of bleeds. There were no viral transmissions or inhibitors. The studies confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of Optivate(®) in both prophylactic and on‐demand management of patients with haemophilia A.","DMOSZYNSKA, A.; KULICZKOWSKI, K.; HELLMANN, A.; TRELINSKI, J.; KLOCZKO, J.; BAGLIN, T.; HAY, C.; O’SHAUGHNESSY, D.; ZAWILSKA, K.; MAKRIS, M.; SHAIKH‐ZAIDI, R.; GASCOIGNE, E.; DASH, C.",Haemophilia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165764/,434
13512,Current Societal Views about Sustainable Wildlife Management and Conservation: A Survey of College Students in China,2020-10-06,"Although many risk studies investigate perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, the causal relationships among them have not yet been verified. Thus, further investigations of these relationships are necessary. This study analyzes three causal models consisting of three components: perceptions (i.e., perceived risk in this study), attitudes (i.e., satisfaction), and behavior (i.e., support for policy). This study checks these relationships in the context of nuclear energy policy. Using a hierarchical regression model, this study tests three different models between the three components: (1) Model 1 (a high-involvement model), (2) Model 2 (a low-involvement model), and (3) Model 3 (a hedonic model). First, in the high-involvement model, behavior is affected by perceptions and attitudes. In particular, attitudes mediate the relationship between risk perceptions and satisfaction. Second, in the low-involvement model, attitudes indirectly affect perceptions through behaviors. Third, in the hedonic model, behaviors affect attitudes, and risk perceptions do not mediate that relationship. This causal model does not depend on perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of nuclear power. Our analysis shows that Model 1 is fully significant, and Model 2 and 3 are only partially significant.","Kim, Byoung Joon; Kim, Seoyong; Kim, Sunhee",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7600510/,434

15556,Use and impact of high intensity treatments in patients with traumatic brain injury across Europe: a CENTER-TBI analysis,2021-02-23,"PURPOSE: Frequent exacerbators are a specific phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whose clinical characteristics and prognostic biomarkers during severe acute exacerbation (AECOPD) have not yet been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical features of severe AECOPD in frequent exacerbators and explore the predictive value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) for outcome in this phenotype during severe exacerbation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 604 patients with severe AECOPD were retrospectively included in the study. Subjects were defined as frequent exacerbators if they experienced two or more exacerbations in the past year. Clinical characteristics and worse outcome (ICU admission, or invasive ventilation, or in-hospital mortality) during severe AECOPD were compared between frequent exacerbators and non-frequent ones. Furthermore, the relationship between NLR and worse outcome in frequent exacerbators was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC). RESULTS: Among 604 patients with severe AECOPD, 282 (46.69%) were frequent exacerbators and 322 (53.31%) were non-frequent exacerbators. Compared with the non-frequent ones, frequent exacerbators presented higher levels of NLR (5.93 [IQR, 3.40–9.28] vs 4.41 [IQR, 2.74–6.80]; p<0.001), and more worse outcome incidence (58 [20.57%] vs 38 [11.80%]; p=0.003). Moreover, among the frequent exacerbators, NLR levels in the patients with worse outcome were much higher than in those without worse outcome (11.09 [IQR, 7.74–16.49] vs 5.28 [IQR, 2.93–7.93]; p<0.001). Increased NLR was significantly associated with a higher risk of worse outcome in frequent exacerbators (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.28–1.64; p<0.001). Furthermore, ROC analysis revealed that a cut-off value of 10.23, NLR could predict worse outcome of severe AECOPD in frequent exacerbators (sensitivity 62.1%, specificity 92.0%, AUC 0.833). CONCLUSION: Frequent exacerbators exhibited an increased level of NLR and a higher proportion of worse outcome during severe AECOPD. NLR is expected to be a promising predictive biomarker for the prognosis of severe AECOPD in frequent exacerbators.","Lu, Fang-Ying; Chen, Rong; Li, Ning; Sun, Xian-Wen; Zhou, Min; Li, Qing-Yun; Guo, Yi",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7901567/,434
16240,Economic violence against women: A case in Turkey,2021-03-15,"BACKGROUND: Utilizing intrawound vancomycin powder in TKA surgery has yielded rather contrasting results in the current literature. Furthermore, CDC criteria, although effective in general, are not specifically designed for post-TKA infections. Here, we present a 7-year experience of vancomycin use in primary TKA in a high-volume tertiary knee center in Iran. Also, new criteria are proposed to detect suspected superficial post-TKA infections. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of primary total knee arthroplasties performed in a tertiary knee center, from March 2007 to December 2018, by a single senior knee surgeon. All patients with follow-up periods of less than 1 year were excluded from the study. Since March 2011, all patients received vancomycin (powder, 1 g) before water-tight closure of the joint capsule. A comparison was made between this group and historical control subjects (operated from March 2007 to March 2011). RESULTS: Altogether, 2024 patients were included in the study. The vancomycin and the control groups included 1710 and 314 cases respectively. Patients were mostly women (male to female ratio, 1 to 4), with a mean age of 65.20 (SD = 10.83) years. In the vancomycin group, the rate of suspected SII (1.87%) and PJI (0.41%) was significantly lower than the control group (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience shows that application of local vancomycin during TKA surgery could be a reasonable infection prevention measure, although prospective randomized studies are required to evaluate its efficacy.","Tahmasebi, Mohammad Naghi; Vaziri, Arash Sharafat; Vosoughi, Fardis; Tahami, Mohamad; Khalilizad, Majid; Rabie, Hamid",J Orthop Surg Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7968172/,434
17380,Adverse events experienced with intrahospital transfer of critically ill patients: A national survey,2021-05-07,"Women with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an increased risk of developing early breast cancer with a poorer prognosis compared to the general population. Therefore, international management guidelines recommend regular screening in women with NF1 starting from 30 to 35 years. As the psychological impacts of breast cancer screening in other high-risk populations cannot be extended to women with NF1, due to increased incidence of cognitive and mental health issues, the psychological harms of breast screening in women with NF1 are unknown. Consequently, the aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of breast cancer screening in women with NF1 attending an established risk management clinic. Twenty-eight women with NF1 (30–50 years) completed psychological well-being and patient experience questionnaires, administered across five time points, before and after their initial and second round annual breast screening visits. Preliminary findings demonstrated the screening regimen was well-tolerated, with most participants reporting high satisfaction with the screening process. Overall, no significant increase in psychological distress related to the breast screening process was identified, with mean cancer worry and anxiety scores decreasing over time. However, some women did experience negative aspects of screening and barriers to re-attendance at annual breast screening appointments. As some women with NF1 exhibited clinical levels of psychological distress prior to screening, efforts to identify those at risk and additional support to address concerns and expectations throughout the breast screening process may be beneficial.

The aim of this review was to systematically explore and synthesise scientific evidence on how women experience and cope with induced abortion. The guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence were used as a framework to review current international and national literature. The researchers made use of Ebsco Discovery Service to search for relevant studies. This was done by employing key concepts and related synonyms. Eleven relevant studies were identified. As the study was exploratory in nature, covering a relatively small selection of studies, heterogeneous in methodology and cultural focus, only a few general trends were highlighted. Not much information was found for women in the South African context. The study found that socio-economic disadvantages and premorbid relationships are important factors that should be better researched, understood and managed in a South African context. Despite many studies on how women experience and cope with induced abortion, the review revealed the need for research related to specific challenges and experiences of South African women.","Lyon, Roché; Botha, Karel",Health SA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8252142/,434

32046,Social Distancing in the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020-05-02,"One of the most critical issues in cybersecurity is represented by social engineering attacks. These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals’ weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives.","Corradini, Isabella",Building a Cybersecurity Culture in Organizations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189027/,434
32379,Rethinking Essential Services in the Wake of the COVID-19 Health Crisis,2020-05-11,"Dependency-based anomaly detection methods detect anomalies by looking at the deviations from the normal probabilistic dependency among variables and are able to discover more subtle and meaningful anomalies. However, with high dimensional data, they face two key challenges. One is how to find the right set of relevant variables for a given variable from the large search space to assess dependency deviation. The other is how to use the dependency to estimate the expected value of a variable accurately. In this paper, we propose the Local Prediction approach to Anomaly Detection (LoPAD) framework to deal with the two challenges simultaneously. Through introducing Markov Blanket into dependency-based anomaly detection, LoPAD decomposes the high dimensional unsupervised anomaly detection problem into local feature selection and prediction problems while achieving better performance and interpretability. The framework enables instantiations with off-the-shelf predictive models for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments have been done on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that LoPAD outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.","Lu, Sha; Liu, Lin; Li, Jiuyong; Le, Thuc Duy; Liu, Jixue",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206231/,434

Discovering interesting subgroups in purely numerical data - attributes and target label - has received little attention so far. Existing methods make use of discretization methods that lead to a loss of information and suboptimal results. This is the case for the reference algorithm SD-Map*. We consider here the discovery of optimal subgroups according to an interestingness measure in purely numerical data. We leverage the concept of closed interval patterns and advanced enumeration and pruning techniques. The performances of our algorithm are studied empirically and its added-value w.r.t.

Today’s KGs have reached a size of billions of RDF triples extracted from a variety of sources, including structured sources and text. While this definitely improves completeness, the inherent variety of sources leads to severe heterogeneity, negatively affecting data quality by introducing duplicate information. We present a novel technique for detecting synonymous properties in large knowledge graphs by mining interpretable definitions of properties using association rule mining. Relying on such shared definitions, our technique is able to mine even synonym rules that have only little support in the data. In particular, our extensive experiments on DBpedia and Wikidata show that our rule-based approach can outperform state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding techniques, while offering good interpretability through shared logical rules.","Kalo, Jan-Christoph; Mennicke, Stephan; Ehler, Philipp; Balke, Wolf-Tilo",The Semantic Web,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7250622/,434

However, DNN classifiers trained on known diseases usually fail when they confront new diseases such as COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning framework and pipeline for explainable medical imaging that can classify known diseases as well as detect new/unknown diseases when the models are only trained on known disease images. We first provide in-depth mathematical analysis to explain the overconfidence phenomena and present the calibrated confidence that can mitigate the overconfidence. Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors’ ground truth.

38352,Changes in recreational behaviors of outdoor enthusiasts during the COVID-19 pandemic: analysis across urban and rural communities,2020-08-14,"BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium is a nontyphoidal and common foodborne pathogen that causes serious threat to humans. There is no licensed vaccine to prevent the nontyphoid bacterial infection caused by S. Typhimurium. METHODS: To develop conjugate vaccines, the bacterial lipid-A free lipopolysaccharide (LFPS) is prepared as the immunogen and used to synthesize the LFPS–linker–protein conjugates 6a–9b. The designed bifunctional linkers 1–5 comprising either an o-phenylenediamine or amine moiety are specifically attached to the exposed 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo), an α-ketoacid saccharide of LFPS, via condensation reaction or decarboxylative amidation. In addition to bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin, the S. Typhimurium flagellin (FliC) is also used as a self-adjuvanting protein carrier. RESULTS: The synthesized conjugate vaccines are characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC), and their contents of polysaccharides and protein are determined by phenol–sulfuric acid assay and bicinchoninic acid assay, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shows that immunization of mouse with the LFPS–linker–protein vaccines at a dosage of 2.5 μg is sufficient to elicit serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to S. Typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The straight-chain amide linkers in conjugates 7a–9b do not interfere with the desired immune response. Vaccines 7a and 7b derived from either unfractionated LFPS or the high-mass portion show equal efficacy in induction of IgG antibodies. The challenge experiments are performed by oral gavage of S. Typhimurium pathogen, and vaccine 7c having FliC as the self-adjuvanting protein carrier exhibits a high vaccine efficacy of 74% with 80% mice survival rate at day 28 post the pathogen challenge. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that lipid-A free lipopolysaccharide prepared from Gram-negative bacteria is an appropriate immunogen, in which the exposed Kdo is connected to bifunctional linkers to form conjugate vaccines. The decarboxylative amidation of Kdo is a novel and useful method to construct a relatively robust and low immunogenic straight-chain amide linkage. The vaccine efficacy is enhanced by using bacterial flagellin as the self-adjuvanting carrier protein.

40753,How Affective Polarization Shapes Americans’ Political Beliefs: A Study of Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-08-24,"Viral central nervous system (CNS) infections can lead to life threatening encephalitis and long-term neurological deficits in survivors. Resident CNS cell types, such as astrocytes and microglia, are known to produce key inflammatory and antiviral mediators following infection with neurotropic DNA viruses. However, the mechanisms by which glia mediate such responses remain poorly understood. Recently, a class of intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), collectively known as DNA sensors, have been identified in both leukocytic and non-leukocytic cell types. The ability of such DNA sensors to initiate immune mediator production and contribute to infection resolution in the periphery is increasingly recognized, but our understanding of their role in the CNS remains limited at best. In this review, we describe the evidence for the expression and functionality of DNA sensors in resident brain cells, with a focus on their role in neurotropic virus infections. The available data indicate that glia and neurons can constitutively express, and/or can be induced to express, various disparate DNA sensing molecules previously described in peripheral cell types. Furthermore, multiple lines of investigation suggest that these sensors are functional in resident CNS cells and are required for innate immune responses to viral infections. However, it is less clear whether DNA sensormediated glial responses are beneficial or detrimental, and the answer to this question appears to dependent on the context of the infection with regard to the identity of the pathogen, host cell type, and host species. Defining such parameters will be essential if we are to successfully target these molecules to limit damaging inflammation while allowing beneficial host responses to improve patient outcomes.","Jeffries, Austin M.; Marriott, Ian",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7525022/,434

(‘Wisdom, unlike money, cannot be kept in a safe’) (Appiagyei-Atua 2000). One critical factor that has contributed to the spread of the virus COVID-19 and resulting illnesses and deaths is both the conceptual and the ethical confusion between the prioritization of individual rights over social duties. The adherence to the belief in the priority of rights over duties has motivated some individuals to refrain from social distancing and, as a result, has placed themselves and other individuals at serious risk to health and life. My argument is that the ethical enjoinder of social duty possesses priority over the ethical value of individual rights especially in times of global crisis. I demonstrate this point by arguing that the concept of individual right is derivative from the concept of social duty and through the argument that the concept of social duty is more efficacious in addressing global threats to human life than is the concept of individual rights. What is needed is an in-depth revision of the moral ordering of rights and duties and a vision of the human being as inherently other directed with duties toward others. I shall examine two specific ethical systems, that of Confucian and African, Akan moral philosophy that exemplify such a revision of the moral order.","Allinson, Robert Elliott",Public Health Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665680/,434

We conducted a meta‐analysis of 490 unique profiles from six public RSV blood transcriptome datasets. A repertoire of 382 well‐characterized transcriptional modules was used to define dominant host responses to RSV infection. The consolidated RSV cohort was stratified according to four traits: “interferon response” (IFN), “neutrophil‐driven inflammation” (Infl), “cell cycle” (CC), and “erythrocytes” (Ery). We identified eight prevalent blood transcriptome phenotypes, of which three Ery+ phenotypes comprised higher proportions of patients requiring intensive care. This finding confirms on a larger scale data from one of our earlier reports describing an association between an erythrocyte signature and RSV disease severity. Further contextual interpretation made it possible to associate this signature with immunosuppressive states (late stage cancer, pharmacological immunosuppression), and with a population of fetal glycophorin A+ erythroid precursors. Furthermore, we posit that this erythrocyte cell signature may be linked to a population of immunosuppressive erythroid cells previously described in the literature, and that overabundance of this cell population in RSV patients may underlie progression to severe disease. These findings outline potential priority areas for biomarker development and investigations into the immune biology of RSV infection. The approach that we developed and employed here should also permit to delineate prevalent blood transcriptome phenotypes in other settings.","Rinchai, Darawan; Altman, Matthew C.; Konza, Oceane; Hässler, Signe; Martina, Federica; Toufiq, Mohammed; Garand, Mathieu; Kabeer, Basirudeen Syed Ahamed; Palucka, Karolina; Mejias, Asuncion; Ramilo, Octavio; Bedognetti, Davide; Mariotti‐Ferrandiz, Encarnita; Klatzmann, David; Chaussabel, Damien",Clin Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733317/,434

43633,Crisis and Intergovernmental Retrenchment in the European Union? Framing the EU’s Answer to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-12-28,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which exploded in Wuhan (Hebei Region, China) in late 2019, has later spread around the world, causing pandemic effects on humans. During the first wave of the pandemic, Italy, and especially its Northern regions around the Po Valley, faced severe consequences in terms of infected individuals and casualties (more than 31,000 deaths and 255,000 infected people by mid-May 2020). While the spread and effective impact of the virus is primarily related to the lifestyles and social habits of the different human communities, environmental and meteorological factors also play a role. Among these, particulate pollution may directly impact the human respiratory system or act as virus carrier, thus behaving as potential amplifying factor in the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Enhanced levels of PM(2.5) and PM(10) particles in Northern Italy were observed over the 2-month period preceding the virus pandemic spread. Threshold levels for PM(10) (< 50 μg/m(3)) were exceeded on 20–35 days over the period January–February 2020 in many areas in the Po Valley, where major effects in terms of infections and casualties occurred, with levels in excess of 80 μg/m(3) occasionally observed in the 1–3 weeks preceding the contagious activation around February 25, 2020. Threshold values for PM(2.5) indicated in WHO air quality guidelines (< 25 μg/m(3)) were exceeded on more than 40 days over the period January–February 2020 in large portions of the Po Valley, with levels up to 70 μg/m(3) observed in the weeks preceding the contagious activation. In this paper, PM(10) particle measurements are compared with epidemiologic parameters’ data. Specifically, a statistical analysis is carried out to correlate the infection rate, or incidence of the pathology, the mortality rate, and the case fatality rate with PM concentrations. The study considers epidemiologic data for all 110 Italian provinces, as reported by the Italian Statistics Institute, over the period 20 February–31 March 2020. Corresponding PM(10) concentrations covering the period 15–26 February 2020 were collected from the network of air quality monitoring stations run by different regional and provincial environment agencies. The case fatality rate is found to be highly correlated to the average PM(10) concentration, with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a slope of the regression line of (6.7 ± 0.3) × 10(−3) m(3)/μg, which implies a doubling (from 3 to 6%) of the mortality rate of infected patients for an average PM(10) concentration increase from 22 to 27 μg/m(3). Infection and mortality rates are also found to be correlated with PM(10) concentrations, with correlation coefficients being 0.82 and 0.80, respectively, and the slopes of the regression lines indicating a doubling (from 1 to 2‰) of the infection rate and a tripling (from 0.1 to 0.3‰) of the mortality rate for an average PM(10) concentration increase from 25 to 29 μg/m(3). Considerations on the exhaled particles’ sizes, their concentrations and residence times, the transported viral dose and the minimum infective dose, in combination with PM(2.5) and PM(10) pollution measurements and an analytical microphysical model, allowed assessing the potential role of airborne transmission through virus-laden PM particles, in addition to droplet and the traditional airborne transmission, in conveying SARS-CoV-2 in the human respiratory system. In specific circumstances which can be found in indoor environments, the number of small potentially infectious particles coalescing on PM(2.5) and PM(10) particles is estimated to exceed the number of infectious particles needed to activate COVID-19 infection in humans.","Di Girolamo, Paolo",Bull,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750914/,434
44190,COVID-19 pandemic in India: through psycho-social lens,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Remdesivir (RDV) has been shown to shorten recovery time and was well tolerated in patients with severe COVID-19. Here we report safety of RDV in patients with moderate COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, phase 3 trial (NCT04252664) in hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, evidence of pulmonary infiltrates, and oxygen saturation >94% on room air. Patients were randomly assigned to receive RDV (5 or 10 days) or standard of care (SOC). RDV was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1, 100 mg daily thereafter. Adverse events (AEs) and laboratory abnormalities were evaluated through the day 11 data cut; safety data through day 28 will be presented at the meeting. RESULTS: 584 patients were randomized and treated (5d RDV: n=191; 10d RDV, n=193; SOC: n=200). Baseline characteristics were balanced among groups; median (range) age was 57y (12-95y), 39% were female and 19% Black, 39% had arterial hypertension, 15% hyperlipidemia, 11% asthma. Briefly, across both the 5d and 10d arms, RDV was well tolerated with a similar rate of Grade 3 or 4 AEs and fewer SAEs compared to SOC (Table). AEs more common with RDV vs SOC included nausea, headache, and hypokalemia. Overall, across the 3 arms, incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation and death were low and no clinically relevant changes in laboratory parameters were observed. In addition, median changes in renal and liver function tests from baseline were not statistically significant between the RDV 5d and RDV 10d groups compared to the SOC only group at d14 (Table 1). Table 1. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: RDV given for 5d or 10d was well tolerated in patients with moderate COVID-19. No clinically significant safety signals were observed with RDV vs SOC.

45781,Loneliness and social engagement in older adults based in Lombardy during COVID‐19 lockdown: The long‐term effects of social networking sites training course: Developing topics,2020-12-07,"BACKGROUND: From the worldwide youth-led climate strikes of 2018–2019 to the student-initiated austerity protests in Chile in 2019, it is undeniable that young people have been protagonists in pressuring for social change towards greater sustainability in recent years. This piece reflects on youth as agents of social-ecological change, and what researchers can learn from the rise in youth-led social movements demanding action in the face of global sustainability challenges. The study of sustainability problems like climate change and biodiversity loss, intrinsically requires consideration of inter-generational equity. However, despite 50% of the global population being under 30 years old, youth are often not included explicitly as actors in environmental social sciences and sustainability-related research. Here we discuss why explicitly considering young people as distinct actors during the research process is important, as it allows researchers to engage in just and inclusive work whilst at the same time accounting for important agents of change in complex social-ecological systems. RESULTS: As a framework for our inquiry we present the themes which emerged during a series of international meetings and forums on sustainability challenges and youth in 2019, a year characterized by world-wide youth mobilization. Our briefing spans the United Nations Youth 2019 Climate Action Summit, the post-2020 meetings organized by the youth branch of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Youth forums and the results from the Global Shapers Survey of the World Economic Forum. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that if researchers wish to facilitate youth-inclusive evidence-based decision making, research agendas must address knowledge gaps highlighted by institutional efforts to incorporate youth concerns within global sustainability policy, a recommendation that is even more relevant in the light of the COVID-19 crisis. We draw on the themes which emerged in our analysis of international youth meetings to provide recommendations for research agendas which account both for young actors as both passive and active components of social-ecological change and we propose a more inclusive and holistic study of coupled natural-human systems.","Barraclough, Alicia Donnellan; Sakiyama, Melina; Schultz, Lisen; Måren, Inger Elisabeth",Sustain Earth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7875163/,434
46009,Evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic over six weeks in four French-speaking countries in West Africa,2021-01-16,"Individuals exist within an environmental context that strongly influences their overall health and welfare. Environmental context refers to the context in which a person lives, works, and socializes. This paper presents a social marketing strategic planning model which begins by analyzing the micro, meso, and macro environments to identify causes or influences of a target social issue or problem. Contributors to the social problem are prioritized with respect to the degree to which they exert influence or causality. Next, stakeholders (those who have some interest in the social problem) are identified. Stakeholder perceptions and values are examined in order to develop an effective coalition of stakeholders who can work collaboratively at the various environmental levels to ameliorate the target social problem. As social marketing has evolved in order to develop more effective solutions to complex social problems, integrating a systems approach is useful to understand the dynamics influencing the social problem. Individuals are not targeted myopically but placed into an environmental context to understand and respond to influences on unhealthy behaviors and living conditions. Engaging a coalition of stakeholders who are motivated to alleviate the causes of the social problem must be skillfully managed by social marketers but offers promise in addressing complex social problems.","Wymer, Walter",Int Rev Public Nonprofit Mark,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7886302/,434

The keystone of SRV is the clean separation between temporal dependencies and data computations. However, in spite of this theoretical separation previous engines include hardwired implementations of just a few datatypes, requiring complex changes in the tool chain to incorporate new data types. Additionally, when previous tools implement features like parametrization these are implemented in an ad-hoc way. In contrast, HLola is implemented as a Haskell embedded DSL, borrowing datatypes and functional aspects from Haskell, resulting in an extensible engine (The tool is available open-source at http://github.com/imdea-software/hlola). We illustrate HLola through several examples, including a UAV monitoring infrastructure with predictive characteristics that has been validated in online runtime verification in real mission planning.","Gorostiaga, Felipe; Sánchez, César",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984579/,434

AC is necessary in process of PET/MR but MR data lack photon attenuation, thus multiple methods are proposed to generate synthetic CT. However, these existing methods requires advantaged MR sequences which needs fine acquisition and huge cost consumption. To address this problem, we proposed a new method for generating synthetic CT using Patch Learning (SCG-PL). Global model of SCG-PL is transfer learning and patch model is semi-supervised classification. The advantages of our method can be summarized into two points. (1) Patch learning is a gradual learning process with gradually updating global model on remodeling patch model, so our SCG-PL method is gradually capable of generating synthetic CT. (2) Semi-supervised classification adopted in the process of patch learning, only small amount of labeled data is needed in SCG-PL, which greatly reduced the workload of radiologists. The experimental results indicate that proposed SCG-PL method can effectively generate synthetic CT image from challenging abdomen images using mDixon MR sequence data only.","Song, Xin; Zheng, Jiamin; Fan, Chao; Yu, Hongbin",Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991422/,434

This study was conducted to assess the utility of DTI tractography as an imaging technique in assessment of brain gliomas and planning of the surgical corridor. RESULTS: Twenty adult patients with brain gliomas were included. Neurological examination and conventional MRI and DTI scans were performed before and after surgery. Low-grade and high-grade tumors were found in 30% and 70% of patients, respectively. Preoperative DTI demonstrated five patterns of WM tract involvement: non-affected (10%), displaced (75%), edematous (55%), infiltrated (60%), and disrupted (20%). The obtained DTI scans were used for preoperative planning of the surgical corridor and extent of resection to achieve the maximum resection while preserving the WM tracts. Total resection was achieved in 40%, while 60% underwent subtotal resection. Postoperative neurological examination showed deterioration of cognitive function, motor power, and vision in 15%, 10%, and 5% of patients, respectively. Headache persisted in 15%, while motor power improved in 35% of patients. High-grade tumors were significantly associated with higher percentage of subtotal resection (p=0.018) and pattern IV (p=0.018). There was a significant association between the preoperative pattern of WM tract involvement and the postoperative DTI changes (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: DTI enables assessment of displaced and infiltrated WM tracts in the vicinity of brain tumors. Preoperative planning of tumor resection and surgical corridor should include DTI scan to achieve the balance between maximum resection of tumor and maximal preservation of function.","Shalan, Mohamed E.; Soliman, Ahmed Y.; Nassar, Ibrahim A.; Alarabawy, Reda A.",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8050646/,434

The two major growth enhancing compounds used in feedlot cattle production are steroidal implants (IMP) and β-adrenergic agonists (β-AA). Implementation of β-AA during the pandemic was extremely difficult due to the lack of knowledge on exact shipping dates. The β-AA are fed the last 28 to 42 d on feed. Ractopamine was approved for cattle with essential a 12-h withdrawal. Many questions arose about the maximum length of withdrawal on ractopamine before losing any of the added growth response in both the live animal and carcass. Many feedlot operators relied on IMP administration to achieve added growth response in cattle held for longer days on feed. With zero-day withdrawal on implants, it was a cost-effective means to hold cattle in an efficient manner. Many producers simply could not manage β-AA feeding during the pandemic period and used other management technologies to enhance growth and efficiency during the end of the feeding period.","Johnson, Bradley J; Smith, Zachary K",J Anim Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8104644/,434

Motivating Pro-Refugee Public Engagement During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-13,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) nanofibrous mats containing ad hoc synthesized gold nanostructures were prepared via a single-step electrospinning procedure and investigated as a novel composite platform with several potential applications. Specifically, the effect of differently shaped and sized gold nanostructures on the resulting mat physical-chemical properties was investigated. In detail, nearly spherical nanoparticles and nanorods were first synthesized through a chemical reduction of gold precursors in water by using (hexadecyl)trimethylammonium bromide as the stabilizing agent. These nanostructures were then dispersed in poly(vinyl alcohol) aqueous solutions to prepare nanofibrous mats, which were then stabilized via a humble thermal treatment able to enhance their thermal stability and water resistance. Remarkably, the nanostructure type was proven to influence the mesh morphology, with the small spherical nanoparticles and the large nanorods leading to thinner well defined or bigger defect-rich nanofibers, respectively. Finally, the good mechanical properties shown by the prepared composite mats suggest their ease of handleability thereby opening new perspective applications.","Dodero, Andrea; Castellano, Maila; Lova, Paola; Ottonelli, Massimo; Brunengo, Elisabetta; Vicini, Silvia; Alloisio, Marina",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8156238/,434

The pandemic has pushed firms to rely on digital technologies to redefine business processes as well as customer relationships and marketing strategies. The digital technological portfolio firms may rely on to face the COVID-19 related challenges spanning from the established web-based technologies to the more recent Industry 4.0 tools related to the fourth industrial revolution. In this regard, the paper aims at exploring which digital technologies allowed firms to positively react to the pandemic to overcome their constraints in managing the market relationships. Based on an original qualitative analysis on 26 Italian SMEs carried out during the first Italian lockdown in 2020, the paper identifies three strategies in the use of digital technologies to support customer relationship management and market expansion. It emerges specifically the strategic importance of web-based technologies (videoconferencing, CRM and e-commerce) to support firm competition and performance through customer interactions and digital experience, advancing the literature on firms’ reaction strategies during turbulent and crisis times.","Bettiol, Marco; Capestro, Mauro; Di Maria, Eleonora; Micelli, Stefano",Ital,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179952/,434
54026,Social Disparities and Food Environment Determinants of Food Insecurity Among Graduate Students in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-07,"There is a lively debate on chief digital officers (CDOs). Some practitioners stress CDOs’ critical role in recrafting digital strategies and accelerating digital transformation, while others predict their disappearance. Academics have also recently begun to study this new executive position and conducted research on CDOs which is, however, scattered across different disciplines and publication outlets. We conduct a systematic literature review that consolidates these initial gains in knowledge. Specifically, we integrate findings on theoretical lenses, research designs, and key themes in studies on CDOs and we propose a framework that organizes CDO research in three broad themes: antecedents of CDO presence, the CDO role, and consequences of CDO presence. We then build on identified gaps to develop an extensive agenda for future research on CDOs. For academic researchers, we not only offer a discipline-spanning overview of knowledge on the topic at hand but also provide useful direction towards fruitful avenues for future research on CDOs. For practitioners, we offer a summary of the current scientific literature on CDOs, including relevant insights on CDO appointments, governance, and performance consequences.

Whilst an enormous number of special issues and articles are devoted on the topic, there are few fundamental reflections on how the current pandemic will affect science and work and organisational psychology in the long run. RESEARCH PURPOSE: The current overview, written by a group of members of the Future of Work and Organisational Psychology (FOWOP) Movement, focuses on the central issues relating to work and organisational psychology that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. MOTIVATION FOR THE STUDY: The study discusses the inability of dominant theories in work and organisational psychology to understand contemporary problems and the need to advance the theoretical realm of work psychology. We also discuss the need for pluralism in methodologies to understand the post-COVID-19 workplace, the urgency of attending to neglected voices and populations during the COVID-19 crisis and teaching during COVID-19. RESEARCH APPROACH/DESIGN AND METHOD: This article uses conceptual argumentation. MAIN FINDINGS: The COVID-19 crisis forces work psychology to address at least its theorising, methods, unheard voices and teaching in the COVID-19 crisis. PRACTICAL/MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS: On the basis of this article, researchers and practitioners may be better aware of the neglected perspectives in the current pandemic.

AIM: To describe the effect of contracting private medical practitioners at primary healthcare facilities on the self-referral rate of clients at district hospitals as a proxy for perceived quality of care in a National Health Insurance pilot district. SETTING: The study was set in Tshwane National Health Insurance pilot district compared to Ekurhuleni district. METHODS: We compared findings before and after implementing the National Health Insurance private medical practitioners contracting between a pilot and a non-pilot district. A quasi-experimental ecological study design was used to compare district hospital outpatient department indicators of clients follow-up, self-referral, self-referral rate and referred in the two districts from June 2012 to May 2014 using single and controlled interrupted time-series analyses. RESULTS: Controlled interrupted time series analysis found decreases in self-referral rate (−1.8 [−2.2, −1.1] [p < 0.0001]) and the initial trend of headcounts of self-referral (−516 [−969, −66] [p = 0.0260]), but an increase in headcounts of referred clients (1293 [77, 2508] [p = 0.0376]) in the pilot compared with the non-pilot district. CONCLUSION: We concluded that the implementation of contracting private medical practitioners in primary healthcare facilities might have resulted in an improved perceived quality of care at primary health care facilities. However, the higher number of outpatient department headcounts for follow-up and the increase in referred cases in the pilot district would need to be investigated.","Mukudu, Hillary; Otwombe, Kennedy; Moloto, Caiphus; Fusheini, Adam; Igumbor, Jude",Health SA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182563/,434
54062,Cash Plus Social and Behavioral Change Communication Approaches to Improve Food Security: Findings From Formative Research With Syrian Refugees in Lebanon,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) can be appropriately managed following international recommendations. However, few studies have assessed the preferred protocols in real-life veterinary practice and whether these are in line with the guidelines. This survey aimed to investigate the current trends in the clinical management of CanL among veterinary practitioners in Portugal, taking into consideration different scenarios of infection/disease and the awareness of and application by veterinary practitioners of the current guidelines. METHODS: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted online using an electronic platform. The following topics were surveyed: (i) general characteristics of the responding veterinarian; (ii) the preferred protocols used for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of CanL, considering different theoretical scenarios of infection/disease; and (iii) the responding veterinarian’s current knowledge and application of the existing guidelines on CanL. After internal validation, the survey was distributed online, for 2 months, via Portuguese social network veterinary groups. Data were collected for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-six replies were obtained. Analysis of the results showed that the preferred diagnostic techniques varied widely according to the theoretical scenario of infection/disease. In general daily practice, serology testing (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) was the most used tool (67.4%). The preferred matrices used for PCR test were lymph nodes (62.3%) and/or bone marrow (59.0%). Regarding treatment, for subclinical infection/stage I CanL, 51.2% of the respondents did not prescribe any medical treatment, but 98.8% proceeded with both monitoring and preventive measures. Among those who prescribed a treatment (n = 42), most chose domperidone (47.6%). For the treament of stages IIa, IIb and III CanL, allopurinol/meglumine antimoniate (MA) was chosen by 69.8, 73.3 and 51.2% of respondents, respectively, followed by allopurinol/miltefosine (20.9, 19.8 and 38.4%, respectively). In contrast, dogs with stage IV CanL were mostly treated with allopurinol/miltefosine (48.8%) rather than with allopurinol/MA (23.3%). The use of repellents was the preferred preventive strategy (98.8%). About 93.0% of responders were aware of the existence of guidelines, and most of these veterinarians consulted the guidelines of the LeishVet group and the Canine Leishmaniosis Working Group; however, 31.3% reported that they did not follow any specific recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Of the veterinarians responding to the survey, most reported following international guidelines for the clinical management of CanL. While allopurinol/MA was the preferred therapeutic protocol for the treatment of stages II/III CanL, allopurinol/miltefosine was the first choice for the treatment of stage IV CanL, possibly due to the unpredictable effect of MA on renal function. This study contributes to a better understanding of the trends in practical approaches to the treatment of CanL in Portugal.

54270,"Longitudinal Associations Between Child Weight Change, the Home Food Environment, and Child Feeding Practices During COVID-19",2021-06-07,"Insulin pumps and glucose sensors have been shown in registry data to be effective in improving diabetes therapy and reducing acute complications. Therefore, in pediatric diabetology, the use of at least one technical device is standard. The combination of both devices leads to the possibility of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. Many AID systems have been tested in clinical trials and have proven safety and effectiveness. The supply situation in Germany currently only allows one system to be prescribed for people insured by public health insurance. Children younger than 7 years of age cannot currently be treated with this system. The reasons for this are legal hurdles and lack of certification by the manufacturers. CE certification can also lead to problems with insulin prescriptions. Open-source systems are nonregulated variants to circumvent existing regulatory conditions. There are risks here for both users and prescribers. For continued use, thorough knowledge of the features of each AID system is necessary on both the user and practitioner side. Complete automation does not work. For the evaluation of the AID therapy, the metric data of the glucose sensors, the “time in range” and the “glucose management index” are the recognized and suitable parameters because they allow consultation based on the real data from the daily life of people with diabetes. Since all glucose sensors are read out via cloud-based software or obtain the data directly automatically, this provides the ideal technical basis for telemedical care, which needs further development.","Biester, Torben; Dovc, Klemen; Chobot, Agata; Tauschmann, Martin; Kapellen, Thomas",Diabetologe,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191719/,434

54433,When low and high tech solutions converge: Adapting to teaching soils during the COVID‐19 pandemic,2021-05-30,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 outbreaks many IBD clinics in Italy adopted a remote monitoring approach both to ensure an adequate follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and respect the rules of social distancing, while access to hospital was restricted. Aim of the study was to perform a survey on IBD patients submitted to remote monitoring in our tertiary referral center in order to assess adherence and patients’ perceptions and satisfaction as well as their opinions for future monitoring. Changes in disease activity and Quality of Life were also evaluated. METHODS: Consecutive patients with IBD scheduled for follow-up visits were switched to remote monitoring through e-mail from March 2020 to February 2021, Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire focusing on 3 elements of the intervention: (1) self-assessment questions, (2) action plans, and (3) educational messages. With regards to self-assessment questions, we used the SIBDQ (to evaluate the QoL) and the IBDSI (to evaluate symptoms as patients’ reported outcomes). All patient sent by email results of blood texts: ESR, CRP, CBC, faecal calprotectin, ferritin, serum iron. HBI Index and Mayo UC score were calculated by the treating physicians. RESULTS: 424 subjects, 100% Caucasians, completed the survey. 233 (55,1%) were male, 220 (52.0%) had Crohn’s Disease (CD). Median baseline Mayo Score and Harvey Bradshaw Index were 3 and 4, respectively. 9 (2,1%) patients were referred to emergency department because of disease flares. 2 (1%) UC patients needed to add topical therapy, 9 (4%) CD patients started therapy with systemic steroids and 3 (1,3%) with biologics. 410 (96,9%) patients were satisfied about telemedicine, and 320 (76,5%) patients reported that would maintain this approach also after COVID-19 outbreak. On univariate logistic regression analysis, only a high ferritin value was found to be related to patients’ satisfaction (p=0.001). Lower calprotectin (p=0.012) and need for treatment change (p<0001) were found to be related to QoL, while CD (p=0.052), age (p=0.027), disease duration (p=0.046) and higher calprotectin (p=0.021) were associated to the need for treatment change. None of the variables were significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm in an homogeneous cohort of IBD patients from southern Italy that a telemedicine approach can substitute face-to-face consultations at least for patients in remission or mild clinical activity. Patients’outcomes were not affected as far as concerns referral to emergency services or the use of steroids for disease flares. A high proportion of patients would maintain this management strategy.","Busacca, A; Sinagra, E; Guida, L; Carrozza, L; Melodia, M; Maida, M; Battaglia, S; Celsa, C; Cammà, C; Cappello, M",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195013/,434

By applying the two-stage Use and gratification (U&G) approach, we first conducted in-depth interviews (n = 20) to explore older adults’ distinctive motives. Based on the 22 motives found in the qualitative research, we developed a questionnaire for an online survey (n = 690) to further investigate how these motives affect older adults’ engagement with health information on WeChat. As the result, six motive typologies were identified: information needs, social support, surveillance, social interaction, self-agency building, and technological convenience. Together, these six types of motivations jointly account for 59.9% of the variance in older adults’ engagement with health information (M = 2.71, SD = 0.79, adjusted R(2) = 0.59, p < 0.001). Social support and information needs were significant predictors, suggesting that the older WeChat users’ active engagement is driven by personal instrumental gratification. This study examines the explanation power of U&G theory in a health context, as well as provides the practical implication for leveraging mobile social media to improve older people’s healthcare management.","Zhang, Xiaoxiao; Xu, Xiaoge; Cheng, Jiang",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8234300/,434
55251,Perceived Causes and Attitudes Regarding Overindebtedness and Their Effects on Public Agreement With Government Financial Aid,2021-06-17,"The global pandemic of coronavirus disease has significantly impacted medical education, including removing trainees from clinical environments, transitioning didactic sessions to virtual platforms, and necessitating creative solutions to provide interactive learning opportunities in a virtual, socially distant setting. Human gross anatomy education, with its emphasis on hands‐on, team‐based, active learning by body donor dissection, has been particularly impacted by these transitions. Dissection is considered the best practice for learning gross anatomy and has been shown to enhance learning over non‐dissection‐based methods. At the Medical College of Wisconsin, team‐based, body donor dissections are the basis for the Clinical Human Anatomy course. However, the pandemic necessitated changes to the format of laboratory activities. For the 2020‐2021 academic year, students either completed anatomy labs in‐person in a socially distant environment or virtually. This provided an opportunity to directly compare the effect of different laboratory instructional modalities on student performance within a single course. All first‐year medical students were enrolled in the same Clinical Human Anatomy course, attended identical didactic sessions, and were assessed by identical examinations that included lecture‐based questions as well as laboratory image‐based questions. As the semester progressed and coronavirus disease case numbers rose, students were offered two options for completing laboratory instruction: (1) continue dissections in socially distant pairs or (2) transition to a virtual lab format. The virtual lab format included a self‐directed module which guided students through the dissections they would have done in person. Each module consisted of a PowerPoint presentation that incorporated interactive software (3D4Medical Complete Anatomy) and dissection images. The self‐directed modules were followed by interactive Zoom sessions, wherein faculty reviewed a prosection and posed clinically relevant questions to the meeting attendees. Students who opted for the virtual lab format were able to review dissections in‐person on their own time or with a tutor. Likewise, students who opted to continue dissection had access to the virtual modules and recordings of the Zoom sessions. Comparison between students completing labs virtually or in‐person showed no difference in aggregate performance on examinations. This study examined medical knowledge and did not investigate other competencies impacted by lab activities (teamwork, dealing with death, and the “first patient” experience). We consider hands‐on dissection to be the gold‐standard format for learning gross anatomy, but this study showed by direct comparison in a single course, that multiple laboratory formats can yield equivalent understanding of the complex structure of the body.","Hillmer, Ryan; Krippendorf, Beth; Patitucci, Teresa",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239755/,434

It contained a far higher proportion of submissions from the first three groups of contributors, above, than traditional journals. The analysis is organised under four analytic themes: ‘Hidden populations; Life, loss and hope; Practising differently and Policy and system change’. The article concludes by describing the apparent divergence between accounts that primarily suggest evidence of improved working relationships between social workers and those they serve via digital practices, and accounts suggesting that an increasingly authoritarian social work practice has emerged under COVID-19. We argue that, notwithstanding this divergence, an upsurge in activism within social work internationally during the pandemic provides a basis for believing that the emergence of a community-situated, socially engaged social work is possible post-pandemic.","Sen, Robin; Kerr, Christian; MacIntyre, Gillian; Featherstone, Brid; Gupta, Anna; Quinn-Aziz, Abyd",Br J Soc Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241417/,434

To infect and colonize their hosts, they secrete effectors including hydrolytic enzymes able to kill and macerate plant tissues. These secreted proteins are transported from the Endoplasmic Reticulum and the Golgi apparatus to the extracellular space through intracellular vesicles. In pathogenic fungi, intracellular vesicles were described but their biogenesis and their role in virulence remain unclear. In this study, we report the essential role of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) in the pathogenicity of Botrytis cinerea, the agent of gray mold disease. To investigate the importance of this protein involved in coat vesicles formation in eukaryotic cells, a T-DNA insertional mutant reduced in the expression of the CHC-encoding gene, and a mutant expressing a dominant-negative form of CHC were studied. Both mutants were strongly affected in pathogenicity. Characterization of the mutants revealed altered infection cushions and an important defect in protein secretion. This study demonstrates the essential role of clathrin in the infectious process of a plant pathogenic fungus and more particularly its role in virulence factors delivery.","Souibgui, Eytham; Bruel, Christophe; Choquer, Mathias; de Vallée, Amélie; Dieryckx, Cindy; Dupuy, Jean William; Latorse, Marie-Pascale; Rascle, Christine; Poussereau, Nathalie",Front Plant Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8244658/,434

This study aims to evaluate the cavitation resistance of WC-10Co4Cr and WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings under cavitation erosion conditions with additional electrochemical effects. The coatings were deposited on AISI 1040 steel substrates using a high velocity air fuel thermal spray process. The microstructure of the coatings was observed by a scanning electron microscope, while their phase composition was analyzed using an energy-dispersive microanalysis system. In addition, the microhardness of the coatings and substrate was measured, and the surface topography of the eroded surface layers was observed using a 3D optical profilometer. The results revealed that the cavitation resistance of the WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings was better than that of the WC-10Co4Cr coatings. The observation of the structure and surface topography made it possible to identity the reasons for the differences between the cavitation resistance of both coatings: The WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings had a finer grain structure, lower pore density, and lower as-sprayed surface roughness. These differences, along with the presence of a high Cr and Ni content in the feedstock powder, that increased the coating corrosion resistance, contributed to improving the cavitation resistance and reducing the material loss of the WC-20CrC-7Ni coatings.","Korobov, Yu.; Alwan, H.; Soboleva, N.; Makarov, A.; Lezhnin, N.; Shumyakov, V.; Antonov, M.; Deviatiarov, M.",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8360761/,434

Furthermore, therapeutic doses of chemotherapeutic agents are limited due to their lack of tissue specificity. Various developments in nanotechnology have been applied to medicine with the aim of enhancing the drug delivery of chemotherapeutic agents. One of the successful developments includes nanoparticles which are particles that range between 1 and 100 nm that may be utilized as drug delivery systems for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer as they overcome the issues associated with chemotherapy; they are highly efficacious and cause fewer side effects on healthy tissues. Other nanotechnological developments include organic nanocarriers such as liposomes which are a type of nanoparticle, although they can deviate from the standard size range of nanoparticles as they may be several hundred nanometres in size. Liposomes are small artificial spherical vesicles ranging between 30 nm and several micrometres and contain one or more concentric lipid bilayers encapsulating an aqueous core that can entrap both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs. Liposomes are biocompatible and low in toxicity and can be utilized to encapsulate and facilitate the intracellular delivery of chemotherapeutic agents as they are biodegradable and have reduced systemic toxicity compared with free drugs. Liposomes may be modified with PEG chains to prolong blood circulation and enable passive targeting. Grafting of targeting ligands on liposomes enables active targeting of anticancer drugs to tumour sites. In this review, we shall explore the properties of liposomes as drug delivery systems for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer.

The virtual simulation teaching mode is no longer a new thing for people, and it is more and more accepted by people familiar with it. Induction and analysis of short message texts generated by students' online learning can fully understand students, make effective adjustments to the classroom, guide teachers' teaching practice, and optimize the classroom, thereby improving students' learning ability, practical ability, innovation ability, and collaboration. To study the effect of virtual simulation education on improving the skills of medical students, this paper is based on video training and education of virtual reality side-cut high-simulation simulator using case analysis and literature analysis methods. It collects data from databases and builds on online education. The model was developed, and a large number of relevant pieces of literature were read and analyzed through the literature survey method. The research results show that virtual simulation teaching can effectively improve students' technical thinking and ability. Students' technical thinking and ability are about 30% higher than traditional teaching methods, and the cooperation consciousness between students reaches 0.8 consciousness, which can solve the contradiction between popularization and improvement.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate our patients diagnosed with MIS-C and present them to the literature in order to contribute to the better understanding of this new disease, which entered paediatric practice with the SARS-CoV-2 peak. METHODS: In this study, 17 MIS-C cases diagnosed according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were included. RESULTS: Of the patients, 7 (41.2%) had a comorbidity. Gastrointestinal system involvement was the most prominent in the patients (70.6%). Laparotomy was performed in 3 patients due to acute abdomen. Two patients had neurological involvement. Of the patients, 15 (88.2%) received intravenous immunoglobulin and 13 (76.5%) received both intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone. Two patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and 4 patients received high flow rate nasal cannula oxygen therapy. One of our patients who needed invasive mechanical ventilation and high vasoactive-inotrope support died despite all supportive treatments including plasmapheresis and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Unnecessary laparotomy should be avoided.","Salman, Hakan; Aslan, Nagehan; Akçam, Mustafa; Arslan, Müjgan; Akkuzu, Emine; Yılmaz Keskin, Ebru; Açarı, Ceyhun; Keskin, Mahmut; Atar, Müge; Köşker, Muhammet; Sinanoğlu, Selçuk; Çetin, Hasan; Akçam, Füsun Zeynep",Mod Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499971/,434
59392,Discovery of a New Oxygen Delivery Method During COVID-19 Pandemic: Wearing a Surgical Mask Over Oxygen Cannula.,2021-01-01,"Background: In our analysis of adolescents affected by the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, we observed many negative mental health effects in individuals with a prior history of psychological trauma. Elevated rates of depression and markers of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were observed, consistent with the hypothesis that prior trauma may reduce sensitivity thresholds for later psychopathology (stress sensitization). Surprisingly, levels of anxiety did not differ based on prior trauma history, nor were retraumatized individuals at increased risk for recent (past month) suicidal ideation. These results are more suggestive of inoculation by prior trauma than stress sensitization. This led us to consider whether individuals with a prior trauma history showed evidence of Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG), a condition in which the experience of a previous trauma leads to areas of sparing or even improvement. Method: To investigate this issue, we generated a structural equation model (SEM) exploring the role of anxiety in previously traumatized (n = 295) and wildfire trauma alone (n = 740) groups. Specifically, models were estimated to explore the relationship between hopelessness, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, self-efficacy and potential protective factors such as friend and family support in both groups. The model was tested using a cross-sectional sample of affected youth, comparing effects between the two groups. Results: While both models produced relatively good fit, differences in the effects and chi-squared values led us to conclude that the groups are subject to different causal specifications in a number of areas, although details warrant caution pending additional investigation. Discussion: We found that adolescents with a prior trauma history appear to have a more realistic appraisal of potential difficulties associated with traumatic events, and seem less reactive to potentially unsettling PTSD symptoms. They also seemed less prone to overconfidence as they got older, an effect seen in the adolescents without a history of trauma. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that the construct of anxiety may work differently in newly traumatized and retraumatized individuals, particularly in the context of mass trauma events.","Pazderka, Hannah; Brown, Matthew RG.; McDonald-Harker, Caroline Beth; Greenshaw, Andrew James; Agyapong, Vincent IO.; Noble, Shannon; Mankowski, Monica; Lee, Bonnie; Omeje, Joy; Brett-MacLean, Pamela; Kitching, Deborah Terry; Hayduk, Leslie A.; Silverstone, Peter H.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514981/,434

In this study, the effects of oral uptake of melamine, melamine formaldehyde, and polyvinyl chloride on serum biochemical profiles, antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation levels and brain acetyl cholinesterase activities in Clarias gariepinus juveniles were investigated. METHODS Fish specimens were fed diets spiked with melamine, melamine formaldehyde and poly vinyl chloride at 0.3% (3.0 g Kg-1) dietary inclusion for 45 days. Toxicity effect of these plastic chemicals was estimated by assaying relevant biomarkers. RESULTS After 45 days exposure, Serum glucose was significantly elevated, whereas plasma protein levels were substantially reduced in the exposed fish groups. Serum transaminases were significantly elevated in the exposed groups. Brain acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzyme activities declined significantly, while malondialdehyde levels were elevated in the exposed groups. CONCLUSION C. gariepinus is an important bioindicator to monitor the ecotoxicological impact of plastic chemicals such as melamine, and polyvinyl chloride.","Iheanacho, Stanley Chidi; Igberi, Christiana; Amadi-Eke, Akunna; Chinonyerem, Delight; Iheanacho, Angus; Avwemoya, Fred","Biomarkers : biochemical indicators of exposure, response, and susceptibility to chemicals",https://doi.org/10.1080/1354750x.2020.1821777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962424/,434

Resident physician burnout is a significant problem and is correlated with time spent using an EHR after work hours. Family physicians have the highest rate of burnout of all specialties, and the EHR is a significant contributor to this burnout. Studies have shown that increased EHR education can improve job satisfaction. METHOD Over 5 months, we provided weekly brief (15 minute) educational sessions covering 6 topics twice and a one-hour individualized meeting of each resident physician with an EHR trainer. We evaluated our intervention with wellness surveys and objective measures of EHR efficiency both pre and post intervention. We further evaluated efficiency by comparing pre and post-intervention values of the following: average keystrokes, mouseclicks, accelerator use, minutes per encounter and percent closed encounters at month's end. RESULTS Resident questionnaires showed lessons increased knowledge and intention to use EHR accelerators, but this was not statistically significant. Analysis of objective data showed most efficiency metrics worsened, though most not to a degree that was statistically significant. Residents reported subjective increases in efficiency, and paired data from wellness surveys showed an overall decrease in burnout post-intervention vs. baseline. CONCLUSIONS Much of the data in this pilot study does not reach statistical significance, but is highly suggestive that increased EHR training can improve at least perceived efficiency and thereby resident wellness.","Johnson, Elizabette; Roth, Elizabeth",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211034633; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34292059/,434

Interventional cardiology is no longer limited to the treatment of coronary artery disease but allows also treatment of valvular disease, stroke prevention, hypertension, etc. One of the most important new treatment options is the percutaneous treatment for aortic valve stenosis (transcatheter aortic valve implantation), since aortic valve disease is a rather common problem in elderly patients, with many of them at high risk for surgery. Similarly, mitral regurgitation is often associated with comorbidities which make surgery high risk. The MitraClip is a promising percutaneous alternative to surgical valve repair or replacement. Other procedures discussed in this review are the percutaneous left atrial appendage closure as a non-pharmacologic therapy to prevent strokes, and renal denervation for resistant hypertension.

We want to assess whether increased symptom interval (SI) is associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma. METHODS We analyzed prospectively collected data of 220 patients younger than 40 years who had osteosarcoma around the knee. Symptom interval was analyzed to evaluate its impact on metastases at diagnosis, tumor volume, chemotherapy response and overall survival. RESULTS The median of SI was 64.5 (Q1-Q3: 42-88) days. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients with different length of symptom interval (<42 days, 42-64 days, 65-87 days, > = 88 days) were 0.78 (95 %CI: 0.67-0.89), 0.49 (95 %CI: 0.35-0.63), 0.52 (95 %CI:0.39-0.65), and 0.65 (95 %CI:0.53-0.77) respectively(p = 0.013). Nonparametric test showed increased SI was associated with metastases at diagnosis (p = 0.008), but not associated with large tumor volume or poor chemotherapy response. Cox regression mode test showed that patient with increased SI had higher hazard ratio (42-64 days HR: 2.586 (95 %CI:1.360-4.915); 65-87 days, HR: 2.225 (95 %CI:1.170-4.233)) for poor outcomes compared to short SI (<42 days), though it was not significant in multivariate analysis (p = 0.182). CONCLUSION Increased SI but not the longest SI is associated with higher incidence of metastases at diagnosis; patients can benefit from an earlier diagnosis in terms of survival.","Hu, Jianping; Zhang, Chunlin; Zhu, Kunpeng; Zhang, Lei; Cai, Tao; Zhan, Taicheng; Luo, Xiong; Dong, Yang",Cancer epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2020.101776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645592/,434

Exploiting a continuous movement of the precursor isolation window to assign precursor masses to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragment traces, Scanning SWATH increases precursor identifications by ~70% compared to conventional data-independent acquisition (DIA) methods on 0.5-5-min chromatographic gradients. We demonstrate the application of ultra-fast proteomics in drug mode-of-action screening and plasma proteomics. Scanning SWATH proteomes capture the mode of action of fungistatic azoles and statins. Moreover, we confirm 43 and identify 11 new plasma proteome biomarkers of COVID-19 severity, advancing patient classification and biomarker discovery. Thus, our results demonstrate a substantial acceleration and increased depth in fast proteomic experiments that facilitate proteomic drug screens and clinical studies.","Messner, Christoph B; Demichev, Vadim; Bloomfield, Nic; Yu, Jason S L; White, Matthew; Kreidl, Marco; Egger, Anna-Sophia; Freiwald, Anja; Ivosev, Gordana; Wasim, Fras; Zelezniak, Aleksej; Jürgens, Linda; Suttorp, Norbert; Sander, Leif Erik; Kurth, Florian; Lilley, Kathryn S; Mülleder, Michael; Tate, Stephen; Ralser, Markus",Nature biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-00860-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767396/,434

Compared to other regions, there are relatively few studies in the literature that report on the C&D waste management issues of Qatar. The present work begins to address this gap by providing insights into the current state of C&D waste management practices in Qatar and by providing a mini-review on the benefits of using recycled aggregates which have only recently been allowed locally by Qatar Construction Standards. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis has been implemented, using data and information from various sources including governmental reports, industries, local waste management companies, as well as reported interviews with relevant stakeholders.

We previously showed that if the five interacting amino acids which differ between hamster and human DPP4 are changed to the residues found in human DPP4, hamster DPP4 does act as a receptor. Here, we show that the functionality of hamster DPP4 as a receptor is severely decreased if less than 4 out of 5 amino acids are changed. IMPORTANCE The novel emerging coronavirus MERS-CoV has infected >1,600 people worldwide, and the case fatality rate is ∼36%. In this study, we show that by changing 4 amino acids in hamster DPP4, this protein functions as a receptor for MERS-CoV.

METHODS This retrospective study was conducted using the hospital database with 4,758 patients who underwent CABG surgery. Among them, 2,836 patients with complete data participated in this study. The female patients were divided into two groups as patients who developed new-onset AF after CABG and those who did not. The relationship between the patients' variables and risk factors of post-CABG AF was examined. RESULTS The overall incidence of post CABG AF was 12.9% (386/2,836). Sex-specific incidence of AF was similar: 3.2% (91/690) and 12.9% (277/2146) in female and male patients, respectively (p = 0.849). Multiple analysis revealed the independent risk factors for male and female patients, respectively: mean age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.057, OR = 1,076), age over 65 years (OR = 2.156, OR = 2.736), the European System For Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation Scores (EuroSCORE) (OR = 1.13, OR = 1.218), COPD (OR = 1.589, OR = 1.789), BUN level (OR = 1.026, OR = 1.019), mean cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR = 1.007, OR = 1.010), prolonged CPB time (OR = 1.604, OR = 2.309), mean cross-clamp time (OR = 1.009, OR = 1.017), need of inotropic support (OR = 2.249, OR = 2.731), and mean mechanical ventilation time (VT) (OR = 1.026, OR = 1.027).Low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (OR = 1.419), left ventricular (LV) aneurysm repair (OR = 1.533), carotid artery disease (OR = 1.750), prolonged VT (OR = 1.729), and use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) (OR = 2.436) were found to be the risk factors only for male AF patients.Unstable angina (OR = 1.969), right coronary artery (RCA) disease (OR = 2), prolonged cross-clamp time (OR = 2.152), and the number of grafts per operation (OR = 1.298) were found to be the risk factors only for female AF patients. CONCLUSION This study suggests that predictors of AF in the overall population may be due to isolated patient groups. Multiple regression analysis and artificial intelligence modelling should be performed on large-scale, isolated groups to make strong AF prediction.","Akça, Barış; Erdil, Nevzat; Colak, Mehmet Cengiz; Disli, Olcay Murat; Battaloglu, Bektas; Colak, Cemil",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0038-1629921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510430/,434
64376,"Biden And New Congress Tackle COVID-19, ACA.",2021-02-08,"Flagellar beating drives sperm through the female reproductive tract and is vital for reproduction. Flagellar waves are generated by thousands of asymmetric molecular components; yet, paradoxically, forward swimming arises via symmetric side-to-side flagellar movement. This led to the preponderance of symmetric flagellar control hypotheses. However, molecular asymmetries must still dictate the flagellum and be manifested in the beat. Here, we reconcile molecular and microscopic observations, reconnecting structure to function, by showing that human sperm uses asymmetric and anisotropic controls to swim. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) microscopy revealed two coactive transversal controls: An asymmetric traveling wave creates a one-sided stroke, and a pulsating standing wave rotates the sperm to move equally on all sides. Symmetry is thus achieved through asymmetry, creating the optical illusion of bilateral symmetry in 2D microscopy. This shows that the sperm flagellum is asymmetrically controlled and anisotropically regularized by fast-signal transduction. This enables the sperm to swim forward.","Gadêlha, Hermes; Hernández-Herrera, Paul; Montoya, Fernando; Darszon, Alberto; Corkidi, Gabriel",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789171/,434

Methods In this study, we used a purely data-driven statistical method to estimate the CFR in the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak. Daily numbers of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths were collected from January 10 to February 3, 2020 and divided into three clusters: Wuhan city, other cities of Hubei province, and other provinces of mainland China. Simple linear regression model was applied to estimate the CFR from each cluster. Results We estimated that CFR during the first weeks of the epidemic ranges from 0.15% (95% CI: 0.12-0.18%) in mainland China excluding Hubei through 1.41% (95% CI: 1.38-1.45%) in Hubei province excluding the city of Wuhan to 5.25% (95% CI: 4.98-5.51%) in Wuhan. Conclusions Our early estimates suggest that the CFR of COVID-19 is lower than the previous coronavirus epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).","Yang, Shu; Cao, Peihua; Du, Peipei; Wu, Ziting; Zhuang, Zian; Yang, Lin; Yu, Xuan; Zhou, Qi; Feng, Xixi; Wang, Xiaohui; Li, Weiguo; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Ju; Chen, Yaolong; He, Daihai",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm.2020.02.66; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32175421/,434
72125,Psychosocial influences on posttraumatic growth among university students following a mass murder.,2021,"BACKGROUND Guidelines regarding head and neck surgical care have evolved during the coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Data on operative management have been limited. METHODS We compared two cohorts of patients undergoing head and neck or reconstructive surgery between March 16, 2019 and April 16, 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and March 16, 2020 and April 16, 2020 (COVID-19) at an academic center. Perioperative, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes were recorded. RESULTS There were 63 operations during COVID-19 and 84 operations during pre-COVID-19. During COVID-19, a smaller proportion of patients had benign pathology (12% vs 20%, respectively) and underwent thyroid procedures (2% vs 23%) while a greater proportion of patients underwent microvascular reconstruction±ablation (24% vs 12%,). Operative times increased, especially among patients undergoing microvascular reconstruction±ablation (687 ± 112 vs 596 ± 91 minutes, P = .04). Complication rates and length of stay were similar. CONCLUSIONS During COVID-19, perioperative outcomes were similar, operative time increased, and there were no recorded transmissions to staff or patients. Continued surgical management of head and neck cancer patients can be provided safely.","Wai, Katherine C; Xu, Mary Jue; Lee, Rex H; El-Sayed, Ivan H; George, Jonathan R; Heaton, Chase M; Knott, P Daniel; Park, Andrea M; Ryan, William R; Seth, Rahul; Ha, Patrick K",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33098178/,434

We aimed to describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at a tertiary-care center in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY We conducted an observational study of adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized between February-June 2020. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 and PCR positivity were included. We created logistic regression models to understand association of clinical characteristics with illness severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS The study population comprised 445 patients [67% males, median age 53 (IQR 40-64) years]. Majority of patients (N = 268; 60%) had ≥ 1 co-morbid [37.5% hypertension, 36.4% diabetes]. In-hospital mortality was 13%. Age ≥ 60 (aOR] =1.92; 95 %CI = 1.23-3.03), shortness of breath (aOR=4.43; 95% CI=2.73-7.22), CRP ≥150mg/L (aOR:1.77; 95% CI=1.09-2.85), LDH ≥ 500 I.U/L (aOR:1.98; 95% CI=1.25-3.16), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ≥5 (aOR:2.80; 95%CI = 1.77-4.42) and increase in serum creatinine (aOR:1.32; 95%CI=1.07-1.61) were independently associated with disease severity. Septic shock (aOR: 13.27; 95% CI=3.78-46.65), age ≥ 60 (aOR: 3.26; 95% CI=1.07-9.89), Ferritin ≥ 1500ng/ml (aOR: 3.78; 95% CI=1.21-11.8), NLR ≥ 5 (aOR: 4.04; 95% CI=1.14-14.35) and acute kidney injury (aOR: 5.52; 95% CI=1.78-17.06) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS We found multiple predictors to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality, except diabetes and gender. Compared to reports from other countries, the in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients was lower, despite a high burden of co-morbidities. Further research is required to explore reasons behind this dichotomy.","Nasir, Nosheen; Habib, Kiren; Iffat Khanum,; Khan, Naveera; Muhammad, Zehra Abdul; Mahmood, Syed Faisal",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.14345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33956647/,434
73169,In Crisis: Medical Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Broad implementation of laparoscopic surgery has made trocar-related complications clinically important. Trocar-site hernia (TSH) is an uncommon, but potentially serious, complication that occasionally requires emergency surgery. This systematic review was conducted to establish the prevalence and risk factors for TSH. METHODS The review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched to 7 June 2010 for studies on TSH. RESULTS Twenty-two articles were included. One study was a randomized clinical trial, five were prospective cohort studies and 16 were retrospective cohort studies. The prevalence of TSH is low, with a median pooled estimate of 0·5 (range 0-5·2) per cent. No meta-analysis on risk factors could be performed. Pyramidal trocars, 12-mm trocars and a long duration of surgery were identified as the most important technical risk factors for TSH. Older age and a higher body mass index were observed to be patient-related risk factors. CONCLUSION TSH is an uncommon complication of laparoscopic surgery. The most important technical risk factors are the design and size of the trocars. The scientific evidence for recommendations to avoid TSH is sparse.","Swank, H A; Mulder, I M; la Chapelle, C F; Reitsma, J B; Lange, J F; Bemelman, W A",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22213083/,434

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated vast increases in the number of virtual pump trainings for Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump starts. A customized, structured pump training curriculum specifically tailored to virtual learning was deployed in early 2020, and included a) preparation for training with use of the t:simulator app, b) use of the teach-back method during video training, and c) automating data uploads for follow-up. Retrospective analysis from more than 23,000 pump training sessions performed from January 1, 2020 through July 28, 2020 showed sensor time-in-range for up to 6 months after training was 72% (60%-81%) for virtual training vs. 67% (54%-78%) for in-person training. Higher user satisfaction (4.78±0.52 vs. 4.64±0.68; p<0.01) and higher user confidence (4.61±0.75 vs. 4.47±0.0.85; p<0.01) were reported after the virtual sessions.

Data Sources: A PubMed and MEDLINE search (2010 to April 2020) was conducted for relevant articles. Data were also obtained from the package insert. Study Selection and Data Extraction: English language publications regarding the clinical efficacy and safety of immune globulin-slra were analyzed. Publications focused on use of immune globulin products were also included. Data Synthesis: Immune globulin-slra is indicated for patients with PIDD and was specifically developed to include donor plasma with high respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) antibody titers. Efficacy was demonstrated through favorable incidence of infections and infection-related complications. Patients treated with immune globulin-slra had increases in anti-RSV neutralizing antibody titers compared with baseline. Adverse events occurred at rates similar to or less than other available immune globulin products. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review describes a new immune globulin product available for use in patients with PIDD. A novel approach to managing patients at risk of serious infections may be to utilize products with formulations proven to not only boost IgG levels, but also antibodies to specific pathogens. Conclusions: The choice of which immune globulin product to select for a patient or formulary is complex. Each product is unique, and differences between products should be taken into consideration, along with cost and availability.","Bates, Brittany N; Olah, Mark E",The Annals of pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028020934722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32567360/,434

BACKGROUND Today, with the development of complex health systems, diplomacy in health care can take place at organizational, national and international levels. INTRODUCTION Diplomacy's role is to convince others peacefully to achieve goals. Diplomacy in nursing can facilitate professional development and direct policy and decision-making process towards the development of a healthcare system. METHODS The study used a qualitative descriptive approach. The sampling method was purposeful, and data were collected via in-depth, unstructured and face-to-face interviews with 16 participants. The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed through conventional content analysis based on Graneheim and Lundman's work. RESULTS In total, 212 codes were generated, which were grouped into three main categories, namely paradigmatic socio-political changes (two subcategories), nurses' dissatisfaction with their status in healthcare system (two subcategories) and multidimensional development of the nursing profession (four subcategories). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS Socio-political changes, development of the nursing profession and nurses' dissatisfaction with the health system have led to the emergence of diplomacy roles in nurse managers, the recognition and development of which can improve the effectiveness of nurse managers in policymaking. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING & HEALTH POLICY The recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has demonstrated the urgent need to use diplomacy to solve health problems and adjust or develop policymaking at the national and international levels. Strengthening their role in diplomacy, nurse managers can play an important role as diplomats at various levels of policymaking and in health crisis management.","Sharafi, Simin; Cheraghi, Mohammad Ali; Nasiri, Ahmad; Mahmoudirad, Gholamhossein",International nursing review,https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459367/,434
75470,A Knowledge Distillation Ensemble Framework for Predicting Short and Long-term Hospitalisation Outcomes from Electronic Health Records Data.,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND Leadless pacemakers are an established treatment option for bradyarrhythmias. Similar to conventional transvenous pacemakers, satisfying pacing values during implantation are targeted for optimal long-term device function. The objective is to investigate the role of a local injury current (IC) in leadless pacemaker implantations. METHOD The IC, sensing value, capture threshold and impedance were collected in 30 consecutive patients receiving a leadless pacemaker. RESULTS 39 EGMs were recorded from 30 patients (including 9 device repositions). An IC was detected in 15 cases (38%). At implantation, the presence of an IC was associated with a significantly lower sensing (7.1 ± 3.7 mV vs 12.0 ± 4.0 mV; P = 0.004) and a higher capture threshold (median threshold 1.13 V at 0.24 ms [0.50-2.00] vs 0.50 V at 0.24 ms [0.25-0.75]; P = 0.002) and with a 26 fold higher likelihood of device repositioning compared to the absence of an IC (OR 26.3 [2.79-248], P < 0.001). Patients with an IC in their final implant position had a lower sensing (9.3 ± 4.4 mV vs 13.6 ± 4.7 mV at implantation, P = 0.04), while the initially similar capture threshold was lower after 24 h in the IC group. After 2 weeks, all parameters were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Our study shows that an IC can readily be observed during leadless pacemaker implantation associated with a lower sensing and a higher capture threshold at implantation but with similar to even better values during follow-up.","Breitenstein, Alexander; Saguner, Ardan M; Gasperetti, Alessio; Hofer, Daniel; Koepfli, Pascal; Regoli, François; Steffel, Jan",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.08.098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916226/,434

A rapid and accurate detection method for the antibody is significant to the disease diagnosis, especially for the epidemic. To this end, a highly sensitive whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) optical testing kit is designed and fabricated for detecting the specific immunoglobulin antibodies. The key component of the kit is a silica self-assembled microsphere decorated with the nucleocapsid proteins (N-proteins) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. After the N-protein antibody immunoglobulin G (N-IgG) and immunoglobulin M (N-IgM) solutions being injected into the kit, the WGM red-shifts due to the antigen-antibody reaction. The wavelength displacement rates are proportional to the concentrations of these two antibodies from 1 μg/ml to 100 mg/ml.

Evidence from 67 countries.",2021-05-21,"Background The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. However, the prevalence of retesting positive by RT-PCR for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the associated patient characteristics, remain unclear. Methods We included 90 confirmed cases of COVID-19 treated in the Nanjing Public Health Center from January 20, 2020 to February 16, 2020 in this retrospective study. All patients completed treatment for COVID-19 and were retested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 4-20 days after completion of therapy. The clinical characteristics between patients with who retested positive versus negative by RT-PCR were compared, and the factors predictive of positive retesting were analyzed. Positive retesting was modeled with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The age range of the study population was 0.8-97 years, and all patients were cured or showed improvement. A total of 10 (11%) patients retested positive by RT-PCR 4-20 days after completion of therapy. As compared with patients who retested negative, those who retested positive had a lower percentage of pre-admission fever, a higher percentage of post-admission fever, a lower percentage of bilateral lung infection, higher white blood cell (WBC) count and creatine phosphokinase, and lower hypersensitive c-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 and erythrocyte sedimentation rates (all P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis of the above eight key variables showed that lower hs-CRP and higher WBC were independently associated with positive retesting by RT-PCR. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC were predictive of positive retesting, with an AUC of 0.859. Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 who retested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 had mild symptoms and better blood testing results. A combination of hs-CRP and WBC may predict positive retesting by RT-PCR; however, the sensitivity and specificity should be studied further.","Liu, Yuan; Ding, Ning; Zhou, Shixiang; Chen, Chen; Huang, Shan; Lv, Yanling; Jiao, Damin; Zheng, Yishan; Hu, Zhiliang; Xu, Chuanjun; Chen, Wei; Dai, Hui; Sun, Wenkui; Cheng, Cong; Lv, Ru; Cheng, Jian; Ye, Zi; Li, Zhengjie; Yi, Yongxiang; Wei, Hongxia",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd.2020.04.17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282346/,434

DESIGN Case series of consecutive veterans with SCI treated at a single center. SETTING SCI Unit at an urban Veterans Administration hospital at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. PARTICIPANTS Seven SCI veterans with confirmed COVID-19 infection by PCR; all veterans were male, mean age was 60.6. Five had cervical level of injury, and five had complete injury (AIS A). Six veterans had a BMI > 22; three had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; three had chronic kidney disease. INTERVENTIONS None. OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of co-morbidities, diagnostic values, and clinical findings. RESULTS Each case presented differently; the most common presenting sign was fever. In the three individuals with critical and fatal infection, pre-existing comorbidities were more common and inflammatory markers were markedly elevated. CONCLUSION Level and completeness of SCI did not appear to correlate with COVID-19 severity, as mild and asymptomatic illness was noted in persons with high grade SCI. As has been shown to be the case in the general population, pre-existing comorbidities are the most reliable predictors of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection currently available for persons with chronic SCI. Contrary to concerns that SCI may mask the cardinal signs of COVID-19, such as fever and cough, by way of compromised thermoregulation and thoracoabdominal musculature, such signs were common in our series. To facilitate early detection, prompt treatment, and minimized viral spread, the implementation of preventive strategies by SCI units is recommended.","Galea, Marinella D; Gelman, Michael A; Galea, Vincent P; Raulkar, Krutika Parasar; Kornfeld, Stephen; Johnson-Kunjukutty, Swapna; Li, Gang; Bräu, Norbert",The journal of spinal cord medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/10790268.2020.1871254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465012/,434

78339,Uveitis Specialists Harnessing Disruptive Technology during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond.,2021-03-23,"Vaccination has made an enormous contribution to global health. Two major infections, smallpox and rinderpest, have been eradicated. Global coverage of vaccination against many important infectious diseases of childhood has been enhanced dramatically since the creation of WHO's Expanded Programme of Immunization in 1974 and of the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization in 2000. Polio has almost been eradicated and success in controlling measles makes this infection another potential target for eradication. Despite these successes, approximately 6.6 million children still die each year and about a half of these deaths are caused by infections, including pneumonia and diarrhoea, which could be prevented by vaccination. Enhanced deployment of recently developed pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines should, therefore, result in a further decline in childhood mortality. Development of vaccines against more complex infections, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, has been challenging and achievements so far have been modest. Final success against these infections may require combination vaccinations, each component stimulating a different arm of the immune system. In the longer term, vaccines are likely to be used to prevent or modulate the course of some non-infectious diseases. Progress has already been made with therapeutic cancer vaccines and future potential targets include addiction, diabetes, hypertension and Alzheimer's disease.","Greenwood, Brian","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

79844,COVID-19 and the Need for a National Health Information Technology Infrastructure.,2020-05-18,"BACKGROUND Relaxation of laws and regulations around privacy and billing during the COVID-19 pandemic provide expanded opportunities to use telehealth to provide patient care at a distance. Many health systems have transitioned to providing outpatient care via telehealth; however, there is an opportunity to utilize telehealth for inpatients to promote physical distancing. OBJECTIVE This article evaluates the use of a rapidly implemented, secure inpatient telehealth program. METHODS We assembled a multidisciplinary team to rapidly design, implement, and iteratively improve an inpatient telehealth quality improvement initiative using an existing videoconferencing system at our academic medical center. We assigned each hospital bed space a unique meeting link and updated the meeting password for each new patient. Patients and families were encouraged to use their own mobile devices to join meetings when possible. RESULTS Within 7 weeks of go-live, we hosted 1,820 inpatient telehealth sessions (13.3 sessions per 100 bedded days). We logged 104,647 minutes of inpatient telehealth time with a median session duration of 22 minutes (range 1-1,961). There were 5,288 participant devices used with a mean of 3 devices per telehealth session (range 2-22). Clinicians found they were able to build rapport and perform a reasonable physical exam. CONCLUSION We successfully implemented and scaled a secure inpatient telehealth program using an existing videoconferencing system in less than 1 week. Our implementation provided an intuitive naming convention for providers and capitalized on the broad availability of smartphones and tablets. Initial comments from clinicians suggest the system was useful; however, further work is needed to streamline initial setup for patients and families as well as care coordination to support clinician communication and workflows. Numerous use cases identified suggest a role for inpatient telehealth will remain after the COVID-19 crisis underscoring the importance of lasting regulatory reform.","Hron, Jonathan D; Parsons, Chase R; Williams, Lee Ann; Harper, Marvin B; Bourgeois, Fabienne C",Applied clinical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1713635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610350/,434

METHODOLOGY The study was performed among COVID-19 infected and uninfected healthcare workers in three hospitals in Wuhan. A total of 325 healthcare workers participated; among them 151 COVID-19-infected healthcare workers were included. Characteristics of infected healthcare workers, and influencing factors including exposure histories, the use of protective equipment in different risk conditions and areas, perceptions, emotions, satisfactions and educations were described and analyzed. RESULTS Healthcare workers got infected clustered mostly in the physical examination center. When performing general operations on confirmed or suspected patients, the use of protective equipment including the effectiveness of masks (p < 0.001), gloves (p < 0.001); and the use of gloves (p < 0.001), suits (p < 0.001), gowns (p < 0.001), shoe covers (p < 0.001), and hats (p < 0.001) were protective factors. The use of protective equipment was a protective factor in most cases. Negative emotions and dissatisfaction to the hospital response were associated with the increased risk of infection. CONCLUSIONS The use of protective equipment, emotions and satisfactions to hospital responses are key COVID-19-infected factors. The awareness, the supply and the use of protective equipment, the layout of departments and other environmental and management factors should be strictly equipped. In addition, hospitals should also pay attention to emotions and satisfaction of healthcare workers.","Lai, Xiaoquan; Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Xinping; Tan, Li",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296333/,434

82907,Preventing a covid-19 pandemic.,2020-02-28,"Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading neurological cause of disability in young adults. As a chronic disease, MS requires complex and challenging management. In this context, eHealth has gained an increasing relevance. Here, we aim to summarize beneficial features of a mobile app recently implemented in clinical MS routine as well as beyond MS. PatientConcept is a CE-certified, ID-associated multilingual software application allowing patients to record relevant health data without disclosing any identifying data. Patients can voluntarily share their health data with selected physicians. Since its implementation in 2018, about 3000 MS patients have used PatientConcept. Initially developed as a physician-patient communication platform, the app maps risk management plans of all current disease modifying therapies and thereby facilitates adherence to specified monitoring appointments. It also allows continuous monitoring of various PROs (Patient Reported Outcomes), enabling a broad overview of the disease course. In addition, various studies/projects currently assess monitoring, follow-up, diagnostics and telemetric evaluations of patients with other diseases beyond MS. Altogether, PatientConcept offers a broad range of possibilities to support physician-patient communication, implementation of risk management plans and assessment of PROs. It is a promising tool to facilitate patient-tailored management of MS and other chronic diseases.","Lang, Michael; Rau, Daniela; Cepek, Lukas; Cürten, Fia; Ringbauer, Stefan; Mayr, Martin",Brain sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11081061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439680/,434

Ultrasound (US) of the inferior vena cava (IVC) may be a fast, noninvasive tool to gauge volume status, but its utility is unclear. Our objectives were to determine the interobserver agreement of IVC collapse and collapse duration, then correlate IVC collapse with the outcome of intravenous (IV) versus oral (PO) rehydration. METHODS We conducted a prospective study by enrolling patients 0 to 21 years old with emesis requiring ondansetron or diarrhea requiring IV hydration. Clinical operators interpreted US examinations in real time to determine whether the IVC was collapsed. Two blinded reviewers interpreted the US videos to determine IVC collapse and collapse duration. Cohen's kappa(κ) was calculated for reviewer-reviewer and reviewer-operator agreement. Primary outcomes were PO versus IV rehydration, and admitted versus discharged. RESULTS One hundred twelve patients were enrolled, and 102 had complete data for analysis. The mean age was 7.2 years with 51% female. Twenty-nine patients received IV hydration. The reviewer-operator agreement for IVC collapse was κ = 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.75) and interreviewer agreement was κ = 0.93 (95% CI, 0.83-1.0). The interreviewer agreement for collapse duration was κ = 0.66 (95% CI, 0.51-0.82). All patients with noncollapsed IVCs tolerated PO hydration. The likelihood of receiving IV hydration was correlated with the duration of IVC collapse (P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS Based on a novel dynamic measure of IVC collapse duration, children with increasing duration of IVC collapse correlated positively with the need for IV rehydration. Noncollapsing IVCs on US were associated with successful PO rehydration without need for IV fluids or emergency department revisits.","Zhou, Amy Z; Green, Robert S; Haines, Elizabeth J; Vazquez, Michelle N; Tay, Ee T; Tsung, James W",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002150; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530838/,434
83943,"Mask related acne (""maskne"") and other facial dermatoses.",2021-06-07,"INTRODUCTION With the medical focus on disease, the problem of overdiagnosis inevitably increases with ageing. Considering the functional health of patients might help to discriminate between necessary and unnecessary medicine. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is an internationally recognised tool for describing functional health. However, it is too detailed to be used in primary care practices. Consequently, the aim of this study is to identify relevant codes for an ICF core set for community-dwelling older adults (75 years and above) in primary care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The study will follow the methodology proposed by the ICF Research Branch to identify relevant concepts from different perspectives: (1) Research perspective: A systematic review of studies focusing on functional health in old age will be conducted in different databases. Relevant concepts will be extracted from the publications. (2) Patients' perspective: Relevant areas of functioning and disability will be identified conducting qualitative interviews and focus groups with community-dwelling older persons. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed using the documentary method of interpretation. (3) Experts' perspective: An online survey with open-ended questions will be conducted. Answers will be analysed using the qualitative content analysis of Mayring. (4) Clinical perspective: A cross-sectional empirical study will be performed to assess the health status of community-dwelling older adults using the extended ICF checklist and other measurement tools.Relevant concepts identified in each study will be linked to ICF categories resulting in four preliminary core sets. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval for the study was obtained (90_17B). All participants will provide written informed consent. Data will be pseudonymised for analysis. Results will be disseminated by conference presentations and journal publications.

83979,Commentary: The COVID-19 Pandemic Is Not a Good Time to Weaken Restrictions on Alcohol Availability.,2021-05-01,"PURPOSE As Huntington disease (HD) progresses, speech and swallowing difficulties become more profound. These difficulties have an adverse effect on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), thus psychometrically robust measures of speech and swallowing are needed to better understand the impact of these domains across the course of the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish the clinical utility of two new patient-reported outcome measures (PROs), HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties and HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties. METHODS Thirty-one participants with premanifest or manifest HD, and 31 age- and sex-matched healthy control participants were recruited for this study. Participants completed several PROs [HDQLIFE Speech Difficulties, HDQLIFE Swallowing Difficulties, Communication Participation Item Bank (CPIB)], as well as several clinician-rated assessments of speech and functioning. A computational algorithm designed to detect features of spoken discourse was also examined. Analyses were focused on establishing the reliability and validity of these new measures. RESULTS Internal consistency was good for Swallowing (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89) and excellent for Speech and the CPIB (both Cronbach's alpha ≥ 0.94), and convergent/discriminant validity was supported. Known groups validity for the PROs was supported by significant group differences among control participants and persons with different stages of HD (all p < 0.0001). All PROs were able to distinguish those with and without clinician-rated dysarthria (likelihood ratios far exceeded the threshold for clinical decision making [all ≥ 3.28]). CONCLUSIONS Findings support the clinical utility of the HDQLIFE Speech and Swallowing PROs and the CPIB for use across the HD disease spectrum. These PROs also have the potential to be clinically useful in other populations.","Carlozzi, Noelle E; Boileau, Nicholas R; Roberts, Angela; Dayalu, Praveen; Hanifan, Dana L; Miner, Jennifer A; Claassen, Daniel; Provost, Emily Mower","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-020-02608-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839864/,434
84375,Let's get physical: A prospective pedometer study of doctors working in a South African emergency department.,2020-10-28,"Overdiagnosis is a harmful consequence of screening which is particularly challenging to estimate. An unbiased setting to measure overdiagnosis in breast cancer screening requires comparative data from a screened and an unscreened cohort for at least 30 years. Such randomized data will not become available, leaving us with observational data over shorter time periods and outcomes of modelling. This collaborative effort of the International Cancer Screening Network quantified the variation in estimated breast cancer overdiagnosis in organized programs with evaluation of both observed and simulated data, and presented examples of how modelling can provide additional insights. Reliable observational data, analysed with study design accounting for methodological pitfalls, and modelling studies with different approaches, indicate that overdiagnosis accounts for less than 10% of invasive breast cancer cases in a screening target population of women aged 50 to 69. Estimates above this level are likely to derive from inaccuracies in study design. The widely discrepant estimates of overdiagnosis reported from observational data could substantially be reduced by use of a cohort study design with at least 10 years of follow-up after screening stops. In contexts where concomitant opportunistic screening or gradual implementation of screening occurs, and data on valid comparison groups are not readily available, modelling of screening intervention becomes an advantageous option to obtain reliable estimates of breast cancer overdiagnosis.

This study demonstrated the putative inhibitory potential of curcumin, allicin, and gingerol towards cathepsin K, COVID-19 main protease, and SARS-CoV 3 C-like protease. The pharmacokinetic properties were predicted through the SwissADME server while the corresponding binding affinity of the selected phytocompounds towards the proteins was computed using PyRx-Python Prescription 0.8 and the binding free energy were computed based on conventional molecular dynamics using LARMD server. The ADMET properties revealed all the drugs possess drug-like properties. Curcumin has the highest binding affinities with all the selected proteases while allicin has the lowest binding affinities towards the proteases. Moreover, it was observed that curcumin exhibited the highest binding free energy of -17.90 ± 0.23, -18.21 ± 0.25, and -9.67 ± 0.08 kcal/mol for Cathepsin K, COVID-19 main protease, and SARS-CoV 3 C-like protease, respectively. Based on the activities of the phytocompounds against coronavirus target proteases involved in the viral entry as evident from the results, the study, therefore, suggests that these phytocompounds could be valuable for the development of drugs useful for the prevention of coronavirus entry and replication.

87124,Increased Intensity Of PCR Testing Reduced COVID-19 Transmission Within Countries During The First Pandemic Wave.,2020-12-02,"Many individuals prescribed osteoporosis pharmacotherapy either do not start or do not persist with treatment. In this study, women who attended a group medical visit at an osteoporosis center which involved fracture risk assessment and focused on autonomous decision-making made treatment decisions with high confidence. Those who started pharmacotherapy were highly persistent. PURPOSE Adherence and persistence with osteoporosis pharmacotherapy is low, possibly reflecting lack of confidence in physicians' treatment recommendations. We evaluated treatment decisions, decisional confidence, and 12-month treatment adherence among women who attended a group bone health consultation that fostered autonomous decision-making. METHODS We prospectively assessed postmenopausal women referred to an osteoporosis clinic who chose to attend a group medical visit in lieu of one-on-one consultation. The group visit was facilitated by a specialist physician and nurse, involving estimation of 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk (using FRAX®) and extensive education regarding fracture consequences and potential advantages and disadvantages of pharmacotherapy. No direct advice was given by the specialist. Post-consult, participants made an autonomous decision regarding treatment intent and followed up with their family physician to enact their chosen plan. Intentions to initiate pharmacotherapy were assessed immediately post-consult. Treatment status and decisional confidence were evaluated 3 and 12 months later. Three-month treatment status was considered to reflect final treatment decision. Persistence was defined as proportion of participants on treatment at 3 months who remained treated at 12 months. RESULTS One hundred one women (mean (SD) age, 62.7 years (5.8); median (IQR) FRAX®, 10.7% (8.3-17.6)) participated. Immediately post-consult, 27 (26.7%) intended to initiate treatment. At 3 months, 23 (22.8%) were treated, and at 12 months, 21 (91.3%) remained persistent. Of 89 questionnaire respondents at 12 months, 85 (95.5%) reported confidence in their treatment decision. CONCLUSION When postmenopausal women are provided with individualized fracture risk estimates and enabled to make autonomous decisions regarding pharmacotherapy, ultimate decisions to receive treatment are made with confidence and result in high persistence at 12 months.","Wilton-Clark, Madeline S; Feasel, A Lynn; Kline, Gregory A; Billington, Emma O",Archives of osteoporosis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11657-020-00809-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888079/,434

The study objective was to evaluate if and when patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation stop dabigatran treatment and to report outcomes following discontinuation. Patients prescribed dabigatran in diverse clinical practice settings were consecutively enrolled and followed for 2 years. Dabigatran persistence over time, reasons for discontinuation, and outcomes post discontinuation were assessed. Of 4,859 patients, aged 70.2 ± 10.4 years, 55.7% were male. Overall 2-year dabigatran persistence was 70.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 69.6 to 72.2). Persistence probability was lower in the first 6-month period (83.7% [82.7 to 84.8]) than in subsequent periods for patients on dabigatran at the start of each period (6 to 12 months, 92.5% [91.6 to 93.3]; 12 to 18 months, 95.1% [94.3 to 95.8]; 18 to 24 months, 96.3% [95.6 to 96.9]). Of 1,305 patients (26.9%) who discontinued dabigatran, adverse events were reported as the reason for discontinuation in 457 (35.0%).

The virus outbreak has been documented around the world. Updating data in different aspects of the virus could force us to revise our idea about the main questions concerning coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). AREAS COVERED Although our knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is largely based on the very limited data, the information is growing rapidly. The renewed answers to the specific research questions concerning updating data not only reveal gaps for future research but also re-categorized our information. Here, we attempt to briefly discuss ten important questions about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION Since our knowledge about different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be in its infancy and is rapidly changing, the provision of the right data is more difficult in this regard. However, we try to rely on results from more extensive research to answer the main questions about this new virus. Therefore, further studies, particularly in the context of the virus pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development, are warranted.","Teymoori-Rad, Majid; Samadizadeh, Saeed; Tabarraei, Alijan; Moradi, Abdolvahab; Shahbaz, Mahsa Bataghva; Tahamtan, Alireza",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1782197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32536226/,434
92495,FULMINANT LIVER FAILURE DUE TO HEPATITIS B REACTIVATION DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.,2021-04-13,"In this paper, I reviewed the emerging field of endoscopic surgery and present data supporting the contention that endoscopy can now be used to treat many foregut diseases that have been traditionally treated surgically. Within each topic, the content will progress as follows: ""lessons learned"", ""technical considerations"" and ""future opportunities"". Lessons learned will provide a brief background and update on the most current literature. Technical considerations will include my personal experience, including tips and tricks that I have learned over the years. Finally, future opportunities will address current unmet needs and potential new areas of development. The foregut is defined as ""the upper part of the embryonic alimentary canal from which the pharynx, esophagus, lung, stomach, liver, pancreas, and part of the duodenum develop"". Foregut surgery is well established in treating conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), achalasia, esophageal diverticula, Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, gastric-outlet obstruction, and obesity. Over the past decade, remarkable progress in interventional endoscopy has culminated in the conceptualization and practice of endoscopic foregut surgery for various clinical conditions summarized in this paper. Regarding GERD, there are now several technologies available to effectively treat it and potentially eliminate symptoms, and the need for long-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors. For the first time, fundoplication can be performed without the need for open or laparoscopic surgery. Long-term data going out 5-10 years are now emerging showing extended durability. In respect to achalasia, per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) which was developed in Japan, has become an alternative to the traditional Heller's myotomy. Recent meta-analysis show that POEM may have better results than Heller, but the issue of post-POEM GERD still needs to be addressed. There is now a resurgence of endoscopic treatment of Zenker's diverticula with improved technique (Z-POEM) and equipment; thus, patients are choosing flexible endoscopic treatment as opposed to open or rigid endoscopy options. In regard to BE, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) which is well established in Asia, is now becoming more mainstream in the West for the treatment of BE with high grade dysplasia, as well as early esophageal cancer. In combination with all the ablation technologies (radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, hybrid argon plasma coagulation), the entire spectrum of Barrett's and related dysplasia and early cancer can be managed predominantly by endoscopy. Importantly, in regard to early gastric cancer and submucosal tumors (SMTs) of the stomach, ESD and full thickness resection (FTR) can excise these lesions en-bloc and endoscopic suturing is now used to close large defects and perforations. For treatment of patients with malignant gastric outlet obstruction (GOO), endoscopic gastro-jejunostomy is now showing better results than enteral stenting. G-POEM is also emerging as a treatment option for patients with gastroparesis. Obesity has become an epidemic in many western countries and is becoming also prevalent in Asia. Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is now becoming an established treatment option, especially for obese patients with body mass index between 30 and 35. Data show an average weight loss of 16 kg after ESG with long-term data confirming sustainability. Finally, in respect to endo-hepatology, there are many new endoscopic interventions that have been developed for patients with liver disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided liver biopsy and EUS-guided portal pressure measurement are exciting new frontiers for the endo-hepatologists.","Chang, Kenneth J",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v25.i1.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30643356/,434

The role of a Pipeline Embolization Device (PED) in the treatment of this challenging aneurysm subtype remains undefined despite theoretical advantages. OBJECTIVE To present a series of 11 patients treated with a PED and to discuss the management and results of this novel application of flow diverters. METHODS Medical records of patients who presented with IC-RBA from May 2011 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed at 6 institutions in the United States. All relevant data were independently compiled. RESULTS A total of 12 IC-RBAs in 11 patients were treated during the study period. Nine (75%) were treated with a single PED; 1 was treated with 2 PEDs; 1 was treated with coils and 1 PED; and 1 was treated with coils and 2 PEDs. Three (27%) had major perioperative complications: middle cerebral artery territory infarction, vision loss, and death. Seven patients demonstrated complete obliteration of the aneurysm in postoperative imaging. Early clinical outcomes were favorable (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) in all 10 survivors. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of using the PED to treat IC-RBA with fair initial results. The proper introduction and management of antiplatelet regimen are key for successful results. Bleeding complications related to dual antiplatelet therapy were similar to those in previous studies of stent-assisted coiling for the same population. Larger cohort analysis is needed to define the precise role of flow diverters in the treatment of IC-RBA.","Yoon, Jang W; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Dumont, Travis M; Levy, Elad I; Hopkins, L Nelson; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Lopes, Demetrius K; Moftakhar, Roham; Billingsley, Joshua T; Welch, Babu G; Boulos, Alan S; Yamamoto, Junichi; Tawk, Rabih G; Ringer, Andrew J; Hanel, Ricardo A",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991709/,434

However, excessive citrate load and coagulation disturbances after TPE have been poorly studied, in particular in cirrhotic patients with hypocapnic alkalosis, metabolic compensation and electrolyte imbalances. We retrospectively evaluated 1123 consecutive LT recipients (923 ABO-compatible [ABO-C], 200 ABO-I) from November 2008 to May 2015. TPE was generally performed a day before LT and blood sampling was performed before anaesthesia induction. We performed propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) analyses. In 199 PSM pairs, metabolic alkalosis was prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients (expectedly due to citrate conversion) with higher pH ≥ 7.50 (IPTW-adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.23) than in ABO-C LT recipients. With increasing cirrhosis severity, the arterial pH and bicarbonate levels showed dose-dependent relationships, whereas mild hypoxaemia was more prevalent in ABO-I LT recipients. ABO-I LT recipients exhibited worsened hypokalaemia ≤3.0 mmol/l (17.6%, aOR = 1.44), hypomagnesaemia ≤1.7 mg/dl (27.6%, aOR = 3.43) and thrombocytopenia <30,000/µl (19.1%, aOR = 2.26) confirmed by lower maximal clot firmness (P = 0.001) in rotational thromboelastometry (EXTEM), which necessitated platelet transfusions.

A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients undergoing RALH (n = 268), TLH (n = 463), and/or repair of vaginal cuff dehiscence at our clinic from July 2006 to January 2010. The cumulative incidence was calculated only for dehiscence that occurred after hysterectomies without evidence of malignancy. The incidence of cuff dehiscence in RALH (2.61%) versus TLH (1.94%) was not statistically significant (P = 0.60). However, among RALH patients, the overall incidence of cuff dehiscence after each surgeon's first 25 cases was low at 0.85%. Mean time to presentation was similar in both groups, 8.2 weeks in RALH and 8.7 weeks in TLH, with sexual intercourse the most common inciting event. Where documented, records of dehisced patients showed that all colpotomy incisions were created using monopolar cautery and closed using 0 Vicryl sutures. In TLH, 87.5% of the colpotomy incisions were closed using the Endo Stitch device in a variety of fashions. While our findings show that the overall incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence in RALH and TLH is comparable, the data also suggest that increased experience with robotic-assisted surgery may decrease dehiscence rates over time. Randomized controlled trials comparing different methods of colpotomy creation, particularly electrocautery, and cuff closure are needed to help guide us in the best surgical practices to reduce vaginal cuff dehiscence and related complications.","Dauterive, Erin; Morris, George",Journal of robotic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11701-011-0285-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27628278/,434

This study aimed to analyze the epidemiological profile and factors associated with SARI-related hospitalization and deaths reported in Goiás. Retrospective cohort study, with data from the investigation files of the Notifiable Diseases Information System's Influenza Web. Multivariate analysis methods were employed to verify the association between exposure variables with the outcomes of ICU admission and death. A total of 4,832 SARI cases were reported in Goiás from 2013 to 2018. The primary etiological diagnosis was Influenza A (22.3%) with the predominant subtype A (H1N1pdm09), followed by the Respiratory Syncytial Virus. A total of 34.6% of the patients required ICU admission, and 19% died. A longer time to start treatment with antivirals was associated with a higher likelihood to have an ICU admission, while a previous non-vaccination against Influenza, longer time to start treatment, and older age were associated with a higher likelihood to suffer death. The study showed a high frequency of respiratory diseases caused by the Influenza virus in Goiás and that the severity of the syndrome, characterized by ICU admission and deaths, is associated with the start of antiviral treatment vaccine status, and patient's age.","Araujo, Kamilla Lelis Rodrigues de; Aquino, Érika Carvalho de; Silva, Lara Lívia Santos da; Ternes, Yves Mauro Fernandes",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-812320202510.2.26802020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33027348/,434

In the last 2 decades a decreasing trend of budesonide allergy was observed. OBJECTIVES To estimate the prevalence of positive patch test reactions to budesonide in an Italian large patch test population characterizing patients according to MOAHLFA index and evaluating the benefit with extended readings of budesonide patch test. METHODS/PATIENTS Retrospective analysis of patient demographics and patch test results over a 2-year period (2018-2019) was performed at 14 patch test Clinics in Italy. RESULTS Ninety patients among 14544 (0.6%) reacted to budesonide 0.01%. Positive reactions were mild in 54.4% and late readings at D7 showed new positive reactions in 37.8% of patients. MOAHLFA index showed a significant positive association with male gender, atopic dermatitis, and age > 40 years and a significant negative association with hand and face dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS We documented a low prevalence of budesonide allergy in Italy, confirming its decreasing trend recently reported in literature.

In other regions where tumor incidence is relatively low and patient characteristics are different, developments in this issue have been limited. In this study, we aimed to compare the early results for patients who underwent open or laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer in a low volume center. Material and Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who underwent curative gastric resection (open gastrectomy n: 30; laparoscopic gastrectomy n: 30) by the same surgical team between 2014 and 2019. Results The tumor was localized in 60% (36/60) of the patients in the proximal and middle 1/3 stomach. In laparoscopic gastrectomy group, the operation time was significantly longer (median, 297.5 vs 180 minutes; p <0.05). In open gastrectomy group, intraoperative blood loss (median 50 vs 150 ml; p <0.05) was significantly higher. Tumor negative surgical margin was achieved in all cases. Although the mean number of lymph nodes harvested in laparoscopic gastrectomy group was higher than the open surgery group, the difference was not statistically significant (28.2 ± 11.48 vs 25.8 ± 9.78, respectively; p= 0.394). The rate of major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ grade 3) was less common in the laparoscopic group (6.7% vs 16.7%; p= 0.642). Mortality was observed in four patients (2 patients open, 2 patients laparoscopic). Conclusion In low-volume centers with advanced laparoscopic surgery experience, laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be performed with the risk of morbidity-mortality similar to open gastrectomy.","Yüksel, Adem; Coşkun, Murat; Turgut, Hamdi Taner; Sümer, Fatih",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.47717/turkjsurg.2021.5048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34585092/,434

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is definitely one of the main clinically relevant consequences in patients with COVID-19. Starting from the earliest reports of the COVID-19 pandemic, two peculiar neurological manifestations (namely, hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia) were reported in a relevant proportion of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, the physiopathologic mechanisms accounting for the onset of these symptoms are not yet clarified. CXCL10 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine with a well-established role in the COVID-19-related cytokine storm and in subsequent development of ARDS. CXCL10 is also known to be involved in coronavirus-induced demyelination. On these bases, a role for CXCL10 as the common denominator between pulmonary and olfactory dysfunctions could be envisaged. The aim of the present report will be to hypothesize a role for CXCL10 in COVID-19 olfactory dysfunctions. Previous evidences supporting our hypothesis, with special emphasis to the role of CXCL10 in coronavirus-induced demyelination, the anatomical and physiological peculiarity of the olfactory system, and the available data supporting their link during COVID-19 infections, will be overviewed.","Oliviero, Antonio; de Castro, Fernando; Coperchini, Francesca; Chiovato, Luca; Rotondi, Mario","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858420939033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32659199/,434

Complication rates, operative closure time, length of hospitalisation and costs were evaluated. The study cohort (group A) of 20 consecutive patients reconstructed using barbed stitches for suturing was prospectively compared to a control cohort (group B) of 20 consecutive patients reconstructed using conventional vicryl stitches. All patients were affected by squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and underwent different types of glossectomy and reconstruction with free flaps. This analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the barbed suture compared with a standard monofilament stitch in terms of lower complication rate (15% group A, 30% group B), intra-operative closure times (486 minutes group A, 517 minutes group B), and length of hospitalisation (average length of hospitalisation 14.60 days group A, 16.85 days group B). These factors coupled with the use of a lower number of stitches compared with the standard stitches may compensate the increased cost of the barbed suture. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the use of unidirectional barbed stitches for suturing of a free flap to the recipient site reduces the complication rate, principally in terms of dehiscence and fistula incidence, and reduces intra-operative time and length of hospitalisation. Based on these results and on the literature, the use of unidirectional barbed stitches can be considered as a safe and efficient alternative to conventional stitches for suturing of free flaps to local tissue.","Crosetti, E; Caracciolo, A; Arrigoni, G; Delmastro, E; Succo, G",Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,https://doi.org/10.14639/0392-100x-2130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30745594/,434

Furthermore, the 3D printed electrodes conveniently accommodate other active layers for diverse applications such as energy storage, catalysis, and sensors. Nevertheless, to enhance a complex 3D structure while preserving the fine morphology, conformal deposition by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique is a powerful solution. Herein, we present the concept of coating Al2O3 by ALD with different thicknesses from 20 to 120 cycles on the 3D printed nanocarbon/PLA electrodes for the electrocatalytic oxidation of catechol as an important biomarker. Overall, 80 ALD cycle Al2O3 achieved an optimum thickness for catechol electrocatalysis. This is resonated with the enhanced adsorption of catechol at the electrode surface and efficient electron transfer, according to the two-proton, two-electron-transfer mechanism, as well as for the passivation of surface defects of the nanocarbon electrode. This work compellingly demonstrates the prospect of 3D printed electrodes modified by a functional layer utilizing a low-temperature ALD process that can be extended to other arbitrary surfaces.","Ng, Siowwoon; Iffelsberger, Christian; Michalička, Jan; Pumera, Martin",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c06961; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411515/,434

Even though submuscular IBR continues to be the most commonly used technique, mastectomy technique optimization, the possibility to check skin viability with indocyanine green angiography, the enhanced propensity of patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomies, and the introduction of acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) have paved the way to the rediscovery of the subcutaneous reconstruction technique. The aim of this article is to update the complication rate of immediate and delayed prepectoral IBR using human ADMs (hADMs). Methods A literature search, using PubMed, Medline, Cochrane, and Google Scholar database according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, was conducted to evaluate complication rates of prepectoral implant-based reconstructions using hADMs. The following MeSH terms were used: ""prepectoral breast reconstruction acellular dermal matrix,"" ""prepectoral breast reconstruction ADM,"" ""human ADM breast reconstruction,"" and ""human acellular dermal matrix breast reconstruction"" (period: 2005-2020; the last search took place on April 2, 2020).

Observations From the search, 22 publications on tracheostomy and 3 referring to laryngectomy were identified. After analysis of titles and abstracts followed by full-text review, 4 publications were identified as presenting guidelines for specific approaches to tracheostomy and were selected; all 3 publications on laryngectomy were selected. The main guidelines on tracheostomy described considerations during management (eg, cuff manipulation, suctioning, valve placement) owing to the increased risk of aerosol generation and transmission during swallowing and communication interventions in this population. Regarding laryngectomy, the guidelines focused on the care and protection of both the professional and the patient, offering recommendations on the management of adverse events and leakage of the tracheoesophageal prosthesis. Conclusions and Relevance Frequent guideline updates for SLPs are necessary to inform best practice and ensure patient and health care worker protection and safety while providing high-quality care and rehabilitation.","Vergara, José; Starmer, Heather M; Wallace, Sarah; Bolton, Lee; Seedat, Jaishika; de Souza, Cinthia Madeira; Freitas, Susana Vaz; Skoretz, Stacey A",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2020.3720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33057590/,434

In the current study, we examine a large multisurgeon population of patients undergoing RARP to assess for predictors of this outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS Between January 2008 and December 2010, 1270 patients who underwent RARP at our institution, with complete preoperative and follow-up data, were assessed for urinary function prospectively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess for predictors of zero pad usage after RARP. Patient and operative characteristics examined include age, body-mass index, prostate-specific antigen, adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), Gleason sum, international prostate symptom score, clinical stage, nerve sparing, bladder neck reconstruction, posterior anastomotic reconstruction, surgeon volume, and percutaneous suprapubic tube (PST) bladder drainage. RESULTS Overall, 17.3% of patients (n=219) never required a pad after catheter removal. Characteristics associated with never requiring a pad are age, preoperative Gleason sum, CCI, nerve sparing, prostate weight, surgeon volume, and PST bladder drainage. Independent predictors of never requiring a pad after catheter removal included nerve-sparing (B/L standard as referent) wide dissection [OR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.49, 1.88)], unilateral inter-/intrafascial [OR: 1.20 (0.70, 2.06)], bilateral inter-/intrafascial [OR: 1.97 (1.36, 2.86)], and PST drainage [OR: 2.53 (1.56, 4.11)]. CONCLUSION In a study reflective of broad RARP practice at our institution, 17.3% of patients were entirely pad free after RARP. The type of nerve sparing performed and placement of a PST for bladder drainage postoperatively were found to be independently predictive of never requiring a pad after RARP.","Sammon, Jesse D; Sharma, Pranav; Trinh, Quoc-Dien; Ghani, Khurshid R; Sukumar, Shyam; Menon, Mani",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2012.0312; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23030798/,434

OBJECTIVE The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of Sal-B and ZDDY was assessed using the authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection assay. The antiviral targets of Sal-B were identified by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to examine the structural characteristics of HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion assay was used to evaluate the effect of Sal-B on virus-cell membrane fusion. Flow cytometry was carried out to analyze the effect of Sal-B on the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to hACE2 receptor. OBJECTIVE The median effective concentrations (EC50) of Sal-B and ZDDY against SARSCoV-2 infection in Vero-E6 cells were 55.47 μmol/L and 36.07 μg/mL, respectively. Both Sal-B and ZDDY successfully inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into the cells that stably expressed human ACE2 (ACE2/293T), with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 1.69 μmol/L and 24.81 μg/mL, respectively. Sal-B showed a binding affinity of -8.2 kcal/mol to the 6-helix bundle (6-HB) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Molecular dynamics simulation showed stable binding between Sal-B and the 6-HB of SARS-CoV-2 S protein at the predicted binding site. Sal-B disturbed the formation of the secondary structure of 6-HB in HR1P/HR2P mixture, resulting in a significantly lowered α-helicity (P < 0.05). Sal-B dose-dependently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, with an IC50 of 3.33 μmol/L. Sal-B showed no effect on RBD-Fc protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. OBJECTIVE Sal-B and its magnesium salt ZDDY can inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells in vitro by blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion.","Yang, C; Cheng, C; Wang, J; Chen, K; Zhan, J; Pan, X; Xu, X; Xu, W; Liu, S",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2021.04.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963705/,434

The analysis exploits a natural experiment to disentangle the effects of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate spending dropped by around 25% (95% CI: 24 to 26%) in Sweden and, as a result of the shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points (95% CI: 3 to 5 percentage points [p.p.]) in Denmark. This suggests that most of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggests that social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low-health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.","Sheridan, Adam; Andersen, Asger Lau; Hansen, Emil Toft; Johannesen, Niels",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2010068117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747573/,434
102635,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Natural Experiment.,2020-04-23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Computational fluid dynamics modeling is useful in the study of the hemodynamic environment of cerebral aneurysms, but patient-specific measurements of boundary conditions, such as blood flow velocity and pressure, have not been previously applied to the study of flow-diverting stents. We integrated patient-specific intravascular blood flow velocity and pressure measurements into computational models of aneurysms before and after treatment with flow-diverting stents to determine stent effects on aneurysm hemodynamics. MATERIALS AND METHODS Blood flow velocity and pressure were measured in peri-aneurysmal locations by use of an intravascular dual-sensor pressure and Doppler velocity guidewire before and after flow-diverting stent treatment of 4 unruptured cerebral aneurysms. These measurements defined inflow and outflow boundary conditions for computational models. Intra-aneurysmal flow rates, wall shear stress, and wall shear stress gradient were calculated. RESULTS Measurements of inflow velocity and outflow pressure were successful in all 4 patients. Computational models incorporating these measurements demonstrated significant reductions in intra-aneurysmal wall shear stress and wall shear stress gradient and a trend in reduced intra-aneurysmal blood flow. CONCLUSIONS Integration of intravascular dual-sensor guidewire measurements of blood flow velocity and blood pressure provided patient-specific computational models of cerebral aneurysms. Aneurysm treatment with flow-diverting stents reduces blood flow and hemodynamic shear stress in the aneurysm dome.","Levitt, M R; McGah, P M; Aliseda, A; Mourad, P D; Nerva, J D; Vaidya, S S; Morton, R P; Ghodke, B V; Kim, L J",AJNR.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions among messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in CRC to reveal the mechanisms of CRC. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from public gene expression data sets. One thousand eighty-one common dysregulated mRNAs in two data sets were identified. Gene function analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated that these DEGs might play important roles in CRC. LINC00365 was selected through coding- noncoding network analysis and its expression was validated upregulated in 22 paired clinical samples and four CRC cell lines. A competing endogenous RNA network composed of 70 miRNAs, nine mRNAs, and LINC00365 was constructed. Eight of nine mRNAs were validated upregulated in The Cancer Genome Atlas data set. Our results suggested that LINC00365 was an oncogene in CRC and it could regulate the expression of several mRNAs through sponging miRNAs.","Zhu, Yiping; Bian, Yinzhu; Zhang, Qun; Hu, Jing; Li, Li; Yang, Mi; Qian, Hanqing; Yu, Lixia; Liu, Baorui; Qian, Xiaoping",Journal of cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.28201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525245/,434

Lectures, clinical clerkships, and testing have all been impacted significantly because of patient care needs and concern for the health and safety of trainees. While traditional teaching strategies have been upended, the challenges posed by the pandemic have also created unique opportunities for trainees. In this article, the authors summarize lessons trainees can learn from the ongoing pandemic in the following areas: public health, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation; reinventing professional and personal roles to meet the needs of the health care system; flexibility in navigating testing, licensure, and certification; appraising scientific evidence quickly and accurately; balancing a physician's call to duty with fear for personal safety; combating moral injury; interprofessional collaboration; and advocating for oneself and colleagues. Focusing on these lessons can help educators steer their efforts to better prepare future physicians for unforeseen challenges that may come up in their personal and professional lives as well as in society as a whole.","Jain, Snigdha; Carlos, W Graham",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394667/,434

METHOD Between 2004 and 2013, a prospectively maintained database was reviewed. LLLS were compared with age- and sex-matched OLLS. In addition, the outcomes of LLLS with a consultant as the primary surgeon were compared with those performed by trainees. RESULTS Forty-three LLLS were performed during the study period. LLLS was a significantly cheaper operation compared with OLLS (P = 0.001, £3594.14 versus £5593.41). The median hospital stay was shorter in the laparoscopic group (P = 0.002, 3 versus 7 days). No difference was found in outcomes between a LLLS performed by a trainee or consultant (operating time, morbidity or R1 resection rate). The procedure length was significantly shorter during the later half of the study period [120 versus 129 min (P = 0.045)]. CONCLUSION LLLS is a significantly cost effective operation compared with an open approach with a reduction in hospital stay. In addition, it is suitable to use as a training operation.","Bell, Richard; Pandanaboyana, Sanjay; Hanif, Faisal; Shah, Nehal; Hidalgo, Ernest; Lodge, J Peter A; Toogood, Giles; Prasad, K Raj",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/hpb.12354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25403492/,434

Despite its benefits on survival and quality of life, it is associated with a considerable financial burden on society including sick leave. Our study aimed to explore the barriers that obstruct return to work after coronary artery bypass grafting. Methods We performed a qualitative study with in-depth interviewing of patients 6 months after their surgery. We included ten working patients and interviewed them and their spouses at home. The interviews were transcribed and two investigators independently searched the transcriptions for barriers that had obstructed return to work. Results Based on the interviews we were able to distinguish four main groups of barriers: 'personal', 'healthcare', 'work' and 'law & regulation.' The personal barriers were subgrouped in affective, physical, cognitive, social and individually determined factors. Conclusion In a qualitative study we showed that personal barriers as well as barriers regarding healthcare, work and law & regulation, were perceived by patients as important factors obstructing return to work after coronary artery bypass grafting. To overcome the identified barriers, the process of return to work could preferably be initiated during the hospital phase, started during cardiac rehabilitation, and coordinated by a case-managing professional.","Blokzijl, Fredrike; Onrust, Marisa; Dieperink, Willem; Keus, Frederik; van der Horst, Iwan C C; Paans, Wolter; Mariani, Massimo A; Reneman, Michiel F",Journal of occupational rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10926-020-09919-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803466/,434

In the Adjuvant ChemoTherapy with S-1 after curative treatment in patients with Head and Neck Cancer (ACTS-HNC) phase III study, OS of curative locoregional treatments improved more with adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 (tegafur gimeracil oteracil potassium) than with tegafur/uracil (UFT). ACTS HNC study showed the significant efficacy of S-1 after curative radiotherapy in sub-analysis. We explored the efficacy of S-1 after curative CRT in a subset of patients from the ACTS-HNC study. METHODS Patients with stage III, IVA, or IVB LAHNSCC were enrolled in this study to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 compared with UFT as adjuvant chemotherapy after curative CRT in the ACTS-HNC study. Patients received S-1 at 80-120 mg/day in two divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by a 1-week rest, or UFT 300 or 400 mg/day in two or three divided doses daily, for 1 year. The endpoints were OS, disease-free survival, locoregional relapse-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and post-locoregional relapse survival. RESULTS One hundred eighty patients (S-1, n = 87; UFT, n = 93) were included in this study. Clinical characteristics of the S-1 and UFT arms were similar. S-1 after CRT significantly improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.93) and DMFS (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.97) compared with UFT. CONCLUSION As adjuvant chemotherapy, S-1 demonstrated better efficacy for OS and DMFS than UFT in patients with LAHNSCC after curative CRT and may be considered a treatment option following curative CRT.

Complications arising from CVC placement are mostly due to a pneumothorax or malposition. Correct position is currently confirmed by chest x-ray, while ultrasonography might be a more suitable option. We performed a meta-analysis of the available studies with the primary aim of synthesizing information regarding detection of CVC-related complications and misplacement using ultrasound (US). METHODS This is a systematic review and meta-analysis registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016050698). PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Articles which reported the diagnostic accuracy of US in detecting the position of CVCs and the mechanical complications associated with insertion were included. Primary outcomes were specificity and sensitivity of US. Secondary outcomes included prevalence of malposition and pneumothorax, feasibility of US examination, and time to perform and interpret both US and chest x-ray. A qualitative assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool. RESULTS We included 25 studies with a total of 2548 patients and 2602 CVC placements. Analysis yielded a pooled specificity of 98.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 97.8-99.5) and sensitivity of 68.2 (95% CI: 54.4-79.4). US examination was feasible in 96.8% of the cases. The prevalence of CVC malposition and pneumothorax was 6.8% and 1.1%, respectively. The mean time for US performance was 2.83 min (95% CI: 2.77-2.89 min) min, while chest x-ray performance took 34.7 min (95% CI: 32.6-36.7 min). US was feasible in 97%. Further analyses were performed by defining subgroups based on the different utilized US protocols and on intra-atrial and extra-atrial misplacement. Vascular US combined with transthoracic echocardiography was most accurate. CONCLUSIONS US is an accurate and feasible diagnostic modality to detect CVC malposition and iatrogenic pneumothorax. Advantages of US over chest x-ray are that it can be performed faster and does not subject patients to radiation. Vascular US combined with transthoracic echocardiography is advised. However, the results need to be interpreted with caution since included studies were often underpowered and had methodological limitations. A large multicenter study investigating optimal US protocol, among other things, is needed.","Smit, Jasper M; Raadsen, Reinder; Blans, Michiel J; Petjak, Manfred; Van de Ven, Peter M; Tuinman, Pieter R",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-018-1989-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29534732/,434
110712,Establishing a COVID-19 pandemic severity assessment surveillance system in Ireland.,2021-10-05,"BACKGROUND Nondepolarising muscle relaxants (NDMRs) provide optimal conditions for tracheal intubation and improve surgical conditions. Several clinical conditions, diseases and pharmacological interactions have been suggested to cause resistance towards NDMRs that may translate into difficult intubation or inadequate operating conditions during surgery. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the current evidence of patient groups with resistance towards NDMRs. A prolonged onset time was defined as a difference that exceeded 25% compared with controls. DESIGN A systematic review of randomised controlled trials and cohort studies. DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search was performed in 2016 in PubMed and EMBASE. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Patients with conditions or diseases, or patients taking medication, which lead to resistance towards current NDMRs (rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, atracurium, mivacurium and pancuronium). Included outcomes were onset time defined as the time between administration of NDMR to maximal (90, 95 or 100%) depression of baseline twitch height of the first twitch in a train-of-four. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were included. Strong evidence supports a prolonged onset time of rocuronium in patients with thermal injury and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Moderate evidence supports a prolonged onset time of NDMRs during hypothermia and in patients with infection, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, liver cirrhosis treated with ulinastatin, when remifentanil is administered prior to administration of an NDMR, in fasting patients being rehydrated intravenously prior to administration of NDMR, in children with end-stage renal failure and in patients with atrial or ventricular septal defects. CONCLUSION A prolonged onset time should be suspected in patients with thermal injury and Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. Further, evidence supports a prolonged onset time in patients with infection, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, congenital heart defects, kidney failure, liver cirrhosis treated with ulinastatin along with remifentanil or intravenous fluids administered prior to NDMR.","Mørk, Emilie L; Kristensen, Mette L; Stokholm, Janne B; Söderström, Carl M; Madsen, Matias V; Gätke, Mona R",European journal of anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/eja.0000000000000991; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30950905/,434

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the selective α 2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine on the pulmonary function of patients who underwent mitral valve surgery using the totally thoracoscopic technique. Methods Fifty-seven patients who underwent thoracoscopic mitral valve surgery between July 2019 and December 2019 were selected. The patients were randomly divided into the control (Con) group (n = 28) and the dexmedetomidine (DEX) group (n = 29) using the random number table method. Arterial blood gas analyses were performed, and the oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2) and respiratory indexes (P(A-a)O/PaO2) were calculated 5 min after tracheal intubation (T1), 2 h after operation (T2), 6 h after operation (T3), and 24 h after operation (T4). Moreover, the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent method at all time points. Chest radiography was performed 24 h after surgery. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and after the operation for a complete hemogram. Additionally, the procalcitonin concentration was measured and recorded when the patients were transported to the intensive care unit (ICU). The postoperative extubation time, length of ICU stay, and pulmonary infection rate were also recorded. Results Inflammatory reaction after surgery was evident. However, the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, and ICAM-1 in the DEX group were lower than those in the Con group after surgery (T2 to T4; P < 0.05). Neutrophil counts and procalcitonin concentration were higher in the Con group than in the DEX group (P < 0.05). In addition, in the DEX group, pulmonary exudation on chest radiography was lower, and pulmonary function, as shown by an increase in oxidation index and decrease in the respiratory index, improved after surgery (P < 0.05). Moreover, the duration of mechanical ventilation in the Con group was 3.4 h longer than that in the DEX group. Conclusion Dexmedetomidine has a protective effect on pulmonary function in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery using a totally video-assisted thoracoscopic technique, which may be related to a reduction in the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in the early perioperative period.","Cui, Junji; Gao, Mintai; Huang, Hongqian; Huang, Xiaoyan; Zeng, Qingshi",Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8638301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32963704/,434

Yet, there are no studies that simultaneously characterize human host and influenza A virus (IAV) genomes. We infected human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with two seasonal IAV/H3N2 strains, Brisbane/10/07 and Perth/16/09 (reference strains for past vaccine seasons) and the well-characterized laboratory strain Udorn/307/72. Strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the infected BEAS-2B cells allowed for simultaneous analysis of host and viral transcriptomes, in addition to pathogen genomes, to reveal changes in mRNA expression and alternative splicing (AS). In general, patterns of global and immune gene expression induced by the three IAVs were mostly shared. However, AS of host transcripts and small nuclear RNAs differed between the seasonal and laboratory strains. Analysis of viral transcriptomes showed deletions of the polymerase components (defective interfering-like RNAs) within the genome. Surprisingly, we found that the neuraminidase gene undergoes AS and that the splicing event differs between seasonal and laboratory strains. Our findings reveal novel elements of the host-virus interaction and highlight the importance of RNA-seq in identifying molecular changes at the genome level that may contribute to shaping RNA-based innate immunity.IMPORTANCE The use of massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has revealed insights into human and pathogen genomes and their evolution. Dual RNA-seq allows simultaneous dissection of host and pathogen genomes and strand-specific RNA-seq provides information about the polarity of the RNA. This is important in the case of negative-strand RNA viruses like influenza virus, which generate positive (complementary and mRNA) and negative-strand RNAs (genome) that differ in their potential to trigger innate immunity. Here, we characterize interactions between human bronchial epithelial cells and three influenza A/H3N2 strains using strand-specific dual RNA-seq. We focused on this subtype because of its epidemiological importance in causing significant morbidity and mortality during influenza epidemics. We report novel elements that differ between seasonal and laboratory strains highlighting the complexity of the host-virus interplay at the RNA level.","Fabozzi, Giulia; Oler, Andrew J; Liu, Poching; Chen, Yong; Mindaye, Samuel; Dolan, Michael A; Kenney, Heather; Gucek, Marjan; Zhu, Jun; Rabin, Ronald L; Subbarao, Kanta",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00518-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29976658/,434
113380,Health systems resilience in managing the COVID-19 pandemic: lessons from 28 countries.,2021-05-17,"BACKGROUND & AIMS Malnutrition is associated with poor prognosis of different diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association of malnutrition with long-term mortality of older adults with ischemic stroke in China. METHODS We selected patients aged ≥65 years with first-ever ischemic stroke from the Nanjing Stroke Registry Program. Malnutrition was defined according to the controlling nutritional status score (CONUT), the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and the prognostic nutritional index score (PNI), respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions and competing risk regressions were performed to explore the relationship between malnutrition and the risk of mortality in older adults with ischemic stroke. RESULTS Among 1065 enrolled patients, 60.5%, 46.7%, and 30.6% of patients were malnourished according to CONUT, GNRI, and PNI score. During a median follow-up of 4.74 (3.73-5.82) years, 205 (19.2%) patients died. In multivariate analysis, malnutrition (severe risk versus normal nutrition) was associated with significantly increased risk for mortality by the CONUT (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 4.615, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.373-15.514, P = 0.013), GNRI (adjusted HR 3.641, 95% CI 1.924-6.891, P < 0.001), and PNI score (adjusted HR 1.587, 95% CI, 1.096-2.297, P = 0.014). Furthermore, adding the malnutrition indexes to models modestly improved the predictive ability of mortality. CONCLUSIONS Our study indicated that malnutrition was highly prevalent in older Chinese adults with ischemic stroke and associated with increased mortality. Further research is required to evaluate the efficacy of nutritional management in these patients.","Yuan, Kang; Zhu, Shuanggen; Wang, Huaiming; Chen, Jingjing; Zhang, Xiaohao; Xu, Pengfei; Xie, Yi; Zhu, Xinyi; Zhu, Wusheng; Sun, Wen; Xu, Gelin; Liu, Xinfeng",Clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.04.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932800/,434

RESULTS Of 247 medical student respondents, 70% had heard of OEM, 60% through one lecture. Of the 160 OEM physicians, 17% first became aware of OEM as medical students, and most would have chosen a different path had they heard sooner. Most TIP program trainees reported that they would not have undertaken specialty training without a TIP program (89%).

115315,COVID-19 as a global challenge: towards an inclusive and sustainable future.,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) includes multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) testing as a colorectal cancer (CRC) screening option in average-risk individuals, but data on colonoscopy outcomes after positive mt-sDNA tests in community settings are needed. AIM The aim of this study was to investigate colonoscopy outcomes and quality following positive mt-sDNA in the population-based New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry. METHODS We compared colonoscopy outcomes and quality between age-matched, sex-matched, and risk-matched patients from 30 endoscopy practices with and without a preceding positive mt-sDNA test. Main outcomes were colonoscopy findings of CRC, advanced noncancerous neoplasia, nonadvanced neoplasia, or normal examination. Quality measures included withdrawal time, bowel preparation quality, examination completion, and percentage of average-risk individuals with normal colonoscopies receiving a USPSTF-recommended 10 year rescreening interval. RESULTS Individuals with positive mt-sDNA tests (N=306, average age 67.0 y; 61.8% female) were significantly more likely than colonoscopy-only patients (N=918, 66.2 y; 61.8% female) to have CRC (1.3% vs. 0.4%) or advanced noncancerous neoplasia (27.1% vs. 8.2%) (P<0.0001). Neoplasia was found in 68.0% of patients having colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test, (positive predictive value, was 68.0%), versus 42.3% of patients with colonoscopy only (P<0.0001). No significant differences in colonoscopy quality measures were observed between cohorts. CONCLUSIONS Colonoscopy after a positive mt-sDNA test was more frequently associated with CRC and colorectal neoplasia than colonoscopy alone. Positive mt-sDNA tests can enrich the proportion of colonoscopies with clinically relevant findings. Follow-up recommendations suggest that endoscopists do not inappropriately shorten rescreening intervals in mt-sDNA-positive patients with normal colonoscopy. These findings support the clinical utility of mt-sDNA for CRC screening in community practice.","Anderson, Joseph C; Robinson, Christina M; Hisey, William M; Edwards, David K; Kneedler, Bonny L; Berger, Barry M; Butterly, Lynn F",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001554; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973962/,434

DESIGN Observational study. SETTING Population-based study of 114 countries. PARTICIPANTS General population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES For each country, we extracted: (1) the maximum rate of COVID-19 incidence increase per 100,000 population over any 5-day moving average period since the first 100 confirmed cases; (2) the maximum 14-day cumulative incidence rate since the first case; (3) the incidence and mortality within 30 days since the first case and first COVID-19-related death, respectively. We retrieved the 13 country-specific International Health Regulations capacities and constructed linear regression models to examine whether these capacities were associated with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, controlling for the Human Development Index, Gross Domestic Product, the population density, the Global Health Security index, prior exposure to SARS/MERS and Stringency Index. RESULTS Countries with higher International Health Regulations score were significantly more likely to have lower incidence (β coefficient -24, 95% CI -35 to -13) and mortality (β coefficient -1.7, 95% CI -2.5 to -1.0) per 100,000 population within 30 days since the first COVID-19 diagnosis. A similar association was found for the other incidence outcomes. Analysis using different regression models controlling for various confounders showed a similarly significant association. CONCLUSIONS The International Health Regulations score was significantly associated with reduction in rate of incidence and mortality of COVID-19. These findings inform design of pandemic control strategies, and validated the International Health Regulations capacities as important metrics for countries that warrant evaluation and improvement of their health security capabilities.","Wong, Martin Cs; Huang, Junjie; Wong, Sunny H; Yuen-Chun Teoh, Jeremy",Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0141076821992453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33557662/,434

METHODS In our previous work, we reported changes to intra-operative blood flow during hip resurfacing arthroplasty comparing two surgical approaches. In this study, we report the vascularity and the metabolic bone function in the proximal femur in these same patients at one year after the surgery. Vascularity and bone function was assessed using scintigraphic techniques. Of the 13 patients who agreed to take part, eight had their arthroplasty through a posterior approach and five through a trochanteric-flip approach. RESULTS One year after surgery, we found no difference in the vascularity (vascular phase) and metabolic bone function (delayed phase) at the junction of the femoral head/neck between the two groups of patients. Higher radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the region of the greater trochanter in the trochanteric-flip group, related to the healing osteotomy. CONCLUSIONS Our findings using scintigraphic techniques suggest that the greater intra-operative reduction in blood flow to the junction of the femoral head/neck, which is seen with the posterior approach compared with trochanteric flip, does not result in any difference in vascularity or metabolic bone function one year after surgery.","Amarasekera, H W; Roberts, P; Costa, M L; Parsons, N; Achten, J; Griffin, D R; Williams, N R",Bone & joint research,https://doi.org/10.1302/2046-3758.15.2000046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23610676/,434

117593,Nasal Brushing Sampling and Processing using Digital High Speed Ciliary Videomicroscopy - Adaptation for the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-11-07,"OBJECTIVE The novel coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, created a pandemic that has the potential to change the paradigm of health care delivery. Of interest to the dental community is the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of the affected patients that can potentially cause transmission of COVID-19 via droplets. The highly infectious nature of the pathogen has created a sense of urgency and a need for extra caution to prevent the spread of the disease and the potential infection of patients and the entire dental team. Spatter consists of droplets up to 50 µm in size that are effectively stopped by barriers such as gloves, masks, and gowns. Aerosols are defined as droplet particles smaller than 5 µm that can remain airborne for extended periods and that have been reported to be significant in viral respiratory infections. In this study, aerosol represented by particulate matter with a size of 2.5 µm (PM2.5) was measured. METHOD AND MATERIALS Eight dry-field isolation methods were tested in a setup that included a realistic dental manikin and a high-speed handpiece that generated air-water spray. Environmental noise generated by the suction devices, suction flow rate of each setup, and the amount of environmental spatter and aerosols, were measured. RESULTS The experimental setups showed significant variability in the suction flow rate, but this was not correlated to the level of sound generated. Some experimental setups caused a short-term level of noise that exceeded the NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) guidelines and were close to the OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) recommended thresholds. It is also worth noting that the variability in the flow rate is not reflected in the efficacy of the experimental setups to mitigate spatter. All experimental setups, except the IsoVac system, provided statistically significantly better spatter mitigation compared to the control. All experimental setups also were efficient in mitigating aerosols compared with the positive control (P < .0001) and most systems yielded results similar to the negative control ambient PM (P > .05). CONCLUSION Results indicate that spatter reduction was significantly better amongst the setups in which an additional high-volume evacuator (HVE) line was used. All setups were efficient at mitigating PM2.5 aerosols in comparison to the control. The conclusions of this study should be interpreted with caution, and additional mitigation techniques consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations must be implemented in dental practices.","Ravenel, Theodore D; Kessler, Raymond; Comisi, John C; Kelly, Abigail; Renne, Walter G; Teich, Sorin T",Quintessence international,https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.a44919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32661521/,434
117737,Mentoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-04-03,"INTRODUCTION The objectives of this study were to obtain the birth prevalence of cleft lips and/or cleft palates (CL±P) and to identify potential associated risk factors in the population of the Northeast (NE) region of Thailand. METHODS The data were collected from October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013, for infant deliveries with nonsyndromic CL±P in all hospitals of 4 provinces in the region. Workshops were conducted to establish diagnostic criteria, treatment guidelines, referral systems, data collection, and data reporting. All patients included in this study, including a case (the child born with cleft lip and palate [CLP]) and 2 control cases (2 following children born without CLP in the same hospital), completed a questionnaire regarding demographics, cleft characteristics, and factors of interest such as alcohol intake, smoking, vitamin use, and medication. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio were presented for the magnitude of associations between proposed risk factors and CL±P along with 95% CIs. RESULTS The overall birth prevalence of CL±P was 1.93 per 1000 live births. There was a significant difference in percentages of infants with low birth weights (P = .03), family history of CL±P (P = .01) in cases than controls. Mothers who took self-medication or a menstrual regulation supplement were more likely to have the child with CL±P (P = .01 adjusted). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of CL±P in the NE Thailand was high. Low infant birth weight, family history of CL±P, and the use of self-medication or menstrual regulation herbal supplement was significant factors.","Chowchuen, Bowornsilp; Surakunprapha, Palakorn; Winaikosol, Kengkart; Punyavong, Pattama; Kiatchoosakun, Pakaphan; Pradubwong, Suteera",The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/1055665620956896; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32911976/,434

DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMABSE, PubMed, CINAHL Plus, APA PsycINFO and IEEE Xplore databases were searched up to September 2020. Studies were restricted to peer-reviewed, English-language journal articles, dissertations and conference papers comprising an empirical analysis where ML was identified to be the method used to examine human experience of tobacco. Studies of genomics and diagnostic imaging were excluded. STUDY SELECTION Two reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts. The reference list of articles was also searched. In an iterative process, eligible studies were classified into domains based on their objectives and types of data used in the analysis. DATA EXTRACTION Using data charting forms, two reviewers independently extracted data from all studies. A narrative synthesis method was used to describe findings from each domain such as study design, objective, ML classes/algorithms, knowledge users and the presence of a data sharing statement. Trends of publication were visually depicted. DATA SYNTHESIS 74 studies were grouped into four domains: ML-powered technology to assist smoking cessation (n=22); content analysis of tobacco on social media (n=32); smoker status classification from narrative clinical texts (n=6) and tobacco-related outcome prediction using administrative, survey or clinical trial data (n=14). Implications of these studies and future directions for ML researchers in tobacco control were discussed. CONCLUSIONS ML represents a powerful tool that could advance the research and policy decision-making of tobacco control.

METHODS P. berghei-infected mice were divided into six groups: infected control (IC) group, administered 1 mL Tween 20; GTE100 and GTE250 groups, administered 100 and 250 mg/kg GTE, respectively; GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups, co-administered 100 and 250 mg/kg GTE plus 30 mg/kg CQ, respectively; and CQ group, administered 30 mg/kg CQ. A separate group of non-infected mice were given 1 mL Tween 20, and served as a normal control group (NC). Extract and drug were dissolved in Tween 20 and administered orally once daily for 12 consecutive days. At the end of the treatment period, mice were anesthetized with chloroform and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Plasma was prepared from blood obtained from each mouse. Parameters evaluated at the end of the treatment period include parasitemia, red blood cell count, hematocrit, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-10 (IL-10). RESULTS Infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups) showed significantly reduced parasitemia levels (P < 0.05) compared to those administered GTE alone as well as IC. Significant improvement in body weight (P < 0.05) was also observed in infected mice treated with a combination of GTE and CQ (GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups), compared to mice receiving GTE alone (GTE100 and GTE250 groups). Plasma MDA and TNF-α concentrations were significantly lowered, and IL-10 concentration was significantly increased in GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups, relative to the IC group (P < 0.05). GSH concentration and SOD, CAT and GPx activities were significantly higher in GT100 + CQ and GT250 + CQ groups compared to the GTE100, GTE250, IC and NC groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Data generated in this study showed that GTE enhanced the anti-plasmodial action of CQ in mice through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.","Oluba, Olarewaju M; Akpor, Oghenerobor B; Adebiyi, Feyikemi D; Josiah, Sunday J; Alabi, Olayinka O; Shoyombo, Ayoola O; Olusola, Augustine O",Journal of integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joim.2020.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830075/,434

Several newer or less-established imaging modalities, including vessel wall MRI, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and 4D CTA and MRA, are being developed to complement conventional CT and MRI techniques. Vessel wall MRI provides high-resolution analysis of both extracranial and intracranial vasculature to help identify previously occult lesions or characteristics of lesions that may portend a worse natural history. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used in the acute setting as a minimally invasive way of identifying large vessel occlusions or monitoring the response to stroke treatment. It can also be used to assist in the workup for cryptogenic stroke or to diagnose a patent foramen ovale. Four-dimensional CTA and MRA provide a less invasive alternative to digital subtraction angiography to determine the extent of the clot burden and the degree of collateral blood flow in large vessel occlusions. Along with technological advances, these new imaging modalities are improving the diagnosis, workup, and management of acute ischemic stroke- roles that will continue to expand in the future.","Kilburg, Craig; Scott McNally, J; de Havenon, Adam; Taussky, Philipp; Kalani, M Yashar S; Park, Min S",Neurosurgical focus,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.1.focus16503; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28366054/,434

119058,[Prediction of end of lockdown post-peak of cases in first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile].,2020-11-09,"BACKGROUND KIR+NKG2A + Eomes+ CD8+ T cells, which are preferentially found with a TEMRA (CD45RA + CCR7-) phenotype while having the capacity to rapidly produce IFN-γ in response to innate stimulation (IL-12 and IL-18), have been demonstrated to exist in human cord blood and the adult blood circulation. This highly responsive T-cell type was termed NK-like CD8+ T cells due to their capability to act in an innate immune fashion in mice similar to NK cells. However, KIR+NKG2A + CD8+ T cells that are Eomes- represent a small proportion of unconventional T cells that have not been described until now. METHODS We compare the distribution of the memory phenotypes and senescence-associated markers of two T-cell subsets by multicolor flow cytometry in 10 cord blood samples and 105 healthy individuals (HIs) ranging from 6 to 84 years of age. RESULTS We found that the Eomes+ population has a higher differentiation degree than the Eomes- population. T cells in the Eomes- subset show proportionally less TEMRA phenotypes while instead preferentially displaying a more naïve and TCM phenotype. Furthermore, the Eomes- population was shown to linearly decrease with age, while the Eomes+ population exhibited more senescence-associated characteristics, such as CD57 expression and loss of CD28. CONCLUSION Overall, the KIR+NKG2A + Eomes- CD8+ T-cell population shares similar characteristics with the Eomes+ population, although with a lower degree of differentiation, lower senescence marker expression, and a proportional decrease with age. Thus, we suspect that KIR+NKG2A + Eomes-CD8+ T cells may represent a less differentiated stage of the NK-like CD8+ T-cell subset.","Kasakovski, Dimitri; Zeng, Xiangbo; Lai, Jing; Yu, Zhi; Yao, Danlin; Chen, Shaohua; Zha, Xianfeng; Li, Yangqiu; Xu, Ling","Cytometry.

There are three subtypes, and the treatment strategies for each are different. Subtype B (multiple fistulas) can be treated by either embolization or surgery. On the basis of a case from our treatment experience, we propose a method for achieving optimal outcome while minimizing nerve injury. CASE DESCRIPTION A 51-year-old female was admitted to our hospital with acute myelopathy caused by a perimedullary AVF. Initially, we treated her by embolization using the chemical agent Onyx. Her symptoms improved immediately but gradually returned beginning 1 week later. Two months later, the symptoms had returned to pretreatment status, so we removed the fistulas surgically. Severe adhesions between nerve and occult venous varices were noted during the operation. Afterward, the patient's symptoms improved significantly. Histopathological sections showed an inflammatory reaction around the varices. CONCLUSIONS We initially considered several possible reasons for the return of symptoms: (a) Hypoperfusion of the spinal cord; (b) mass effect of the occult vein varices; (c) residual AVF or vascular remodeling resulting in recurrent cord hypertension; (d) Onyx-induced perivascular inflammation resulting in nerves adhering to each other and to occult venous varices.

120161,Sex workers are returning to work and require enhanced support in the face of COVID-19: results from a longitudinal analysis of online sex work activity and a content analysis of safer sex work guidelines.,2020-08-25,"BACKGROUND Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health information related to COVID-19 has spread across the news media worldwide. Google is among the most used Internet search engines, and the Google Trends tool can reflect how the public seek COVID-related health information during this period. OBJECTIVE To understand health communication through Google Trends and news coverage and to explore their relationship with prevention and control of COVID-19 in the early epidemic stage. METHODS To achieve the study objectives, we analyzed the public's information-seeking behaviors on Google and news media coverage on COVID-19. We collected data on COVID-19 news coverage and Google search queries for eight countries (United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand) between January 1, 2020 and April 29, 2020, and depicted the characteristics of the trend of news coverage on COVID-19 over time, as well as the search queries trends on the topics of COVID-19 related diseases, treatments and medical resources, symptoms and signs, and public measures. And the search queries trend provided relative search volume (RSV) as an indicator to represent the popularity of a specific search term in a specific geographic area over a period. Also, time-lag correlation analysis was used to further explore the relationship between the trend of search terms and the number of daily new cases, the relationship between search terms trends and news coverage. RESULTS Across all search trends in eight countries, almost all search peaks were formed between March and April 2020, and declined occurred in April 2020. Regarding COVID-19 related diseases, in most countries, the RSV of ""coronavirus"" increased earlier than ""covid-19"", but around April 2020, the search volume of ""covid-19"" surpassed ""coronavirus"". For treatments and medical resources, the most and least searched terms were ""mask"" and ""ventilator"", respectively. In the topic of symptoms and signs, ""fever"" and ""cough"" were the most searched terms. And the RSV of ""lockdown"" was significantly more than ""social distancing"" on the topic of public measures. Besides, when combining the search trends with news coverage, there were three main patterns: the United States pattern, the Singapore pattern, and the other-countries pattern. In the time-lag correlation analysis between the RSV of the topic ""Treatment and medical resources"" and the number of daily new cases, except for Singapore, the RSV of this topic were positively correlated with daily new cases in other countries, with the maximum correlation of 0.8 (United States). And in the time-lag correlation analysis between the overall RSV of ""Diseases"" and the number of daily news, the overall RSV of this topic were positively correlated with the number of daily news, the maximum correlation coefficient was more than 0.8, and the search behavior was 0-17 days earlier than the news coverage. CONCLUSIONS Our findings revealed public interest in masks, disease control, and public health measures, and revealed the potential value of Google Trends in the face of the emergence of new infectious diseases. Also, Google Trends combined with news media can achieve more efficient health communication. Therefore, both news media and Google Trends contribute to the early prevention and control of the epidemic.

121657,Psychological impact of fear-based messages in context of COVID 19.,2020-12-10,"PURPOSE The benefit of routine pre-emptive screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in patients with cancer before cancer-directed therapies is unclear. Herein, we characterize the outcomes of a cohort of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by routine screening (RS) in comparison with those diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion or exposure history (nonroutine screening [NRS]). METHODS A multisite prospective observational study was conducted at three major and five satellite campuses of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center between March 18 and July 31, 2020. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospital admission. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit admissions and all-cause mortality. RESULTS Five thousand four hundred fifty-two patients underwent RS in the outpatient setting only, and 44 (0.81%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. RS detected 19 additional patients from the scheduled inpatient admissions for surgical or interventional procedures or inpatient chemotherapy. One hundred sixty-one patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 on the basis of NRS. COVID-19-related hospitalization rate (17.5% v 26.7%; P = .14), intensive care unit admission (1.6% v 5.6%; P = .19), and mortality (4.8% v 3.7%; P = .72) were not significantly different between the RS and NRS groups. In the multivariable analysis, age ≥ 60 years (odds ratio, 4.4; P = .023) and an absolute lymphocyte count ≤ 1.4 × 109/L (odds ratio, 9.2; P = .002) were independent predictors of COVID-19-related hospital admission. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 positivity rate was low on the basis of RS. Comparing the hospital admission and mortality outcomes with the NRS cohort, there were no significant differences. The value of routine pre-emptive screening of asymptomatic patients with cancer for COVID-19 remains low.","Xie, Zhuoer; Saliba, Antoine N; Abeykoon, Jithma; Majeed, Umair; Almquist, Daniel R; Wiedmeier-Nutor, Julia E; Bezerra, Evandro; Andrade-Gonzalez, Xavier; Hickman, Ashley; Sorenson, Karl; Rakshit, Sagar; Wee, Christopher; Tella, Sri Harsha; Kommalapati, Anuhya; Abdallah, Nadine; Pritchett, Joshua; De Andrade, Mariza; Uprety, Dipesh; Badley, Andrew; Manochakian, Rami; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Bryce, Alan H; Hubbard, Joleen M; Gangat, Naseema; Thompson, Carrie A; Witzig, Thomas E; McWilliams, Robert R; Leventakos, Konstantinos; Halfdanarson, Thorvardur R",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.21.00177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34125579/,434

However, the efficiency of this material is controversial. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of cloth masks in reducing transmission and contamination by droplets and aerosols for the general population and healthcare workers. Electronic databases were searched without year or language restrictions. Clinical and laboratorial studies were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using an adapted quality checklist for laboratory-based studies. ROBINS-I tool and Cochrane RoB 2.0 were used to evaluate non-randomized (n-RCT) and randomized clinical trials (RCT), respectively. The quality of the evidence was assessed through GRADE tool. From the eleven studies selected, eight were laboratory-based studies, one non-randomized and one RCT supported by laboratory data. Between the evaluated fabrics only three presented a filtration efficiency > 90%. Hybrid of cotton/chiffon (95%CI 95.2 to 98.8), hybrid of cotton/silk (95%CI 92.2 to 95.8) and cotton quilt (95%CI 94.2 to 97.8). However, cloth masks are not recommended for healthcare workers. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to a high methodological heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Despite the lower efficiency compared to medical masks, laboratorial results may underestimate the efficiency of cloth masks in real life. Cloth mask efficiency is higher when made of hybrid fabrics (cotton/chiffon, cotton/silk) and cotton quilt, mainly with multiple layers.","Santos, Milena; Torres, Darlyane; Cardoso, Paula Coutinho; Pandis, Nikolaos; Flores-Mir, Carlos; Medeiros, Rita; Normando, Antonio David",Brazilian oral research,https://doi.org/10.1590/1807-3107bor-2020.vol34.0123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33146319/,434

Drawing on a near population of federal clients on supervised release in the Midwestern United States, the current study examined variables associated with compliant supervision status. One day on supervision contributed to a 1% reduction in the logged odds of supervision compliance. Clients with no drug history had 793% increased odds, clients with sustained remission had 620% increased odds, and clients with early remission had 458% increased odds of compliant supervision status relative to clients actively using drugs. Among the federal Post Conviction Risk Assessment (PCRA) indices, only PCRA Criminal History was significant as clients with less extensive criminal history were more likely to be compliant supervision clients. A one-unit change in PCRA Criminal History status was associated with 25% reduced odds of supervision compliance. Total conditions were inversely associated with compliant supervision status with each additional condition associated with a 19% reduced likelihood of compliant supervision status. None of the demographic variables was significantly associated with compliant supervision status. Implications of the findings for the protective factor paradigm in corrections are discussed.","DeLisi, Matt; Drury, Alan; Elbert, Michael",International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624x21992681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33533267/,434

However, the herbal combination mechanism and underlying material basis of this multi-herbal formula are not clear. In this study, an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method to simultaneously determine multiple bioactive compounds in QSKL was established and validated. Using the developed method, 18 bioactive components in rat plasma after oral administration of QSKL formula and its single herb extracts were quantified. Based on these results, PK parameters (T1/2 , Tmax , Cmax , AUC0-48h , and AUC0-∞ ) of the 18 bioactive components were analyzed and compared by using PKSlover 2.0 PK software. The experimental data suggested that significant changes in PK profiles were observed between the QSKL formula and its single herb extracts. The herbal combination in QSKL significantly influences the system exposure and the PK behaviors of the 18 bioactive components, indicating multicomponent interactions among the herbs. This study provides insight into the herbal combination mechanism and underlying material basis of the QSKL formula.","Zhou, Hui; He, Yang; Zheng, Zhong; Liu, Zhiqiang; Song, Fengrui; Liu, Shu",Biomedical chromatography : BMC,https://doi.org/10.1002/bmc.4959; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726460/,434

Taking the advantage of the closed form of solutions, we establish the epidemic characteristics of disease transmission: the outbreak size, the peak size and the turning point for the cumulative infected cases. It is shown that the usual disease outbreak threshold condition (the basic reproduction number R0 is greater than unity) fails to fully guarantee the existence of peaking time and turning point when the initial infection size is not relatively small.

123873,The knowledge level and perceptions towards COVID-19 among Turkish final year medical students.,2020-07-11,"BACKGROUND During noninvasive ventilation, nonintentional leaks have a detrimental effect on the efficacy of ventilation. A wide range of industrial masks are available, with intentional leaks of different importance. The potential impact of this variability in intentional leaks on performances of bilevel ventilators has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE To measure intentional leaks in seven different industrial masks and determine whether higher leaks modify ventilator performance and quality of ventilation. METHODS Seven interfaces connected to four ventilators, the VPAP III ST (ResMed; NorthRyde, Australia), the BiPAP Harmony (Respironics; Monroeville, PA), the SmartAir ST (Covidien/Airox; Pau, France), and the GoodKnight 425 ST Bilevel (Covidien/Tyco-Nellcor/Puritan Bennett; Pleasanton, CA), were adapted on a mannequin connected to a lung model (ASL5000, IngMar Medical; Pittsburgh, PA). Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure were 14 and 4 cm H(2)O, respectively. The lung model was set with a respiratory rate of 15 cycles per min and a duration of inspiration of 1 s in three simulated conditions (normal, restrictive, and obstructive). Inspiratory trigger delay and effort, capacity to achieve and maintain IPAP, expiratory cycling and tidal volume were analyzed for all masks and ventilators in the three simulated lung conditions. RESULTS The level of intentional leaks in the seven masks ranged from 30 to 45 L/min for an IPAP of 14 cm H(2)O. Importance of leaks did not influence trigger performances. However, capacity to achieve and maintain IPAP was significantly decreased with all ventilators and in all simulated lung conditions when intentional leaks increased. This led to a maximum reduction in delivered tidal volume of 48 mL. Expiratory cycling was not affected by the level of intentional leaks except in obstructive lung conditions. CONCLUSION Mask intentional leaks can impair efficacy of ventilation, especially when > 40 L/min.","Borel, Jean Christian; Sabil, AbdelKebir; Janssens, Jean-Paul; Couteau, Marie; Boulon, Loren; Lévy, Patrick; Pépin, Jean-Louis",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.08-1340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18849400/,434

This study aimed to evaluate perception and satisfaction of health sciences students towards E-learning during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS A structured questionnaire was distributed to 2000 health care students either through email or social media platforms. The questionnaire was divided into two sections: the first section addressed demographic information such as age, education level, course of study, number of lectures attended and country. The second section gathered information on perception and satisfaction of students using 13 close-ended questions. Frequencies and percentages were assessed for demographic data, perception and satisfaction level of students. The paired sample t-test, independent t test and Spearman correlation were applied to evaluate statistical significance between different variables of the study. A p-value of <0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Data from 1255 participants were included at a response rate of 66.4%. More than one third (37%) of the students took 25 or more online E-learning sessions and 47% preferred Zoom as an online platform. Participants belonged to 11 countries from developed and developing nations. 41% reported interference of E-learning due to network problems. 60% considered that clinical and practical skills are best learned in clinics and laboratories. More than one third of the students preferred classroom teaching and 34% of the students did not feel confident enough to take exit exams after E-learning sessions. CONCLUSION E-learning satisfaction levels were better among developed countries (7.34) compared to developing countries (5.82).

We sought to investigate to what extent bleeding represents the unmasking of an occult cancer in patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulants. Methods and Results Using data from CardioCHUVI-AF (Retrospective Observational Registry of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation From Vigo's Health Area), 8753 patients with AF aged ≥75 years with a diagnosis of AF between 2014 and 2017 were analyzed. Of them, 2171 (24.8%) experienced any clinically relevant bleeding, and 479 (5.5%) were diagnosed with cancer during a follow-up of 3 years. Among 2171 patients who experienced bleeding, 198 (9.1%) were subsequently diagnosed with cancer. Patients with bleeding have a 3-fold higher hazard of being subsequently diagnosed with new cancer compared with those without bleeding (4.7 versus 1.4 per 100 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 3.2 [95% CI, 2.6-3.9]). Gastrointestinal bleeding was associated with a 13-fold higher hazard of new gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis (HR, 13.4; 95% CI, 9.1-19.8); genitourinary bleeding was associated with an 18-fold higher hazard of new genitourinary cancer diagnosis (HR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.5-26.2); and bronchopulmonary bleeding was associated with a 15-fold higher hazard of new bronchopulmonary cancer diagnosis (HR, 15.8; 95% CI, 6.0-41.3). For other bleeding (nongastrointestinal, nongenitourinary, nonbronchopulmonary), the HR for cancer was 2.3 (95% CI, 1.5-3.6). Conclusions In patients with AF treated with oral anticoagulant therapy, any gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or bronchopulmonary bleeding was associated with higher rates of new cancer diagnosis. These bleeding events should prompt investigation for cancers at those sites.","Raposeiras Roubín, Sergio; Abu Assi, Emad; Barreiro Pardal, Cristina; Cespón Fernandez, María; Muñoz Pousa, Isabel; Cobas Paz, Rafael; Parada, Jose Antonio; Represa Montenegro, Marta; Melendo Miu, María; Blanco Prieto, Sonia; Rosselló, Xavier; Ibañez, Borja; Íñiguez Romo, Andrés",Journal of the American Heart Association,https://doi.org/10.1161/jaha.120.016836; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140676/,434

Video-assisted debriefing (VAD) adds audio-visual captures and reviews to support traditional verbal debriefing (VD), but evidence evaluating its educational effects has been mixed, with limited attention focusing on its structure development. AIMS This study aimed to 1) investigate the effects of a three-phase VAD in enhancing nursing students' debriefing experiences and perceived stress compared to VD and 2) to explore its impact on facilitators' debriefing practices. METHODS A mixed-methods design was adopted. The quantitative phase involved a prospective controlled trial on 145 nursing students from a university in Singapore who were randomized into the intervention cluster (n = 72) and the control cluster (n = 73). The debriefing experience scale (DES), the stress visual analogue scale (Stress VAS), and the debriefing assessment for simulation in healthcare (DASH© student version) were used as outcome measures. For the qualitative component, a purposive sample of eight facilitators evaluated their own debriefing practices using the DASH© instructor version and each completed an open-ended question survey. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS Students from the intervention cluster significantly improved their debriefing experiences (p = 0.01), experienced comparable stress, and had better impressions of VAD facilitators' practices (p < 0.001) compared to those in the control cluster. Repeated VAD significantly reduced students' stress (p < 0.001). Students viewed the VAD facilitators as more effective than the VD facilitators. Three categories were derived from the qualitative comments: the act of debriefing, the crux of VAD, and debriefing for success. CONCLUSION The three-phase VAD significantly improved nursing students' debriefing experiences without adding extra stress. It also helped to improve facilitators' practices. Future research will benefit from exploring how experts facilitate the three-phase VAD ""on the ground"" and its effect on learning transfer and cost-effectiveness.","Zhang, H; Wang, W; Goh, S H L; Wu, X V; Mörelius, E",Nurse education today,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nedt.2020.104460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408245/,434

However, the association between e-cigarette use and ventricular arrhythmia is unknown. Thus, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the markers of ventricular repolarization such as QT interval, corrected QT (QTc), QT dispersion (QTd), peak-to-end interval of the T wave (Tp-e), corrected Tp-e and Tp-e/QT ratios in e-cigarette users. Methods The study population consisted 36 e-cigarette users and 40 healthy subjects. Ventricular repolarization parameters were obtained from 12-lead resting electrocardiogram. Ventricular repolarization parameters of the groups were compared. Results Basal demographic and laboratory data were similar in both groups. According to the electrocardiographic parameters, the Tp-e interval, corrected Tp-e, and Tp-e/QT ratio were significantly higher in individuals using e-cigarettes than in control subjects [74.9±6.4 milliseconds (ms) vs. 80.1±4.1ms, <0.001; 82.9±7.5 ms vs. 87.8±6.3 ms, p=0.003; 0.20±0.01 vs. 0.21±0.01, p=0.002; respectively].

Students were given 48 hours to recreate the examination, including details about the questions and answer choices. For accuracy and extent of reproduction, the results were compared to the original examination version.Results. The students were able to collectively recreate 90% of questions on the two examinations. For most questions (51%), students also recreated the question in combination with a correct response and at least one incorrect response. A large majority of the questions recreated were considered medium to high accuracy as they contained detailed phrasing that aligned with the original question on the examination.Conclusion. The collective memory of a group of students allows them to recreate almost an entire completed examination from memory. Based on the findings of the study and tenets of social psychology, we discuss the potential implications for examination security, providing feedback on examinations, and whether completed examinations should be released to students following the examination.","Persky, Adam M; Fuller, Kathryn A",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34301572/,434

Simultaneously, a series of wildlife sightings-mainly in urban areas-have been brought to public attention and often attributed to lockdown measures. Here we report on a series of wild carnivore records, including threatened species, obtained through camera traps set in urban forests, campuses, suburbs, and peri-urban areas of two cities in Chile, during partial lockdown measures. Our records are novel for Chile, a country where urban carnivore ecology is mostly unknown, and include the detection of four native carnivores, including the vulnerable güiña (Leopardus guigna) and the endangered southern river otter (Lontra provocax). These records also constitute a valuable baseline collected during partial lockdown measures in two cities of the Global South. We emphasize, however, that these findings cannot be used to argue for or against an effect of lockdown measures on wildlife. More generally, we call for caution in the interpretation of seemingly novel carnivore records during periods of lockdown and stress the value of international collaboration in evaluating the effects of the Anthropause on wildlife.","Silva-Rodríguez, Eduardo A; Gálvez, Nicolás; Swan, George J F; Cusack, Jeremy J; Moreira-Arce, Darío",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077221/,434

Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand the disease mechanisms, identify drug targets and inflammatory processes associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this need, we created a targeted mass spectrometry based multiplexed panel of 96 immune response associated proteins. We applied the multiplex assay to a cohort of serum samples from asymptomatic and moderately affected patients. All patients had tested positive for a SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and were determined to be subsequently positive for antibodies. Even 40-60 days post-viral infection, we observed a significant remaining inflammatory response in all patients. Proteins that were still affected were associated with the anti-inflammatory response and mitochondrial stress. This indicates that biochemical and inflammatory pathways within the body can remain perturbed long after SARS-CoV-2 infections have subsided even in asymptomatic and moderately affected patients.","Doykov, Ivan; Hällqvist, Jenny; Gilmour, Kimberly C; Grandjean, Louis; Mills, Kevin; Heywood, Wendy E",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27287.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33391730/,434

METHODS Laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy was performed with three ports, and specimen extraction carried out transanally through a complete opening of the rectal stump. A triple-stapled anastomosis restored colonic continuity. Systematic intraoperative bacteriological sampling was performed. Intraoperative data as well as microbiological and postoperative outcomes were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS Sixteen consecutive patients were studied over a 6-month period. All procedures were technically satisfactory, with a mean(s.d.) operating time of 120·9(41·9) min. No conversion or additional access was required. Four of the 16 patients developed complications, but none required intervention. Although polybacterial growth was present in all peritoneal culture samples, no infection-related complications were observed. Two patients had an extended course of perioperative antibiotic cover owing to overt peritoneal cavity contamination during surgery, and in two further patients antibiotics were instituted empirically following the development of postoperative fever alone. CONCLUSION Transanal specimen extraction in addition to per ano transcolonic stapler anvil insertion allows laparoscopic sigmoid resection to be performed with just three ports. Although intraperitoneal bacterial contamination occurs, this does not appear to translate into infectious morbidity.","Leroy, J; Costantino, F; Cahill, R A; D'Agostino, J; Morales, A; Mutter, D; Marescaux, J",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.7517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21560119/,434
136455,Editorial: social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic-IBD patients cannot stay at home forever. Authors' reply.,2020-08-01,"Multiple perforator flap breast reconstruction is an option that avoids implants in selected patients with minimal donor tissue. The technique addressed the need for additional skin to help create a breast envelope with more natural ptosis and additional volume to help create a body-appropriate breast mound while avoiding serial fat grafting. Using four flaps for the reconstruction of two breasts (bilateral stacked flap reconstruction) has recently become feasible with the advancement of microsurgical techniques, increased experience with alternative perforator flaps and use of co-surgery. Herein, we describe our early experience with bilateral stacked flap breast reconstruction.From 1/2014-10/2018, the senior co-surgeons performed 50 consecutive bilateral stacked flap operations at a single institution. All reconstructions were done in delayed fashion with mean operative time of 10 hours. Most breasts (94%) were reconstructed with a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap combined with a profunda artery perforator flap. Most flap micro-anastomoses (91.5%) were done directly with internal mammary vessels. The larger of the two flaps was typically placed inferiorly (66%), but there was significant inset variability. Of 200 flaps, five were lost (2.5%). Seven take-backs were needed for a flap-related concern, which included two negative explorations and a flap salvage. The most common non-flap-related complication was a thigh wound (17 total, 8 requiring a procedure).Our early experience suggests that bilateral stacked flap breast reconstruction is a powerful tool that can be done with acceptable microsurgical risk and complication profile in highly-selected patients.","Haddock, Nicholas T; Suszynski, Thomas M; Teotia, Sumeet S",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000007548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165290/,434

136586,Impact and trend of COVID-19 in the Brazilian prison system: an ecological study.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION Laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) is becoming an alternative to standard laparoscopic surgery. Proposed advantages include enhanced cosmesis and faster recovery. We assessed the early post-operative surgical outcomes of LESS surgery utilizing different instruments in the pediatric urological population in Canada. METHODS We prospectively captured data on all patients undergoing LESS at our institution between February 2011 and August 2012. This included patient age, operative time, length of stay, complications and short-term surgical outcomes. Different instruments/devices were used to perform the procedures. Access was achieved through a transumbilical incision. RESULTS A total of 16 LESS procedures were performed, including seven pyeloplasties, four unilateral and one bilateral varicocelectomies, two simple nephrectomies, one renal cyst decortication and one pyelolithotomy. There was no statistical difference in the operative times, hospital length of stay and cost (pyeloplasty only) in patients undergoing pyeloplasty and varicocelectomy using the LESS technique when compared to an age matched cohort of patients managed with the traditional laparoscopic approach. One pyeloplasty in the LESS group required conversion to open due to a small intra-renal pelvis. There were no immediate or short term post-operative complications; however, one patient experienced a decrease in renal function status post LESS pyeloplasty. Since all procedures were performed by a vastly experienced surgeon at a tertiary center, the generalizability of the results cannot be assessed. CONCLUSIONS There are only a few series that have assessed the role of LESS in pediatric urological surgery. Although our experience is limited by a heterogeneous group of patients with a short follow-up period, the present cohort demonstrates the safety and feasibility of LESS. Further evaluation with randomized studies is required to better assess the role of LESS in pediatric urology.","Khambati, Aziz; Wehbi, Elias; Farhat, Walid A",Canadian Urological Association journal = Journal de l'Association des urologues du Canada,https://doi.org/10.5489/cuaj.2379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25737756/,434

137644,[Neuropsychiatric sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic].,2021-03-31,"BACKGROUND Physiotherapy services are necessary for hospitalized patients of COVID-19 as well as chronic patients. Thus, physiotherapists present an increased risk of exposure to coronavirus. This study aimed to determine the number of physiotherapists who interrupted their services because of the COVID-19 pandemic and to verify the procedures adopted by the ones who are still working. METHODS The sample comprised 619 physiotherapists who worked in Portugal, 154 (24.9%) male and 465 (75.1%) female, aged between 22 and 67 years (34.47±8.70). The measurement instrument was an on-line questionnaire applied in late March 2020 through contacts and social networks. RESULTS 453 (73.2%) physiotherapists interrupted their work activities in person because of the pandemic and 166 (26.8%) continue to work in person. The main measures adopted by physical therapists who continue to work in person included: hand washing (21.5%), mask use (20.3%), material disinfection (19.3%) and, glove use (19.3%). Of the physiotherapists who are not working in person (n = 453), 267 (58.9%) continue to monitor their patients at a distance, and 186 (41.1%) are not monitoring the patients. The main measures used by physiotherapists to monitor their patients at a distance included: written treatment prescription (38%), making explanatory videos (26.7%), and synchronous video conference treatment (23.5%). CONCLUSIONS Our data revealed that most of the physiotherapists interrupted their face-to-face practices because of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, once they do not follow up their patients' treatment in person, most of them adapted to monitor their patients from a distance.","Minghelli, Beatriz; Soares, Ana; Guerreiro, Andreia; Ribeiro, Antoine; Cabrita, Carolina; Vitoria, Carlos; Nunes, Chloé; Martins, Claudia; Gomes, Diogo; Goulart, Filipa; Santos, Raquel Marreiro Dos; Antunes, Rita",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.4.491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578784/,434
138824,COVID-19 Pandemic: Hopes from Proteomics and Multiomics Research.,2020-05-18,"Photography provides a means for objective assessment and dissemination of clinical information. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) and Plastic Surgery Foundation (PSF) published photography guidelines in 2006 to optimize its clinical use. However, photographic documentation of outcomes in facial transplantation (FT) continues to lack standardization. We therefore appraised the current state of FT photography in the peer-reviewed literature. Methods A PubMed search was conducted from July 2005 to July 2019. Studies containing photographs of partial or full FT recipients were included. Non-English language articles, cadaveric and animal studies, technique papers, and case reports were excluded. Data were extracted from 91 articles. Adherence rates were calculated to determine whether published FT photographs followed ASPS/PSF guidelines. Proposed photographic standards particular to FT were then formulated to guide standardization of practice. Results Only 28.6% (26/91) of articles adhered to the photographic conventions of preparation, positioning, and views. Of 162 patient appearances in the 91 articles, 95% (154/162) met the criteria for preparation, 98.8% (160/162) met the criteria for positioning, but only 24.7% (40/162) met the criteria for views. Conclusions Photographic documentation of FT outcomes in the peer-reviewed literature is limited, with inconsistent adherence to ASPS/PSF guidelines. There is substantial deficiency in provision of alternative views, with the majority of publications only depicting the frontal view. FT photography standards should specifically incorporate alternative views, proper lighting and framing, and elimination of distractions, and accommodate for remote patient self-photography. This will promote a transparent and consistent longitudinal evaluation of the surgical results.","Wolfe, Erin M; Najera-Sweeney, Guillermo; Berman, Zoe P; Alfonso, Allyson R; Diep, Gustave K; Ramly, Elie P; Rodriguez, Eduardo D",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Then, VO2 and fat utilization measured at rest and during the 2h post-exercise, enjoyment, perceived exertion and appetite recorded during the session and energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE) assessed over the next 24h were compared for the three modalities. Overall, fat utilization increased after exercise. No modality effect or time-modality interaction were observed concerning VO2 and fat oxidation rate during the 2h post-exercise. The two exercise modalities did not induce specific EI and EE adaptations, but perceived appetite scores at 1h post-exercise were lower after HIIE 1 & 2 than MICE. Perceived exertion was higher during HIIE 1 & 2 than MICE, but enjoyment did not differ among modalities. The acute HIIE responses did not allow explaining the greater fat mass loss observed after regular high-intensity interval training in postmenopausal women with overweight/obesity. More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms involved in such adaptations.","Dupuit, Marine; Boscaro, Audrey; Bonnet, Alban; Bouillon, Patrice; Bruno, Pereira; Morel, Claire; Rance, Mélanie; Boisseau, Nathalie",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32881054/,434
139272,Structural Racism and the COVID-19 Experience in the United States.,2021-06-01,"BACKGROUND While COVID-19 in chronic hemodialysis patients has high mortality and the pandemic will not end in the near future, effective follow up strategies should be implemented for these patients. Surgeries have been triaged according to their level of urgencies and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) operations were among elective surgeries. This study aimed to analyze the effect of vascular access on the outcomes of hemodialysis patients who had COVID-19. METHODS One hundred four hemodialysis patients who had COVID-19 were retrospectively analyzed. Seventy-two of them had AVF as the vascular access while 32 of them had tunneled catheters. Inflammatory markers and outcomes of patients with AVFs and catheters were compared. A logistic regression analysis was performed in order to define factors that contribute to better outcomes in hemodialysis patients. RESULTS COVID-19 had high mortality rate in hemodialysis patients (36.5%). Patients with catheters have higher peak ferritin levels (p = 0.02) and longer hospital stay (p = 0.00). Having AVF as the vascular access (OR = 3.36; 95% CI: 1.05-10.72; p = 0.041) and using medium cut-off dialyzers (OR = 7.99; 95% CI: 1.53-41.65; p = 0.014) were related to higher survival of the patients. COVID severity was inversely proportional to the survival (p = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS AVFs contribute to higher survival of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Even in the pandemic era, end stage renal disease patients should be given the opportunity to have their vascular access properly created.","Murt, Ahmet; Yadigar, Serap; Yalin, Serkan Feyyaz; Dincer, Mevlut Tamer; Parmaksiz, Ergun; Altiparmak, Mehmet Riza",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.1177/11297298211021253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34082588/,434

Our objective was to compare molecular and conventional methods in a cohort of hospitalized children with and without symptoms of respiratory viral illness (RVI). METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of infants and toddlers hospitalized between December 2007 and March 2008 at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Five hundred sixty-nine of 641 patient visits (89%) were tested on admission. Conventional tests (immunochromatography, direct fluorescent antibody, shell vial and tube culture) were performed on all patients and nucleic acid tests (NATs) were performed on available samples (n = 306). Viruses were grouped into those routinely (group 1) and those not routinely (group 2) detected by conventional methods. RESULTS In children with RVI symptoms (n = 148), NATs identified a virus in 83% of specimens compared with 49% by conventional methods (P < 0.001), but detected a similar percentage of specimens with group 1 viruses (48.6% and 55.4%; P = 0.13) compared with conventional tests. In children without RVI symptoms (n = 158), NATs identified a virus in 41.7% of specimens compared with 4.4% by conventional tests (P < 0.001) and identified more group 1 viruses (9.5% and 4.4%; P = 0.03) compared with conventional tests. Group 2 viruses were identified by NATs in a similar percentage of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (25% and 32.3%; P = 0.20). CONCLUSIONS Molecular assays may have several advantages over conventional methods for detecting respiratory viruses, including improved sensitivity and rapid detection, but given the high prevalence of positive results in children without RVI symptoms, results should be interpreted cautiously.","Advani, Sonali; Sengupta, Arnab; Forman, Michael; Valsamakis, Alexandra; Milstone, Aaron M",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e318265a804; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22739572/,434

Clinically, RVFV induces a gamut of symptoms ranging from febrile illness to retinitis, hepatic necrosis, hemorrhagic fever, and death. It is known that type I interferon (IFN) responses can be protective against severe pathology; however, it is unknown which innate immune receptor pathways are crucial for mounting this response. Using both in vitro assays and in vivo mucosal mouse challenge, we demonstrate here that RNA helicases are critical for IFN production by immune cells and that signaling through the helicase adaptor molecule MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) is protective against mortality and more subtle pathology during RVFV infection. In addition, we demonstrate that Toll-like-receptor-mediated signaling is not involved in IFN production, further emphasizing the importance of the RNA cellular helicases in type I IFN responses to RVFV.","Ermler, Megan E; Yerukhim, Ekaterina; Schriewer, Jill; Schattgen, Stefan; Traylor, Zachary; Wespiser, Adam R; Caffrey, Daniel R; Chen, Zhijian J; King, Charles H; Gale, Michael; Colonna, Marco; Fitzgerald, Katherine A; Buller, R Mark L; Hise, Amy G",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01997-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23408632/,434

Periclimenaeus karantina sp. nov. was obtained from ascidian hosts. The species has a denticulate dactylus on both second pereiopods, considered to be typical for ascidian associates. It can be separated from related species by the combination of the following characters: the carpocerite overreaching the anterior margin of the scaphocerite; the distolateral tooth of the scaphocerite exceeding the anterior margin of the lamella; the dactylus of the minor chela exceeding the fixed finger; and the ambulatory dactyli furnished with a minute proximal tooth. Periclimenaeus apomonosi sp. nov. was obtained from sponge hosts, and belongs to the P. robustus species-group, on account of the developed anterior median lobe on the tergite of the first abdominal somite. It can be distinguished from related species by the combination of the presence of a supraorbital tooth; the presence of a pointed process on the inferior orbital angle; the distolateral tooth of the scaphocerite terminating level with the anterior margin of the lamella; the antennal carpocerite reaching about 0.6 of the scaphocerite; the first and second chelae with non-serrated cutting edges; the ischium and merus of the second pereiopods harbouring tubercles on the ventral margin; and the ambulatory dactyli with a distal accessory tooth and the corpus furnished with denticles, ventrally. The sponge associated species, Periclimenaeus djboutensis, relatively widespread across the Indo-Pacific, is reported for the first time from Korea in Geomundo Island.

The first case was seen in Turkey on March 11, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March 12, 2020. The study aimed to document the effect of pandemic on dermatology outpatient clinics in Turkey. 15 tertiary hospitals from 13 provinces were included in the study, which was conducted between January 12 and May 12, 2020. The International Codes of Diseases (ICD-10) categories and patients' characteristics were evaluated before and after the pandemic. A total of 164878 patients, 133131 before and 31747 after the pandemic, were evaluated. The daily hospital applications were found reduced by 77%. The three of the most frequent diagnoses; dermatitis, acne, and psoriasis remained unchanged after the pandemic. While the frequency of herpes zoster, scabies, urticaria, pityriasis rosea and sexually transmitted diseases increased significantly; allergic and irritant contact dermatitis decreased after the pandemic. The applications regarding cutaneous neoplasms were considerably reduced during the pandemic, and this effect was more pronounced in cities with higher COVID incidence. The pandemic caused a noteworthy reduction in the number of patients accessing dermatological care. The pandemic caused significant changes in the frequency of a wide range of dermatological diseases. The application of cutaneous neoplasms is considerably reduced after the pandemic, and this effect was more pronounced in cities where pandemics are frequent. Therefore, the pandemic has resulted on numerous impacts on many critical issues in dermatology and dermatological care. This article is protected by copyright.

144499,Consent during the covid-19 pandemic: surgeons need to think beyond the end of their scalpels now more than ever.,2020-08-11,"Painful conditions and sleep disturbances are major public health problems worldwide and one directly affects the other. Sleep loss increases pain prevalence and severity; while pain disturbs sleep. However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we asked whether chronic sleep restriction for 6 h daily progressively increases pain sensitivity and if this increase is reversed after two days of free sleep. Also, whether the pronociceptive effect of chronic sleep restriction depends on the periaqueductal grey and on the nucleus accumbens, two key regions involved in the modulation of pain and sleep-wake cycle. We showed that sleep restriction induces a pronociceptive effect characterized by a significant decrease in the mechanical paw withdrawal threshold in rats. Such effect increases progressively from day 3 to day 12 remaining stable thereafter until day 26. Two consecutive days of free sleep were not enough to reverse the effect, not even to attenuate it. This pronociceptive effect depends on the periaqueductal grey and on the nucleus accumbens, since it was prevented by their excitotoxic lesion. Complementarily, chronic sleep restriction significantly increased c-Fos protein expression within the periaqueductal grey and the nucleus accumbens and this correlates with the intensity of the pronociceptive effect, suggesting that the greater the neural activity in this regions, the greater the effect. These findings may contribute not only to understand why painful conditions are more prevalent and severe among people who sleep poorly, but also to develop therapeutic strategies to prevent this, increasing the effectiveness of pain management in this population.","Sardi, Natalia F; Lazzarim, Mayla K; Guilhen, Vinicius A; Marcílio, Renata S; Natume, Priscila S; Watanabe, Thainá C; Lima, Marcelo M S; Tobaldini, Glaucia; Fischer, Luana",Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.06.022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29928886/,434
144884,"Structural Barriers Influencing Food Insecurity, Malnutrition, and Health Among Latinas During and After COVID-19: Considerations and Recommendations.",2021-02-07,"BACKGROUND In preparing for the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery (FLS) exam, residents usually adopt a self-learning strategy where practice time can be managed with more flexibility. However, with this self-learning strategy, there is a lack of direct supervision from experts and residents risk understudying for this high-stakes exam. Our objective is to determine study goals for effective self-guided practice for the FLS manual skills tasks that will result in passing the examination. METHODS FLS manual skills data for all PGY-5 residents during 2009-2010 was supplied by the FLS administrative office. Descriptive statistics were performed, and data were regrouped by the pass/fail results of the exam. The minimum practice time requirement for passing each manual skills task is reported in order to guide practice. RESULTS 1,047 proctored FLS exams were completed by 2009-2010 residents. Mean task time achieved by all residents was 84 ± 31 s for peg transfer, 139 ± 54 s for pattern cut, 78 ± 29 s for endoloop, 158 ± 66 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 168 ± 77 s for intracorporeal suturing. In the pass group (n = 988), mean time to complete each task was 80 s for peg transfer, 134 s for pattern cut, 75 s for endoloop, 148 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 160 s for intracorporeal suturing. Calculations suggest a self-study goal for each task of 53 s for peg transfer, 50 s for pattern cut, 87 s for endoloop, 99 s for extracorporeal suturing, and 96 s for intracorporeal suturing. If a resident can reliably achieve these results during self-study, they have an 84% chance of passing the exam. CONCLUSIONS Residents preparing to take the FLS exam can refer to data presented in this study to set practice goals. Referring to these data-based practice goals will help residents to improve their chances of passing this high-stakes exam.","Cassera, Maria A; Zheng, Bin; Swanström, Lee L",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2357-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648121/,434

145238,Challenges and Experiences of Dental Medicine in Combating the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND Increasing numbers of patients with psychiatric illness are boarding in emergency departments (EDs) for longer periods. Many patients are at high risk of harm to self, and maintaining their safety is critical. The objectives of this study are to describe the development and implementation of a comprehensive safety precautions protocol for ED patients at risk for self-harm and to report the observed changes in rates of self-harm. METHODS A multidisciplinary team developed comprehensive safety precautions, including the creation of safe bathrooms, increasing the number and training of observers, protocols to manage access to belongings and for clothing search or removal, and additional interventions for exceptionally high-risk patients. Events of attempted self-harm were measured for 12 months before and after new safety precautions were enacted. RESULTS In the 12 months prior to the protocol initiation, among 4,408 at-risk patients, there were 13 episodes of attempted self-harm (2.95 per 1,000 at-risk patients), and 6 that resulted in actual self-harm (1.36 per 1,000 at-risk patients). In the 12 months after the protocol was introduced, among the 4,523 at-risk patients, there were 6 episodes of attempted self-harm (1.33 per 1,000 at-risk patients, p = 0.11) and only 1 that resulted in actual self-harm (0.22 per 1,000 at-risk patients, p = 0.07). There were no deaths. CONCLUSION Comprehensive safety precautions can be successfully developed and implemented in the ED. These precautions correlated with lower, although not statistically significant, rates of self-harm. Further study of similar interventions with adequately powered samples could be beneficial.","Donovan, Abigail L; Aaronson, Emily L; Black, Lauren; Fisher, Sara A; Bird, Suzanne A; Benzer, Theodore; Temin, Elizabeth S",Joint Commission journal on quality and patient safety,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcjq.2020.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962905/,434

146690,Communicating Uncertainties during the COVID-19 Outbreak.,2020-12-01,"Cholesterol has been implicated in various viral life cycle steps for different enveloped viruses, including viral entry into host cells, cell-cell fusion, and viral budding from infected cells. Enveloped viruses acquire their membranes from their host cells. Though cholesterol has been associated with binding and entry of various enveloped viruses into cells, cholesterol's exact function in the viral-cell membrane fusion process remains largely elusive, particularly for the paramyxoviruses. Further, paramyxoviral fusion occurs at the host cell membrane and is essential for both virus entry (virus-cell fusion) and syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion), central to viral pathogenicity. Nipah virus (NiV) is a deadly member of the Paramyxoviridae family, which also includes Hendra, measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and various veterinary viruses. The zoonotic NiV causes severe encephalitis, vasculopathy, and respiratory symptoms, leading to a high mortality rate in humans. We used NiV as a model to study the role of membrane cholesterol in paramyxoviral membrane fusion. We used a combination of methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MβCD), lovastatin, and cholesterol to deplete or enrich cell membrane cholesterol outside cytotoxic concentrations. We found that the levels of cellular membrane cholesterol directly correlated with the levels of cell-cell fusion induced. These phenotypes were paralleled using NiV/vesicular stomatitis virus (NiV/VSV) pseudotyped viral infection assays. Remarkably, our mechanistic studies revealed that cholesterol reduces an early F-triggering step but enhances a late fusion pore formation step in the NiV membrane fusion cascade. Thus, our results expand our mechanistic understanding of the paramyxoviral/henipaviral entry and cell-cell fusion processes.IMPORTANCE Cholesterol has been implicated in various steps of the viral life cycle for different enveloped viruses. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic enveloped virus in the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family, capable of causing a high mortality rate in humans and high morbidity in domestic and agriculturally important animals. The role of cholesterol for NiV or the henipaviruses is unknown. Here we show that the levels of cholesterol influence the levels of NiV-induced cell-cell membrane fusion during syncytia formation, and virus-cell membrane fusion during viral entry. Further, the specific role of cholesterol in membrane fusion is not well defined for the paramyxoviruses. We show that the levels of cholesterol affect an early F-triggering step and a late fusion pore formation step during the membrane fusion cascade. Thus, our results expand our mechanistic understanding of the viral entry and cell-cell fusion processes, which may aid the development of antivirals.","Contreras, Erik M; Johnston, Gunner P; Buchholz, David W; Ortega, Victoria; Monreal, I Abrrey; Zamora, J Lizbeth R; Cheung, Tracy; Aguilar, Hector C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02323-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408170/,434
146913,[Social inequalities in health and power relations: The Covid-19 in Quebec].,2021-03-02,"OBJECTIVE The present study aims to study whether using a videolaryngoscope (A.P. Advance™) facilitates or hinders intubation by non-anaesthetists inexperienced in its use. METHODS Thirty doctors from Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine backgrounds performed laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation using the Macintosh laryngoscope (MAC), A.P. Advance™ Normal Blade (AP N) and A.P. Advance™ Difficult Airway Blade (AP DAB) in simulated normal and difficult airway manikins. The primary outcomes measured were time to successful tracheal intubation and failure to intubate within 3 min or three attempts. Secondary outcomes were number of intubation attempts, adjuncts used, glottic view and ease of intubation. RESULTS There was a higher rate of failed intubation in the simulated difficult airway in participants using the AP N blade than either the MAC or AP DAB (23% vs 3% and 7%, P = 0.031). This was associated with a longer median time to intubate with the AP N and the AP DAB versus MAC (56.6, 50.2 vs 39.9 s, P = 0.007 and P = 0.041). In the normal airway median time to intubate was longest with the AP N (27.8 s), and this was significantly slower than the MAC (18.1 s, P = 0.003) and the AP DAB (17.3 s, P < 0.001). No one failed to intubate the normal manikin. CONCLUSIONS The use of the A.P. Advance™ videolaryngoscope should not be considered, without adequate prior training and experience, in the management of a difficult airway. The level of adequate training has yet to be established.","Marshall, Elizabeth M; O'Loughlin, Edmond; Swann, Alex D",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.12213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720848/,434

They have been classically divided into 3 groups (group 1 ILCs or ILC1s, group 2 ILCs or ILC2s, and group 3 ILCs or ILC3s). They serve as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and allergens at mucosal surfaces. The adaptive immune response works effectively in association with innate immunity as innate immune cells serve as APCs to directly stimulate the adaptive immune cells (various sets of T and B cells). Additionally, innate immune cells also secrete various effector molecules, including cytokines or chemokines impacting the function, differentiation, proliferation, and reprogramming among adaptive immune cells to maintain immune homeostasis. Only superantigens do not require their processing by innate immune cells as they are recognized directly by T cells and B cells. Thus, a major emphasis of the current article is to describe the cross-talk between different ILCs and adaptive immune cells during different conditions varying from normal physiological situations to different infectious diseases to allergic asthma.","Kumar, V",Journal of leukocyte biology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlb.4mir0420-500rrr; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32557732/,434

Diarrhoea as the most important indication of the infection leads to high economic losses in livestock industries and is a life threatening infection in immunocompromised individuals. In the absence of the effective drugs, vaccine has an effective role in the prevention of infection. For this purpose we developed a vaccine utilizing recombinant P23 protein and immunized pregnant cows four times from 70 days to parturition every 2 weeks. After parturition, each calf received his dam colostrum and challenged with 1 × 10(7) Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts at 12 h of age. Results showed that in contrast with the control group, the antibody titre in the sera and first milking colostra of the immunized cows significantly increased and calves fed hyperimmune colostrum did not show cryptosporidiosis signs. Moreover, enriched colostrum not only reduced significantly the amount of oocyst excretion but also delayed its onset. Our study showed that recombinant P23 protein could be used for passive immunization of newborn calves against Cryptosporidium parvum.","Askari, N; Shayan, P; Mokhber-Dezfouli, M R; Ebrahimzadeh, E; Lotfollahzadeh, S; Rostami, A; Amininia, N; Ragh, M J",Parasite immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12317; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27012710/,434

Uncommon mechanisms of resistance escape detection by these platforms and undermine our ability to contain outbreaks. This article is a systematic review of published articles that reported isoniazid (INH) resistance-conferring mutations between September 2013 and December 2019. The genes katG, inhA, fabG1, and the intergenic region oxyR'-ahpC were considered in this review. Fifty-two articles were included describing 9,306 clinical isolates (5,804 INHR, 3,502 INHS) from 31 countries. The three most frequently mutated loci continue to be katG315 (4,271), inhA-15 (787), and inhA-8 (106). However, the diagnostic value of inhA-8 is far lower than previously thought, only appearing in 25 (0.4%) INHR isolates lacking the first two mutations. We catalogued 45 new loci (29 katG, nine inhA, seven ahpC) associated with INH resistance and identified 59 loci (common to this and previous reviews) as a reliable basis for molecular diagnostics. Including all observed mutations provides a cumulative sensitivity of 85.6%. In 14.4% of resistant isolates no mechanism of resistance was detected, making them likely to escape molecular detection, and in case of mono INH resistance likely to convert to MDR-TB. Integrating the information cataloged in this study into current diagnostic tools is essential for combating the emergence of MDR-TB, and its exclusion can lead to an unintended selection against common mechanisms and to diversifying evolution. Observation of many low-frequency resistance-conferring mutations points to an advantage of WGS for diagnostics. Finally, we provide five recommendations for future diagnostic platforms.","Valafar, Siavash J",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.02091-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33361298/,434

METHODS A 29-question survey was distributed to an international mailing list of patients with subglottic stenosis to assess the patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 543 patients with iSGS participated. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with iSGS have experienced COVID-19 symptoms, which were predominantly mild to moderate, with only 2 hospitalizations. Most patients with iSGS (80.0%) have not been advised they are high risk for COVID-19, despite 36.5% of patients with iSGS being obese (body mass index of 30+). Delays to surgeries and in-office procedures have impacted 40.1% of patients currently receiving treatment, with 38.8% of patients increasingly struggling to breathe as a result. Anxiety and stress are increasing among patients, with 3 in 4 (75.2%) reporting they are anxious about travelling by public transport, contracting the virus in hospital and infecting loved ones (69.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Of greater concern is that 23.1% with increasing dyspnea state they are staying away from hospital despite their deteriorating health. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the physical and psychological health of patients with iSGS. Surgeons managing cases of laryngotracheal stenosis need to offer appropriate support and communication to these high risk patients. During the pandemic, this should include self-isolation if they are dyspneic or on treatments that may have reduced their immunity. In addition, they should offer safe clinical pathways to airway assessment and treatments, if they become necessary. To minimize unnecessary travel, much of the clinical monitoring can be carried out remotely, using telephone or video-based consultations, in conjunction with local health professionals.","Anderson, Catherine; Sandhu, Guri; Yaghchi, Chadwan Al","Ear, nose, & throat journal",https://doi.org/10.1177/0145561320977467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302743/,434

Complications following panniculectomy are higher for super obese patients, often requiring readmission and additional interventions. In this study, the authors compare the outcomes of patients who underwent primary closure of their resection wounds to the outcomes of patients who underwent initial open wound management with a negative-pressure dressing. METHODS The records of all patients who underwent panniculectomy between 2007 and 2012 were reviewed. Of 14 patients with a body mass index greater than 50, nine underwent primary closure and five were treated with open wound management. A retrospective chart review was performed. RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in age or preoperative comorbidities, but body mass index was higher for the open wound management group (66.4 versus 58.9, p = 0.039). There were no statistically significant differences in mean operative time, resection weight, estimated blood loss, or hospital length of stay. The primary closure group had a 44 percent readmission rate and a 33 percent reoperation rate for wound complications. The open wound management group had no wound-related readmissions or secondary procedures for débridement. CONCLUSIONS Open wound management in the massive panniculectomy patient reduces hospital readmission and secondary operations. This case series provides reasons to support the consideration of open wound management following massive panniculectomy in the super morbidly obese patient population.","Brown, Matthew; Adenuga, Paul; Soltanian, Hooman",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.prs.0000436818.34332.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24105087/,434

Among some communities, rainfall induced flooding can cause increased uncertainty where first-mile transportation infrastructure is limited. In Rwanda, this challenge is apparent, where 90% of the population below the poverty line live in rural areas that are typically mountainous with frequent flooding - events that may be increasing in frequency and severity as the climate changes. To reduce these transportation barriers, the non-profit organization Bridges to Prosperity (B2P) plans to construct hundreds of trailbridges in Rwanda between 2018 and 2023. This scale of rural infrastructure services presents an opportunity for experimental investigation of the effects of these new trailbridges on economic, health, agricultural and education outcomes in rural communities. In this paper, we present a cohort study evaluating the potential community benefits of rural trailbridges - including economic, health and social outcomes for Rwandan communities experiencing environmental change. We examined households living near 12 trailbridge sites and 12 comparison sites over February 2019-March 2020. We found that labor market income increased by 25% attributable to the trailbridges.

However, viral infection in immunocompromised patients and pregnant women may result in serious consequences, such as chronic hepatitis and liver damage, mortality of the latter of which reaches up to 20-30%. Type I interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral immunity is known to be the first-line defense against virus infection. Upon HEV infection in the cell, the virus genome is recognized by pathogen recognition receptors, leading to rapid activation of intracellular signaling cascades. Expression of type I IFN triggers induction of a barrage of IFN-stimulated genes, helping the cells cope with viral infection. Interestingly, some of the HEV-encoded genes seem to be involved in disrupting signaling cascades for antiviral immune responses, and thus crippling cytokine/chemokine production.

Despite long-established, clear, and evidence-based recommendations regarding the treatment of OUD during pregnancy, incarcerated pregnant people with OUD do not consistently receive medication treatment and are instead forced into opioid withdrawal. This inadequate care raises multiple concerns, including issues of justice and equity, considerations regarding the legal and ethical obligations of the provision of health care, and violations of the medical and legal rights of incarcerated people. We offer recommendations for improving care for this often-ignored group.","Ahlbach, Chris; Sufrin, Carolyn; Shlafer, Rebecca",Obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aog.0000000000004002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769655/,434
153299,Natural Disasters Related Traumatic Injuries/Fatalities in the United States and Their Impact on Emergency Preparedness Operations.,2021,"Importance Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, yet many individuals with OUD do not receive treatment. Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of OUD treatments and association of these treatments with outcomes in the US. Design and Setting This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis included a US population with OUD. Interventions Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, methadone, or injectable extended-release naltrexone; psychotherapy (beyond standard counseling); overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND); and contingency management (CM). Main Outcomes and Measures Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths throughout 5 years, discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. Results In the base case, in the absence of treatment, 42 717 overdoses (4132 fatal, 38 585 nonfatal) and 12 660 deaths were estimated to occur in a cohort of 100 000 patients over 5 years, and 11.58 discounted lifetime QALYs were estimated to be experienced per person. An estimated reduction in overdoses was associated with MAT with methadone (10.7%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (22.0%), and when combined with CM and psychotherapy (range, 21.0%-31.4%). Estimated deceased deaths were associated with MAT with methadone (6%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (13.9%), and when combined with CM, OEND, and psychotherapy (16.9%). MAT yielded discounted gains of 1.02 to 1.07 QALYs per person. Including only health care sector costs, methadone cost $16 000/QALY gained compared with no treatment, followed by methadone with OEND ($22 000/QALY gained), then by buprenorphine with OEND and CM ($42 000/QALY gained), and then by buprenorphine with OEND, CM, and psychotherapy ($250 000/QALY gained). MAT with naltrexone was dominated by other treatment alternatives. When criminal justice costs were included, all forms of MAT (with buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) were associated with cost savings compared with no treatment, yielding savings of $25 000 to $105 000 in lifetime costs per person. The largest cost savings were associated with methadone plus CM. Results were qualitatively unchanged over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. An analysis using demographic and cost data for Veterans Health Administration patients yielded similar findings. Conclusions and Relevance In this cost-effectiveness analysis, expanded access to MAT, combined with OEND and CM, was associated with cost-saving reductions in morbidity and mortality from OUD. Lack of widespread MAT availability limits access to a cost-saving medical intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality from OUD. Opioid overdoses in the US likely reached a record high in 2020 because of COVID-19 increasing substance use, exacerbating stress and social isolation, and interfering with opioid treatment. It is essential to understand the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of MAT to treat OUD.","Fairley, Michael; Humphreys, Keith; Joyce, Vilija R; Bounthavong, Mark; Trafton, Jodie; Combs, Ann; Oliva, Elizabeth M; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D; Asch, Steven M; Brandeau, Margaret L; Owens, Douglas K",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2021.0247; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787832/,434

This review describes the requirements, protocols and processes for DES in regions of Brazil. Dysphagia is a swallowing abnormality, in one or more swallowing phases, with risk and/or occurrence of aspiration, damage regarding nutrition and/or hydration and possible need of nonoral feeding methods. DES is performed in an armored room, using fluoroscopy, with the patient in lateral and anteroposterior views, in an orthostatic position. Different consistencies and volumes are tested, depending on the patient's age, complaint and clinical conditions. Its main objective is to determine if the patient can safely eat orally, is able to meet his basic nutritional and hydration needs, or if alternative means of feeding are necessary. It allows anatomical observation of structures, and the dynamics of swallowing during oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases, in real time. The DES is used worldwide for pediatric patients, from newborns to adolescents, for a complete assessment. In Brazil, the exam is the state of the art in the functional evaluation of swallowing, however it is only available to a fraction of the population, mostly in the largest, and economically developed cities, and usually restricted to major health centers and teaching hospitals. Implementing DES in healthcare units requires radiological equipment, infrastructure standards, availability and training of personnel, as well as specialized physicians, and speech-language pathologists. For these reasons, our services face daily challenges while managing long scheduling waiting lists.","Gonçalves, Maria Ines R; Lederman, Henrique M",Anatomical record,https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.24611; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33982449/,434

From other languages under validation, the Persian version finished data acquisition and underwent further validation. METHODS The Persian version of the EFAS Score was developed and validated in three stages: 1) item (question) identification (completed during initial validation study), 2) item reduction and scale exploration (completed during initial validation study), 3) confirmatory analyses and responsiveness of Persian version (completed during initial validation study in nine other languages). The data were collected pre-operatively and post-operatively at a minimum follow-up of 3 months and mean follow-up of 6 months. Item reduction, scale exploration, confirmatory analyses and responsiveness were executed using classical test theory and item response theory. RESULTS The internal consistency was confirmed in the Persian version (Cronbach's Alpha 0.82). The Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) was 0.38 and is similar to other language versions. Between baseline and follow-up, 97% of patients showed an improvement on their EFAS score, with excellent responsiveness (effect size 1.93).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of cyanoacrylates glue for polypropylene-polyvinylidene fluoride (PP-PVDF) intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) fixation in a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS In 40 New Zealand white rabbits, three pieces (3×3cm) of a PP-PVDF mesh (n=120) were fixed in IPOM technique on both sides of a midline laparotomy. For mesh fixation we used spiral tacks, nonabsorbable sutures, or cyanoacrylate glue in a randomized manner. All animals were killed after 12 wk. The prosthetic materials were excised en bloc with the anterior abdominal wall for evaluation of the tensile strength and histologic analysis. Results are presented as mean and standard deviation. RESULTS Meshes fixed with glue showed a significantly higher tenacity of adhesions (2.75±0.97) compared with those with tacks (2.44±0.97 sutures versus 1.91±0.92 tacks). The percentage of adhesions in the glue group was comparable to the suture group (36.50% ± 27.60% glue, 37.62% ± 27.36% suture). The tensile strength of stapled and sutured meshes was significantly higher than the tensile strength glued mesh (14.15±0.97N suture versus 14.84±0.74 stapler versus 9.64±0.78N glue). Mesh shrinkage was irrespective of the fixation technique. The inflammation reaction was more pronounced in the glue group. CONCLUSIONS Although cyanoacrylate glue showed a considerable cellular ingrowth in this rabbit model, sutures and tacks proved to be superior for IPOM fixation of PP-PVDF meshes in terms of tensile strength.","Ladurner, Roland; Drosse, Inga; Bürklein, Dominik; Plitz, Wolfgang; Barbaryka, Gregor; Kirchhoff, Chlodwig; Kirchhoff, Sonja; Mutschler, Wolf; Schieker, Matthias; Mussack, Thomas",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2009.11.710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20189582/,434

Although prior research works have rigorously explored the adverse effects of COVID-19 on mental health, investigations linking the impact of COVID-19 with parental stress and flourishing are very scarce. Rooted in boundary theory, the authors examined the influence of COVID-19 on flourishing and parental stress, respectively. Furthermore, predicated on spillover theory, the study explored the mediating effect of parental stress. Method: In this research, 259 IT employees in India were prospectively followed from the second week until the twentieth week of lockdown as part of a longitudinal population. A three-stage data collection method was employed. The employee completed the COVID-19 impact scale in the 2nd and 10th week of lockdown in India. Subsequently, the authors administered parental stress and flourishing surveys online in the 20th week. Results: Findings revealed that COVID-19 negatively impacted employee flourishing, via parental stress that had a partial mediating effect. Conclusion: This study is the first of its kind to theoretically and empirically investigate the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on employees' flourishing via parental stress. Based on the findings, the organizations can enhance their employees' flourishing by providing the autonomy to control their work time, and adequate training to better handle COVID-19 impact and parental stress to have better and sustainable human resources.

We investigated immunogenicity after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in kidney transplant recipients who are and are not taking belatacept. METHODS Participants were recruited between 12/9/2020 - 4/1/2021. Blood samples were collected after dose 1 and dose 2 (D1, D2), and analyzed using either an anti-SARS-CoV-2 enzyme immunoassay against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) was used to compare immunogenicity and a weighted logistics regression was used to calculate fold change of positive response. RESULTS Among the 609 participants studied, 24 (4%) were taking belatacept. After dose 1, 0/24 (0%) belatacept patients had detectable antibodies, compared to 77/568 (14%) among the equivalent nonbelatacept population (p=0.06). After dose 2, 1/19 (5%) belatacept patients had detectable antibodies, compared to 190/381 (50%) among the equivalent nonbelatacept population (p<0.001). Belatacept use was associated with 16.7-fold lower odds of having a positive post-D2 titer result (p <0.01). CONCLUSIONS Additional measures need to be explored in order to protect kidney transplant recipients taking belatacept. Best safety practices should be continued despite vaccination among this population.","Ou, Michael T; Boyarsky, Brian J; Chiang, Teresa P Y; Bae, Sunjae; Werbel, William A; Avery, Robin K; Tobian, Aaron A R; Massie, Allan B; Segev, Dorry L; Garonzik-Wang, Jacqueline M",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003824; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34028386/,434

BACKGROUND SG is a widely used bariatric operation leading to weight loss and early improvement of patient's metabolic profile. Current data indicate faster postoperative gastric emptying, but detailed studies on alterations in small bowel motility are missing. DESIGN We evaluated 21 morbidly obese patients who underwent laparoscopic SG before and 4 months after the procedure. After consumption of a semisolid radiolabeled meal, their gastric and intestinal transit times were studied with a gamma camera. Particularly the times of 10% gastric emptying, 50% gastric emptying, maximal intestinal filling, 10% terminal ileum filling, duodenal to terminal ileum transit, cecal filling initiation, and ileocecal valve transit (T ICVt) were studied pre- and postoperatively. RESULTS Ten percent gastric emptying and 50% gastric emptying were decreased postoperatively as well as maximal intestinal filling, indicating faster gastric emptying and intestinal filling. Duodenal to terminal ileum transit and 10% terminal ileum filling also decreased as small bowel transit time accelerated and the meal reached the terminal ileum more rapidly. Contrary opening of the ileocecal valve and food transit through it were delayed, with postoperative increase in cecal filling initiation and T ICVt, respectively. CONCLUSIONS SG accelerates gastric emptying and small bowel transit of semisolids. In addition, it delays the initiation of cecal filling and T ICVt. This early and prolonged contact of food with the distal small bowel mucosa may explain the metabolic effects of SG occurring before substantial weight loss.","Melissas, John; Leventi, Aikaterini; Klinaki, Ifigeneia; Perisinakis, Kostas; Koukouraki, Sophia; de Bree, Eelco; Karkavitsas, Nikolaos",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3182774522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23160151/,434
159746,The functional health status of children with cerebral palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic stay-at-home period: a parental perspective.,2021,"The type I IFN-mediated immune response is the first line of antiviral defence. Coronaviruses, like many other viruses, have evolved mechanisms to evade this innate response, ensuring their survival. Several coronavirus accessory genes play a central role in these pathways, but for feline coronaviruses this has never to our knowledge been studied. As it has been demonstrated previously that ORF7 is essential for efficient replication in vitro and virulence in vivo of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the role of this ORF in the evasion of the IFN-α antiviral response was investigated. Deletion of ORF7 from FIPV strain 79-1146 (FIPV-Δ7) rendered the virus more susceptible to IFN-α treatment. Given that ORF7 encodes two proteins, 7a and 7b, it was further explored which of these proteins is active in this mechanism. Providing 7a protein in trans rescued the mutant FIPV-Δ7 from IFN sensitivity, which was not achieved by addition of 7b protein. Nevertheless, addition of protein 7a to FIPV-Δ3Δ7, a FIPV mutant deleted in both ORF3 and ORF7, could no longer increase the replication capacity of this mutant in the presence of IFN. These results indicate that FIPV 7a protein is a type I IFN antagonist and protects the virus from the antiviral state induced by IFN, but it needs the presence of ORF3-encoded proteins to exert its antagonistic function.","Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Olyslaegers, Dominique A J; Desmarets, Lowiese M B; Roukaerts, Inge D M; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Nauwynck, Hans J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.058743-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24189622/,434

Evidence from changes in five key pollutants in nine Chinese cities most affected by the COVID-19.,2021-04-01,"Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a subtype of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) diseases. The underlying mechanism of these life-threatening disorders is impaired granule-mediated cytotoxicity exerted by natural killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes. This function is meant for elimination of virus-infected cells, malignant cells and to prevent exaggerated immune responses. The normal outcome after an attack by NK or cytotoxic T cells is apoptosis of the target cell. This prevents cytotoxic inflammatory responses in adjacent tissues which occur after lytic cell death. Extensive cell lysis can even produce a cytokine storm, as evidenced in MAS. Programmed proinflammatory lytic cell death, pyroptosis, caused by activated inflammasomes is central in the pathogenesis of MAS. Pyroptosis mediates IL-18 cytokine release, which robustly stimulates NK and T cells to produce IFN-γ, the key macrophage-activating signal which initiates a burst of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lytic cell death also mediates a discharge of the prototype alarmin high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1), a proinflammatory molecule present in all cells and that mediates the pathogenesis of MAS as outlined here. Therapeutic options to control causal factors operating in the pathogenesis of MAS are also discussed.","Andersson, Ulf",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15900; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33934408/,434

The risks and outcomes involved need to be better understood prior to their widespread application. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility of minimally invasive donor hepatectomy by reviewing our experience. A total of 99 living donor liver transplantations performed between 2000 and 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. All 99 living liver donors underwent right hepatectomy. The breakdown of the techniques is as follows: the standard technique in 33 patients; the laparoscopic-assisted minilaparotomy technique (hybrid technique group) in 19 patients; and the upper midline incision technique without laparoscopic assistance (minilaparotomy group) in 47 patients. An association between donor operative outcomes and body habitus, such as body mass index (BMI), abdominal truncal depth (approximated by celiac axis [CA] depth ratio), and umbilical circumference (UC) were assessed. Perioperative factors were compared between the standard technique and the minimally invasive technique. The minilaparotomy group had significantly shorter operative time (P = 0.046) and hospital stay (P = 0.005) than the standard technique group. Postoperative complication rates were similar between the 3 groups (P = 0.16). In the minilaparotomy group, greater BMI (P = 0.02), CA depth ratio (P = 0.04), and UC (P = 0.004) were found to be risk factors for postoperative complications. In the minilaparotomy group, CA depth ratio > 0.41, UC > 90 cm, and BMI > 30 kg/m2 were significantly associated with longer operative time and hospital stay. In the standard technique group, none of the body size factors were associated with postoperative outcomes. In conclusion, the minilaparotomy technique is safe and feasible, though technical difficulties may be encountered when performed on donors with larger body habitus.

That framework remains valuable for understanding contagious disease in early modernity by helping to highlight the structure of responses to epidemics. So-called ""Jail Fever"" outbreaks are especially instructive, in part because the most notorious of these epidemics were small affairs when compared to the larger pandemics that Rosenberg explored. Considering that they accounted for relatively few deaths, historians must answer why they caused such a stir. Whereas the raw body count often drives development of narratives about epidemics, eighteenth-century typhus epidemics often hinged more on who died and where than how many. Typhus ravaged poor and working class communities throughout the period. However, even significant spikes in mortality occurring in poor neighborhoods often failed to trigger proclamations of epidemics. Some deaths mattered more than others in this regard, suggesting that qualitative criteria may have played a greater role than quantitative criteria when it came to identifying which events registered as epidemics in the eighteenth century.","Siena, Kevin",Bulletin of the history of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1353/bhm.2020.0084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775941/,434

METHODS This prospective clinical trial enrolled patients with recurrent intermediate uveitis who exhibited minimal improvement of visual acuity, despite injections of periocular steroids. Twenty patients were randomized to the pars plana vitrectomy group or oral steroid and cyclosporine-A group (10 eyes of 10 patients per group). Follow-up was performed for 24 months to study changes in visual acuity, binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography findings. RESULTS Visual acuity (logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution) significantly improved from 0.71 to 0.42 (p=0.001) in the surgical group, whereas it improved from 0.68 to 0.43 (p=0.001) in the immune modulator therapy group. Seven patients (70%) in the surgical group gained ≥2 lines, and six patients (60%) in the immune modulator therapy group gained ≥2 lines (p=0.970). Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography studies showed that six of seven pars plana vitrectomy patients who had cystoid macular edema experienced improvement, whereas two patients with diffuse macular edema did not experience improvement. In the immune modulator therapy group, three of six patients with cystoid macular edema did not experience improvement, whereas two patients with diffuse macular edema experienced improvement. CONCLUSIONS Pars plana vitrectomy and immune modulator therapy resulted in significant improvement in visual function in patients with persistent inflammation secondary to chronic intermediate uveitis. Despite this success, there remains a need for the determination of optimal indications for the use of each modality. Immune modulator therapy was successful for the treatment of diffuse macular edema associated with chronic intermediate uveitis, whereas pars plana vitrectomy was not.","Shalaby, Osama; Saeed, Ahmed; Elmohamady, Mohamed Nagy",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,https://doi.org/10.5935/0004-2749.20200079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084818/,434

OBJECTIVE Investigate if auditory loss occurs in horses treated using the recommended IV daily dosage of gentamicin for 7 consecutive days. ANIMALS Ten healthy adult horses (7-15 years; females and males, 5 each). METHODS Prospective study. Physical and neurological examinations and renal function tests were performed. Gentamicin sulfate was administered at a dosage of 6.6 mg/kg via the jugular vein on alternating sides for 7 days. Gentamicin peak and trough concentrations were measured. Horses were sedated using detomidine hydrochloride IV to perform brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAER) before the first dose, immediately after the last dose, and 30 days after the last dose. Peaks latencies, amplitudes, and amplitude ratios were recorded. Data from the second and last BAER were compared to results at baseline. Bone conduction was performed to rule out conduction disorders. RESULTS Seven horses had auditory loss: complete bilateral (N = 1), complete unilateral (N = 2), and partial unilateral (N = 4). Based on physical examination and BAER results, sensorineural auditory loss was suspected. Absent bone conduction ruled out a conduction disorder and further supported sensorineural auditory loss in horses with completely absent BAER. Auditory dysfunction was reversible in 4 of 7 horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Gentamicin at recommended doses may cause sensorineural auditory loss in horses that might be irreversible. Follow-up studies are needed to investigate if other dosing protocols present a similar risk.","Aleman, Monica R; True, Alexander; Scalco, Rebeca; Crowe, Chelsea M; Costa, Lais R R; Chigerwe, Munashe",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.16221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322916/,434
162745,"Implicit, Intrinsic, Extrinsic (or Environmental), and Host Factors Attributing the Covid-19 Pandemic. Part 2- Implicit Factor Pesticide Use: A Systematic Analysis",2021-09-14,"HIF1 (Hypoxia-inducible Factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the hypoxia stress response. However, chronic hypoxia exposure can cause irreversible physiological changes that can lead to pulmonary hypertension (PH), and the need for therapeutics to ameliorate these conditions is great and unmet. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that CPEB2 (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 2) is a translational repressor of one of the HIF1 subunits: HIF1α. Our lab demonstrated that the alternatively spliced CPEB2A isoform of CPEB2 is a repressor of translation, while the CPEB2B isoform is a translational activator of HIF1α during hypoxia, suggesting a major regulatory role for CPEB2 AS in the pulmonary hypoxic response. Although it is well established that during hypoxia, HIF1α levels are dramatically upregulated due to a decrease in the degradation of this factor, we propose that during chronic hypoxia, the expression of HIF1α is maintained via a translational mechanism, likely alongside a decrease in proteolytic degradation. In this study we demonstrate that depletion of the CPEB2B splice isoform has an inhibitory effect on the translation of nascent HIF1α protein during chronic hypoxia, but not the acute phase. We further demonstrate this pathway is dependent on the initiation factor eIF3H. Finally, we show data that indicate CPEB2A and CPEB2B bind differentially to cytoplasmic polyadenylation element consensus sequences depending on the surrounding sequence context. These findings are important since they provide evidence for the potential of CPEB2 to act as a therapeutic target for treating chronic hypoxia-related pulmonary diseases.","Mayo, Emily M.; Stevens, Shaun C.; Ali, Anika N.; Moss, Christina J.; Lund, Sean P.; Nazario-Muñoz, Gina S.; Permuth, Jennifer B.; Westerheide, Sandy D.; Chalfant, Charles E.; Park, Margaret A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.05.325290,434

Design Clinical vignettes study. Setting 200 clinical vignettes representing real-world scenarios in primary care. Intervention/comparator Condition coverage, suggested condition accuracy, and urgency advice performance was measured against the vignettes' gold-standard diagnoses and triage level. Primary outcome measures Outcomes included (i) proportion of conditions 'covered' by an app, i.e. not excluded because the patient was too young/old, pregnant, or comorbid, (ii) proportion of vignettes in which the correct primary diagnosis was amongst the top 3 conditions suggested, and, (iii) proportion of 'safe' urgency level advice (i.e. at gold standard level, more conservative, or no more than one level less conservative). Results Condition-suggestion coverage was highly variable, with some apps not offering a suggestion for many users: in alphabetical order, Ada: 99.0%; Babylon: 51.5%; Buoy: 88.5%; K Health: 74.5%; Mediktor: 80.5%; Symptomate: 61.5%; Your.MD: 64.5%. The top-3 suggestion accuracy (M3) of GPs was on average 82.1{+/-}5.2%. For the apps it was - Ada: 70.5%; Babylon: 32.0%; Buoy: 43.0%; K Health: 36.0%; Mediktor: 36.0%; Symptomate: 27.5%; WebMD: 35.5%; Your.MD: 23.5%. Some apps exclude certain user groups (e.g. younger users) or certain conditions - for these apps condition-suggestion performance is generally greater with exclusion of these vignettes. For safe urgency advice, tested GPs had an average of 97.0{+/-}2.5%. For the vignettes with advice provided, only three apps had safety performance within 1 S.D. of the GPs (mean) - Ada: 97.0%; Babylon: 95.1%; Symptomate: 97.8%. One app had a safety performance within 2 S.D.s of GPs - Your.MD: 92.6%. Three apps had a safety performance outside 2 S.D.s of GPs - Buoy: 80.0% (p< 0.001); K Health: 81.3% (p< 0.001); Mediktor: 87.3% (p=1.3x10-3). Conclusions The utility of digital symptom assessment apps relies upon coverage, accuracy, and safety. While no digital tool outperformed GPs, some came close, and the nature of iterative improvements to software offers scalable improvements to care.","Gilbert, S.; Mehl, A.; Baluch, A.; Cawley, C.; Challiner, J.; Fraser, H.; Millen, E.; Multmeier, J.; Pick, F.; Richter, C.; Tuerk, E.; Upadhyay, S.; Virani, V.; Vona, N.; Wicks, P.; Novorol, C.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20093872v1?rss=1,434

To achieve these critical objectives, however, they need to be financially sustainable, which is threatened by the current economic and financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective of this paper is to review the determinants of financial sustainability of microfinance institutions with a view to drawing lessons for Islamic microfinance banks in Nigeria. The paper utilized the literature review methodology to synthesize research findings in the area. The review revealed that the major determinants of financial sustainability of microfinance institutions are the capital structure, asset size, and financial innovation. Others are good risk management and corporate governance frameworks. The paper thus recommended that Islamic microfinance institutions in Nigeria should maintain a robust capital structure that relies more on equity, a lean but diversified Board, and utilize more technology-based services. Most importantly, they should emphasize profit and loss sharing principles in their operations.","Abdullahi, A.; Othman, A. H.

164487,Tweeting the Alarm: Exploring the Efficacy of Twitter as a Serial Transmitter during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: The goal of this systematic review is to assess the published literature for seizure risk with chloroquine therapy in persons with and without epilepsy. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a desperate need for therapy against the SARS CoV-2 virus. Chloroquine is one proposed medication that has received substantial public attention. However, drug labeling in the package insertion states that persons with epilepsy have the risk of chloroquine provoking seizures, and this has increased questions and anxiety in the epilepsy community. Methods: PubMed (1970 to March 27, 2020) and the Embase (1970 to March 27, 2020) were searched with the terms chloroquine and seizure or epilepsy. Selected studies were reviewed, and the adverse drug reaction was classified. Results: Only nine out of 27 studies were deemed eligible for systematic analysis. Out of the nine studies, only one was a prospective study (N=109), two were case series (N=6), and the remaining 6 were case reports. The dose of chloroquine ranged between 100-500 mg/day, except in one patient, the seizure was after taking 1000 mg. The strength of causality for the drug causing seizures in healthy and persons with epilepsy was mostly possible or unlikely, and none were certain. The only clinical trial that evaluated seizure risk with chloroquine failed to find any significant relation. Conclusion: Although the drug insertion label states an increased risk of seizure, the systematic review highlights that such a statement is not supported by any class I studies but by anecdotal case reports. The only randomized clinical study revealed that seizures were not associated with an increased blood level of chloroquine or its metabolite. The present systematic review should provide reassurance to busy clinicians and persons with epilepsy that chloroquine, if prescribed to treat COVID-19, lacks any substantial evidence to suggest that the medication increases the risk of seizure.","Pati, S.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.09.20056358v1?rss=1,434

Network inference from transcriptional time series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance but additionally infers whether the causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time series data of 2, 768 differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2, 768 genes and 31, 945 directed edges (FDR ≤ 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project.

Nicotine transferred well to aerosols irrespective of topography; however, transfer efficiencies of flavor chemicals depended on the chemical, puff volume, puff duration, pump head, and EC power. Participants could be classified as “mouth inhalers” or “lung inhalers” based on their retention and exhale of flavor chemicals and nicotine. Only mouth inhalers exhaled sufficient concentrations of flavor chemicals and nicotine to contribute to chemical deposition on environmental surfaces.

Contact patterns between age groups and patches are key parameters in such models. Arenas et al. (2020) develop an approach to simulate contact patterns associated with recurrent mobility between patches, such as due to work, school, and other regular travel. Using their approach, mixing between patches is greater than mobility data alone would suggest, because individuals from patches A and B can form a contact if they meet in patch C. We build upon their approach to address three potential gaps that remain. First, our approach includes a distribution of contacts by age that is responsive to underlying age distribution of the mixing pool. Second, different age distributions by contact type are also maintained in our approach, such that changes to the numbers of different types of contacts are appropriately reflected in changes to the overall age mixing patterns. Finally, we introduce and distinguish between two mixing pools associated with each patch, with possible implications for the overall connectivity of the population: the home pool, in which contacts can only be formed with other individuals residing in the same patch; and the travel pool, in which contacts can be formed with some residents of, and any other visitors to the patch.

The remaining two techniques use a separable spatio-temporal filter to reduce interactions between dissimilar regions, hence mitigating artifacts. In order to deal with non-registered datasets we combine all our extensions with robust optical flow computation. Two of our proposed multi-frame filters outperform existing extensions on most occasions by a significant margin while also being competitive with a state-of-the-art neural network-based technique.

Tragically, many of those technologies, despite legal requirements to the contrary, are inaccessible to disabled youth—a pattern of oppression within compulsory education that predates the pandemic by almost two decades and is rooted in ableism. In this paper, I advance a new interdisciplinary framework—Accessibility4Equity (A4E)—that integrates existing single‐discipline theories to explain the messy interactions among human and non‐human actors engaged in learning that is equitable and accessible to disabled youth within the context of compulsory education. A4E asserts that equitable technology‐mediated education is (1) constructed by educators and disabled people collaboratively cripping discourse and practice through sociotechnical praxis, (2) born technologically and pedagogically accessible;and (3) requires institutions to have the capacity to cultivate access intimacy and swiftly respond to individual needs. Hence, A4E is a framework that scholars and practitioners can use to begin the complex social change that is required to disrupt the unjust status quo and reimagine technology‐mediated compulsory education as a place that values and is hospitable to disabled youth.

167309,COVID-19 Pandemic: Tapping opportunities in the face of adversity,2021,"Covid-19 is (in) a class of its own in its influence on human lives and livelihoods globally, precipitating steep learning and psychological well-being curves for university teachers and students. This has impacted dramatically on the conditions under which higher education has had to function in regard to research and what is now referred to as ‘emergency online education’. As staff face unprecedented challenges, so too do students. Given that the consequences of these times are likely to be felt well into the future, it is important to capture what is happening now. We therefore present this perspective piece comprising 13 musings co-authored by students and educators regarding our experiences of two lockdowns within Aotearoa New Zealand in 2020 representative of the disrupted university in its adjustment to learning and teaching. In contributing to calls to develop a post-pandemic pedagogy for higher education, and better support staff and student well-being, we draw on methods that would multiply questions and invoke possibilities, as an impetus for reimagining higher education. Making use of a cogenerative dialoguing process, these musings enable multiple voices to be heard and considered. A non-representational lens enables us to explore the what and how of Covid-19 creating disruption and uncertainty for students’ and educators, influencing their psychological well-being and higher education pedagogy and practices, and becoming a contextually relevant taonga (treasure) of experiences that might inform future educational activities. © Copyright © 2021 Trafford, Haxell, Lau, Carlson, Rebelo da Silva, Hart, De Freitas and Rope.","Trafford, J.; Haxell, A.; Lau, K.; Carlson, G.; Rebelo da Silva, A.

168264,Medical support of mass events during the COVID-19 pandemic: Problems and possible ways of their solution,2021,"Virus infection necessarily requires redirecting cellular resources towards viral progeny production. Adenovirus encodes the histone-like protein VII that causes catastrophic global reorganization of host chromatin to promote virus infection. Protein VII recruits the family of high mobility group box (HMGB) proteins to chromatin along with the histone chaperone SET. As a consequence of this recruitment, we find that protein VII causes chromatin-depletion of several linker histone H1 isoforms. The relationship between linker histone H1 and the functionally opposite HMGB proteins is critical for higher order chromatin structure. However, the physiological consequences of perturbing this relationship are largely unknown. Here, we employ complementary systems in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells to demonstrate that adenovirus protein VII disrupts the H1-HMGB balance to obstruct the cell cycle. We find that protein VII causes an accumulation of G2/M cells both in yeast and human systems, underscoring the high conservation of this chromatin vulnerability. In contrast, adenovirus E1A and E1B proteins are well-established to override cell cycle regulation and promote transformation of human cells. Strikingly, we find that protein VII obstructs the cell cycle even in the presence of E1A and E1B, suggesting that protein VII-directed cell cycle disruption ensures host resources are directed towards viral proliferation during infection.

In 186,527 individuals, we found significant boosting of anti-spike IgG by second doses of both vaccines in all ages and using different dosing intervals, including the 3-week interval for BNT162b2. After second vaccination, BNT162b2 generated higher peak levels than ChAdOX1. Antibody levels declined faster at older ages than younger ages with BNT162b2, but were similar across ages with ChAdOX1. With both vaccines, prior infection significantly increased antibody peak level and half-life. Protection was estimated to last for 0.5-1 year after ChAdOx1 and >1 year after BNT162b2, but could be reduced against emerging variants. Reducing the dosing interval to 8 weeks for both vaccines or further to 3 weeks for BNT162b2 may help increase short-term protection against the Delta variant. A third booster dose may be needed, prioritised to more vulnerable people.","Wei, J.; Pouwels, K. B.; Stoesser, N.; Matthews, P. C.; Diamond, I.; Studley, R.; Rourke, E.; Cook, D.; Bell, J.

We aimed to assess the differences between COVID-19 and other influenza like illnesses in disease burden brought by isolation. We conducted an online questionnaire survey of 302 people who had COVID-19 or other influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) and compared the burden of isolation due to sickness with one-to-one propensity score matching. The primary outcomes are the duration and productivity losses of isolation, the secondary outcome is quality of life (QOL) valuation on the day of the survey. Acute symptoms of outpatient COVID-19 and other ILIs lasted 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 9-32) and 7 (IQR 4-10) days, respectively. The length of isolation due to COVID-19 was 18 (IQR 10-33) days and that due to other ILIs was 7 (IQR 4-11) days, respectively. The monetary productivity loss of isolation due to COVID-19 was 1424.3 (IQR 825.6-2545.5) USD and that due to other ILIs was 606.1 (IQR 297.0-1090.9) USD, respectively. QOL at the time of the survey was lower in the COVID-19 group than in the other ILIs group (0.89 and 0.96, p = 0.001). COVID-19 infection imposes a substantial disease burden, even in patients with non-severe disease. This burden is larger for COVID-19 than other ILIs, mainly because the required isolation period is longer.","Tsuzuki, S.; Ohmagari, N.; Beutels, P.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.19.21262267v1?rss=1,434
168898,"Paquitop.arm, a Mobile Manipulator for Assessing Emerging Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic Scenario",2021,"A three-dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulation is combined with a laboratory study to describe the turbulent flow in an enclosed annular rotor-stator cavity characterized by a large aspect ratio G=(b-a)/h=18.32 and a small radius ratio a/b=0.152, where a and b are the inner and outer radii of the rotating disk and h is the interdisk spacing. The rotation rate Omega under consideration is equivalent to the rotational Reynolds number Re=Omegab2/nu=9.5 x 104, where nu is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. This corresponds to a value at which an experiment carried out at the laboratory has shown that the stator boundary layer is turbulent, whereas the rotor boundary layer is still laminar. Comparisons of the 3D computed solution with velocity measurements have given good agreement for the mean and turbulent fields. The results enhance evidence of weak turbulence at this Reynolds number, by comparing the turbulence properties with available data in the literature. An approximately self-similar boundary layer behavior is observed along the stator side. The reduction of the structural parameter a1 under the typical value 0.15 and the variation in the wall-normal direction of the different characteristic angles show that this boundary layer is three-dimensional. A quadrant analysis of conditionally averaged velocities is performed to identify the contributions of different events (ejections and sweeps) on the Reynolds shear stress producing vortical structures. The asymmetries observed in the conditionally averaged quadrant analysis are dominated by Reynolds stress-producing events in this B\""{o}dewadt layer. Moreover, case 1 vortices (with a positive wall induced velocity) are found to be the major source of generation of special strong events, in agreement with the conclusions of Lygren and Andersson.","Randriamampianina, Anthony; Poncet, S'ebastien",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0607097v1.pdf,434
168923,Changes of Work Environments and Adaptations of Japanese Sales and Marketing Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk from nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from virus laden aerosols. This study aimed to: 1) quantify the degree of protection from virus aerosol provided by different types of mask (surgical, N95, fit-tested N95) and personal protective equipment (PPE); 2) determine if the use of a portable HEPA filter can enhance the effectiveness of PPE; 3) determine the effectiveness of a decontamination shower to remove virus aerosol contamination of a HCW. Methods: Virus aerosol exposure experiments were conducted using bacteriophage PhiX174 (10^8 copies/mL). A HCW wearing PPE (mask, gloves, gown, faceshield) was exposed to nebulised viruses for 40mins in a sealed clinical room. After exiting, the HCW doffed PPE. Virus exposure was quantified via skin swabs applied to the face and nostrils, forearms, neck, and forehead. Experiments were performed with and without the presence of a portable HEPA filter (set to 470m3/hr). Findings: Swabs quantified significant virus exposure under the surgical and N95 mask. Only the fit-tested N95 resulted in lower virus counts compared to no mask control (p=0.027). Nasal swabs demonstrated very high virus exposure, which was not mitigated by the surgical or N95 masks, although there was a trend for the fit-tested N95 mask to reduce virus counts (p=0.058). The addition of HEPA filtration substantially reduced virus counts from all swab sites, and to near zero levels when combined with a fit-tested N95 mask, gloves, gown and faces shield. Virus counts were substantially reduced to near zero levels following a shower. Interpretation: These data demonstrate that quantitatively fit tested N95 masks combined with a HEPA filter can offer protection against high virus aerosol loads at close range and for prolonged periods of time. Skin contamination from virus aerosol can be effectively by removed by showering. Funding: Epworth Hospital Capacity Building Research Grant ID: EH2020-654","Landry, S. A.; Subedi, D.; Barr, J.

169239,Difficult lung separation. An insight into the challenges faced during COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Background Despite robust efforts, patients and staff acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitals. In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated whether whole-genome sequencing (WGS) could enhance the epidemiological investigation of healthcare-associated SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. Methods and findings From 17-November-2020 to 5-January-2021, 803 inpatients and 329 staff were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection across four teaching hospitals in Oxfordshire, UK. We classified cases according to epidemiological definitions, sought epidemiological evidence of a potential source for each nosocomial infection, and evaluated if epidemiologically-linked cases had genomic evidence supporting transmission. We compared epidemiological and genomic outbreak identification. Using national epidemiological definitions, 109/803(14%) inpatient infections were classified as definite/probable nosocomial, 615(77%) as community-acquired and 79(10%) as indeterminate. There was strong epidemiological evidence to support definite/probable cases as nosocomial: 107/109(98%) had a prior-negative PCR in the same hospital stay before testing positive, and 101(93%) shared time and space with known infected patients/staff. Many indeterminate cases were likely infected in hospital: 53/79(67%) had a prior-negative PCR and 75(95%) contact with a potential source. 89/615(11% of all 803 patients) with apparent community-onset had a recent hospital exposure. WGS highlighted SARS-CoV-2 is mainly imported into hospitals: within 764 samples sequenced 607 genomic clusters were identified (>1 SNP distinct). Only 43/607(7%) clusters contained evidence of onward transmission (subsequent cases within 1 SNP). 20/21 epidemiologically-identified outbreaks contained multiple genomic introductions. Most (80%) nosocomial acquisition occurred in rapid super-spreading events in settings with a mix of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Hospitals not routinely admitting COVID-19 patients had low rates of transmission. Undiagnosed/unsequenced individuals prevent genomic data from excluding nosocomial acquisition. Conclusions Our findings suggest current surveillance definitions underestimate nosocomial acquisition and reveal most nosocomial transmission occurs from a relatively limited number of highly infectious individuals.","Lumley, S.

Higher education learning experts believe that learning and working at a distance mode especially in the pandemic disruption is greatly assisted by developing research skills application. This paper has reviewed many scientific publications of the RSD framework and other research-based learning literature to gain a better perspective and understanding to prove this assumption. With the existing research evidence from seven publication materials we could say that the evidence from the research skill development frameworks publications and advantages are constructive for academic and students in universities where the involvement of rich research skills is very high and specific as they now are working in the remote system during the crisis of infected pandemic. Therefore, we highly recommend academicians students in the higher education environment.

Recently, the spread of COVID-19 increased people's reliance on their smartphones, and the resulting lockdown revealed them engaging in a variety of pro-social or virtue-based behaviours. Using the extended self-theory, previous research examined the effects of objects on the human mind and cognitive behaviour in order to identify behavioural segments in smartphone markets. Subsequently, scholars examined smartphone-based (iPhone vs. Android) virtue traits such as honesty and humility. However, other virtues such as compassion and altruism have received little attention in this regard. Thus, this study aims to bridge this gap by analysing the predictability of consumers' compassion and altruism in relation to their smartphone type (iPhone vs Android) and usage. A total of 509 completed questionnaires were received from participants in the United States, Europe, and Asia. According to the findings, iPhone users are more compassionate and altruistic than Android users.

The focus was on African Independent Television (AIT), a privately owned TV, and Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), a government-owned TV. We also interviewed (n = 30) participants to understand their view on media coverage of the pandemic. We found that the TV stations paid adequate attention to the issues of COVID-19. However, the private media allocated more prominence to the coverage of COVID-19. By implication, the private media had more COVID-19 stories telecasted on its headline which also appeared as the first headline in many cases. Furthermore, they had more stories that were aired 61 seconds and above. The findings also showed that the government media outlet cited more of government officials while the private media dueled more on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The private media had more negative tone stories, and most of its stories used visual and motion footages. Overall, our findings suggest that media ownership and politics play a large role in the coverage of COVID-19 in Nigeria. This has affected the attitude of the public as many of them no longer see the pandemic as something serious, but rather politically motivated virus to highlight the failings of the political party in power. © The Author(s) 2021.","Apuke, O.

We have previously presented a classifier of a serious game for mobile platforms that allows children to practice their isolated sibilants exercises at home to correct sibilant distortions, which was further motivated by the Covid-19 pandemic present at the time this article is posted. Since the current classifier reached an accuracy of over 95%, we conducted a study on the ongoing issues for deploying the game. Such issues include pruning and optimization of the current classifier to ensure near real-time classifications and silence detection to prevent sending silence segment requests to the classifier. To analyze if the classification is done in a tolerable amount of time, several requests were done to the server with pre-defined time intervals and the interval of time between the request and response was recorded.

Firstly, Japanese teacher education and the ICT environment in schools are summarized. In addition, the Japanese concept of “teachers who continue to learn” and its multidimensional character is explained. Secondly, a model of the above idea that consists of five dimensions is introduced: (1) social navigators, (2) technical experts, (3) inquiry practitioners, (4) critical practitioners, and (5) members of professional learning communities. Thirdly, through the review, it is pointed out that all of them are affected by the digitization of the educational environment, which has been accelerated as a countermeasure to COVID-19.

In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as MAVS, RIG-I, and MDA5 mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in Caenorhabditis elegans activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of eol-1 requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form dsRNA, as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses.

In particular, in the first months of the global health emergency, a drastic reduction in the number of access to healthcare system has been recorded. In the “Phase 1” of the emergency, the fear for the contagion, the strict containment measures and the lack of adequate information regarding the virus have been listed as possible factors contributing to this phenomenon. In the “Phase 2”, mental health care has been completely reorganized in order to compile with requirements for physical distancing and reducing overcrowding. The visits in outpatients’ units have been rescheduled, healthcare professionals have received information regarding the adequate use of protective personal equipment and patients have learnt how to protect themselves. Furthermore, telemental health approaches have been fostered worldwide, although several obstacles still persist such as the lack of adequate training for healthcare professionals for using telemental health instruments, the uncertainties regarding the legal implications of telemental health and the difficulties for older patients to access those systems.

To study the nature of gaze during visually-guided navigation, we tasked humans to navigate to transiently visible goals in virtual mazes of varying complexity, observing that they took near-optimal trajectories in all arenas. By analyzing subjects’ eye movements, we gained insights into the principles of active sensing and planning. The spatial distribution of gaze revealed that environmental complexity mediated a striking trade-off in the extent to which attention was directed towards two complimentary aspects of the world model: reward location and task-relevant transitions. The temporal evolution of gaze revealed rapid, sequential prospection of the future path, evocative of neural ‘preplay’.

173080,The First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: HEXACO Profiles Affect Coping Mechanisms and Adaptability of Response,2021,"Background: Since the beginning of the COVID19 outbreak, the Veneto Oncology Network ROV licensed dedicated guidelines for cancer patients care during the pandemic, and developed a regional registry (ROVID) aimed at describing epidemiology and clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients. Preliminary data on 170 patients mainly diagnosed during the first pandemic wave have been published (Guarneri V, Eur J Cancer 2021). Here we report the data of additional 270 patients, comparing clinical data and outcomes between first (W1) and second (W2) pandemic waves. Methods: All patients with cancer diagnosis and documented SARS-CoV-2 infection are eligible. Data on diagnosis, comorbidities, anticancer treatments, details on SARS-CoV-infection including source of contagion, clinical presentation, hospitalization, treatments and fate of the infection are recorded. Results: 440 patients have been enrolled, 196 diagnosed during W1 (until September 2020) and 244 during W2. The most common cancer type was breast cancer (n = 116). Significant differences in clinical characteristics between W1 and W2 were the followings: ECOG PS 0 (34% vs 58%), presence of cardiac comorbidities (30% vs 13%), presence of any co-morbidities (81% vs 62%), smoking habits (23% vs 13%). Patients diagnosed in W1 were less likely on active anticancer therapy (54% vs 73%) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Distribution per stage, presence of lung metastases, disease setting (curative vs palliative), active treatment discontinuation due to infection were similar between W1 and W2. Patients diagnosed in W1 were more likely symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2 infection (80% vs 67%), and reported more frequently an inhospital contact as potential source of infection (44% vs 9%). Significantly more patients diagnosed in W1 were hospitalized (76% vs 25%). All-cause mortality rates were 30.6% for patients diagnosed in W1 vs 12% for patients diagnosed in W2 (p < 0.001). However, deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 infection were more frequent in patients diagnosed in W2 (86% vs 54%, odds ratio 3.22;95% CI 1.97-5.279). Conclusions: Differences in clinical characteristics between W1 and W2 reflect different pattern of virus circulation. The dramatic reduction of in-hospital contact as a source of infection reflects the efforts put in place to protect this vulnerable population from in-hospital exposure. The lower all-cause mortality rate observed in W2 is in line with the observed less frail population. However, the higher relative risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in W2 reinforces the need to adopt protective measures including vaccination in cancer patients, irrespectively of age, stage, and comorbidities.","Guarneri, V.; Caccese, M.; Azzarello, G.; Bassan, F.; Chiarion-Sileni, V.; Chiari, R.; Favaretto, A.

Hence, it was not unreasonable to expect the referral of pregnant women in all trimesters. Since respiratory illnesses can increase the risk of infectious diseases and maternal mortality, it is justifiable to consider COVID-19-positive cases as high-risk pregnancies. Case presentation: The present study introduced six pregnant women with COVID-19 and discussed the points to consider in managing these patients. Conclusions: Pregnant women are at increased risk in all epidemics of infectious diseases due to their physiological and immunological changes.

174730,Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous ANN Algorithm-Based Predicting of COVID-19 Pandemic in Tamil Nadu,2022,"Itaconate is a dicarboxylic acid that inhibits the isocitrate lyase enzyme of the bacterial glyoxylate shunt. Activated macrophages have been shown to produce itaconate, suggesting that these immune cells may employ this metabolite as a weapon against invading bacteria. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, itaconate can exhibit bactericidal effects under acidic conditions similar to the pH of a macrophage phagosome. In parallel, successful pathogens including Salmonella have acquired a genetic operon encoding itaconate degradation proteins, which are induced heavily in macrophages. We characterize the regulation of this operon by the neighbouring gene, ripR, in specific response to itaconate. Moreover, we develop an itaconate biosensor based on the operon promoter that can detect itaconate in a semi-quantitative manner and, when combined with the ripR gene, is sufficient for itaconate-regulated expression in E. coli. Using this biosensor with fluorescence microscopy, we observe bacteria responding to itaconate in the phagosomes of macrophage and provide additional evidence that interferon-γ stimulates macrophage itaconate synthesis and that J774 mouse macrophages produce substantially more itaconate than the human THP-1 monocyte cell line. In summary, we examine the role of itaconate as an antibacterial metabolite in mouse and human macrophage, characterize the regulation of Salmonella’s defense against it, and develop it as a convenient itaconate biosensor and inducible promoter system. Importance In response to invading bacteria, immune cells can produce a molecule called itaconate, which can inhibit microbial metabolism. Here we show that itaconate can also directly kill Salmonella when combined with moderate acidity, further supporting itaconate’s role as an antibacterial weapon. We also discover how Salmonella recognizes itaconate and activates a defense to degrade it, and we harness this response to make a biosensor that detects the presence of itaconate. This biosensor is versatile, working in Salmonella enterica or lab strains of Escherichia coli, and can detect itaconate quantitatively in the environment and in immune cells. By understanding how immune cells kill bacteria and how the microbes defend themselves, we can better develop novel antibiotics to inhibit pathogens such as Salmonella.","Hersch, Steven J.; Navarre, William Wiley",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/648865,434
174882,Effects of the Covid-19 Pandemic Estimated in the Financial Statements and the Auditor's Report,2021,"Background Heart Failure (HF) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Myocardial fibrosis, one of the clinical manifestations implicated in almost every form of heart disease, contributes significantly to HF development. However, there is no approved drug specifically designed to target cardiac fibrosis. Nintedanib (NTB) is an FDA approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (ILD). The favorable clinical outcome of NTB in IPF patients is well established. Furthermore, NTB is well tolerated in IPF patients irrespective of cardiovascular comorbidities. However, there is a lack of direct evidence to support the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NTB in cardiac diseases. Methods and Results We examined the effects of NTB treatment on cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction using a murine model of HF. Specifically, 10 weeks old C57BL/6J male mice were subjected to Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC) surgery. NTB was administered once daily by oral gavage (50mg/kg) till 16 weeks post-TAC. Cardiac function was monitored by serial echocardiography. Histological analysis and morphometric studies were performed at 16 weeks post-TAC. In the control group, systolic dysfunction started developing from 4 weeks post-surgery and progressed till 16 weeks. However, NTB treatment prevented TAC-induced cardiac functional decline. In another experiment, NTB treatment was stopped at 8 weeks, and animals were followed till 16 weeks post-TAC. Surprisingly, NTB’s beneficial effect on cardiac function was maintained even after treatment interruption. NTB treatment remarkably reduced cardiac fibrosis as confirmed by Masson’s trichome staining and decreased expression of collagen genes (COL1A1, COL3A1). Compared to TAC group, NTB treated mice showed lower HW/TL ratio and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that NTB prevents myofibroblast transformation, TGFβ1-induced SMAD3 phosphorylation, and production of fibrogenic proteins (Fibronectin-1). However, NTB significantly altered vital signaling pathways in both, isolated fibroblast and cardiomyocytes, suggesting that its biological effect and underlying cardiac protection mechanisms are not limited to fibroblast and fibrosis alone. Conclusion Our findings provide a proof of concept for repurposing NTB to combat adverse myocardial fibrosis and encourage the need for further validation in large animal models and subsequent clinical development for HF patients.","Umbarkar, Prachi; Singh, Anand P.; Tousif, Sultan; Zhang, Qinkun; Sethu, Palaniappan; Lal, Hind",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423817,434

The Health Care Workers (HCWs) are presumably exposed to a higher risk of acquiring the disease owing to their regular contact with the patients. Methods COVID-19 prevalence was investigated by classifying 313 HCWs into four groups based on their degree of exposure and estimating the IgG and total antibody. The serological assessment of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was conducted 21 days post-vaccination of first or both doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine among 174 HCWs. The vaccinated HCWs were followed up for 3 months for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Findings The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were comparable among different groups, but the seroprevalence gradually decreased from the most exposed to the less exposed group. The neutralizing antibody was positively correlated with IgG as well as total antibody. IgG was marginally decreased after 2 months followed by a significant drop after 4-6 months post-infection. However, 80% of the HCWs developed a detectable amount of IgG after the first dose of vaccination, the median titer of which was comparable to the seropositive HCWs after natural infection. Almost 100% of the HCWs developed antibodies after the second dose of vaccine with boosting effect among the seropositive HCWs. Although ~11.5% of the vaccinated HCWs were infected with the SARS-CoV-2, ~94% of them showed mild symptoms and recovered in home isolation without any O2 support. Interpretations The varying level of seroprevalence among the four groups suggested a stratified spread of the disease. One dose of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was found to be effective in terms of the antibody titer, while the second dose was required to cover the larger population. The effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was noticeable due to the low rate of post-vaccination infection with moderate or severe symptoms.","Sarkar, S.; das, S.; Choudhury, K.; Mukherjee, S.; Chatterjee, R.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.20.21260278v1?rss=1,434

We used partitioning on variables derived from oral glucose tolerance tests, MRI measured body fat distribution, liver fat content, and genetic risk in a cohort of extensively phenotyped individuals who are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes to identify six distinct clusters of subphenotypes. Three of the identified subphenotypes have increased glycemia (clusters 3, 5 and 6), but only individuals in clusters 5 and 3 have immanent diabetes risks. By contrast, those in cluster 6 have moderate risk of type 2 diabetes, but an increased risk of kidney disease and all-cause mortality. Findings were replicated in an independent cohort using simple anthropomorphic and glycemic constructs.

Antimicrobial-resistant strains have emerged to an alarming level to most antibiotics including to the ceftriaxone-azithromycin combination, currently recommended as first-line dual therapy. Rapid testing for antimicrobial resistance will contribute to clinical decision-making for rational drug use and will slow this trend. Herein, we developed a Cas13a-based assay for N. gonorrhoeae detection (porA target) and azithromycin resistance identification (A2059G and C2611T point mutations). We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of this method, and 10 copies per reaction can be achieved in porA detection and C2611T identification, with no cross-reactions. Comparison of the Cas13a-based assay (porA target) with Roche Cobas 4800 assay (n=23 urine samples) revealed 100% concordance. Isolated N. gonorrhoeae strains were used to validate the identification of A2059G and C2611T resistance mutations. All tested strains (8 A2059G strains, 8 C2611T strains, and 8 wild-type strains) were successfully distinguished by our assay and verified by testing MIC for azithromycin and sequencing the 23S rRNA gene. We adopted lateral flow for the SHERLOCK assay readout, which showed a visible difference between test group and NC group results. To further evaluate the capability of our assay, we tested 27 urethral swabs from patients with urethritis for N. gonorrhoeae detection and azithromycin-resistance identification. Of these, 62.96% (17/27) strains were detected with no mutant strains and confirmed by sequencing.

However, such optimized layouts do not guarantee fixed T-2-T distances in any direction and would be disadvantageous if reduction in computational costs due to turbine set-point updates is also a priority. Regular turbine layouts are considered basic because turbine coordinates can be determined intuitively without the application of any optimization algorithms. However, such layouts can be used to intentionally create directions of large T-2-T distances, hence, achieve the gains of standard/non-optimized operations in these directions, while also having close T-2-T distances in other directions from which the gains of optimized operations can be enjoyed. In this study, a regular hexagonal turbine layout is used to deploy turbines within a fixed area dimension, and a turbulence intensity-constrained axial induction-based plant-wide optimization is carried out using particle swarm, artificial bee colony, and differential evolution optimization techniques. Optimized plant power for three close turbine deployments (4D, 5D, and 6D) are compared to a non-optimized 7D deployment using three mean wind inflows. Results suggest that a plant power increase of up to 37% is possible with a 4D deployment, with this increment decreasing as deployment distance increases and as mean wind inflow increases.","Mfon, Charles Oyedokun David T.

However, little is known with respect to how pharmaceuticals influence the epitranscriptome. Here we define how acetaminophen (APAP) induces epitranscriptomic reprogramming and how the writer Alkylation Repair Homolog 8 (Alkbh8) plays a key gene regulatory role in the response. Alkbh8 modifies tRNA selenocysteine (tRNASec) to translationally regulate the production of glutathione peroxidases (Gpx’s) and other selenoproteins, with Gpx enzymes known to play protective roles during APAP toxicity. We demonstrate that APAP increases toxicity and markers of damage, and decreases selenoprotein levels in Alkbh8 deficient mouse livers, when compared to wildtype. APAP also promotes large scale reprogramming of 31 RNA marks comprising the liver tRNA epitranscriptome including: 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U), isopentenyladenosine (i6A), pseudouridine (Ψ), and 1-methyladenosine (m1A) modifications linked to tRNASec and many others. Alkbh8 deficiency also leads to wide-spread epitranscriptomic dysregulation in response to APAP, demonstrating that a single writer defect can promote downstream changes to a large spectrum of RNA modifications. Our study highlights the importance of RNA modifications and translational responses to APAP, identifies writers as key modulators of stress responses in vivo and supports the idea that the epitranscriptome may play important roles in responses to pharmaceuticals.","Evke, Sara; Melendez, J.

These quantitative predictions based on patient-specific P-V data suggest that the optimum parameters of mechanical ventilation including PEEP and Tidal Pressure (Volume) are largely varying among ARDS population and are primarily influenced by the degree in the severity of ARDS.","Nabian, Mohsen; Narusawa, Uichiro",Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352914818300996; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352914818300996,434
177912,Identifying At-Risk Communities and Key Vulnerability Indicators in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-09-22,"This paper investigates the capital market reaction to the first detection of the COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Using a sample of 314 listed firms in Dhaka stock Exchange (DSE), this study employed the event study methodology (ESM) to find any abnormal return (AR) associated to the first COVID-19 detection announcement. Three different return models namely mean-adjusted return, market-adjusted return and market model have been used to calculate the abnormal return and test the statistical significance using both parametric crude dependence and standardised cross-sectional T-test along with non-parametric generalised sign-test and Corrado rank-test. The findings suggest that, despite the perceived weak market efficiency, the announcement of the first COVID-19 detection has a significant negative impact on overall market return on the event day. Additionally, the result exhibits the indifferent market reaction of different industry segments such as manufacturing, service, financial, non-financial, pharmaceuticals and IT and telecommunication sectors. The results would be useful for investors, industrial and financial analysts in accessing volatile systemic risk and building an optimal portfolio to solve the pandemic dilemma effectively.","Adnan, A.

The consumption of alcohol-containing hand sanitizer products, whether intentional or accidental, often garners attention, particularly since these products may contain methanol. This report describes a case of surreptitious theft and intentional ingestion of the emergency department's (ED) ethanol-based hand sanitizer by a patient who presented to the ED clinically intoxicated with a high ethanol level. When the patient remained clinically intoxicated for more than 18 hours and had a rising serum ethanol level in the ED, clinicians searched his belongings and found several purloined bottles of the ED's hand sanitizer. When confronted, the patient admitted to ingesting hand sanitizer during his ED stay. This case highlights the need for clinicians to be suspicious of intentional ingestion of ethanol-containing products for at-risk patients. Additionally, it demonstrates that measures and protocols should be put in place that minimize the ability for the inappropriate use of these widely accessible products within the hospital.","Pourmand, A.; Ghassemi, M.; Frasure, S.

A surge of positive cases ensued by March 2020 which led to a series of countrywide containment and mitigation measures known as Movement Control Order (MCO). We study the direct effects of MCO on the course of epidemic by analyzing the cumulative and daily infection cases of COVID-19 up to 31 December 2020 in Malaysia and its states using piecewise linear regression and segment neighborhoods algorithm of change-point analysis, respectively. Through piecewise regression on nationwide cases, MCO were likely to almost flatten the epidemic curve in just one month after it was first initiated. While for stateswise cases, the average length of series of concave downward is six months before it turn to concave upward, indicating the period of which deceleration of new cases can be expected. However, the starting of this wave of COVID-19 can be relatively vary for three months in different states and federal territories. Together with change-point analysis on daily cases, the statewise epidemic phases could be subdivided into two to four regimes, whereby the majority of phase transitions fall in April and last quarter of 2020. Overall, the statistical modelling shows that the immediate effect of MCO appears to be effective.","Phang, P.; Abdul Taib, N.

Following the call of Oman Vision 2040 to emphasize educational practices that promote the development of higher-order cognitive processes, this study raises the following question: Can an online multiple choice question (MCQ) quiz tap into the higher-order cognitive skills of apply, analyze and evaluate? This question was also critical at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic when Omani universities switched to the online learning mode. The researchers administered an online MCQ quiz to 35 undergraduate students enrolled in an ESP course for Engineering and Sciences. The results showed that MCQ quizzes could be developed to tap into higher-order thinking skills when the stem of the MSQ is developed as a task or a scenario. The study also revealed that students performed better on MCQs that tap into low--level cognitive skills. This result can be attributed to the prevalent practice in Oman to develop assessment tools that tap only into a level of Bloom's taxonomy, which involves the cognitive process of retrieving memorized information. The significance of the study lies in its pedagogical applications. The study calls for the use of teaching and assessment practices that target the development of higher--order thinking skills, which is aligned with the country's strategic direction reflected in Oman vision 2040.","Lenchuk, I.; Ahmed, A.",Arab World English Journal,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/covid.12,434

The dynamic behavior of the epidemiological model is analyzed using the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovery) model, where different values of parameters of the epidemic model will be simulated using MATLAB program to better understand and to extract useful information about possible situations. The behavior of the infectious disease COVID-19 and TB is investigated with real data in Libya and controlled using a Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) which characterizes optimality around the optimal solution to minimizing the infected people and maximizing the recovery process. The simulation results indicate that the designed control strategy has a positive effect.

178690,COVID-19 pandemic doctor bleep system,2020,"The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 in 2020 has become the main health problem across the globe. A special characteristic of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is tropism to the vascular endothelium with the development of endotheliitis, which entails a number of typical disorders of the blood coagulation system: coagulopathy with increased thrombin generation, D-dimer, decreased fibrinolysis and prolonged prothrombin time. The coagulation disorder in COVID-19 is called thromboinflammation. Hyperinflammation, increased blood levels of von Willebrand factor, coagulation factor VIII, neutrophil extracellular traps, platelet activation, microvesicles play a significant role in the pathogenesis of hypercoagulation in COVID-19. To date, it is known that cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents constitute a small part of the total number of patients with diagnosed COVID-19, and disorders of the blood coagulation system are similar to those in adults. The degree of hypercoagulable syndrome and the risk of thrombosis depend on the severity of COVID-19. And for children they are most expressed with the development of a hyperinflammatory immune response, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. At the same time, clinical studies of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in adults and children and the search for optimal methods of therapy for thrombus inflammation, which underlies the pathogenesis of COVID-19, continue. © 2021 Novosibirsk State University.

However, knowledge of the wildlife virome is inherently constrained by historical discovery effort, and there are concerns that the reliability of ecological inference from host-virus data may be undermined by taxonomic and geographical sampling biases. Here, we evaluate whether current estimates of host-level viral diversity in wild mammals are stable enough to be considered biologically meaningful, by analysing a comprehensive dataset of discovery dates of 6,571 unique mammal host-virus associations between 1930 and 2018. We show that virus discovery rates in mammal hosts are still either constant or accelerating, with little evidence of declines towards viral richness asymptotes in even highly-sampled hosts. Consequently, inference of relative viral richness across host species has been unstable over time, particularly in bats, where intensified surveillance since the early 2000s caused a rapid rearrangement of species’ ranked viral richness. Our results show that comparative inference of host-level virus diversity across mammals is highly sensitive to even short-term changes in sampling effort. We advise caution to avoid overinterpreting patterns in current data, since our findings suggest that an analysis conducted today could feasibly draw quite different conclusions than one conducted only a decade ago.","Gibb, Rory; Albery, Gregory F.; Mollentze, Nardus; Eskew, Evan A.; Brierley, Liam; Ryan, Sadie J.; Seifert, Stephanie N.; Carlson, Colin J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.10.455791,434

To illustrate how it can be used and evaluate its robustness and flexibility, such a tool was applied to Portugal and Italy, two countries that particularly suffered from the Covid-19 crisis.FindingsThe application of the analytical framework has shown how financially vulnerable municipalities are to global pandemic crises. Financial vulnerability relates to issues ranging from institutional design to internal financial conditions and the perception of the capacity to cope with a crisis. Results further reveal that vulnerability has an inherent contingent nature in time and space and can lead to paradoxical outcomes.Research limitations/implicationsThis paper provides a tool that can be useful for both academic and public policy purposes, to further appreciate municipal financial vulnerability, especially during crises.Practical implicationsMunicipalities can use the framework to better manage their financial vulnerability, strengthening their anticipatory and copying capacities, while oversight authorities can use it to help municipalities become less financially vulnerable or, at least, more aware of their financial vulnerability.Originality/valueMunicipal financial vulnerability to global shocks has not been explored extensively. Also, the Covid-19 pandemic is different from previous global crises as it affected society overnight with the implementation of lockdown and social distancing measures.","Padovani, E.; Iacuzzi, S.; Jorge, S.; Pimentel, L.",Journal of Public Budgeting Accounting &amp; Financial Management,https://doi.org/10.1108/jpbafm-07-2020-0129,434

In this study, we began to explore the impact of urbanization on zoonotic disease risk by simultaneously characterizing changes in the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts (rodents), ectoparasite vectors (ticks), and microbial pathogens across a gradient of urbanization in Malaysian Borneo. We found that although rodent species diversity decreased with increasing urbanization, two species appeared to thrive in anthropogenic environments: the invasive urban exploiter, Rattus rattus and the native urban adapter, Sundamys muelleri. R. rattus was strongly associated with the presence of built infrastructure across the gradient and dominated the urban rodent community where it was associated with high microbial diversity and multi-host zoonoses capable of environmental transmission, including Leptospira spp., and Toxoplasma gondii. In contrast, S. muelleri was restricted to sites with a significant vegetative component where it was found at high densities in the urban location. This species was strongly associated with the presence of ticks, including the medically important genera Ambylomma, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes. Overall, our results demonstrate that the response to urbanization varies by species at all levels: host, ectoparasite, and microbe. This may lead to increased zoonotic disease risk in a subset of environments across urban and urbanizing landscapes that can be reduced through improved pest management and public health messaging.","Blasdell, Kim R.; Morand, Serge; Laurance, Susan G.W.; Doggett, Stephen L; Hahs, Amy; Perera, David; Firth, Cadhla",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.436089,434

Although several techniques have already been identified to control the pandemic or treat patients and causes of adverse impact on mental health, relatively only, fewer researchers have little concern about finding effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. Therefore, this study aimed to find some common and unique approaches to manage mental health during a pandemic. Some strategies for the better management of mental health induced by SARS-CoV-2 infections are required for all classes of peoples. Early management is vital, and those must be associated with frontline workers and people staying at home, particularly in isolation centers and already identified as active cases. Experts have pointed out the need to pay specific attention to proper daily life. To manage abnormal mental conditions, such as anxiety, mood, personality, and psychotic disorder during the pandemic;social media, meditation, and psychological motivation with adequate diet, exercise, and sleep have significant roles in regulating some biological mechanism, incredibly immune, hormonal, and neural process.

We examined the association between prescribing patterns of oral capecitabine vs. IV 5FU for GI cancers and social distancing, measured by the change in population mobility patterns in response to shelter-in place policies, during the pandemic. Methods: Using claims data for commercially insured members, we included patients 18 years of age or older with colorectal, gastroesophageal, or pancreatic cancer, who had continuous health plan coverage for at least 2 months before and 1 month after initiating chemotherapy with capecitabine or 5- FU from January 2017 to August 2020. We analyzed unadjusted trends in proportion of chemotherapy that was oral during pandemic (March 1 to August 31 , 2020) compared to previous years. Then, we conducted differencein-differences analysis using COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, by Google, and utilizing different levels of changes in mobility trends across states over time. In our main model, we used a 20% decrease in retail and recreation visits as our threshold and compared the prescribing rates in states below and above the threshold as well as before and after the pandemic began. We also used different thresholds and categories of places to check the sensitivity of our findings. Models are adjusted for age, gender, month of year, urban status, comorbidities, and state of residence at chemotherapy start date. Results: A total of 17,414 nationally distributed patients (69% colorectal, 13% gastroesophageal, 18% pancreatic) were included (mean age, 58.8 years;41% female). During the pandemic, 1,875 patients (65% colorectal, 15% gastroesophageal, 20% pancreatic) were identified. The proportion of oral regimens did not change significantly for colorectal and gastroesophageal patients and decreased by 7.4 percentage points (pp) (p < 0.01) for pancreatic patients. In regression modelling with mobility data, oral prescribing rates for colorectal patients increased by 3.1 pp (p < 0.01), largely driven by increases for female patients (9.2 pp, p = 0.02). We observed a decrease in oral prescribing rates among pancreatic patients (-1.20 pp, p = 0.04) and did not observe a significant change for gastroesophageal patients. Our results are not sensitive to different social distancing specifications. Conclusions: We observed differential impact of the pandemic on oral prescribing rates by GI cancer type and gender. Oral prescribing increased among colorectal cancer patients driven mostly by higher oral prescribing in females. For pancreatic and gastroesophageal patients, oral prescriptions either remained unchanged or decreased. This observation may reflect a variable impact of the pandemic on women as compared to men and might involve heightened caregiving responsibilities for women.","Civelek, Y.; Cullen, D.; Debono, D.

Due to the fact that there is research on COVID-19 on child health, the direct (primary) and indirect (secondary) effects reasons on child health are not known exactly. However, with the product obtained in the future, it is expected that the researches to be made with more concrete data will be expanded and definite results will emerge. Pediatric cases diagnosed with COVID-19 are less frequent than those found in the data specified in studies where they received the clinical cloud around seven. It was emphasized that although the clinical picture in children is mild, it has a carrier feature (secondary) and may cause major effects against its direct (primary) effects. Studies have reported that there may be approximately 30 million risks worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic process and its indirect (secondary) effects. In this review, up-to-date literature knowledge has been shown to cause indirect (secondary) effects of COVID-19 on child health, causing distress in health services, interruption of education, daily routine disorder, socio-economic level, etc. many factors have been addressed.","Coşkun, A.

180994,A methodology to study the university's online teaching activity from virtual platform indicators: the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic at universitat politecnica de catalunya,2021,"Oropouche virus (OROV) infection of humans is associated with a debilitating febrile illness that can progress to meningitis or encephalitis. First isolated from a forest worker in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, the arbovirus OROV has since been detected throughout the Amazon basin with an estimated 500,000 human infections. Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins Gn and Gc responsible for attachment and membrane fusion. There are no therapeutics or vaccines to combat OROV infection, and we have little understanding of protective immunity to infection. Here we generated a replication competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the endogenous glycoprotein was replaced by the GPC of OROV. Serum from mice immunized with VSV-OROV specifically neutralized wild type OROV, and using peptide arrays we mapped multiple epitopes within an N-terminal variable region of Gc recognized by the immune sera. VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N-terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc. Importance Oropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus found in Central and South America, is an emerging public health challenge that causes debilitating febrile illness. OROV is transmitted by arthropods, and increasing mobilization has the potential to significantly increase the spread of OROV globally. Despite this, no therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to combat infection. Using vesicular stomatitis (VSV) as a backbone, we developed a chimeric virus bearing the OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) and tested its ability to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Our results demonstrate that VSV-OROV produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that is at least partially targeted to the N-terminal region of Gc. Importantly, vaccination with VSV-OROV reduces viral loads in mice challenged with wildtype virus. This data provides the first evidence that targeting the OROV glycoproteins may be an effective vaccination strategy to combat OROV infection.","Stubbs, Sarah Hulsey; Pontelli, Marjorie Cornejo; Mishra, Nischay; Zhou, Changhong; de Paula Souza, Juliano; Mendes Viana, Rosa Maria; Lipkin, W.

Education is the fastest aspect that has been hindered due to the pandemic. The majority of the schools and universities were prone to global closure. The world turned toward using e-learning as an alternative to traditional learning due to the strict lockdown procedures. This study presents a model to measure the students' intention to use e-learning during the pandemic in Iraq. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is utilized with some external variables. Task Technology Fit (TTF) is also adopted as a moderator for the proposed model. The model is implemented on a sample of students studying at Technical College of Management -Baghdad who have completed the academic year using e-learning. Eighteen hypotheses were formulated;out of them, only two were rejected. The model is tested and evaluated using PLS Tool. The results showed that the students have a positive intention to use e-learning during the covid-19 pandemic;also, most of the external variables were statistically significant. Furthermore, using TTF positively moderates the proposed model. The results open the way to perform more investigations in adopting e-learning during unusual situations. © 2021.

181289,Risk communication and COVID-19 in Europe: lessons for future public health crises,2021,"COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread throughout the world with unprecedented global healthcare and socio-economic consequences. There is now an established secondary syndrome of COVID-19 characterised by thrombosis, vascular dysfunction and hypertension, seen in those most severely affected. Advancing age in adults is the single most significant risk factor for hospitalisation and death with COVID-19. In light of the cardiovascular/thrombotic sequalae associated with severe COVID-19 disease and the overwhelming risk that increased age carries, in this study, our aim was to obtain mechanistic insight by interrogating gene expression profiles in cardiovascular tissues and cells. Our focus was on the two putative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and BSG along with a selected range of genes thought to be involved in virus binding/processing. In this study we have made four important observations: (i)Cardiovascular tissues and/or endothelial cells express the required genes for SARS-CoV-2 infection, (ii) SASR-CoV-2 receptor pathways, ACE2/TMPRSS2 and BSG/PPIB(A) polarise to lung/epithelium and vessel/endothelium respectively, (iii) expression of SARS-CoV-2 host genes are, on the whole, relatively stable with age and (iv) notable exceptions were ACE2 which decreases with age in some tissues and BSG which increases with age in endothelial cells. Our data support the idea that that BSG is the dominate pathway utilised by SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells and are the first to demonstrate a positive correlation with age. We suggest BSG expression in the vasculature is a critical driver which explains the heightened risk of severe disease and death observed in those >40 years of age. Since BSG is utilised by other pathogens our findings have implications beyond the current pandemic. Finally, because BSG is functions in a range of cardiovascular diseases and fibrosis, our observations may have relevance to our understanding of the diseases associated with aging.","Ahmetaj-Shala, Blerina; Vaja, Ricky; Atanur, Santosh S; George, Peter M.; Kirkby, Nicholas S.; Mitchell, Jane A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.23.165324,434
181361,Global Monitoring of the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic through Online Surveys Sampled from the Facebook User Base,2021-07-07,"Introduction: Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in patients over the age of 65 presenting to medical admissions units yet remains under-diagnosed despite significant associated mortality and morbidity. Our trust's delirium screening tool incorporates a fourstep approach, with completion of validated 4AT test warranted in all those over 65 years of age admitted with increased confusion or social withdrawal. Our aim was to measure current uptake of this delirium screening and introduce measures to improve practice. Method: We retrospectively collected data from medical records of patients on two Geriatric inpatient wards (42 patients) at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, to determine whether appropriate delirium screening was taking place for at-risk patients on admission. We then introduced two PDSA (plan, do, study, act) cycles: 1. teaching at departmental weekly educational meetings with sending electronic communications to all doctors in medicine highlighting importance of delirium screening;and 2. displaying posters on all admissions wards. A third cycle was planned involving visiting wards to raise awareness, however this was interrupted by the COVID pandemic. Results: Initial baseline results showed only 5% (1 of 18) of at-risk patients were fully screened for delirium. Following our first intervention, this increased to 13% (3 of 23). Second intervention involving display of posters led to an increase to 44% (8 of 18) of atrisk patients being screened. Proportions of dementia were comparable across PDSA cycles. Conclusions: Education, raising awareness, and display of reminder posters can improve delirium screening uptake of at-risk patients on admission to medical admission units, despite growing pressures associated with the COVID pandemic. Further interventions are planned to improve and maintain awareness and uptake of delirium screening.","Al-Alousi, S.; Khan, A.

We aimed to investigate whether risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, are raised following discharge from a COVID-19 hospitalisation. Methods and Findings: Working on behalf of NHS-England, we used linked primary care and hospital data in OpenSAFELY to compare risks of hospital admission and death, overall and by specific cause, between people discharged from COVID-19 hospitalisation (February-December 2020), and (i) demographically-matched controls from the 2019 general population; (ii) people discharged from influenza hospitalisation in 2017-19. We used Cox regression adjusted for personal and clinical characteristics. 24,673 post-discharge COVID-19 patients, 123,362 general population controls, and 16,058 influenza controls were followed for [≤]315 days. Overall risk of hospitalisation or death (30968 events) was higher in the COVID-19 group than general population controls (adjusted-HR 2.23, 2.14-2.31) but similar to the influenza group (adjusted-HR 0.94, 0.91-0.98). All-cause mortality (7439 events) was highest in the COVID-19 group (adjusted-HR 4.97, 4.58-5.40 vs general population controls and 1.73, 1.60-1.87 vs influenza controls). Risks for cause-specific outcomes were higher in COVID-19 survivors than general population controls, and largely comparable between COVID-19 and influenza patients. However, COVID-19 patients were more likely than influenza patients to be readmitted/die due to their initial infection/other lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted-HR 1.37, 1.22-1.54), and to experience mental health or cognitive-related admission/death (adjusted-HR 1.36, 1.01-2.83); in particular, COVID-19 survivors with pre-existing dementia had higher risk of dementia death. One limitation of our study is that reasons for hospitalisation/death may have been misclassified in some cases due to inconsistent use of codes. Conclusions: People discharged from a COVID-19 hospital admission had markedly higher risks for rehospitalisation and death than the general population, suggesting a substantial extra burden on healthcare. Most risks were similar to those observed after influenza hospitalisations; but COVID-19 patients had higher risks of all-cause mortality, readmissions/death due to the initial infection, and dementia death, highlighting the importance of post-discharge monitoring.","Bhaskaran, K.; Rentsch, C.

To improve the stability and purity of synthesized RNA we had characterized a novel single-subunit RNA polymerase (RNAP) encoded by a psychrophilic phage VSW-3 from plateau lake to produce RNA at low temperature. The VSW-3 RNAP is capable of carrying out in vitro RNA synthesis at low temperature (4-25°C) to reduce RNA degradation and alleviate the need of costly RNase inhibitor. Compared to routinely used T7 RNAP, VSW-3 RNAP provides comparable yield of transcripts, but is insensitive to class II transcription terminators and synthesizes RNA without redundant 3’ -cis extension. More importantly, through dot-blot detection with the J2 monoclonal antibody, we found that the RNA products synthesized by VSW-3 RNAP contain much lower amount of or virtually no double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by-products, which are significant in most T7 RNAP products and may cause severe cellular immune response. Combining these advantages, the VSW-3 RNAP is an advantageous enzyme for IVT, especially to produce RNA for in vivo use.","Xia, Heng; Jiang, Yixin; Cheng, Rui; Yu, Bingbing; Lu, Xueling; Wu, Hui; Zhu, Bin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.14.297226,434
185410,What Have We Learned From the Covid-19 Pandemic so Far?,2020-05-07,"Introduction: In Canada, first and second doses of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were uniquely spaced 16 weeks apart, but the duration of single-dose protection remains uncertain. We estimated one- and two-dose mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Quebec, Canada including protection against varying outcome severity, variants of concern (VOC), and the stability of single-dose protection out to 16 weeks post-vaccination. Methods: A test-negative design compared vaccination among SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and weekly-matched (10:1), randomly-sampled, test-negative HCWs using linked surveillance and immunization databases. Vaccine status was defined by one dose [≥]14 days or two doses [≥]7 days before illness onset or specimen collection. Adjusted VE was estimated by conditional logistic regression. Results: Primary analysis included 5,316 cases and 53,160 controls. Single-dose VE was 70% (95%CI: 68-73) against SARS-CoV-2 infection, 73% (95%CI: 71-75) against COVID-19 illness and 97% (95%CI: 92-99) against associated hospitalization. Two-dose VE was 86% (95%CI: 81-90) and 93% (95%CI: 89-95), respectively, with no associated hospitalizations. VE was higher for non-VOC than VOC (73% Alpha) among single-dose (77%, 95%CI: 73-81 versus 63%, 95%CI: 57-67) but not two-dose recipients (87%, 95%CI: 57-96 versus 94%, 95%CI: 89-96). Across 16 weeks, no decline in single-dose VE was observed with appropriate stratification based upon prioritized vaccination determined by higher versus lower likelihood of direct patient contact. Conclusion: One mRNA vaccine dose provided substantial and sustained protection to HCWs extending at least four months post-vaccination. In circumstances of vaccine shortage, delaying the second dose may be a pertinent public health strategy to consider.","Carazo, S.; Talbot, D.; Boulianne, N.; Brisson, M.; Gilca, R.; Deceuninck, G.; Brousseau, N.; Drolet, M.; Ouakki, M.; Sauvageau, C.; Barkati, S.; Fortin, E.; Carignan, A.; De Wals, P.; Skowronski, D.

This qualitative study assessed attitudes toward this strategy among four groups of stakeholders: school administrators, teachers, parents, and high school students. Methods Focus groups and interviews were conducted in Los Angeles from December 2020 to January 2021 when schools were closed due to the high level of COVID transmission in the community. Results Findings indicated similarities and differences in attitudes toward in-school COVID-19 testing. All groups agreed that frequent in-school COVID-19 testing could increase the actual safety and perceived safety of the school environment. School administrators and teachers expressed pessimism about the financial cost and logistics of implementing a testing program. Parents supported frequent testing but expressed concerns about physical discomfort and stigma for students who test positive. Teachers and parents noted that testing would prevent parents from sending sick children to school. Students were in favor of testing because it would allow them to return to in-person school after a difficult year of online learning. Conclusion In-school COVID-19 testing could be a useful component of school reopening plans and will be accepted by stakeholders if logistical and financial barriers can be surmounted and stigma from positive results can be minimized.","Unger, J.

METHODS The authors collected data retrospectively from February 2020 to March 2020 and compared it to data of a parallel period in 2019. RESULTS From 1 February 2020 to 28 March 2020, 3897 women were referred to the emergency department (ED), compared to 4067 the previous year. Mean duration of treatment until decision and referral indications did not differ between 2020 and 2019 (207 vs. 220 minutes, P = 0.26; urgent referrals 58.8% vs. 59.2%, P = 0.83). A per-week comparison showed a significant reduction in ED referrals only in the last week of the period (337 [2020] vs. 515 [2019], P < 0.001). The proportion of women admitted to the delivery unit in active labor was significantly higher in the last three weeks (39.1% vs. 28.2%, P = 0.005). During February and March 2020, 1666 women delivered, compared to 1654 during February and March 2019. The proportion of types and modes of delivery did not differ. In a per-week comparison, the number of deliveries did not differ (mean 208 vs. 206, P = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS With timely preparation and proper management, negative impact of COVID-19 can be reduced in obstetrical emergency departments.","Meyer, Raanan; Levin, Gabriel; Hendin, Natav; Katorza, Eldad",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32812715/,434

The development of genomic and proteomic multiplex technologies have enormously amplified biomarker discovery and application to diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in clinical practice. New technologies are now available that simultaneously identify a wide spectrum of biomarkers and save time and costs. Multiplexed assays can be coupled to other disease specific indicators (i.e., cytokines, single nucleotide polymorphisms) in order to get more powerful information. However, there is an urgent need for validation/standardization of the new assays before they are adopted into clinical diagnostics. It is worthy to note a new assay, T cell interferon gamma release (TIGRAs), which has recently been introduced in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection. It seems to perform better than tuberculin skin test in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. In this review, we focus on advantages and limits of novel approaches to the detection of autoantibody profiles in autoimmune diseases or pathogen signatures in microbiology.","Lalvani, A; Meroni, P L; Millington, K A; Modolo, M L; Plebani, M; Tincani, A; Villalta, D; Doria, A; Ghirardello, A",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18570756/,434

METHODS For this case-control study, vitamin D levels were studied in term and late preterm neonates admitted to NICU with seizures in a tertiary care center in South India. Controls were term and late preterm healthy neonates admitted in the postnatal ward with the mothers in the same center. RESULT 30 cases and 30 controls were enrolled. The mean (SD) serum vitamin D was 19.33 (7.76) ng/mL among cases and 16.83 (6.74) ng/mL among controls (P=0.18). We tested maternal vitamin D levels in babies with seizures and low vitamin D levels. The mean (SD) serum vitamin D level among these mothers (n=11) was 13.25 (6.17) ng/mL. CONCLUSION There was no statistically significant association between serum vitamin D levels and seizures among neonates in our study. However, we found low vitamin D levels in lactating mothers and newborn population of this region.","Reddy, Jonnala Chaitanya; Barche, Apurv; Andrade, Sneha Jaganathan; Verma, Aditya; Lewis, Leslie Edward; Purkayastha, Jayashree",Indian pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016803/,434

There have been no data from Nepal. Objective The objective of this study is to describe clinical profile and survival in Eastern Nepal. Method Prospectively collected clinical, radiological and laboratory data of consecutive patients with Interstitial lung disease from an eastern regional tertiary care center were analyzed. The recommended official criteria for diagnosing different types of interstitial lung diseases were followed accordingly. Result The study revealed that, 68.0% of the patient's age was of above 60 years with male predominance (66.0%). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (79.5%) was the commonest interstitial lung disease followed by connective tissue disease associated interstitial lung disease. Persistent cough (97.7%) and dyspnea (95.5%) were the commonest presentations. Renal impairment, ischemic Heart Disease and anasarca were significant co morbidities contributing to mortality. Survival rate of the patients was found to be maximum at 5 months (95%) and minimum at 24 months (42%) from the diagnosis of the disease. Conclusion Widespread use of High-resolution computed tomography has made early recognition of interstitial lung disease in elderly patients.

We report here that NS5A of HCV-1a is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase proteases in transfected cells. Two cleavage sites at positions Asp154 and 248DXXD251 were mapped. Cleavage at Asp154 has been previously recognized as one of the caspase cleavage sites for the NS5A protein of HCV genotype 1b (1, 2) and results in the production of a 17-kDa fragment. The sequence 248DXXD251 is a novel caspase recognition motif for NS5A and is responsible for the production of a 31-kDa fragment. Furthermore, we show that Arg217 is implicated in the production of the previously described 24-kDa product, whose accumulation is affected by both calpain and caspase inhibitors. We also showed that caspase-mediated cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous proapoptotic stimuli and is not related to the accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, our data indicate that NS5A is targeted by at least two different caspases and suggest that caspase 6 is implicated in the production of the 17-kDa fragment. Most importantly, we report that, all the detectable NS5A fragments following caspase-mediated cleavage are C-terminal-truncated forms of NS5A and are mainly localized in the cytosol. Thus, in sharp contrast to the current view we found no evidence supporting a role for caspase-mediated cleavage in the transport of the NS5A protein to the nucleus, which could lead to transcriptional activation.","Kalamvoki, Maria; Georgopoulou, Urania; Mavromara, Penelope",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16517592/,434

The genome of T385 was 19,259 nt in length, 37 nt shorter than the genome of T36, and 33 and 10 nt longer than those of VT and SY568, respectively, but their organization was identical. T385 had mean nucleotide identities of 81.3, 89.3 and 94% with T36, VT and SY568, respectively. The 3' UTR had over 97% identity in all isolates, whereas the 5' UTR of T385 had 67% identity with VT, 66.3% with SY568 and only 42.5% with T36. In the coding regions, the nucleotide differences between T385 and VT were evenly distributed along the genome (around 90% identity); this was not observed between T385 and the other isolates. T385 and T36 had nucleotide identities around 90% in the eight 3'-terminal ORFs of the genome, but only 72.3% in ORF 1a, a divergence pattern similar to that reported previously for T36 and VT. T385 and SY568 had nucleotide identities close to 90% in the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of the genome, whereas the central region had over 99% identity. Our data suggest that the central region in the SY568 genome results from RNA recombination between two CTV genomes, one of which was almost identical to T385.","Vives, M C; Rubio, L; López, C; Navas-Castillo, J; Albiach-Martí, M R; Dawson, W O; Guerri, J; Flores, R; Moreno, P",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10092023/,434

ANIMALS 105 and 120 castrated male 4- to 8-month-old feedlot cattle involved in 1997 and 1998 outbreaks, respectively. PROCEDURES Nasal swab specimens and blood samples were collected, and cattle were vaccinated on arrival at an order-buyer barn from 4 local auction houses. Four days later, they were transported to a feedlot, and additional nasal swab specimens and blood samples were collected. Nasal swab specimens were submitted for virus isolation and bacterial culture; blood samples were submitted for measurement of respiratory bovine coronavirus (RBCV) hemagglutinin inhibition titers. RESULTS 93 of 105 cattle and 106 of 120 cattle developed signs of respiratory tract disease during 1997 and 1998, respectively, and RBCV was isolated from 81 and 89 sick cattle, respectively, while at the order-buyer's barn or the day after arrival at the feedlot. During the 1997 outbreak, bovine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from 2 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and from 5 cattle 7 and 14 days after arrival at the feedlot, and parainfluenza virus 3 was isolated from 4 cattle 14 days after arrival at the feedlot. During the 1998 outbreak, bovine herpesvirus 1 was isolated from 2 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and on arrival at the feedlot and from 5 cattle 7 and 14 days after arrival at the feedlot, and parainfluenza virus 3 was isolated from 1 animal the day of, and from 18 cattle 7 and 14 days after, arrival at the feedlot. Pasteurella spp was cultured from 4 and 6 cattle at the order-buyer's barn and from 92 and 72 cattle on arrival at the feedlot during the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks, respectively.

At the authors' institution, pneumonia is the most common diagnosis for which azithromycin is used as a treatment for patients who are hospitalized. Objective To compare corrected QT (QTc) interval measurements on electrocardiogram (ECG) before and after inpatient azithromycin treatment for pneumonia. Methods The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 642 patients age 18 years and older who were diagnosed with pneumonia and treated with azithromycin at an academic teaching hospital between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. Patients who had an ECG performed both before and after azithromycin treatment were included and divided into 2 groups: those who had 1 dose of azithromycin (Group 1) and those who had 2 doses (Group 2). Patients were excluded if they had a baseline QTc interval on initial ECG greater than or equal to 500 ms, any signs of ischemia or myocardial infarction, any initial dysrhythmia or underlying ECG abnormalities, or absence of pre- and post-ECG results. Outcomes measures included a comparison of QTc intervals on ECG before and after azithromycin, and an analysis of the percentage of patients with a QTc interval measurement greater than 500 ms on ECG after azithromycin treatment. Our primary outcome measurement was the QTc interval measurement on ECG before and after azithromycin in patients treated with azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia. Our secondary outcome measurement was the percentage of patients with a QTc interval measurement of greater than 500 ms on ECG after azithromycin treatment. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate repeated QTc measures of our primary outcome in Group 1 and Group 2. Our secondary outcome was reported as a percentage of total patients with a QTc interval of greater than 500 ms after azithromycin doses on ECG. Results Of 642 patients, 142 had available pre- and post-EGC results available; 100 were included in Group 1 (1 dose) and 42 in Group 2 (2 doses). Mean QTc interval differences after 1 dose of azithromycin exhibited an increase compared to baseline values (424 vs 477 ms). A Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant QTc prolongation after 1 dose of azithromycin (mean rank, 43.76; Z=-4.921; P<.001). QTc interval differences after 2 doses of azithromycin did not reach statistical significance when compared to baseline values (422 vs 444 ms). A total of 10 patients (10%) in Group 1 and 4 patients (9.5%) in Group 2 had a QTc interval >500 ms after azithromycin. There were no documented dysrhythmias during hospitalization in this study period. Conclusion QTc interval increases were observed during inpatient azithromycin therapy for pneumonia, but were not found to be associated with cardiac dysrhythmias during hospitalization.","Cruz, Maricel Dela; Ershad, Muhammed; Mostafa, Ahmed",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33044496/,434

Currently, several diagnostic modalities are available for COVID-19, each with its own pros and cons. Although there is a global consensus to increase the testing capacity, it is also essential to prudently utilize these tests to control the pandemic. In this paper, we have reviewed the current array of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the gaps in current diagnostic modalities, and their role in community surveillance and control of the pandemic. The different modalities of COVID-19 diagnosis discussed are: clinical and radiological, molecular based (laboratory based and point-of-care), Immunoassay based (ELISA, rapid antigen and antibody detection tests) and digital diagnostics (artificial intelligence based algorithms). The role of rapid antigen/antibody detection tests in community surveillance has also been described here. These tests can be used to identify asymptomatic persons exposed to the virus and in community based seroprevalence surveys to assess the epidemiology of spread of the virus. However, there are few concerns about the accuracy of these tests which needs to evaluated beforehand.","Tripathi, Satyendra C; Deshmukh, Vishwajit; Patil, Ashlesh; Tripathy, Jaya Prasad",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532934/,434

These newly emerging RBCV isolates exhibited distinct phenotypic features that differentiated them from enteropathogenic bovine coronaviruses (EBCV). The RBCV strains had a receptor-destroying enzyme function mediated by acetylesterase (AE) activity of the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) glycoprotein. The HE genes of wild-type EBCV strain LY138 and RBCV strains OK-0514 (OK) and LSU-94LSS-051 (LSU) were cloned, sequenced and transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The enzymic properties of HE proteins in COS-7 cellular extracts and in purified virus preparations were assayed at room temperature, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C by two different assays. One assay used p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) as substrate and detected serine-esterase activity; the second assay monitored AE function with bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) as substrate. The PNPA tests confirmed that HE proteins of EBCV and RBCV were functionally expressed in transfected COS-7 cells. Time-dependent determination of the AE activity of purified RBCV OK and LSU particles showed lower AE activity at 39 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, whereas the purified EBCV LY particles retained full AE activity at both 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C. Transiently expressed RBCV HE exhibited a marked reduction of AE activity after 40 min of assay time at 37 degrees C. In contrast, the AE activity of the transiently expressed EBCV HE remained stable beyond 40 min. The deduced amino-acid sequences of the HE proteins specified by the RBCV strains OK and LSU contained specific amino-acid changes in comparison with the EBCV LY strain, which may be responsible for the observed enzymic differences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that RBCV strains have evolved to selectivelyreplicate in respiratory tissues and that HE may play a role in this tissue tropism.","Lin, X Q; Chouljenko, V N; Kousoulas, K G; Storz, J",Journal of medical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11129725/,434

Clinical and laboratory parameters were prospectively collected at baseline, day 1, 2, 7 and 14. No moderate-to severe adverse events attributable to TCZ were recorded. RESULTS We observed a significant improvement in the levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer. The ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pa02) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fi02) improved (mean±SD Pa02/Fi02 at admission: 152±53; at day 7: 283.73 ± 115.9, at day 14: 302.2 ± 126, p<0.05). The overall mortality was 11%; D-dimer level at baseline, but not IL-6 levels were predictors of mortality. TCZ administration within 6 days from admission in the hospital was associated with an increased likelihood of survival (HR 2.2 95%CI 1.3-6.7, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS In hospitalised adult patients with severe COVID-19, TCZ could be a safe option. An improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters was observed.

202939,Physical Exercise and Immune System in the Elderly: Implications and Importance in COVID-19 Pandemic Period,2020,"KEY POINTS: Accumulation of inorganic phosphate, Pi , may contribute to muscle fatigue by precipitating calcium salts inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, SR. Direct demonstration of this process nor definition of the entry pathway of Pi into SR are fully established. We show that Pi promoted Ca2+ release at concentrations below 10 mm and decreased it at higher concentrations. This decrease correlated well with that of [Ca2+ ]SR . Pre-treatment of permeabilized myofibers with 2 mm Cl- channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) inhibited both effects of Pi . The biphasic dependence of Ca2+ release on [Pi ] is explained by a direct effect of Pi acting on the SR Ca2+ release channel, combined with the intra-SR precipitation of Ca2+ salts. 9AC effects demonstrates that Pi enters the SR via a Cl- pathway of as yet undefined molecular nature. ABSTRACT: Fatiguing exercise causes hydrolysis of phosphocreatine, increasing the intracellular concentration of inorganic phosphate (Pi ). Pi diffuses into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) where it is believed to forms insoluble Ca2+ salts, thus contributing to the impairment of Ca2+ release. Information on the Pi entrance pathway is still lacking. In amphibian muscles endowed with isoform 3 of the RyR channel, Ca2+ spark frequency is correlated with Ca2+ load of the SR and can be used to monitor this variable. We studied the effects of Pi on Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized fibres of the frog. Relative event frequency (f/fref ) rose with increasing [Pi ] reaching 2.54±1.6 at 5 mm and then decreased monotonically, reaching 0.09±0.03 at [Pi ] = 80 mm. Measurement of [Ca2+ ]SR confirmed a decrease correlated with spark frequency at high [Pi ]. A large [Ca2+ ]SR surge was observed upon Pi removal. Anion channels are a putative path for Pi into the SR. We tested the effect of chloride channel blocker 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid (9AC) on Pi entrance. 400 µm 9AC applied to the cytoplasm produced a non-significant increase in spark frequency and reduced the Pi effects on this parameter. Fibre treatment with 2 mm 9AC in the presence of high cytoplasmic Mg2+ suppressed Pi effects on [Ca2+ ]SR and spark frequency up to 55 mm Pi . These results suggest that chloride channels (or transporters) provide the main pathway of inorganic phosphate into the SR and confirm that it impairs Ca2+ release by accumulating and precipitating with Ca2+ inside the SR, thus contributing to myogenic fatigue.

203784,On Masochism: A Resident's Conflict Between Sacrifice and Self-Preservation During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then the novel coronavirus pneumonia disease has been spreading quickly and many countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran. Influenza virus has been known as a common pathogen in winter and it can cause pneumonia. It was found clinically that very few patients were diagnosed with both COVID-19 and influenza virus. A total of 5 of the 115 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were also diagnosed with influenza virus infection, with three cases being influenza A and two cases being influenza B. In this study, we describe the clinical characteristics of those patients who got infected with COVID-19 as well as influenza virus. Common symptoms at onset of illness included fever (five [100%] patients), cough (five [100%] patients), shortness of breath (five [100%] patients), nasal tampon (three [60%] patients), pharyngalgia (three [60%] patients), myalgia (two [40%] patients), fatigue (two [40%] patients), headache (two [40%] patients), and expectoration (two [40%] patients). The laboratory results showed that compared to the normal values, the patients' lymphocytes were reduced (four [80%] patients), and liver functions alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (two [40%] patients and two [40%] patients) and C-reactive protein (four [80%] patients) were increased when admitted to hospital. They stayed in the hospital for 14, 30, 17, 12, and 19 days (28.4 ± 7.02), respectively. The main complications for the patients were acute respiratory distress syndrome (one [20%] patients), acute liver injury (three [60%] patients), and diarrhea (two [40%] patients). All patients were given antiviral therapy (including oseltamivir), oxygen inhalation, and antibiotics. Three patients were treated with glucocorticoids including two treated with oral glucocorticoids. One of the five patients had transient hemostatic medication for hemoptysis. Fortunately, all patients did not need intensive care unit and were discharged from the hospital without death. In conclusion, those patients with both COVID-19 and influenza virus infection did not appear to show a more severe condition because based on the laboratory findings, imaging studies, and patient prognosis, they showed similar clinical characteristics as those patients with COVID-19 infection only. However, it is worth noting that the symptoms of nasal tampon and pharyngalgia may be more prone to appear for those coinfection patients.","Ding, Qiang; Lu, Panpan; Fan, Yuhui; Xia, Yujia; Liu, Mei",J Med Virol,,434
203909,Rapid Dissemination of a COVID-19 Airway Management Simulation Using a Train-the-Trainers Curriculum,2021,"We analyze the dynamics of a population of independent random walkers on a graph and develop a simple model of epidemic spreading. We assume that each walker visits independently the nodes of a finite ergodic graph in a discrete-time markovian walk governed by his specific transition matrix. With this assumption, we first derive an upper bound for the reproduction numbers. Then we assume that a walker is in one of the states: susceptible, infectious, or recovered. An infectious walker remains infectious during a certain characteristic time. If an infectious walker meets a susceptible one on the same node there is a certain probability for the susceptible walker to get infected. By implementing this hypothesis in computer simulations we study the space-time evolution of the emerging infection patterns. Generally, random walk approaches seem to have a large potential to study epidemic spreading and to identify the pertinent parameters in epidemic dynamics.","Bestehorn, Michael; Riascos, Alejandro P.; Michelitsch, Thomas M.; Collet, Bernard A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07731v1.pdf,434

Public engagement with this public health tool has been low, limiting the effectiveness of the intervention. This study examines physician knowledge of the app and practice patterns in relation to the app. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional self-administered online English language survey of physicians and medical students in Alberta, Canada. The survey link was sent to all registered members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and was distributed by other provincial physician organizations and health zone leaders. RESULTS: The survey received 317 responses. 96% of participants were aware of the app but only 27% had recommended the app to patients. The most common reason provided for not downloading or recommending the app was that participants had security concerns about the app. 23% of participants indicated they did not believe they had a responsibility to recommend the app to others. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides insights into participants' knowledge and beliefs about the ABTraceTogether app. This information may be valuable to public health officials who wish to engage physicians in future public health campaigns.","Jerome, D; Pietrosanu, M; Dhillon, K",J. public health (Oxf),,434

Symptoms were similar to an episode of travel-provoked pulmonary embolism 3 years prior. She denied chest pain, cough, fever, extremity complaints and symptoms at rest. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, her healthcare system was using secure telemedicine to evaluate non-critical complaints. During the initial video visit, she appeared well, conversing normally without laboured breathing. An elevated serum D-dimer prompted CT pulmonary angiography, which identified acute lobar pulmonary embolism. After haematology consultation and telephone conversation with the patient, her physician prescribed rivaroxaban. Her symptoms rapidly improved. She had an uneventful course and is continuing anticoagulation indefinitely. The pandemic has increased the application of telemedicine for acute care complaints.

The main goal of this work is to perform the image inpainting process from a set of sparsely distributed image samples with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique. As, in its naive formulation, the SPH technique is not even capable of reproducing constant functions, we modify the approach to obtain an approximation which can reproduce constant and linear functions. Furthermore, we examine the use of Voronoi tessellation for defining the necessary parameters in the SPH method as well as selecting optimally located image samples. In addition to this spatial optimization, optimization of data values is also implemented in order to further improve the results. Apart from a traditional Gaussian smoothing kernel, we assess the performance of other kernels on both random and spatially optimized masks. Since the use of isotropic smoothing kernels is not optimal in the presence of objects with a clear preferred orientation in the image, we also examine anisotropic smoothing kernels. Our final algorithm can compete with well-performing sparse inpainting techniques based on homogeneous or anisotropic diffusion processes as well as with exemplar-based approaches.","Daropoulos, Viktor; Augustin, Matthias; Weickert, Joachim",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.11289v4.pdf,434
206011,Smartphone data during the COVID-19 pandemic can quantify behavioral changes in people with ALS,2020,"Most COVID-19 predictive modeling efforts use statistical or mathematical models to predict national- and state-level COVID-19 cases or deaths in the future. These approaches assume parameters such as reproduction time, test positivity rate, hospitalization rate, and social intervention effectiveness (masking, distancing, and mobility) are constant. However, the one certainty with the COVID-19 pandemic is that these parameters change over time, as well as vary across counties and states. In fact, the rate of spread over region, hospitalization rate, hospital length of stay and mortality rate, the proportion of the population that is susceptible, test positivity rate, and social behaviors can all change significantly over time. Thus, the quantification of uncertainty becomes critical in making meaningful and accurate forecasts of the future. Bayesian approaches are a natural way to fully represent this uncertainty in mathematical models and have become particularly popular in physics and engineering models. The explicit integration time varying parameters and uncertainty quantification into a hierarchical Bayesian forecast model differentiates the Mayo COVID-19 model from other forecasting models. By accounting for all sources of uncertainty in both parameter estimation as well as future trends with a Bayesian approach, the Mayo COVID-19 model accurately forecasts future cases and hospitalizations, as well as the degree of uncertainty. This approach has been remarkably accurate and a linchpin in Mayo Clinic's response to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The model accurately predicted timing and extent of the summer and fall surges at Mayo Clinic sites, allowing hospital leadership to manage resources effectively to provide a successful pandemic response. This model has also proven to be very useful to the state of Minnesota to help guide difficult policy decisions.","Storlie, Curtis B.; Rojas, Ricardo L.; Demuth, Gabriel O.; Pollock, Benjamin D.; Johnson, Patrick W.; Wilson, Patrick M.; Heinzen, Ethan P.; Liu, Hongfang; Carter, Rickey E.; Dowdy, Sean C.; Dunlay, Shannon M.; Habermann, Elizabeth B.; Kor, Daryl J.; Neville, Matthew R.; Limper, Andrew H.; Noe, Katherine H.; Bydon, Mohamad; Franco, Pablo Moreno; Sampathkumar, Priya; Shah, Nilay D.; Ting, Henry H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04033v1.pdf,434

The main complication of desmopressin treatment in DI is dilutional hyponatraemia. Since plasma sodium monitoring is not always possible in times of COVID-19, we recommend to delay the desmopressin dose once a week until aquaresis occurs allowing excess retained water to be excreted. Patients should measure their body weight daily. Patients with DI admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 have a high risk for mortality due to volume depletion. Specialists must supervise fluid replacement and dosing of desmopressin. Patients after pituitary surgery should drink to thirst and measure their body weight daily to early recognize the development of the postoperative syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). They should know hyponatraemia symptoms. The prevalence of hyponatraemia in patients with pneumonia due to COVID-19 is not yet known, but seems to be low. In contrast, hypernatraemia may develop in COVID-19 patients in ICU, from different multifactorial reasons, for example, due to insensible water losses from pyrexia, increased respiration rate and use of diuretics. Hypernatraemic dehydration may contribute to the high risk of acute kidney injury in COVID-19. IV fluid replacement should be administered with caution in severe cases of COVID-19 because of the risk of pulmonary oedema.","Christ-Crain, Mirjam; Hoorn, Ewout J; Sherlock, Mark; Thompson, Chris J; Wass, John A H",Eur J Endocrinol,,434

Most reports of COVID-19 highlight fever and upper respiratory symptoms as the dominant initial presentations, consistent with the World Health Organization guidelines regarding suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, atypical presentations of this disease have been evolving since the initial outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019. We report a case of an older male patient who presented at our hospital with an unusual manifestation of COVID-19. DESIGN: Brief report. SETTING: A university hospital in Saudi Arabia. PARTICIPANT: A 73-year-old man who presented with confusion in the absence of any respiratory symptoms or fever. INTERVENTION: The patient was initially admitted with delirium and underwent a further work-up. MEASUREMENTS: Given his recent history of domestic travel and the declaration of a global COVID-19 pandemic status, the patient was administered a swab test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The patient's positive test led to a diagnosis of COVID-19. Although he began to experience a spiking fever and mild upper respiratory symptoms, he recovered rapidly with no residual sequela. CONCLUSION: The recognition of atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, such as delirium, is critical to the timely diagnosis, provision of appropriate care, and avoidance of outbreaks within healthcare facilities during this pandemic.

The aim of this study was to microscopically analyse osteotomized humerus of birds following the insertion of solid laser-sintered polyamide 12 rods in order to detect foreign body reaction and, thus, verify the bioinert property of the material in the bone fracture environment. Polyamide 12 intramedullary rods were inserted into the osteotomized humerus of 10 birds (white Plymouth Rock) and blocked using 2mm diameter cortical screws of varying lengths. The birds were operated at 60 days of age and monitored post-operatively for three months. Animals were euthanized at 150 days old and samples of the operated humerus collected for immunohistochemistry, light and scanning electron microscopy analysis. Results show bone consolidation without rejection of the implant and absence of inflammatory cells. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) was expressed in the endothelial cells of the blood vessels at the site of the newly formed bone surrounding the implant, indicative of local angiogenesis. There was no bone growth on the surface of the rod; however, the implant did not interfere with the circumjacent bone repair. Thus, the findings of this study corroborate with the literature in characterizing polyamide as a bioinert material and, under the studied conditions, it can be concluded that polyamide 12 intramedullary rod is biocompatible and provides adequate bone consolidation in humeral fractures with no signs of rejection.(AU)","Dias, Romim G; Magalhães, Georgia M; Dias, Luís Gustavo G.

Association of self-perceptions of aging, personal and family resources and loneliness with psychological distress during the lock-down period of COVID-19",2020,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is caused by a mutant biotype of the feline enteric coronavirus. The resulting FIP virus (FIPV) commonly causes central nervous system (CNS) and ocular pathology in cases of noneffusive disease. Over 95% of cats with FIP will succumb to disease in days to months after diagnosis despite a variety of historically used treatments. Recently developed antiviral drugs have shown promise in treatment of nonneurological FIP, but data from neurological FIP cases are limited. Four cases of naturally occurring FIP with CNS involvement were treated with the antiviral nucleoside analogue GS-441524 (5-10 mg/kg) for at least 12 weeks. Cats were monitored serially with physical, neurologic, and ophthalmic examinations. One cat had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (including feline coronavirus [FCoV]) titers and FCoV reverse transcriptase [RT]-PCR) and serial ocular imaging using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). All cats had a positive response to treatment. Three cats are alive off treatment (528, 516, and 354 days after treatment initiation) with normal physical and neurologic examinations. One cat was euthanized 216 days after treatment initiation following relapses after primary and secondary treatment. In 1 case, resolution of disease was defined based on normalization of MRI and CSF findings and resolution of cranial and caudal segment disease with ocular imaging. Treatment with GS-441524 shows clinical efficacy and may result in clearance and long-term resolution of neurological FIP. Dosages required for CNS disease may be higher than those used for nonneurological FIP.","Dickinson, Peter J; Bannasch, Michael; Thomasy, Sara M; Murthy, Vishal D; Vernau, Karen M; Liepnieks, Molly; Montgomery, Elizabeth; Knickelbein, Kelly E; Murphy, Brian; Pedersen, Niels C",J Vet Intern Med,,434

In order to minimise the number of hospital visits for patients receiving durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic we implemented 4-weekly (20 mg/kg) durvalumab in place of 2-weekly infusions at The Royal Marsden Hospital. We assessed the potential impact of the safety of a 4-weekly schedule in patients receiving adjuvant durvalumab. We carried out a retrospective study of 40 patients treated with 2-weekly and 4-weekly infusions of durvalumab prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical documentation was analysed from 216 consultations across 40 patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab and 66 consultations of 14 patients who switched from 2-weekly to 4-weekly durvalumab during the COVID-19 pandemic. In patients receiving 2-weekly durvalumab, the rate of grade 3 and 4 toxicities was 15 % compared to 7% in patients receiving 4-weekly durvalumab. Pre-existing autoimmune disease was considered a risk factor for the development of grade 3 or 4 toxicities.

However, limited data exists about vaccine concerns among Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). METHODS: Data from the COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of AAPI Survey Study (COMPASS), a cross-sectional, national survey for AAPI adults in the U.S. were used (N=1,646). Descriptive statistics were used to assess sample characteristics including proportions of AAPI with various COVID-19 vaccine concerns, categorized as none, side-effects only, unsafe only, and multiple reasons, and differences in vaccine concerns by socio-demographics. Ordinary multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between a characteristic and having any vaccine concerns. RESULTS: Overall, 76% of the respondents reported having at &#8805;1 concerns about the vaccine. The most common concern was side effects (65%). Vietnamese Americans reported less concerns (vs. Chinese Americans). Those who were 30-39 and 40-49 years old (vs. <30), females (vs. males), and experienced mild negative impacts from COVID-19 on family income/employment (vs. no change) reported more concerns about the vaccine. Those who had less vaccine concerns were those who reported higher (vs. low) health status, &#8805;60 years old (vs. <30), and separated/divorced/widowed (vs. single). DISCUSSION: AAPI is a diverse population and this study revealed differences in vaccine concerns across AAPI groups. Findings revealed potential targets for patient education needs. Effective strategies to address various vaccine concerns across subgroups of AAPI will be crucial to ensure equity in vaccination uptake.","Ta Park, Van; Dougan, Marcelle; Meyer, Oanh; Nam, Bora; Tzuang, Marian; Park, Linda; Vuong, Quyen; Tsoh, Janice",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,434

We explore how social media discourse about COVID-19 in Italy was affected by the rapid spread of the virus, and how themes in postings changed with the adoption of social distancing measures and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). We used topic modeling and social network analysis to highlight critical dimensions of conversations around COVID-19: 1) topics in social media postings about the Coronavirus; 2) the scope and reach of social networks; and 3) changes in social media content as the nation moved from partial to full social distancing. Twitter messages sent in Italy between February 11th and March 10th, 2020. 74,306 Tweets sent by institutions, news sources, elected officials, scientists and social media influencers. Messages were retweeted more than 1.2 million times globally. Non-parametric chi-square statistic with residual analysis to identify categories, chi-square test for linear trend, and Social Network Graphing. The first phase of the pandemic was dominated by social media influencers, followed by a focus on the economic consequences of the virus and placing blame on immigrants. As the crisis deepened, science-based themes began to predominate, with a focus on reducing the spread of the virus through physical distancing and business closures Our findings highlight the importance of messaging in social media in gaining the public's trust and engagement during a pandemic. This requires credible scientific voices to garner public support for effective mitigation. Fighting the spread of an infectious disease goes hand in hand with stemming the dissemination of lies, bad science, and misdirection.","Massaro, Maurizio; Tamburro, Paola; La Torre, Matteo; Dal Mas, Francesca; Thomas, Ronald; Cobianchi, Lorenzo; Barach, Paul",J Med Syst,,434

The use of PP in awake spontaneous breathing patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 was reported to improve oxygenation in few retrospective trials with small sample size. High-level evidence of awake PP for hypoxaemic patients with COVID-19 patients is still lacking. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The protocol of this meta-trial is a prospective collaborative individual participant data meta-analysis of randomised controlled open label superiority trials. This design is particularly adapted to a rapid scientific response in the pandemic setting. It will take place in multiple sites, among others in USA, Canada, Ireland, France and Spain. Patients will be followed up for 28 days. Patients will be randomised to receive whether awake PP and nasal high flow therapy or standard medical treatment and nasal high flow therapy. Primary outcome is defined as the occurrence rate of tracheal intubation or death up to day 28. An interim analysis plan has been set up on aggregated data from the participating research groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approvals were obtained in all participating countries. Results of the meta-trial will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

211447,Intolerance of uncertainty and reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Tracking SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is strongly indicated because diversifying selection may lead to the emergence of novel variants resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced immunity. To monitor New York City (NYC) for the presence of novel variants, we amplified regions of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein gene from RNA acquired from all 14 NYC wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and ascertained the diversity of lineages from these samples using high throughput sequencing. Here we report the detection and increasing frequencies of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages not recognized in GISAIDs EpiCoV database. These lineages contain mutations rarely observed in clinical samples, including Q493K, Q498Y, H519N and T572N. Many of these mutations were found to expand the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses by allowing infection of cells expressing the human, mouse, or rat ACE2 receptor. In addition, pseudoviruses containing the Spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were found to be resistant to many different classes of receptor binding domain (RBD) binding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. We offer several hypotheses for the anomalous presence of these mutations, including the possibility of a non-human animal reservoir. Although wastewater sampling cannot provide direct inference of SARS-CoV-2 clinical sequences, our research revealed several lineages that could be relevant to public health and they would not have been discovered if not for wastewater surveillance.","Smyth, Davida S; Trujillo, Monica; Gregory, Devon A; Cheung, Kristen; Gao, Anna; Graham, Maddie; Guan, Yue; Guldenpfennig, Caitlyn; Hoxie, Irene; Kannoly, Sherin; Kubota, Nanami; Lyddon, Terri D; Markman, Michelle; Rushford, Clayton; San, Kaung Myat; Sompanya, Geena; Spagnolo, Fabrizio; Suarez, Reinier; Teixeiro, Emma; Daniels, Mark; Johnson, Marc; Dennehy, John J",,,434

An international comparative study using change point analysis,2021,"We aimed to explore university students' perceptions and experiences of SARS-CoV-2 mass asymptomatic testing, social distancing and self-isolation, during the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised of four rapid online focus groups conducted at a higher education institution in England, during high alert (tier 2) national COVID-19 restrictions. Participants were purposively sampled university students (n = 25) representing a range of gender, age, living circumstances (on/off campus), and SARS-CoV-2 testing/self-isolation experiences. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Six themes with 16 sub-themes emerged from the analysis of the qualitative data: 'Term-time Experiences', 'Risk Perception and Worry', 'Engagement in Protective Behaviours', 'Openness to Testing', 'Barriers to Testing' and 'General Wellbeing'. Students described feeling safe on campus, believed most of their peers are adherent to protective behaviours and were positive towards asymptomatic testing in university settings. University communications about COVID-19 testing and social behaviours need to be timely and presented in a more inclusive way to reach groups of students who currently feel marginalised. Barriers to engagement with SARS-CoV-2 testing, social distancing and self-isolation were primarily associated with fear of the mental health impacts of self-isolation, including worry about how they will cope, high anxiety, low mood, guilt relating to impact on others and loneliness. Loneliness in students could be mitigated through increased intra-university communications and a focus on establishment of low COVID-risk social activities to help students build and enhance their social support networks. These findings are particularly pertinent in the context of mass asymptomatic testing programmes being implemented in educational settings and high numbers of students being required to self-isolate. Universities need to determine the support needs of students during self-isolation and prepare for the long-term impacts of the pandemic on student mental health and welfare support services.","Blake, Holly; Knight, Holly; Jia, Ru; Corner, Jessica; Morling, Joanne R; Denning, Chris; Ball, Jonathan K; Bolton, Kirsty; Figueredo, Grazziela; Morris, David E; Tighe, Patrick; Villalon, Armando Mendez; Ayling, Kieran; Vedhara, Kavita",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,434

We also extracted modules from a COVID-19 dataset and analyzed a suspected set of genes that may be associated with this deadly disease. We used information available for two other viruses that cause SARS and MERS because their physiology is similar to that of the COVID-19 virus. We report several crucial genes associated with COVID-19: RPA2, POLD4, MAPK8, IRF7, JUN, NFKB1, NFKBIA, CD40LG, FASLG, ICAM1, LIFR, STAT2 and CCR1.

212310,The Exceptional Preventive Agreement: Legal Solution for Companies in Crisis Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic? (preprint),2021,"OBJECTIVES: Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a potentially severe complication of COVID-19 most commonly resulting in respiratory failure. This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients. METHODS: Five single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period. In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients. RESULTS: Non-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE. The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF&#945;, IFNÎ³ and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. All patients demonstrated significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF&#945;. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with Penn class 3 and 4 CRS complicating COVID-19, TPE demonstrated a prompt improvement in oxygenation and reduction in cytokine load without compromising patient safety. As this pilot study was envisioned to be hypothesis generating, expanded trials using TPE alone and in conjunction with novel pharmacologic agents are warranted.

MIS-C presents with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). We aimed to better understand this cytokine storm syndrome by comparing the initial laboratory findings of MIS-C and MAS. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with MAS due to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in our clinic between March 2002 and November 2020 and with MIS-C between 20 September and 20 October 2020 were enrolled into the study. The medical files of all patients were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 13 MAS (9 boys, 4 girls) and 26 MIS-C (16 boys,10 girls) patients were included in the study. Hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, fibrinogen and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels showed significant differences between the two groups (P < 0.05). Patients with MAS had lower hemoglobin (10.10 g/dL) and fibrinogen (2.72 g/dL), but higher ferritin (17 863 mg/dL) and LDH (890.61 U/L) at the time of diagnosis. Patients with MIS-C had higher absolute neutrophil count (12 180/mm3 ) and CRP (194.23 mg/dL) values, but lower absolute lymphocyte count (1140/mm3 ) at the time of diagnosis. Left ventricle ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MIS-C group in echocardiographic evaluation (P < 0.001).

Management of patients complicated with neurological illness requiring neurocritical care is challenging during this time. Patients with neurological disease may develop COVID-19 infection or there could be independent neurological manifestations of COVID-19. Critically ill neurological patients are more vulnerable to contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, neurological patients with comorbidities and multisystem involvement are at increased risk of adverse outcomes. Though SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects the pulmonary system, it can complicate the assessment and management of neurological patients. With increasing COVID-19 numbers, the hospitalizations of both non-COVID and COVID-19 neurological patients will bring significant strain on the hospital and neurocritical care facilities. Streamlining work pattern, understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its impact on neurological function, establishing general and specific neurocritical care management strategies, ensuring protection and well-being of health care providers, and implementing effective infection control policies are key elements of efficient neurocritical care management during this pandemic.

213922,Sexuality during the COVID-19 pandemic: the importance of Internet,2021,"SARS-CoV-2, causing the lethal disease COVid-19, is a public health emergency in the 2020 global pandemic. The outbreak and fast spreading of SARS-CoV-2 have a high morbidity and mortality specifically in elder patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and organ transplanted patients with immunosuppressive therapy. Preliminary results support different treatments such as chloroquine and convalescent plasma infusion in severe cases, with good outcome. On the other hand, the efficacy of supplementation with active vitamin D, an immunomodulator hormone with antiinflammatory and antimicrobial effects, is unproven. A recent study reported that vitamin D attains antiviral effects, via blocking viral replication directly. SARS-CoV-2 primarily uses the immune evasion process during infection via the envelope spike glycoprotein, which is followed by a cytokine storm, causing severe acute respiratory disease syndrome and death. SARS-CoV-2, by using the well-known angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 by the protein spike, as the host receptor to enter into alveolar, myocardial, and renal epithelial cells, can be disrupted by vitamin D. However, the correlation between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 deaths in previous studies was insignificant. Retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find this correlation. Studies have shown that, vitamin D reduces the risk of acute viral respiratory tract infections and pneumonia via direct inhibition of viral replication, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The data available today regarding the beneficial protective effect of vitamin D is unclear and with conflicting results. Large randomized control trials are necessary to test this hypothesis. In this review, we will explain the cross talk between the active vitamin D and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and summarize the data from the literature.","Farid, Nakhoul; Rola, Nakhoul; Koch, Elias A T; Nakhoul, Nakhoul",Ir. j. med. sci,,434

Students in nursing programs represent several generational cohorts with varying learning styles and comfort with technology. This move to an online format required faculty and students to use digital tools from video conferencing, remote testing, online classes, and an unfolding case study. Community Health Nursing is an important capstone course in the Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing curriculum. Community health nursing focuses on the care of populations. Communication skills, analysis of data from various sources, collaboration with peers, and planning and evaluation of interventions are essential competencies of community health nursing. This article describes strategies to teach the core competencies online and how two group activities were formatted for online delivery: development of a public service announcement and a debate. The faculty employed an approach to online teaching that preserved the activities and fostered student engagement through the use of various online strategies.","Pullis, Bridgette Crotwell; Hekel, Barbara Emily",Public health nurs,,434

These changes required that students adapt and alter their daily routines accordingly. To investigate patterns associated with these behavioral changes, we collected smartphone sensing data using the Beiwe platform from two groups of undergraduate students at a major North American university, one from January to March of 2020 (74 participants), the other from May to August (52 participants), to observe the differences in students' daily life patterns before and after the start of the pandemic. In this paper, we focus on the mobility patterns evidenced by GPS signal tracking from the students' smartphones and report findings using several analytical methods including principal component analysis, circadian rhythm analysis, and predictive modeling of perceived sadness levels using mobility-based digital metrics. Our findings suggest that compared to the pre-COVID group, students in the mid-COVID group generally (1) registered a greater amount of midday movement than movement in the morning (8-10am) and in the evening (7-9pm), as opposed to the other way around; (2) exhibited significantly less intradaily variability in their daily movement, and (3) had a significant lower correlation between their mobility patterns and negative mood.","Wu, Congyu; Fritz, Hagen; Craddock, Cameron; Kinney, Kerry; Castelli, Darla; Schnyer, David M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04137v1.pdf,434
214983,"COVID-19, a tale of two pandemics: novel coronavirus and fake news messaging",2020,"BACKGROUND: The degree to which children experience unmet need for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with pandemic-related household job or income loss are unknown. METHODS: The authors performed a cross-sectional household survey of 348 families in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from June 25 through July 2, 2020. Unmet need for child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss were assessed using caregiver self-report. RESULTS: Caregivers reported that the greatest unmet child health care need during the COVID-19 pandemic was dental care (16%), followed by medical care for a well visit or vaccination (5%). Approximately 40% of caregivers reported job loss or a decrease in household income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors found a significant association between the probability of unmet child dental care and pandemic-related household job or income loss (P = .022). Losing a job or experiencing a decrease in income due to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with unmet child dental care (relative risk, 1.77;95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.88). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, 3 times as many households reported unmet dental care for a child compared with unmet medical care. Unmet child dental care was more common in households where pandemic-related job or income loss occurred. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: If unmet dental care continues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, nontraditional strategies for delivering dental care can be considered to improve access to dental care for children, such as teledentistry and oral health prevention services in primary care settings.","Burgette, J.

Repurposed anti-viral drugs have played a huge role in combating the virus, and most recently, dexamethasone (Dex) have shown its therapeutic activity in severe cases of COVID-19 patients. The study sought to provide insights on the anti-COVID-19 mechanism of Dex at both atomic and molecular level against SARS-CoV-2 targets. Computational methods were employed to predict the binding affinity of Dex to SARS-CoV-2 using the Schrodinger suite (v2020-2). The target molecules and ligand (Dex) were retrieved from PDB and PubChem, respectively. The selected targets were SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), and host secreted molecules glucocorticoid receptor, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6). Critical analyses such as Protein and ligand preparation, molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), and toxicity analyses were performed using the targets and the ligand as inputs. Dex showed stronger affinity to its theoretical (glucocorticoid) receptor with a superior docking score of -14.7 and a good binding energy value of -147.48 kcal/mol; while short hydrogen bond distances were observed in both Mpro and IL-6 when compared to glucocorticoid receptor. Based on these findings, Dex-target complexes were used to perform MD simulations to analyze Dex stability at 50 ns. This study demonstrates that Dex could bind to both the viral and host receptors as a potential drug candidate for COVID-19. To ascertain the biological fitness of this study, other SARS-CoV-2 targets should be explored. Also, the in vitro studies of dexamethasone against several SARS-CoV-2 targets warrant further investigation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

216463,Staying at Home Is a Privilege: Evidence from Fine-Grained Mobile Phone Location Data in the United States during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Synbiotics are food supplements that combine probiotics and prebiotics to synergistically elicit a health effect in humans. Lactobacillus plantarum exhibits a remarkable genetic and phenotypic diversity, in particular in strain-specific carbohydrate utilization capacities and several strains are marketed as probiotics. We have screened 77 L. plantarum strains for their capacity to utilize specific prebiotic fibers, revealing variable and strain-specific growth efficiencies on isomalto- and galacto-oligosaccharides. We identified a single strain within the screening panel that was able to effectively utilize inulin and FOS, which did not support efficient growth of the rest of the strains. In our panel tested, we did not find strains that could utilize arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides or sulfated fucoidan. The strain-specific growth phenotype on isomalto-oligosaccharides was further analyzed using high performance anion exchange chromatography and revealed distinct substrate utilization phenotypes within the strain panel. The strain-specific phenotypes could be linked to the strain's genotypes identifying gene clusters encoding for carbohydrate membrane transport systems that are predicted to be involved in the utilization of isomaltose and other (unidentified) oligosaccharides in the isomalto-oligosaccharide substrate.IMPORTANCE Synbiotics combine the concepts of prebiotics and probiotics to synergistically enhance the health benefits associated with these ingredients. Lactobacillus plantarum is encountered as a natural inhabitant of gastrointestinal tract and specific strains are marketed as a probiotic based on their strain-specific health-promoting activities. Strain-specific stimulation of growth through prebiotic substrates could enhance the persistence and/or activity of L. plantarum in situ Our study establishes a high-throughput screening model for prebiotic substrate utilization by individual strains of bacteria, which can be readily employed for synbiotic match-making approaches that aim to enhance the intestinal delivery of probiotics through strain-specific, selective growth stimulation.","Fuhren, Jori; Rösch, Christiane; Ten Napel, Maud; Schols, Henk A; Kleerebezem, Michiel",,,434
216527,Psychological responses during the COVID-19 outbreak among university students in Bangladesh,2020,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to train decision-making models in complex environments. However, RL can be slow as it requires repeated interaction with a simulation of the environment. In particular, there are key system engineering bottlenecks when using RL in complex environments that feature multiple agents with high-dimensional state, observation, or action spaces. We present WarpDrive, a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use open-source RL framework that implements end-to-end deep multi-agent RL on a single GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), built on PyCUDA and PyTorch. Using the extreme parallelization capability of GPUs, WarpDrive enables orders-of-magnitude faster RL compared to common implementations that blend CPU simulations and GPU models. Our design runs simulations and the agents in each simulation in parallel. It eliminates data copying between CPU and GPU. It also uses a single simulation data store on the GPU that is safely updated in-place. WarpDrive provides a lightweight Python interface and flexible environment wrappers that are easy to use and extend. Together, this allows the user to easily run thousands of concurrent multi-agent simulations and train on extremely large batches of experience. Through extensive experiments, we verify that WarpDrive provides high-throughput and scales almost linearly to many agents and parallel environments. For example, WarpDrive yields 2.9 million environment steps/second with 2000 environments and 1000 agents (at least 100x higher throughput compared to a CPU implementation) in a benchmark Tag simulation. As such, WarpDrive is a fast and extensible multi-agent RL platform to significantly accelerate research and development.","Lan, Tian; Srinivasa, Sunil; Wang, Huan; Zheng, Stephan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13976v3.pdf,434

To the best of the authors knowledge, to this date very little data exists on COVID-19 in a pediatric patient with liver transplantation. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a three year-old boy who had liver transplantation at 18 months old. He was admitted due to dyspnea with impression of acute respiratory distress syndrome and was then transferred to the intensive care unit. Chest X-ray at admission showed bilateral infiltration. Vancomycin, meropenem, azithromycin, voriconazole and co-trimoxazole were started from the first day of admission. On day 4 of admission, with suspicion of COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and oseltamivir were added to the antibiotic regimen. PCR was positive for COVID-19. The patient developed multi-organ failure and died on day 6 of admission. CONCLUSIONS: For pediatric patients with organ transplantations, extreme caution should be taken, to limit and prevent their contact with COVID-19 during the outbreak, as these patients are highly susceptible to severe forms of the disease.","Nikoupour, Hamed; Kazemi, Kourosh; Arasteh, Peyman; Ghazimoghadam, Saba; Eghlimi, Hesameddin; Dara, Naghi; Gholami, Siavash; Nikeghbalian, Saman",BMC Surg,,434

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 µM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 µM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data demonstrate that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.","Pruijssers, Andrea J; George, Amelia S; Schäfer, Alexandra; Leist, Sarah R; Gralinksi, Lisa E; Dinnon, Kenneth H; Yount, Boyd L; Agostini, Maria L; Stevens, Laura J; Chappell, James D; Lu, Xiaotao; Hughes, Tia M; Gully, Kendra; Martinez, David R; Brown, Ariane J; Graham, Rachel L; Perry, Jason K; Du Pont, Venice; Pitts, Jared; Ma, Bin; Babusis, Darius; Murakami, Eisuke; Feng, Joy Y; Bilello, John P; Porter, Danielle P; Cihlar, Tomas; Baric, Ralph S; Denison, Mark R; Sheahan, Timothy P",Cell Rep,,434

219507,"Correction to: Rapid, Full-Scale Change to Virtual PCIT During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implementation and Clinical Implications",2021,"BACKGROUND: Decision-making in end-stage dementia (ESD) is a complex process involving medical, social, legal and ethical issues. In ESD, the person suffers from severe cognitive problems leading to a loss of capacity to decide matters regarding health and end-of-life issues. The decisional responsibility is usually passed to clinicians and relatives who can face significant difficulty in making moral decisions, particularly in the presence of life-threatening swallowing problems. AIM: This study aimed to understand the decision-making processes of clinical teams and relatives in addressing life-threatening swallowing difficulties in ESD in long-term care in Malta. METHOD: The study followed a qualitative approach where six case studies, involving six different teams and relatives of six different patients, were interviewed retrospectively to understand their decision-making in connection with the management of swallowing difficulties in ESD. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with each stakeholder. All data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: the vulnerability of patients in dementia decision-making; the difficult role of relatives in decision-making; the decisional conflict between aggressive care through tube feeding versus oral comfort feeding; a consensus-building decision-making process as ideal to facilitate agreement and respect for patient's dignity. CONCLUSION: Decision-making to manage swallowing difficulties in ESD is a challenging process, which involves an interpretation of personal values, beliefs, patient preferences, care needs and clinical practice. Better communication between clinicians and relatives in dementia helps promote agreement between stakeholders leading to a care plan that respects the dignity of patients at their end of life.","Dimech, Joseph; Agius, Emmanuel; Hughes, Julian C; Bartolo, Paul",J. med. ethics,,434

A whole range of human activities has been suspended Monday 17 March 2020 in all French regions. Since then experiments are progressing to reflect the effectiveness of reduced emissions. In this paper, we looked at variations of pollutants prior to, during and after containment period. In a first step, we proved through experiments on eight air pollutants, how all daily maximum pollutants concentration have decreased during containment phase, apart from the ozone pollutant O3. This Ozone pollutant has indeed increased by 27.19% during lockdown period and kept growing by 21.35% as well right after deconfinement. Indeed, the maximum daily concentrations detected in different regions of France, have decreased by 18.18%, 37.14%, 20.36%, 9.28%, 44.38%, 5.1% and 44.38%, respectively, for the pollutants SO2, NO2, CO, C6H6, NOX, PM2.5 and PM10. Declining levels of other pollutants, however, were not sustained after deconfinement for NO2, NOX and PM10. We have reinforced these findings by classifying each pollutant according to the ATMO and AQI indexes, to better visualize their criticality throughout the three lockdown phases (Pre/During/Post). The family of air pollutant variables with their associated geographical sources was thereafter exploited to justify their approximate contribution to the daily mortality rates associated to COVID-19 across all French regions. However, more thorough study is still in progress to validate this finding. Finally, coming up to the abrupt changes in airborne pollutants experienced in this period, a question about future climate crisis was raised again. Whereby a weighting study has shown the current and very short-term French scenario (Status-Quo) in view of its current environmental path, the political responses made towards future climate change crisis and French investments done in this sense.","Ikhlasse, Hamzaoui; Benjamin, Duthil; Vincent, Courboulay; Hicham, Medromi",Environ Dev Sustain,,434

Previous data showed that men are more affected than women by COVID-19, then we hypothesized whether sex hormones could be protecting the female organism against the infection. VERO E6 cells have been commonly used as in vitro model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our experimental approach, we have treated VERO E6 cells with 17ß-estradiol to evaluate the modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cell line. Here we demonstrated that estrogen protein receptors ER&#945;, ERß, and GPER1 are expressed by VERO E6 cells and could be used to study the effects of this steroid hormone. Previous and 24-hours post-infection, cells treated with 17ß-estradiol revealed a reduction in the viral load. Afterward, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection per se results in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 increased gene expression in VERO E6-cell, which could be generating a cycle of virus infection in host cells. The estrogen treatment reduces the levels of the TMPRSS2, which are involved with SARS-CoV-2 infectiveness capacity, and hence, reducing the pathogenicity/genesis. These data suggest that estrogen could be a potential therapeutic target promoting cell protection against SARS-CoV-2. This opens new possibilities for further studies on 17ß-estradiol in human cell lines infected by SARS-CoV-2 and at least in part, explain why men developed a more severe COVID-19 compared to women.","Lemes, Robertha Mariana Rodrigues; Costa, Angelica Jardim; Bartolomeo, Cynthia Silva; Bassani, Taysa Bervian; Nishino, Michelle Sayuri; Pereira, Gustavo Jose da Silva; Smaili, Soraya Soubhi; Maciel, Rui Monteiro de Barros; Braconi, Carla Torres; da Cruz, Edgar Ferreira; Ramirez, Ana Lopez; Maricatto, Juliana Terzi; Janini, Luiz Mario Ramos; Prado, Carla Máximo; Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes",Physiol Rep,,434
221440,Viral Evolution will Automatically Resolve COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: The novel coronavirus pandemic has affected Brazil's Santa Catarina State (SC) severely. At the time of writing (24 March 2021), over 764,000 cases and over 9,800 deaths by COVID-19 have been confirmed, hospitals were fully occupied with local news reporting at least 397 people in the waiting list for an ICU bed. In an attempt to better inform local policy making, we applied an existing Bayesian algorithm to model the spread of the pandemic in the seven geographic macro-regions of the state. Here we propose changes to extend the model and improve its forecasting capabilities. Methods: Our four proposed variations of the original method allow accessing data of daily reported infections and take into account under-reporting of cases more explicitly. Two of the proposed versions also attempt to model the delay in test reporting. We simulated weekly forecasting of deaths from the period from 31/05/2020 until 31/01/2021. First week data were used as a cold-start to the algorithm, after which weekly calibrations of the model were able to converge in fewer iterations. Google Mobility data were used as covariates to the model, as well as to estimate of the susceptible population at each simulated run. Findings: The changes made the model significantly less reactive and more rapid in adapting to scenarios after a peak in deaths is observed. Assuming that the cases are under-reported greatly benefited the model in its stability, and modelling retroactively-added data (due to the""hot""nature of the data used) had a negligible impact in performance. Interpretation: Although not as reliable as death statistics, case statistics, when modelled in conjunction with an overestimate parameter, provide a good alternative for improving the forecasting of models, especially in long-range predictions and after the peak of an infection wave.","Avelar, Pedro Henrique da Costa; Lamb, Luis C.; Tsoka, Sophia; Cardoso-Silva, Jonathan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01133v1.pdf,434
221770,Migration and health in Latin America during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a declared pandemic that is spreading all over the world at a dreadfully fast rate. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of COVID-19, infects the human body using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor identical to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic that occurred in 2002-2003. SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to that of other species. Animal models that mimic the human disease are highly essential to develop therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. Here, we review transgenic mice that express human ACE2 in the airway and other epithelia and have shown to develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV, the pathogen of SARS. This literature review aims to present the importance of utilizing the human ACE2 transgenic mouse model to better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and develop both therapeutics and vaccines.","Lutz, Cathleen; Maher, Leigh; Lee, Charles; Kang, Wonyoung",Hum Genomics,,434

Different concentrations (0-200 mg/L) of g-C3N4 were prepared in nutrient solution amended with or without 20 mg/L CdCl2 for the greenhouse study. Rice seedlings were exposed to g-C3N4 and Cd for 20 days. Our results suggest that 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly increased the fresh weight and root and shoot length as compared with the control, and notably alleviated Cd-induced toxicity. The addition of 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly reduced the root and shoot Cd content by approximately 14% and 23%, respectively. In addition, 200 mg/L g-C3N4 significantly elevated the nitrogen content and decreased C/N ration in rice shoots; most importantly, it alleviated Cd-induced nitrogen reduction. Our findings demonstrated the potential of g-C3N4 in regulating plant growth and minimizing the Cd-induced phytotoxicity, and shed light on providing a new strategy to maintain heavy metal contamination in agriculture using a low-cost and environmental friendly NMs.","Hao, Yi; Lv, Ruitao; Ma, Chuanxin; Adeel, Muhammad; Zhao, Ziqian; Rao, Yuhang; Rui, Yukui",,,434
222019,"Challenging times: ethics, nursing and the COVID-19 pandemic",2020,"Antibodies with heavy chains that derive from the VH1-2 gene constitute some of the most potent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-neutralizing antibodies yet identified. To provide insight into whether these genetic similarities inform common modes of recognition, we determine the structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with three VH1-2-derived antibodies: 2-15, 2-43, and H4. All three use VH1-2-encoded motifs to recognize the receptor-binding domain (RBD), with heavy-chain N53I-enhancing binding and light-chain tyrosines recognizing F486RBD. Despite these similarities, class members bind both RBD-up and -down conformations of the spike, with a subset of antibodies using elongated CDRH3s to recognize glycan N343 on a neighboring RBD-a quaternary interaction accommodated by an increase in RBD separation of up to 12 Å. The VH1-2 antibody class, thus, uses modular recognition encoded by modular genetic elements to effect potent neutralization, with the VH-gene component specifying recognition of RBD and the CDRH3 component specifying quaternary interactions.","Rapp, Micah; Guo, Yicheng; Reddem, Eswar R; Yu, Jian; Liu, Lihong; Wang, Pengfei; Cerutti, Gabriele; Katsamba, Phinikoula; Bimela, Jude S; Bahna, Fabiana A; Mannepalli, Seetha M; Zhang, Baoshan; Kwong, Peter D; Huang, Yaoxing; Ho, David D; Shapiro, Lawrence; Sheng, Zizhang",Cell Rep,,434

In childbearing age women, before inclusion, a pregnancy test will be performed if not available 10. Clinical decision to withhold life-sustaining treatment or ""too sick to benefit"" 11. Presence of other severe diseases impairing life expectancy (e.g. patients are not expected to survive 28 days given their pre-existing medical condition) 12. Lack or withdrawal of informed consent INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: â¢ LMWH group: patients in this group will be administered enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage. â¢ LMWH + steroid group: patients in this group will receive enoxaparin at standard prophylactic dosage and methylprednisolone. â¢ UFH + steroid group: patients in this group will receive UFH at therapeutic dosages and methylprednisolone. UFH will be administered intravenously in UFH + steroid group at therapeutic doses. The infusion will be started at an infusion rate of 18 UI/kg/hour and then modified to obtain aPTT Ratio in between the range of 1.5-2.0. aPTT will be periodically checked at intervals no longer than 12 hours. The treatment with UFH will be administered up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge anticoagulant therapy may be interrupted or switched to prophylaxis with LMWH in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Enoxaparin will be administered in both LMWH group and LMWH + steroid group at standard prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI once day, increased to 6000 UI once day for patients weighting more than 90 kg). The treatment will be administered subcutaneously once a day up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge it may be continued or interrupted in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Methylprednisolone will be administered in both LMWH + steroid group and UHF + steroid group intravenously with an initial bolus of 0,5 mg/kg followed by administration of 0,5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7 days, 0,5 mg/kg 3 times daily from day 8 to day 10, 0,5 mg/kg 2 times daily at days 11 and 12 and 0,5 mg/kg once daily at days 13 and 14. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography, haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures; haemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention or any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug. RANDOMIZATION: A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes (block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/&#8805;30) and Age (<75/&#8805;75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants to the study will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be completed in approximately 10 months. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.1 of April 26th, 2020.

We aimed to investigate whether exogenous l-fucose could be an enteral nutritional supplement to protect intestinal barrier function. The effect of l-fucose on the restoration of epithelial barrier function in both the DSS-induced colitis mouse model and LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells was investigated, and the impact on fucosylation of epithelial cells was examined. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was significantly reduced by l-fucose. Restoration of epithelial barrier function by l-fucose was detected. Direct l-fucose-mediated protection of tight junctions was observed in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, exogenous l-fucose promoted the exogenous metabolic pathway of l-fucose, and fucosylation of epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, knockout of the FUT2 gene restrained fucosylation and the protective effect of l-fucose on barrier function. The severity of colitis was not improved by l-fucose in Fut2 knockout mice. Therefore we conclude that exogenous l-fucose protects intestinal barrier function and relieves intestinal inflammation via upregulation of FUT2-mediated fucosylation of intestinal epithelial cells.","Li, Ying; Jiang, Yudong; Zhang, Lei; Qian, Wei; Hou, Xiaohua; Lin, Rong",FASEB J,,434

This study retrospectively analyzed 113patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taizhou Public Health Center. Clinical characteristics and indexes of coagulation function were collected. A multivariate Cox analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers for predicting disease progression. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, a Nomogram was built and the predictive accuracy was evaluated through the calibration curve, decision curve, clinical impact curve, and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values were calculated to assess the clinical value. The data showed that Fibrinogen, FAR, and D-dimer were higher in the severe patients, while PLTcount, Alb were much lower. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for disease progression. The optimal cutoff values for FAR and PLT count were 0.0883 and 135*109/L, respectively. The C-index [0.712 (95% CI = 0.610-0.814)], decision curve, clinical impact curve showed that Nomogram could be used to predict the disease progression. In addition, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that potential risk decreased in patients with FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*109/L.The model showed a good negative predictive value [(0.9474 (95%CI = 0.845-0.986)].This study revealed that FAR and PLT count were independent risk factors for severe illness and the severity of COVID-19 might be excluded when FAR<0.0883 and PLT count>135*109/L.","Bi, Xiaojie; Su, Zhengxian; Yan, Haixi; Du, Juping; Wang, Jing; Chen, Linping; Peng, Minfei; Chen, Shiyong; Shen, Bo; Li, Jun",Platelets,,434

To address this issue, re-use of surgical face masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended; prior decontamination is paramount to their re-use. AIM: We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. METHODS: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2, and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. FINDINGS: UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2 and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporised H2O2 and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the FDA policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilisation in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","Ludwig-Begall, Louisa F; Wielick, Constance; Dams, Lorène; Nauwynck, Hans; Demeuldre, Pierre-Francois; Napp, Aurore; Laperre, Jan; Haubruge, Eric; Thiry, Etienne",J. hosp. infect,,434

BACKGROUND: The emergence of SARS-CoV2 influenced the evolution of governmental and hospital policy worldwide, which might eventually impact many aspects. The incidence of many diseases in the Emergency Department (ED), especially traumatic brain injury (TBI), has been an area of interest. DESIGN/METHODS: Retrospective study comparing TBI incidence before and during COVID-19 pandemic era starting from the declaration of national pandemic date (March 16, 2020) until June 14, 2020 with the comparison of the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: There was an increase in admission rate due to TBI during COVID-19 pandemic compared with the previous year (157/752 (20.9%) vs 106/766 (13.8%), p < 0.001, respectively).

During the pandemic era, road traffic injury (97/157 (61.8%) vs 56/106 (52.8%), p = 0.149) as well as moderate-to-severe brain injury tended to increase (30/157 (19.1%) vs 17/106 (16.0%) p = 0.524) albeit statistically insignificant. Although the mortality rate was similar (12/157 (7.6%) vs 9/106 (8.5%), p = 0.804), higher hospitalization rate was observed in the pandemic era (81/157 (51.2%) vs 37/106 (34.9%) p = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: TBI incidence remained increasing despite entering the COVID-19 era. These phenomena required further investigation and analysis that may possibly be unrelated with the COVID-19, but due to the change of the government policy and its impact, such as the more quiet road after national social distancing.","Prawiroharjo, Pukovisa; Pangeran, David; Supriawan, Hendra; Lastri, Diatri; Mayza, Adre; Zairinal, Ramdinal Aviesena; Dewi, Ahdinar Rosdiana; Asmaniar, Fadila; Ramli, Yetty",Neurology,,434
225105,The role of pharmacists and pharmacovigilance after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"AIMS: The aim of this study is to generate an in-depth understanding of youth perceptions and experiences of living with type 2 diabetes to inform knowledge translation, research and intervention development. DESIGN: Interpretive descriptive qualitative study. METHODS: Twenty to 25 youth aged 10-18 years with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes will be purposively recruited through the Diabetes Education Resource for Children and Adolescents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and through the Improving Renal Complications in Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes Through the REsearch [iCARE] cohort. Socio-demographic information will be collected. Semi-structured interviews will occur iteratively with inductive thematic analysis. Data will be professionally transcribed and managed using NVivo 1.0 software. The University Ethics Committee approved this study (May 2020). DISCUSSION: There is a critical gap in understanding youth experiences of type 2 diabetes. Research involving youth with type 2 diabetes is predominantly quantitative in nature, largely reflecting risk factors, underlying mechanisms and treatment outcomes associated with diabetes management. In-depth qualitative research on youth experiences can help identify youth priorities, provide insight into critical misalignments between stakeholder perspectives, and drive forward a more consolidated youth-centred research agenda. IMPACT: Understanding and applying knowledge of youth experiences is critical as the prevalence of, and challenges associated with, youth onset type 2 diabetes continues to increase worldwide. This research will generate a robust interpretive description of youth lived experiences and perceptions of type 2 diabetes where such research is lacking, to inform basic and applied research within an interdisciplinary investigative and clinical research team with relevance to other jurisdictions. In response to calls for youth-oriented research in type 2 diabetes, this work will catalyse collaborative knowledge translation using creative and youth-directed initiatives.","Archibald, Mandy M; Dart, Allison; Wicklow, Brandy; Pundyk, Katherine J; Marks, Seth D; Sellers, Elizabeth A C",J Adv Nurs,,434
225156,Parents’ Lived Experiences With the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The increasing transmission of the corona virus (covid 19) in the world has caused tremendous impacts on various things such as health, the economy and various other aspects of life. One of the causes of the increase in the spread of this virus is due to the lack of understanding of the public in the use of good masks. Many people use cloth masks that can be washed several times, but have a weakness that the face area is not tightly closed, resulting in leaks both in the nose area near the eyes and on the chin. We, from a team from the production systems laboratory of the Industrial Engineering Departement Widyatama University, provide solutions for the community by making masks that are produced using 3D Print. The production of COVID-19 masks using a filament fused 3D printer was carried out in September 2020 using PETG material because this plastic is food grade and does not require special treatment such as a heated chamber. To control the quality of the production process in making this 3D mask, a standardized P-chart is used. At the beginning of production there is an eratic but controllable failure rate so that it decreases in subsequent periods. Standardized P-charts can be used for small medium busines without the use of special computing tools and applications. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University. All rights reserved.","Rochman, D.

226218,Reduced mortality in New Zealand during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Introduction: TheNational Audit of Dementia (NAD) is funded by theHealthcareQuality Improvement Partnership to collect data from acute general hospital in England and Wales. In June 2020 NAD circulated optional surveys to leads for dementia in acute hospitals and carers asking about the impact of the pandemic on the organisation and provision of hospital care. Methods: Anonymous survey links were sent to hospital dementia leads directly and circulated to carers of people with dementia via social media and representative organisations. Dementia Leads' questions included whether they and/or their team had been redeployed during the pandemic and whether wards had access to specialist services. Carers' questions included whether patients' needs were discussed, whether they were permitted to visit/how this was communicated, any measures to facilitate communication with their loved ones, and whether they were updated about progress and discharge. Results: 53 dementia hospital leads completed the questionnaire. 32% had been redeployed to other clinical areas during the pandemic, 45% said the same for members of the dementia team. Specialist support for people with dementia on both Covid and Non-Covid wards was significantly compromised. 32 carers completed the questionnaire. 48% were not asked about the needs of the patient they cared for, 90% not allowed to visit, 43% were not given any explanation about visiting and 48% not given support to keep in touch with their loved one. Conclusions: Clinical priorities inevitably meant redeployment of dementia specialist staff, and changes to visiting. However, continuation of specialist support is a requirement for people with dementia admitted to hospital. Liaison with carers/families must be a priority, including facilitating remote support. Hospitals should take note of NHS guidance permitting carer visits to support a person with dementia experiencing distress.","Hood, C.; Morris, A.; Corrado, O.; Swanson, E.; Bourke, L.; Crawford, M.; Quirk, A.; Doxford, H.",Age and Ageing,,434

Venous thromboembolism is a common manifestation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a reported incidence that is significantly higher compared to other acute viral infections. The pathophysiology mechanisms have not been fully explored and autopsy studies might enhance our understanding on this topic. Microthrombi formation occurs mainly in the pulmonary vasculature but can also occur in other organs. The high inflammatory burden related to COVID-19 seems to be associated with the coexisting coagulopathy. Concomitant manifestations of COVID-19, such as severe pneumonia, which has similar clinical presentation with pulmonary embolism (PE), and barriers related to strict isolation protocols are the two main reasons why PE diagnosis might be more challenging in patients with COVID-19. Medical societies have published guidance reports suggesting the administration of prophylactic anticoagulant therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, but several questions regarding the optimal acute and long-term treatment of these patients remain unanswered.","Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G; Kokkinidis, Damianos G; Kyprianou, Ioanna A; Papanastasiou, Christos A; Archontakis-Barakakis, Paraschos; Doundoulakis, Ioannis; Bakoyiannis, Christos; Giannakoulas, George; Palaiodimos, Leonidas",Phlebology,,434

AIM: We evaluated if in-hospital administration of heparin improved survival in a large cohort of Italian COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 2,574 unselected patients hospitalized in 30 clinical centers in Italy from February 19, 2020 to June 5, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection were analyzed. The primary endpoint in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin [UFH]) with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores. RESULTS: Out of 2,574 COVID-19 patients, 70.1% received heparin. LMWH was largely the most used formulation (99.5%). Death rates for patients receiving heparin or not were 7.4 and 14.0 per 1,000 person-days, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found a 40% lower risk of death in patients receiving heparin (hazard ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.74; E-value = 2.04). This association was particularly evident in patients with a higher severity of disease or strong coagulation activation. CONCLUSION: In-hospital heparin treatment was associated with a lower mortality, particularly in severely ill COVID-19 patients and in those with strong coagulation activation. The results from randomized clinical trials are eagerly awaited to provide clear-cut recommendations.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Costanzo, Simona; Antinori, Andrea; Berselli, Nausicaa; Blandi, Lorenzo; Bonaccio, Marialaura; Cauda, Roberto; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Mennuni, Marco; Parruti, Giustino; Patti, Giuseppe; Santilli, Francesca; Signorelli, Carlo; Vergori, Alessandra; Abete, Pasquale; Ageno, Walter; Agodi, Antonella; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Aiello, Luca; Al Moghazi, Samir; Arboretti, Rosa; Astuto, Marinella; Aucella, Filippo; Barbieri, Greta; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cacciatore, Francesco; Caiano, Lucia; Carrozzi, Laura; Cascio, Antonio; Ciccullo, Arturo; Cingolani, Antonella; Cipollone, Francesco; Colomba, Claudia; Colombo, Crizia; Crosta, Francesca; Danzi, Gian Battista; D039,; Ardes, Damiano; de Gaetano Donati, Katleen; Di Gennaro, Francesco; Di Tano, Giuseppe; Offizi, Gianpiero; Fantoni, Massimo; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Gentile, Ivan; Gianfagna, Francesco; Grandone, Elvira; Graziani, Emauele; Grisafi, Leonardo",Thromb. haemost,,434

227726,The Scientists' Collective 10-point proposal for equitable and timeous access to COVID-19 vaccine in South Africa,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the acute COVID-19 pandemic, physical access to the University Medical Center Göttingen was restricted for students. For the first time at our dental school, theoretical knowledge was imparted to students via asynchronous online screencasts and discussed via synchronous video meetings only. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the acceptance and effectiveness of distance education as a new teaching format for theoretical knowledge within the preclinical course in Operative Dentistry (sixth semester of the undergraduate dental curriculum in Germany). METHODS: The phantom course comprised distance education (first phase, 11 weeks) and subsequent on-site practical demonstrations and training (second phase, 10 weeks). All theoretical knowledge was taught via online screencasts during distance education (except for the first week, 3 screencasts were uploaded per week resulting in a total of 30 screencasts). Until the end of the term, all students (N=33) were able to view the screencasts for an unlimited number of times. Theoretical knowledge was assessed in a summative examination after practical on-site teaching. Acceptance and effectiveness of the new curriculum and distance education were also measured based on an evaluation survey and students' self-perceived learning outcome, which was compared to the outcome from the two pre-COVID-19 terms. RESULTS: Each screencast was viewed by a mean of 24 (SD 3.3) students and accessed a mean of 5.6 (SD 1.2) times per user (ie, by students who accessed the respective screencast at least once). During distance education, the number of accesses showed a linear trend over time. During the practical training phase, screencast views declined and increased again prior to the examination. Screencasts covering topics in Cariology, Restorative Dentistry, and Preventive Dentistry were viewed by more students than screencasts covering topics in Endodontology or Periodontology (both P=.047). Examination items in Periodontology showed inferior results compared to the other topics (P<.001). Within the different topics, students' self-perceived learning outcome did not differ from that during the pre-COVID-19 terms. Although most students agreed that the presented screencasts contributed to their learning outcome, pre-COVID-19 term students more strongly felt that lectures significantly contributed to their learning outcome (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Screencasts showed high acceptance and effectiveness among the students but were not used as a learning tool by all students. However, students who viewed the screencasts accessed each screencast more frequently than they could have attended a conventional lecture. Screencast views were mostly due to intrinsic motivation.","Kanzow, Philipp; Krantz-Schäfers, Christiane; Hülsmann, Michael",JMIR Med Educ,,434

228010,The Effect of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Government- and Market-Attitudes,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to discuss particular features of the public debate around the COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation strategies in Croatian media from the beginning of 2020 to mid-September of the same year. Design/methodology/approach: The discussion is theoretically grounded on Luhmann’s concept of moral communication combined with the key assumption of critical discourse analysis that language reflects a position of power of social actors. Based on these premises, the analysis of a sample of articles in a chosen online media was conducted to uncover the moral codes in the public debate concerning the corona outbreak and connect them with specific moral discourses of particular social actors. Findings: The findings clearly indicate that the communication about the pandemic is considerably imbued with moralization and that moral coding is profoundly used to generate preferred types of behaviour of citizens and their compliance with the imposed epidemiologic measures. In conclusion, Luhmann’s claim of moralization as a contentious form of communication is confirmed as the examined public discussion fosters confrontations and generates disruptions rather than contributing to a productive dialogue among diverse social actors. Originality/value: The novelty of the approach lies in the combination of Luhman’s conceiving of moral communication with critical discourse analysis that, taken together, entails a pertinent research tool for analysing relevant attributes of the ongoing vibrant debate on the coronavirus outbreak. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Žažar, K.",Kybernetes,,434
228085,The role of social cohesion in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on mental health within marginalized communities,2020,"Background: The relaxation of telemedicine (TM) restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated adoption of this technology by many orthopedic practices. The purpose of this study was to examine the demographics of the orthopedic patients who utilized TM visits during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify opportunities to improve access. Methods: All patients who underwent orthopedic TM visits at one urban academic medical center between January and April 2020 were included. Demographic data including primary zip code, primary language, and visit type were collected. The demographics of the TM cohort were compared with those of patients seen in the outpatient (OP) setting at the same institution the prior year as well as with patients in the metropolitan area (M). Results: Five thousand thirty-five TM visits met the inclusion criteria. The TM cohort was significantly younger than the OP cohort, with mean age of 48.7 ± 19.0 years for TM and 55.2 ± 18.0 years for OP, and with 22% of TM being 65 or older versus 35% of OP being 65 or older (p = 0.001). The TM cohort had a lower percentage of minority patients (41.3%) than the OP cohort (48.2%). The TM cohort had a significantly lower percentage of black 12.9% versus 14.1%, Asian. 5.1% versus 5.8%, and Spanish/Hispanic 1.9% versus 15.4%, than the M and the OP cohort from the prior year (p < 0.026, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). For socioeconomic status, only 13.8% of TM patients were from ZIP codes with median household incomes <50k. A total of 96.2% of TM visits were performed in English, where only 61% of individuals in the metropolitan area report English as their primary language. Conclusions: As the largest analysis of the use of TM in orthopedics, this study highlights both the future potential of TM and areas of improvement to ensure better access to care for all patient populations. Maintenance of the provisions to allow audio-only visits to be considered TM and billed as such is one important measure.","Lott, Ariana; Sacks, Hayley; Hutzler, Lorraine; Campbell, Kirk A; Lajam, Claudette M",Telemed. j. e. health,,434

These standards are based on provider availability, anticipated enrollment, and patterns of care delivery. We anticipate that the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic will have 3 main effects on provider networks and their regulation: enrollment changes, changes to the provider landscape, and changes to care delivery. Regulators will need to ensure that plans adjust their network size should there be increased enrollment or increased utilization caused by forgone care. Regulators will also require updated monitoring data and plan network data that reflect postpandemic provider availability. Telehealth will have a larger role in care delivery than in the prepandemic period, and regulators will need to adapt network standards to accommodate in-person and virtual care delivery.","Anderson, Kelly E; Shugarman, Lisa R; Davenport, Karen",Am J Manag Care,,434

Previous studies reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infections may affect the gastrointestinal (GI) system. In this review we outline the important GI manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and their diagnosis and management. GI manifestations are reported in 11.4-61.1% of individuals with COVID-19, with variable onset and severity. The majority of COVID-19-associated GI symptoms are mild and self-limiting and include anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain/discomfort. A minority of patients present with an acute abdomen with aetiologies such as acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, bowel ischaemia, haemoperitoneum or abdominal compartment syndrome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA has been found in biopsies from all parts of the alimentary canal. Involvement of the GI tract may be due to direct viral injury and/or an inflammatory immune response and may lead to malabsorption, an imbalance in intestinal secretions and gut mucosal integrity and activation of the enteric nervous system. Supportive and symptomatic care is the mainstay of therapy. However, a minority may require surgical or endoscopic treatment for acute abdomen and GI bleeding.","Kariyawasam, Jayani C; Jayarajah, Umesh; Riza, Rishdha; Abeysuriya, Visula; Seneviratne, Suranjith L",Trans.

230236,"Missed Opportunities? Covid-19, Biosecurity and One Health in the United Kingdom",2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was first detected in Lebanon on February 21, 2020; it reached its peak in January 2021, with a total number of 418,448 confirmed cases and 5380 deaths (until March 15, 2021). Gaining insight into factors regarding willingness or refusal for vaccination might guide our goals in raising the awareness and target efforts to increase acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and maximize the uptake. Therefore, this study aims to assess the intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among Lebanese adults and the factors associated with vaccine refusal. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study during November-December 2020 among Lebanese adults from all Lebanese regions using a survey tool with closed-ended questions that included sociodemographic data and questions about vaccine hesitancy, knowledge, attitude, practice, and fear of COVID-19. We used the snowball technique to collect the data because of the COVID-19 imposed lockdown. RESULTS: Of the 579 participants, 21.4% were willing to receive the vaccine, 40.9% refused, and the remainder were unsure of their response. More vaccine hesitancy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.06; 95% CI 1.03-1.09) was significantly associated with more odds of disagreeing/ strongly disagreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. More vaccine hesitancy (aOR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.91-0.99), female gender compared to males (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.32-0.87), and being married compared to single (aOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.98) were significantly associated with lower odds of agreeing/strongly agreeing on receiving the COVID-19 vaccine compared to being neutral. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings revealed a high percentage of people (40%) who strongly disagreed with receiving the vaccine, mainly females, married participants, and those who have a general vaccine hesitancy. Moreover, no significant association was found with knowledge, attitude, or prevention practice regarding COVID-19. Targeted efforts are necessary to increase acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the Lebanese population to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies with a larger sample size are warranted to validate our results and provide better insights into the underlying reasons for refusing vaccination.","Kasrine Al Halabi, Carina; Obeid, Sahar; Sacre, Hala; Akel, Marwan; Hallit, Rabih; Salameh, Pascale; Hallit, Souheil",BMC Public Health,,434

Now more than ever, action is needed to tackle vaccine hesitancy, especially in light of the availability of effective and safe vaccines. A cross-sectional online survey was carried out on a representative random sample of 1011 citizens from the Emilia-Romagna region, in Italy, in January 2021. The questionnaire collected information on socio-demographics, comorbidities, past vaccination refusal, COVID-19-related experiences, risk perception of infection, and likelihood to accept COVID-19 vaccination. Multiple logistic regression analyses and classification tree analyses were performed to identify significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy and to distinguish groups with different levels of hesitancy. Overall, 31.1% of the sample reported hesitancy. Past vaccination refusal was the key discriminating variable followed by perceived risk of infection. Other significant predictors of hesitancy were: ages between 35 and 54 years, female gender, low educational level, low income, and absence of comorbidities. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine involved safety (54%) and efficacy (27%). Studying the main determinants of vaccine hesitancy can help with targeting vaccination strategies, in order to gain widespread acceptance-a key path to ensure a rapid way out of the current pandemic emergency.","Reno, C.; Maietti, E.; Fantini, M.

233272,Covid-19 quarantine and the way forward,2020,"Following successful non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) aiming to control COVID-19, many jurisdictions reopened their economies and borders. As little immunity had developed in most populations, re-establishing higher contact carried substantial risks, and therefore many locations began to see resurgence in COVID-19 cases. We present a Bayesian method to estimate the leeway to reopen, or alternatively the strength of change required to re-establish COVID-19 control, in a range of jurisdictions experiencing different COVID-19 epidemics. We estimated the timing and strength of initial control measures such as widespread distancing and compared the leeway jurisdictions had to reopen immediately after NPI measures to later estimates of leeway. Finally, we quantified risks associated with reopening and the likely burden of new cases due to introductions from other jurisdictions. We found widely varying leeway to reopen. After initial NPI measures took effect, some jurisdictions had substantial leeway (e.g., Japan, New Zealand, Germany) with > 0.99 probability that contact rates were below 80% of the threshold for epidemic growth. Others had little leeway (e.g., the United Kingdom, Washington State) and some had none (e.g., Sweden, California). For most such regions, increases in contact rate of 1.5-2 fold would have had high (> 0.7) probability of exceeding past peak sizes. Most jurisdictions experienced June-August trajectories consistent with our projections of contact rate increases of 1-2-fold. Under such relaxation scenarios for some regions, we projected up to â¼100 additional cases if just one case were imported per week over six weeks, even between jurisdictions with comparable COVID-19 risk. We provide an R package covidseir to enable jurisdictions to estimate leeway and forecast cases under different future contact patterns. Estimates of leeway can establish a quantitative basis for decisions about reopening. We recommend a cautious approach to reopening economies and borders, coupled with strong monitoring for changes in transmission.","Anderson, Sean C; Mulberry, Nicola; Edwards, Andrew M; Stockdale, Jessica E; Iyaniwura, Sarafa A; Falcao, Rebeca C; Otterstatter, Michael C; Janjua, Naveed Z; Coombs, Daniel; Colijn, Caroline",Epidemics,,434

235219,Novel insights into impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on aquatic environment of Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal in southern Jiangsu region,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of worldwide restrictive measures to reduce social contact and viral spread. These measures have been reported to have a negative effect on physical activity (PA). Studies of PA during the pandemic have primarily used self-reported data. The single academic study that used tracked data did not report on demographics. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore patterns of smartphone-tracked activity before, during, and immediately after lockdown in the United Kingdom, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics and prior levels of PA. METHODS: Tracked longitudinal weekly minutes of PA were captured using the BetterPoints smartphone app between January and June 2020. Data were plotted by week, demographics, and activity levels at baseline. Nonparametric tests of difference were used to assess mean and median weekly minutes of activity at significant points before and during the lockdown, and as the lockdown was eased. Changes over time by demographics (age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation, baseline activity levels) were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). RESULTS: There were 5395 users with a mean age of 41 years (SD 12) and 61% (n=3274) were female. At baseline, 26% (n=1422) of users were inactive, 23% (n=1240) were fairly active, and 51% (n=2733) were active. There was a relatively even spread across deprivation deciles (31% [n=1693] in the least deprived deciles and 23% in the most [n=1261]). We found significant changes in PA from the week before the first case of COVID-19 was announced (baseline) to the week that social distancing restrictions were relaxed (Friedman test: &#967;22=2331, P<.001). By the first full week of lockdown, the median change in PA was 57 minutes less than baseline. This represents a 37% reduction in weekly minutes of PA. Overall, 63% of people decreased their level of activity between baseline and the first week of COVID-19 restrictions. Younger people showed more PA before lockdown but the least PA after lockdown. In contrast, those aged >65 years appeared to remain more active throughout and increased their activity levels as soon as lockdown was eased. Levels of PA among those classed as active at baseline showed a larger drop compared with those considered to be fairly active or inactive. Socioeconomic group and gender did not appear to be associated with changes in PA. CONCLUSIONS: Our tracked PA data suggests a significant drop in PA during the United Kingdom's COVID-19 lockdown. Significant differences by age group and prior PA levels suggests that the government's response to COVID-19 needs to be sensitive to these individual differences and the government should react accordingly. Specifically, it should consider the impact on younger age groups, encourage everyone to increase their PA, and not assume that people will recover prior levels of PA on their own.","McCarthy, Hannah; Potts, Henry W W; Fisher, Abigail",J Med Internet Res,,434

The use of antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) for COVID-19 treatment and prevention has proven to be a cautionary tale for widespread, off-label use of a medication during a crisis. The investigation of antimalarials for COVID-19 has also been a driver for a deluge of scientific output in a short amount of time. In this narrative review, we detail the evidence for and against antimalarial use in COVID-19, starting with the early small observational studies that influenced strategies worldwide. We then contrast these findings to later published larger observational studies and randomized controlled trials. We detail the emerging possible cardiovascular risks associated with antimalarial use in COVID-19 and whether COVID-19-related outcomes and cardiovascular risks may differ for antimalarials used in rheumatic diseases.","Egeli, Bugra Han; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Kim, Alfred H J; Liew, Jean W",Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol,,434

Spectroscopic analysis and electron microscopy showed the distinctive band of the metallic CuNP surface plasmon and their random distribution on the CPE laminar surface, respectively. Theoretical calculations on CuNP/CPE deposits suggest that the interaction between both materials occurs through polyelectrolyte side chains, with a small contribution of its backbone electron density. The CuNP/CPE composite showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) bacteria, mainly attributed to the CuNPs' effect and, to a lesser extent, to the cationic CPE.","Jessop, Ignacio A; Pérez, Yasmín P; Jachura, Andrea; Nuñez, Hipólito; Saldías, Cesar; Isaacs, Mauricio; Tundidor-Camba, Alain; Terraza, Claudio A; Araya-Durán, Ingrid; Camarada, María B; Cárcamo-Vega, José J",,,434
235693,Using social media data for assessing children’s exposure to violence during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Despite huge global, national, and local preventive measures including travel restriction, social distancing, and quarantines, the outbreak of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) develops the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 emerging from Wuhan, China, took only three months to cover >200 countries worldwide by infecting more than 2.4 million people and killing more than 150,000 people. Although this infection at the early stage creates seasonal flu-like symptoms with a higher illness, it eventually causes a higher mortality. Epidemiological studies not only find the causes of many health issues but also suggest preventive measures. This study aimed to see the link between environment temperature and COVID-19 cases. STUDY DESIGN: The monthly average environment temperature (MAET) and various COVID-19 cases of a country were collected and analyzed to see the relationship between these parameters. METHODS: Univariate analysis and statistical modeling were used to determine the relationship between environment temperature and different COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: This study found that the majorities of the countries having higher COVID-19 cases are located in the higher latitude (colder region) in the globe. As of 20th April data available, statistical analyses by various methods have found that strong negative correlations with statistical significance exist between MAET and several COVID-19 cases including total cases, active cases, and cases per million of a country (Spearman correlation coefficients were -0.45, -0.42, and -0.50 for total cases, active cases, and cases/per million, respectively). Analysis by the statistical log-linear regression model further supports that the chance of patients to contract COVID-19 is less in warmer countries than in colder countries. CONCLUSION: This pilot study proposes that cold environment may be an additional risk factor for COVID-19 cases.","Mandal, Chandi C; Panwar, M S",Public Health,,434

The COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of informal helping arrangements in Germany,2021,"BACKGROUND: Evidence has suggested that exercise protects against cognitive decline in aging, but the recent lockdown measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have limited the opportunity for outdoor exercise. Herein we tested the effects of an indoor exercise, Qigong, on neurocognitive functioning as well as its potential neuro-immune pathway. METHODS: We conducted a 12-week randomized active-controlled trial with two study arms in cognitively healthy older people. We applied Wu Xing Ping Heng Gong (Qigong), which was designed by an experienced Daoist Qigong master, to the experimental group, whereas we applied the physical stretching exercise to the control group. The Qigong exercise consisted of a range of movements involving the stretching of arms and legs, the turning of the torso, and relaxing, which would follow the fundamental principles of Daoism and traditional Chinese medicine (e.g., Qi). We measured aging-sensitive neurocognitive abilities, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and brain structural volumes in the experimental (Qigong, n = 22) and control groups (stretching, n = 26) before and after the 12-week training. RESULTS: We observed that Qigong caused significant improvement in processing speed (t (46) = 2.03, p = 0.048) and sustained attention (t (46) = -2.34, p = 0.023), increased hippocampal volume (t (41) = 3.94, p < 0.001), and reduced peripheral IL-6 levels (t (46) = -3.17, p = 0.003). Moreover, following Qigong training, greater reduction of peripheral IL-6 levels was associated with a greater increase of processing speed performance (bootstrapping CI: [0.16, 3.30]) and a more significant training-induced effect of hippocampal volume on the improvement in sustained attention (bootstrapping CI: [-0.35, -0.004]). CONCLUSION: Overall, these findings offer significant insight into the mechanistic role of peripheral IL-6-and its intricate interplay with neural processes-in the beneficial neurocognitive effects of Qigong. The findings have profound implications for early identification and intervention of older individuals vulnerable to cognitive decline, focusing on the neuro-immune pathway. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier: NCT04641429).","Qi, Di; Wong, Nichol M L; Shao, Robin; Man, Idy S C; Wong, Clive H Y; Yuen, Lai Ping; Chan, Chetwyn C H; Lee, Tatia M C",Brain Behav Immun,,434

236516,Mortality and clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with non-invasive respiratory support: A rapid review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to strict, nationwide, comprehensive COVID-19 protective measures, including home quarantine, all Chinese medical students began taking web-based classes beginning in the spring semester of 2020. Home quarantine, web-based classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered an increased incidence of mental health problems among medical students. Although there have been increasing amounts of literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources, such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic, still need to be expanded. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess depression among medical students who are taking web-based classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate the role of coping styles as mediators between resilience and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students involving stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China, was completed between March 20 and April 10, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered, smartphone-based questionnaire, which included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and Ego Resilience 89 Scale. Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling were used in this study. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression among the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. The regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in training) (P=.013), how well students adapted to web-based classes (P<.001), their levels of resilience (P=.04), and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P<.001). Resilience and positive coping styles were negatively related to depression (resilience: P=.04; positive coping styles: P<.001), and negative coping styles were positively related to depression (P<.001). The structural equation modeling analysis showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles (P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it was found that the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings have significant implications for future studies. Future studies and interventions should aim to improve resilience and promote positive coping styles.","Zhao, Lina; Sznajder, Kristin; Cheng, Dan; Wang, Shimeng; Cui, Can; Yang, Xiaoshi",J Med Internet Res,,434

The compounds 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl)-2,3-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-ene (cis-ascaridole), 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethyl) benzene (Ñ-cymene), and 1-isopropyl-4-methyl-1,3-cyclohexadiene (p-mentha-1,3-diene also known as &#945;-terpinene) were identified as the major components. The EO and the major fractions showed remarkable mosquitocidal activity against third instar larvae and adults of Culex quinquefasciatus Say. The oil and fractions were assayed at 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 µl/l. Mortality was time- and dose-dependent. At 24 h post-exposure at an assayed concentration of 50 µl/l, the larval and adult mortalities ranged between 80.11-100% and 91.22-100%, respectively. Strong larvicidal and adulticidal activities were recorded in the cases of the crude oil and cis-ascaridole. The LC50 values after 24 h of treatment ranged between 6.2-20.1 µl/l and 5.1-13.9 µl/l against larvae and adults, respectively. The corrected percentage mortalities increased over time with the tested plant oil and the major fractions relative to the control. The time required to achieve 50% mortality (LT50) decreased remarkably with all treatments. The tested EO and major fractions effectively inhibited larval acetylcholinesterase activity with IC50 values ranging from 8.44 to 64.80 mM compared with 2.08 × 10-3 mM for the reference standard, methomy. The results indicate the potential of developing natural mosquitocides against C. quinquefasciatus based on the tested EO and its major fractions. Graphical abstract.","Almadiy, Abdulrhman A",,,434

(Special Issue: COVID-19: supporting scientific surge.),2020,"Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that plays a major role in the physiology and physiopathology of the coronary artery system, mainly by activating its A2A receptors (A2AR). Adenosine is released by myocardial, endothelial and immune cells during hypoxia, ischaemia or inflammation, each condition being present in coronary artery disease (CAD). While activation of A2AR improves coronary blood circulation and leads to anti-inflammatory effects, downregulation of A2AR has many deleterious effects during CAD. A decrease in the level and/or activity of A2AR leads to: i) lack of vasodilation, which decreases blood flow, leading to a decrease in myocardial oxygenation and tissue hypoxia; ii) an increase in the immune response, favouring inflammation; and iii) platelet aggregation, which therefore participates, in part, in the formation of a fibrin-platelet thrombus after the rupture or erosion of the plaque, leading to the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Inflammation contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, leading to myocardial ischaemia, which in turn leads to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, a vicious circle is created that maintains and aggravates CAD. In some cases, studying the adenosinergic profile can help assess the severity of CAD. In fact, inducible ischaemia in CAD patients, as assessed by exercise stress test or fractional flow reserve, is associated with the presence of a reserve of A2AR called spare receptors. The purpose of this review is to present emerging experimental evidence supporting the existence of this adaptive adenosinergic response to ischaemia or inflammation in CAD. We believe that we have achieved a breakthrough in the understanding and modeling of spare A2AR, based upon a new concept allowing for a new and non-invasive CAD management.","Paganelli, Franck; Gaudry, Marine; Ruf, Jean; Guieu, Régis",Cardiovasc. res,,434

We here tested infectivity and neutralization efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoviruses bearing particular mutations of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) derived either from the Wuhan strains (referred to as D614G or with other sites) or the B.1.351 lineage (referred to as N501Y, K417N, and E484K). The three different pseudoviruses B.1.351 lineage related significantly increased infectivity compared with other mutants that indicated Wuhan strains. Interestingly, K417N and E484K mutations dramatically enhanced cell-cell fusion than N501Y even though their infectivity were similar, suggesting that K417N and E484K mutations harboring SARS-CoV-2 variant might be more transmissible than N501Y mutation containing SARS-CoV-2 variant. We also investigated the efficacy of two different monoclonal antibodies, Casirivimab and Imdevimab that neutralized SARS-CoV-2, against several kinds of pseudoviruses which indicated Wuhan or B.1.351 lineage. Remarkably, Imdevimab effectively neutralized B.1.351 lineage pseudoviruses containing N501Y, K417N, and E484K mutations, while Casirivimab partially affected them. Overall, our results underscore the importance of B.1.351 lineage SARS-CoV-2 in the viral spread and its implication for antibody efficacy.","Kim, Yeong Jun; Jang, Ui Soon; Soh, Sandrine M; Lee, Joo-Youn; Lee, Hye-Ra",Viruses,,434

With over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths around the world, to date, this pandemic represents the gravest global health crisis of our times. Thus, the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is an urgent global imperative. At the time of writing, there are over 165 vaccine candidates being developed, with 33 in various stages of clinical testing. In this review, we discuss emerging insights about the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and their implications for vaccine design. We then review emerging knowledge of the immunogenicity of the numerous vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in the clinic and discuss the range of immune defense mechanisms that can be harnessed to develop novel vaccines that confer durable protection against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the potential role of a systems vaccinology approach in accelerating the clinical testing of vaccines, to meet the urgent needs posed by the pandemic.","Grigoryan, L.; Pulendran, B.",Seminars in Immunology,,434
238202,Covid-19: PM's former chief aide accuses health secretary of lying over PPE and access to treatment,2021,"Mass vaccination campaigns against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing in many countries with increasing vaccination coverage enabling relaxation of lockdowns. Vaccination rollout is frequently supplemented with advisory from public health authorities for continuation of physical distancing measures. Compliance with these measures is waning while more transmissible virus variants such as Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) have emerged. In this work, we considered a population where the waning of compliance depends on vaccine coverage. We used a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model which captures the feedback between compliance, infection incidence, and vaccination coverage to investigate factors that contribute to the increase of the prevalence of infection during the initial stages of the vaccination rollout as compared to no vaccination scenario. We analysed how the vaccine uptake rate affects cumulative numbers of new infections three and six months after the start of vaccination. Our results suggest that the combination of fast waning compliance in non-vaccinated population, low compliance in vaccinated population and more transmissible virus variants may result in a higher cumulative number of new infections than in a situation without vaccination. These adverse effects can be alleviated if vaccinated individuals do not revert to pre-pandemic contact rates, and if non-vaccinated individuals remain compliant with physical distancing measures. Both require convincing, clear and appropriately targeted communication strategies by public health authorities. Significance StatementSARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns are in progress in many countries around the world. As the vaccination coverage increases, the compliance with physical distancing measures aimed at reducing virus transmission may decline. Using a socio-epidemiological model we identify factors that are the drivers of increased transmission when SARS-CoV-2 prevalence is higher than the projected prevalence without vaccination. To maximize the benefits of vaccination campaigns, compliance in vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups should be targeted prioritizing one group over the other depending on the vaccination rate, the efficacy of vaccine in blocking the infection, and the circulating variant.","Teslya, Alexandra; Rozhnova, Ganna; Pham, Thi Mui; Wees, Daphne A van; Nunner, Hendrik; Godijk, Noortje G.; Bootsma, Martin CJ; Kretzschmar, Mirjam E",,,434

239628,Balancing ambition and realism to address pandemic sequelae,2020,"In recent years, epidemic modeling in complex networks has found many applications, including modeling of information or gossip spread in online social networks, modeling of malware spread in communication networks, and the most recent model of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the information disseminated is accurate, for example, maximizing its distribution is desirable, whereas if it is a rumor or a virus, its spread should be minimized. In this context, it is very important to identify super-spreaders that maximize or minimize propagation. Lately, studies for detecting super-spreaders have gained momentum. Most of the studies carried out aim to distinguish the influences of nodes under a specific propagation model (such as SIR) using network centrality measures and subsequently, to rank the nodes accordingly. However, in this study, we developed an algorithm that approximates the expected influence of nodes under the popular SIR model. By considering the behavior of the SIR model and only the shortest paths between nodes, the algorithm ranks the nodes according to this approximated value. Our developed algorithm is named the Expected Value Estimation (EVE).

The experimental studies demonstrated that the solution quality (ranking capability) of EVE is superior to that of its competitors.","cSimcsek, Aybike",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02324v3.pdf,434

Materials and Methods: Extensive network analysis methods, based on a bootstrap approach, allow us to prioritize a list of diseases that display a high similarity to COVID-19 and a list of drugs that could potentially be beneficial to treat patients. As a key feature of CovMulNet19, the inclusion of symptoms allows a deeper characterization of the disease pathology, representing a useful proxy for COVID-19-related molecular processes. Results: We recapitulate many of the known symptoms of the disease and we find the most similar diseases to COVID-19 reflect conditions that are risk factors in patients. In particular, the comparison between CovMulNet19 and randomized networks recovers many of the known associated comorbidities that are important risk factors for COVID-19 patients, through identified similarities with intestinal, hepatic, and neurological diseases as well as with respiratory conditions, in line with reported comorbidities. Conclusion: CovMulNet19 can be suitably used for network medicine analysis, as a valuable tool for exploring drug repurposing while accounting for the intervening multidimensional factors, from molecular interactions to symptoms.","Verstraete, Nina; Jurman, Giuseppe; Bertagnolli, Giulia; Ghavasieh, Arsham; Pancaldi, Vera; De Domenico, Manlio",Netw Syst Med,,434

As I write this in the summer of 2020, the world is dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and is looking for a medical fix, a life-saving vaccine. The public's faith in science and technology has never been higher. Computer ""apps"" that explore things such as the frequency of, and point of origin of, COVID-related Google search terms, and Twitter posts, are being used to trace the progress of the virus and to predict the sites of further outbreaks. The United States has been roiled by the death, at the hands of the police, of George Floyd. Floyd's killing was captured by an app that has been circulating throughout the globe that has acquired the near iconic power of the crucifixion. With the majority of the American people equipped to make audio-visual recording of police brutality and post them on social media, we expect that crimes such as this will certainly diminish.","Wunsch, A.

241290,Maintaining everyday life praxis in the time of COVID-19 pandemic measures (ELP-COVID-19 survey),2020,"BACKGROUND: Primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNS-DLBCL) is a relatively rare and aggressive neoplasm. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is an effective regimen for the treatment of PCNS-DLBCL, but MTX-related toxicity remains a problem. The aim of this analysis study was to investigate the influence of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T polymorphism on HD-MTX-related toxicity in patients with PCNS-DLBCL. MATERIAL/METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted to analyze 148 MTX courses in 32 patients with PCNS-DLBCL. RESULTS: The delayed MTX clearance was observed in 53 cycles (35.8%). The patients carrying the homozygous variant genotype had a higher risk of developing nephrotoxicity than those carrying the wild-type genotype (odds ratio [OR] 13.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-103.86; P = .002) or heterozygous variant genotype (OR 8.43; 95% CI, 2.31-30.70; P < .001). Significant differences were observed in hepatotoxicity (OR 9.33; 95% CI, 2.54-34.27; P < .001) and hematologic toxicity (OR 3.09; 95% CI, 1.18-8.07; P = .024) in addition to nephrotoxicity between the homozygous variant genotype and the wild-type genotype. CONCLUSION: The homozygous mutation of C to T at nucleotide 677 increases the risk on HD-MTX-related toxicity. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism can be used to predict HD-MTX-related toxicity for patients with PCNS-DLBCL.","Chang, Xiaoli; Guo, Yixian; Su, Li; Zhang, Yunxiu; Hui, Wuhan; Zhao, Hong; Hu, Ronghua; Sun, Wanling",Clin. lymphoma myeloma leuk.

There is a need for radiology departments in both government and private facilities to be prepared to meet this crisis. Their efforts should be geared not only toward diagnosis, but also to preventing patient-to-patient, staff-to-patient, and staff-to-staff transmission of infection by utilizing social distancing measures and personal protective equipment (PPE). Aim: To evaluate the preparedness of radiologic departments of government hospitals and private centers, by assessing the outlay of the facility and likelihood to attend to COVID patients, type of equipment in the centers, and plans in place for protection of staff and the public. Materials and Methods: The radiology departments of government and private facilities in each geopolitical zone of the country were randomly selected to discuss radiology preparedness in Nigeria using preset guidelines which were sent to radiologists at the facilities. Written informed consent was obtained from the radiologists at the participating centers. Ethical approval was also obtained from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. Results: A total of twelve centers were included in the study, comprising eight government and four private centers. All had plans in place to attend to COVID patients;majority were in the process of developing standard operating procedures (SOPs). Majority of the government facilities lacked mobile equipment and adequate PPEs, with only one computed tomography machine and no holding area in some of the facilities for symptomatic patients unlike the private facilities. They, however, had infection control teams in place. Conclusion: Private radiological centers appear better prepared and more equipped to cope with the crisis than government hospitals. Adequate PPEs, mobile equipment, and isolation rooms need to be provided for the government facilities. Radiology information systems should be installed for remote viewing. Training and retraining on COVID management and decontamination should be conducted periodically. SOPs should be drafted universally and modified for each facility.","Omidiji, O. A.; Irurhe, N.

There is a sense of urgency in finding a cure for this deadly virus. In this study, we reviewed the empiric options used in common practice for COVID-19, based on the literature available online, with an emphasis on human experiences with these treatments on severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-COV-1) and other viruses. Convalescent blood products are the most promising potential treatment for use in COVID-19. The use of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir, and tocilizumab are some of the other promising potential therapies; however, they are yet to be tested in randomized clinical trials (RCTs). The use of lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove beneficial in a large RCT. The use of corticosteroids should be avoided in COVID-19 pneumonia unless used for other indications, based on the suggestion of harm in patients with SARS-COV-1 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) infection.

242609,Collaboration in Humanitarian Operations in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint),2021,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Although much has been learned in the first few months of the pandemic, many features of COVID-19 pathogenesis remain to be determined. For example, anosmia is a common presentation, and many patients with anosmia show no or only minor respiratory symptoms1. Studies in animals infected experimentally with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of COVID-19, provide opportunities to study aspects of the disease that are not easily investigated in human patients. Although the severity of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to lethal2, most experimental infections provide insights into mild disease3. Here, using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice that were originally developed for SARS studies4, we show that infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes severe disease in the lung and, in some mice, the brain. Evidence of thrombosis and vasculitis was detected in mice with severe pneumonia. Furthermore, we show that infusion of convalescent plasma from a recovered patient with COVID-19 protected against lethal disease. Mice developed anosmia at early time points after infection. Notably, although pre-treatment with convalescent plasma prevented most signs of clinical disease, it did not prevent anosmia. Thus, K18-hACE2 mice provide a useful model for studying the pathological basis of both mild and lethal COVID-19 and for assessing therapeutic interventions.","Zheng, Jian; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Li, Kun; Verma, Abhishek Kumar; Ortiz, Miguel E; Wohlford-Lenane, Christine; Leidinger, Mariah R; Knudson, C Michael; Meyerholz, David K; McCray, Paul B; Perlman, Stanley",Nature (Lond.),,434

242993,"The Caribbean and Covid-19: not a health crisis, but a looming economic one",2020,"The world experienced the outbreak of a new pandemic disease in 2019, known as coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The respiratory system is the organ system most commonly affected by COVID-19;however, several other organ systems have been reported to be affected. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA found in infected stub samples can cause lung contagion by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor of the alveolar epithelial cells. The gut microbiota (GM) promote immunity, indicating that the alignment of the microbiota and corresponding metabolic processes in COVID-19 can help to identify novel biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for this disease. The cause of kidney damage in COVID-19 patients is possibly multifactorial, involving a complex mechanism that involves complement dysregulation and thrombotic microangiopathy, as well as the occurrence of a ""cytokine storm"" syndrome, which are immune responses that are abandoned and dysfunctional with unfavorable prognosis in severe COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, COVID-19 involves a continuous proliferation and activation of macrophages and lymphocytes. SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to the ACE-2 receptor expressed in the cerebral capillary endothelial cells that can invade the blood-brain wall, to penetrate the brain parenchyma. However, in the ongoing pandemic, there has been a surge in studies on a wide range of topics, including causes of respiratory failure, asymptomatic patients, intensive care patients, and survivors. This review briefly describes the damaging effects of COVID-19 on vital human organs and the inhibitory function of the ACE-2 receptor on the GM, which causes gut dysbiosis, and thus, this review discusses topics that have an opportunity for further investigation.

The crystal structure is monoclinic, but its lattice is metrically strongly pseudo-orthorhombic and underpins a strongly pseudo-hexagonal sublattice. Several possible twin laws are compatible with these metric specializations, among which the one found experimentally corresponds to a trichromatic point group. Twinning is by reticular pseudo-merohedry with twin index 2 and zero obliquity but a non-zero twin misfit. The twin lattice coincides with the pseudo-hexagonal sublattice of the individual domain, which justifies the adoption of the unconventional setting B21 of the space group.","Nespolo, Massimo; Smaha, Rebecca W; Parkin, Sean",Acta Crystallogr B Struct Sci Cryst Eng Mater,,434

They, however, are prone to over 5000 mutations on the spike (S) protein uncovered by a Mutation Tracker based on over 200 000 genome isolates. It is imperative to understand how mutations will impact vaccines and antibodies in development. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the S protein which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of 56 antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we reveal that most of the 462 mutations on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) will weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies and disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines. A list of 31 antibody disrupting mutants is identified, while many other disruptive mutations are detailed as well. We also unveil that about 65% of the existing RBD mutations, including those variants recently found in the United Kingdom (UK) and South Africa, will strengthen the binding between the S protein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), resulting in more infectious COVID-19 variants. We discover the disparity between the extreme values of RBD mutation-induced BFE strengthening and weakening of the bindings with antibodies and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is at an advanced stage of evolution for human infection, while the human immune system is able to produce optimized antibodies. This discovery, unfortunately, implies the vulnerability of current vaccines and antibody drugs to new mutations. Our predictions were validated by comparison with more than 1400 deep mutations on the S protein RBD. Our results show the urgent need to develop new mutation-resistant vaccines and antibodies and to prepare for seasonal vaccinations.","Chen, J. H.; Gao, K. F.; Wang, R.; Wei, G.

County-Level Analysis of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Urban and Rural America,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in low-middle income countries. We aimed to describe the clinical spectrum and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at a tertiary-care center in Karachi, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY: We conducted an observational study of adult COVID-19 patients hospitalized between February-June 2020. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 and PCR positivity were included. We created logistic regression models to understand association of clinical characteristics with illness severity and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: The study population comprised 445 patients [67% males, median age 53 (IQR 40-64) years]. Majority of patients (N = 268; 60%) had &#8805; 1 co-morbid [37.5% hypertension, 36.4% diabetes]. In-hospital mortality was 13%. Age &#8805; 60 (aOR] =1.92; 95 %CI = 1.23-3.03), shortness of breath (aOR=4.43; 95% CI=2.73-7.22), CRP &#8805;150mg/L (aOR:1.77; 95% CI=1.09-2.85), LDH &#8805; 500 I.U/L (aOR:1.98; 95% CI=1.25-3.16), Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) &#8805;5 (aOR:2.80; 95%CI = 1.77-4.42) and increase in serum creatinine (aOR:1.32; 95%CI=1.07-1.61) were independently associated with disease severity. Septic shock (aOR: 13.27; 95% CI=3.78-46.65), age &#8805; 60 (aOR: 3.26; 95% CI=1.07-9.89), Ferritin &#8805; 1500ng/ml (aOR: 3.78; 95% CI=1.21-11.8), NLR &#8805; 5 (aOR: 4.04; 95% CI=1.14-14.35) and acute kidney injury (aOR: 5.52; 95% CI=1.78-17.06) were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We found multiple predictors to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality, except diabetes and gender. Compared to reports from other countries, the in-hospital mortality among COVID-19 patients was lower, despite a high burden of co-morbidities. Further research is required to explore reasons behind this dichotomy.","Nasir, Nosheen; Habib, Kiren; Khan, Naveera; Muhammad, Zehra Abdul; Mahmood, Syed Faisal",J Infect Dev Ctries,,434

246931,Staying connected during the COVID-19 pandemic: highlights from the Paediatric and Congenital Interventional Cardiology Early-Career Society (PICES) 2020 activities,2021,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generated a huge pressure on health care systems worldwide and exposed their lack of preparation for a major health crisis. In the times of a respiratory disease pandemic, members of the dental profession, due to having a direct contact with the patients' oral cavity, body fluids and airborne pathogens, are exposed to a great occupational hazard of becoming infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The authors carried out a systematic literature search using the main online databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, UpToDate, Embase, and Web of Science) with the following keywords: ""COVID-19,"" ""2019-nCoV,"" ""coronavirus,"" ""SARS-CoV-2,"" ""dental COVID-19,"" ""dentistry COVID-19,"" ""occupational hazards dentistry,"" ""ventilation,"" ""air disinfection,"" ""airborne transmission,"" ""hydrogen peroxide disinfection,"" ""UV disinfection,"" ""ozone disinfection,"" ""plasma disinfection,"" and ""TiO2 disinfection."" They included publications focused on COVID-19 features, occupational hazards for dental staff during COVID-19 pandemic, and methods of air disinfection. They found that due to the work environment conditions, if appropriate measures of infection control are not being implemented, dental offices and dental staff can become a dangerous source of COVID-19 transmission. That is why the work safety protocols in dentistry have to be revised and additional methods of decontamination implemented. The authors specifically advise on the utilization of wildly accepted methods like ultraviolet germicidal irradiation with additional disinfection systems, which have not been introduced in dentistry yet, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide, non-thermal plasma and air filters with photocatalytic disinfection properties. Due to its toxicity, ozone is not the first-choice method for air decontamination of enclosed clinical settings.

We describe organ donation and transplant practice in the UK and assess whether kidney transplantation conferred a substantial risk of harm. Data from the UK transplant registry were used to describe kidney donation and transplant activity in the UK, and a detailed analysis of short-term, single-center, patient results in two periods: during the pre-pandemic era from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020 (""Pre-COVID era"") and the 9th March 2020 to 19th May 2020 (""COVID era""). Donor and recipient numbers fell by more than half in the COVID compared to the pre-COVID era in the UK, but there were more kidney transplants performed in our center (42 vs. 29 COVID vs. pre-COVID respectively). Overall outcomes, including re-operation, delayed graft function, primary non-function, acute rejection, length of stay and graft survival were similar between COVID and pre-COVID era. 6/71 patients became infected with SARS-CoV-2 but all were discharged without critical care requirement. Transplant outcomes have remained similar within the COVID period and no serious sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in the peri-transplant period.","Georgiades, Fanourios; Summers, Dominic M; Butler, Andrew J; Russell, Neil K I; Clatworthy, Menna R; Torpey, Nicholas",Clin Transplant,,434

The only way to reach out to these patients has been the newly evolved telemedicine services. Aim and Objectives: The aim of the study is to study the need and accessibility of telemedicine services among patients of COCs. Methodology: The case record files of patients who got them registered in the COCs during January to March 2020 were taken out and sociodemographic, clinical, and contact details were retrieved. A 12-item questionnaire was prepared to know the current status of these patients and information about need and accessibility of telemedicine service for mental health over phone. Results: A total of 78 patients were interviewed. Mean age of the respondents was 43.90 years. The most common clinical diagnoses were neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders followed by substance use disorders, mood disorders, and schizophrenia, including other psychotic disorders. About two-third of the respondents reported that their condition worsened over a period of 4 months after closure of COCs, while one-fourth patients could not purchase medicines due to nonrenewal of prescription. Only 2.4% of the respondents were aware about the existing telemedicine services in the hospital and 100% of the respondents agreed to consult telemedicine services after imparting the information and scope of telemedicine services. Conclusion: Sudden closure of COCs led to worsening of mental health status of already registered patients in the clinics. There were poor knowledge and accessibility of telemedicine service by the respondents. Information, education, and communication about telemedicine services increase the feasibility, acceptability, and accessibility of services.","Sidana, A.; Singh, A.

The world was slow to react to the developing crisis, but once the contours of the impending calamity became evident, the different state and non-state actors have raced to put their act together. The COVID-19 pandemic has blatantly exposed the shortcomings of our healthcare system and the limitations of medical science, despite considerable advances in recent years. To effectively tackle the current pandemic, almost unprecedented in the modern age, there is an urgent need for a concerted, sustained, and coordinated effort towards the development of new diagnostics, therapeutic and vaccines, and the ramping up of the healthcare infrastructure, especially in the poorer underprivileged nations. Towards this end, researchers around the world are working tirelessly to develop new diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics. Efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 are presently underway in several countries around the world, but a new vaccine is expected only by the end of the year-at the earliest. New drug development against COVID-19 and its approval may take even longer. Under such circumstances, drug repurposing has emerged as a realistic and effective strategy to counter the current menace, and several antiviral and antimalarial medicines are currently in different stages of clinical trials. Researchers are also experimenting with nutrients, vitamins, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma as immunity boosters against the SARS-CoV-2. This report presents a critical analysis of the global clinical trial landscape for COVID-19 with an emphasis on the therapeutic agents and vaccines currently being tested at pandemic speed.","Ahamad, Shakir; Branch, Scotty; Harrelson, Shea; Hussain, Mohd Kamil; Saquib, Mohammad; Khan, Saeed",Eur J Med Chem,,434

Currently, there is no specific treatment for Hashimoto thyroiditis. We hypothesize that acupuncture can halt or delay the progression of HT and improve fertility in child-bearing period female. We therefore designed a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis by comparing the therapeutic effect of acupuncture vs sham acupuncture in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, a total of 284 eligible patients will be assigned to acupuncture group (nâ=â142) or sham acupuncture group (nâ=â142) in a 1:1 ratio. All patients will receive 36 sessions in total for 12 consecutive weeks with the same acupoint prescription (RN23, ST9, RN17, RN4, RN6, ST36, SP6, KI6). The primary assessment is the titers of thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb). Secondary outcomes include the thyroid function, ovarian function, the rate of primary ovarian insufficiency, and pregnancy outcome. The thyroid function and thyroid antibodies tests will be measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 after randomization. The ovarian function will be examined on the 2nd to 4th day of the menstrual period in the 1st month, 2nd month and 3rd month compared with baseline. Both the pregnancy outcome and the rate of primary ovarian insufficiency will be evaluated 1 year after treatment. DISCUSSION: This will be the first large-scale trial specifically evaluating acupuncture therapy in child-bearing period female with Hashimoto thyroiditis. If the study confirms the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment, more consistent acupuncture therapy can be set up for clinical practice.

This study aims to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients in the Netherlands, considering recovery as a competing risk. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort study we included adults with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that were admitted to one of five hospitals in the Netherlands (March to May 2020). We performed a competing risk survival analysis, presenting cause-specific hazard ratios (HRCS) for the effect of preselected factors on the absolute risk of death and recovery. RESULTS: 1,006 patients were included (63.9% male; median age 69 years, IQR: 58-77). Patients were hospitalized for a median duration of 6 days (IQR: 3-13); 243 (24.6%) of them died, 689 (69.9%) recovered, and 74 (7.4%) were censored. Patients with higher age (HRCS 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.12), immunocompromised state (HRCS 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.98), who used anticoagulants or antiplatelet medication (HRCS 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.88), with higher modified early warning score (MEWS) (HRCS 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), and higher blood LDH at time of admission (HRCS 6.68, 95% CI 1.95-22.8) had increased risk of death, whereas fever (HRCS 0.70, 95% CI 0.52-0.95) decreased risk of death. We found no increased mortality risk in male patients, high BMI or diabetes.

Motivated by a non-randomized open-label study investigating the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19, we describe in a unified fashion various alternative approaches to the analysis of non-randomized studies. A widely used tool to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias are so-called propensity score (PS) methods. Conditioning on the propensity score allows one to replicate the design of a randomized controlled trial, conditional on observed covariates. Extensions include the g-computation approach, which is less frequently applied, in particular in clinical studies. Moreover, doubly robust estimators provide additional advantages. Here, we investigate the properties of propensity score based methods including three variations of doubly robust estimators in small sample settings, typical for early trials, in a simulation study.

To decrease person-to-person contact, health care providers have built many isolation wards. However, out-of-hospital professionals cannot access patient information, which has greatly reduced the efficiency of treatment; it is inconvenient for health care professionals to issue a case discussion with professionals from other wards. This article mainly introduces a mobile telehealth system (MTS) applied to facilitate patient information presentation and case discussion. Materials and Methods: The MTS searches patient information, which is stored in hospital intranet, and uses five modules to display patient information. By a request/response module and a real-time interaction module, we successfully conducted case discussions. In addition, we took measures in three areas to prevent patient information leakage. Results: The system uses mobile collaboration technology to present patient information and support case discussion. MTS was officially launched for 37 days, during which it has been used 3,061 times. Conclusions: The building of the MTS not only provides convenience and benefit for health care professionals, but also reduces person-to-person contact.","Ren, Xiaoyang; Zhai, Yunkai; Song, Xiaoqin; Wang, Zhenbo; Dou, Dongwei; Li, Yuhong",Telemed J E Health,,434

Starting from OECD, DESI and ISTAT data, only a small percentage of teachers are ready for distance teaching;in the literature it is agreed that the didactic action follows technological innovation but has not yet managed it. An implicit factor could be the lack of knowledge of digital content and digital tools by teachers. The guidelines issued by the Ministry during the COVID-19 period highlighted the importance of using digital tools to motivate student learning and foster relationships.

METHODS: ""COVID-19"" was entered as the search term in Thomson Reuter's Web of Science database. The 100 most cited articles (T100) were analyzed bibliometrically. Altmetric attention scores (AASs) and dimension badge scores of the articles were evaluated. RESULTS: T100 articles were published from January to September 2020. The average citation of the top 100 articles on COVID-19 was 320 ± 344.3 (143-2676). The language of all articles was English. The average Altmetric value of T100 is 3246 ± 3795 (85-16,548) and the mean dimension badge value was 670 ± 541.6 (176-4232).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis from January 2014 to October 2018 was performed in six patients (4 females and 2 males; mean age, 45.3 ± 14.2 years; range, 26-61 years) who underwent LPA embolization for chylous ascites developing after retroperitoneal surgery involving the perirenal space (four donor nephrectomies, one partial nephrectomy, and one retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy). After placing a percutaneous drainage catheter into the LPA or adjacent lymphocele, embolization was performed by filling the LPA itself with a mixture of glue and Lipiodol (Guerbet). RESULTS: Daily drainage from percutaneously placed drains exceeded 300 mL/day despite medical and surgical treatment (volume: mean, 1173 ± 1098 mL; range, 305-2800 mL). Intranodal lymphangiography was performed in four of the six patients and revealed leakage in 2 patients. Percutaneous embolization of the LPA was successful in all patients using an NBCA and Lipiodol mixture in a ratio of 1:1-1:2 (volume: mean, 4.3 ± 1.1 mL; range, 3-6 mL). Chylous ascites was resolved and the drainage catheter was removed in all patients within 4 days after the procedure (mean, 2.0 ± 1.8 days; range, 0-4 days). No procedure-related complications or recurrence of chylous ascites occurred during a mean follow-up period of 37.3 months (range, 21.1-48.4 months). CONCLUSION: Glue embolization of LPA has the potential to be a feasible and effective treatment method for the management of chylous ascites after retroperitoneal surgery.","Kwon, Lyo Min; Hur, Saebeom; Jeong, Chang Wook; Jae, Hwan Jun; Chung, Jin Wook",Korean j. radiol,,434

METHODS: In this study, 121 children between the ages of 0-18 with Covid-19 were evaluated based on their history, blood pressure values, and electrocardiography and echocardiography results. These findings were compared with the findings of the control group which consisted of 95 healthy cases who were in the same age range as the study group and did not have Covid-19. The results were evaluated using the statistics program, SPSS 21. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the study group and the control group in terms of age, weight, and body mass index. The clinical symptoms (chest and back pain, dizziness, headache, palpitation, fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of balance, coughing) of 37.2% of the cases persisted at least 1 month after Covid-19 recovery. Statistically significant differences were found in systolic blood pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction, relative wall thickness, and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. CONCLUSION: The continuation of some cases' clinical symptoms post-recovery indicates that long Covid infection can be observed in children. The fact that statistically significant differences were observed between the echocardiographic parameters of the study and control groups suggests that Covid-19 may have effects on the cardiovascular system. To shed light on the long Covid cases among children and the infection's cardiac impacts, it would be beneficial to conduct more comprehensive studies on this matter.","Erol, Nurdan; Alpinar, Abdullah; Erol, Cigdem; Sari, Erdal; Alkan, Kubra",Cardiol Young,,434

Summary: The sudden rise of the COVID19 pandemic has led to media outlets reporting science without necessary peer review and has resulted in preliminary data presented as factual evidence. It is difficult for patients without an extensive medical background in science to fully understand the uncertainty of information shared in popular media. This was demonstrated when preliminary data showed potential promise of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment/prevention of COVID19. This led to patients requesting hydroxychloroquine prescriptions from their providers, as well as stockpiling medication, which led to a shortage. In addition, patients began taking chloroquine containing substances not intended for human consumption. Popular media created a belief in the general public that all antimalarial drugs may work to prevent COVID19. This case report presents an elderly patient that presented to clinic with shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Upon interviewing the patient, it was discovered that he had been taking an old supply of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. Physical exam, and laboratory examination were evaluated to rule out any other etiology with all tests and exams being unremarkable. Two weeks after stopping atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, the patient's symptoms completely resolved. Conclusion: The media provides a significant portion of the information that patients receive regarding rapidly changing treatment information in a pandemic. It is crucial for health care providers to know what information patients are exposed to, and to educate patients with evidence-based information. Pharmacists are the most accessible health care providers and have a key role in medication review and management. Educating patients on evidence-based use of medications may help avoid harm caused by misinformation from unreliable media sources.","Anderson, S.; Windscheffel, J.; Gunning, K.",Innovations in Pharmacy,,434

RECENT FINDINGS: Kidney injury is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute tubular necrosis and glomerular injury are two common findings. Direct viral effect, endothelial dysfunction, and podocyte and tubular epithelial injury have been described. COVID-19-related glomerular injury may also be associated with high-risk APOL1 genotype. SUMMARY: Data on COVID-19 renal involvement have suggested novel mechanisms of kidney injury that need to be further elucidated. More data are needed on renal involvement in milder disease, renal-specific therapeutic interventions, and long-term sequelae.","Punj, Shweta; Eng, Eudora; Shetty, Aneesha A",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,434

We aimed to determine the symptoms most commonly associated with a positive result for a SARS-CoV-2 swab among community-based children. METHODS: We conducted an observational study among children tested and followed for SARS-CoV-2 infection using nasal, nasopharyngeal, throat or other (e.g., nasopharyngeal aspirate or tracheal secretions, or unknown) swabs between Apr. 13 and Sept. 30, 2020, in Alberta. We calculated positive likelihood ratios (LRs) for self-reported symptoms and a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result in the entire cohort and in 3 sensitivity analyses: all children with at least 1 symptom, all children tested because of contact tracing whether they were symptomatic or not and all children 5 years of age or older. RESULTS: We analyzed results for 2463 children who underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection; 1987 children had a positive result and 476 had a negative result. Of children with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2, 714 (35.9%) reported being asymptomatic. Although cough (24.5%) and rhinorrhea (19.3%) were 2 of the most common symptoms among children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were also common among those with negative test results and were not predictive of a positive test (positive LR 0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-1.14, and 0.87, 95% CI 0.72-1.06, respectively). Anosmia/ageusia (positive LR 7.33, 95% CI 3.03-17.76), nausea/vomiting (positive LR 5.51, 95% CI 1.74-17.43), headache (positive LR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74-3.57) and fever (positive LR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.11) were the symptoms most predictive of a positive result for a SARSCoV-2 swab. The positive LR for the combination of anosmia/ageusia, nausea/vomiting and headache was 65.92 (95% CI 49.48-91.92). INTERPRETATION: About two-thirds of the children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection reported symptoms. The symptoms most strongly associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab result were anosmia/ageusia, nausea/vomiting, headache and fever.","King, James A; Whitten, Tara A; Bakal, Jeffrey A; McAlister, Finlay A",CMAJ,,434
257597,"Stay active, stay at home and stay safe: the risk of falls in older adults in the COVID-19 quarantine",2020,"The most effective way to control newly emerging infectious disease, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, is to strengthen preventative or therapeutic public health strategies before the infection spreads worldwide. However, global health systems remain at the early stages in anticipating effective therapeutics or vaccines to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While maintaining social distance is the most crucial metric to avoid spreading the virus, symptomatic therapy given to patients on the clinical manifestations helps save lives. The molecular properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been quickly elucidated, paving the way to therapeutics, vaccine development, and other medical interventions. Despite this progress, the detailed biomolecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. Given virus invasion of cells is a determining factor for virulence, understanding the viral entry process can be a mainstay in controlling newly emerged viruses. Since viral entry is mediated by selective cellular proteases or proteins associated with receptors, identification and functional analysis of these proteins could provide a way to disrupt virus propagation. This review comprehensively discusses cellular machinery necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding multifactorial traits of the virus entry will provide a substantial guide to facilitate antiviral drug development.","You, Jaehwan; Seok, Jong Hyeon; Joo, Myungsoo; Bae, Joon-Yong; Kim, Jin Il; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Kisoon",,,434

Nurses who were actively and daily involved in the care of COVID-19 patients on selected intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU wards were included. Depression, somatization, anxiety and distress scores were calculated using the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ). The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Brief-COPE questionnaires were used to assess respectively the psychological impact and coping strategies. Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire at the start of inclusion, 4 weeks later and 8 weeks later.Results: In total, 39/42 included nurses participated in the study. 4DSQ results showed low rates of depression, anxiety and somatization with a declining trend over time. Distress scores however were high throughout the study period. A past history of stress symptoms was significantly associated with higher distress scores at the inclusion and one month follow-up. As major psychological impact, more participants experienced 'intrusion' compared to 'avoidance' specifically among nurses working on ICU. In 10% of participants, IES-R-scores were predictive for post-traumatic stress disorder.Conclusion: Healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 patients during the pandemic reported high and enduring distress scores and experienced a major impact on mental health, especially when employed at ICU. These results highlight the importance of psychological support and proper long-term follow-up to mitigate this impact.","Van Steenkiste, Eveline; Schoofs, Jessie; Gilis, Shauni; Messiaen, Peter",Acta Clin Belg,,434

However, various threats/hazards could lead to disruption and failure of developing CIs resilience, which inevitably can lead to negative repercussions to humanity and national economy. In this regard, detailed understanding of the threats/hazards and their impacts are critical to improve a country’s preparedness for unexpected situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper aims to conduct a critical analysis of the potential threats to governments’ efforts and capacity to build CI resilience. A three-stage systematic review process is adopted and a total of 35 papers are carefully selected. Results show that during the past two decades, researchers’ interest in exploring the threats/hazards in CIs resilience has increased. Further, most of the research publications emanate from the United States and United Kingdom. Lastly, a total of 31 threats/hazards are identified, with the most reported threats/hazards being: (1) natural disasters, (2) ageing and decay, (3) cyber threats, (4) terrorist activities, (5) contamination and (6) cascading failure/threat. The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future research on developing CIs resilience.

Paracetamol is one of the most prescribed and purchased drugs that has been widely detected in wastewater and surface water. The present study investigated paracetamol degradation by photocatalytic treatment in a batch system using TiO2 supported on aluminosilicate recovered from waste LED panel (ATiO2). The prepared ATiO2 catalyst was characterized for morphology, elemental composition and crystallinity using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. ATiO2 was spherical in morphology with a predominance of the anatase phase of TiO2 and an average size of â¼15 nm. Subsequently, the effects of operating parameters, viz., initial paracetamol concentration (1-10 mg/L), catalyst dosage (0.5-4.0 g/L) and pH (4-10) on paracetamol degradation were investigated using central composite design (CCD). A polynomial model was developed to interpret the linear and interactive effect of operating parameters on the paracetamol degradation efficiency. About 99% degradation efficiency of paracetamol was obtained at optimum conditions (Initial paracetamol concentration â¼2.74 mg/L, ATiO2 dosage â¼2.71 g/L and pH â¼ 9.5). The mechanism of paracetamol degradation was adsorption on aluminosilicate and subsequent degradation by TiO2. ATiO2 could be effectively reused up to 3 cycles, with <5% decrease in the degradation efficiency.","Jayasree, Pyla; Remya, Neelancherry",Water Sci Technol,,434

260432,Medical applications of social networks. Specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Drug reposition, or repurposing, has become a promising strategy in therapeutics due to its advantages in several aspects of drug therapy. General drug development is expensive and can take more than 10 years to go through the designing, development, and necessary approval steps. However, established drugs have already overcome these steps and thus a potential candidate may be already available decreasing the risks and costs involved. Viruses invade cells, usually provoking biochemical changes, leading to tissue damage, alteration of normal physiological condition in organisms and can even result in death. Inside the cell, the virus finds the machinery necessary for its multiplication, as for instance the protein quality control system, which involves chaperones and Hsps (heat shock proteins) that, in addition to physiological functions, help in the stabilization of viral proteins. Recently, many inhibitors of Hsp90 have been developed as therapeutic strategies against diseases such as the Hsp90 inhibitors used in anticancer therapy. Several shreds of evidence indicate that these inhibitors can also be used as therapeutic strategies against viruses. Therefore, since a drug treatment for COVID-19 is urgently needed, this review aims to discuss the potential use of Hsp90 inhibitors in the treatment of this globally threatening disease.","Ramos, Carlos H I; Ayinde, Kehinde S",Current protein and peptide science,,434

This systematic review organizes all information available about viral and bacterial pathogens of Chilean wild birds, determines which pathogens and avian orders have received attention from the local scientific community, evaluates changes in the frequency of article publication, and identifies gaps in knowledge regarding these pathogens. A total of 35 peer-reviewed publications have been published from January 1941 through April 2019. Viral agents were evaluated in 11 studies, while 24 involved bacteria. Article publication has been mostly discontinuous in years prior to 2006. Salmonella spp. and avian influenza have been the most studied pathogens with 10 and 8 studies, respectively. Los Ríos and Valparaíso regions concentrate the highest number of studies and no research has been carried out in O'Higgins, Maule, and Aysén regions. Overall, information about pathogens in wild birds is scarce, highlighting the need for increased effort to identify pathogens being carried by avian reservoirs and evaluate the potential threat that they might pose for wildlife conservation, animal production, and the public health system in Chile.","González-Acuña, Daniel; Llanos-Soto, Sebastián",Rev Chilena Infectol,,434

For these reasons it represents the prime target for Covid-19 vaccines. In recent months, variants of this protein have started to emerge. Their ability to reduce or evade recognition by S-targeting antibodies poses a threat to immunological treatments and raises concerns for their consequences on vaccine efficacy. To develop a model able to predict the potential impact of S-protein mutations on antibody binding sites, we performed unbiased multi-microsecond molecular dynamics of several glycosylated S-protein variants and applied a straightforward structure-dynamics-energy based strategy to predict potential changes in immunogenic regions on each variant. We recover known epitopes on the reference D614G sequence. By comparing our results, obtained on isolated S-proteins in solution, to recently published data on antibody binding and reactivity in new S variants, we directly show that modifications in the S-protein consistently translate into the loss of potentially immunoreactive regions. Our findings can thus be qualitatively reconnected to the experimentally characterized decreased ability of some of the Abs elicited against the dominant S-sequence to recognize variants. While based on the study of SARS-CoV-2 Spike variants, our computational epitope-prediction strategy is portable and could be applied to study immunoreactivity in mutants of proteins of interest whose structures have been characterized, helping the development/selection of vaccines and antibodies able to control emerging variants.","Triveri, Alice; Serapian, Stefano A.; Marchetti, Filippo; Doria, Filippo; Pavoni, Silvia; Cinquini, Fabrizio; Moroni, Eisabetta; Rasola, Andrea; Frigerio, Francesco; Colombo, Giorgio",,,434

We sought to evaluate outcomes of delayed intubation and examine the ROX index (ie, [SpO2 /FIO2 ]/breathing frequency) to predict weaning from high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study of subjects with respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and managed with HFNC. The ROX index was applied to predict HFNC success. Subjects that failed HFNC were divided into early HFNC failure (&#8804; 48 h of HFNC therapy prior to mechanical ventilation) and late failure (> 48 h). Standard statistical comparisons and regression analyses were used to compare overall hospital mortality and secondary end points, including time-specific mortality, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and ICU length of stay between early and late failure groups. RESULTS: 272 subjects with COVID-19 were managed with HFNC. One hundred sixty-four (60.3%) were successfully weaned from HFNC, and 111 (67.7%) of those weaned were managed solely in non-ICU settings. ROX index >3.0 at 2, 6, and 12 hours after initiation of HFNC was 85.3% sensitive for identifying subsequent HFNC success. One hundred eight subjects were intubated for failure of HFNC (61 early failures and 47 late failures). Mortality after HFNC failure was high (45.4%). There was no statistical difference in hospital mortality (39.3% vs 53.2%, P = .18) or any of the secondary end points between early and late HFNC failure groups. This remained true even when adjusted for covariates. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review, HFNC was a viable strategy and mechanical ventilation was unecessary in the majority of subjects. In the minority that progressed to mechanical ventilation, duration of HFNC did not differentiate subjects with worse clinical outcomes. The ROX index was sensitive for the identification of subjects successfully weaned from HFNC. Prospective studies in COVID-19 are warranted to confirm these findings and to optimize patient selection for use of HFNC in this disease.","Chandel, Abhimanyu; Patolia, Saloni; Brown, A Whitney; Collins, A Claire; Sahjwani, Dhwani; Khangoora, Vikramjit; Cameron, Paula C; Desai, Mehul; Kasarabada, Aditya; Kilcullen, Jack K; Nathan, Steven D; King, Christopher S",Respir. care,,434

Purpose To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system in differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia on chest CT and assess radiologist performance without and with AI assistance. Methods 521 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from ten hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia on chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the EfficientNet B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by two-layer fully-connected neural network to pool slices together. Our final cohort of 1,186 patients (132,583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance on separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance. Results Our final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% CI: 90-98%), sensitivity 95% (95% CI: 83-100%) and specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88-99%) with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) AUC of 0.95 and Precision-Recall (PR) AUC of 0.90. On independent testing, our model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82-90%), sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81-94%) and specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80-90%) with ROC AUC of 0.90 and PR AUC of 0.87.

Korean mothers then upload this information on the boards of online groups called ""mom cafes."" Based upon a digital ethnography of 15 ""mom cafes,"" we examine how Korean mothers understand the travel histories of virus patients and explore the relationships between morality and materiality in the context of infectious disease surveillance. The main findings reveal that mom cafe mothers form moral personhood based on information gathered about artifacts, places, and the mobility of patients. They tie patients' travel histories inextricably to moral identities. Non-maleficence is central to Korean mothers' morality. This morality appears through the material discourses of artifacts, places, and mobility. A face mask becomes one such hallmark of morality. It is a requisite for moral persons. Those who visit crowded places, such as churches, clubs, and room salons, become immoral because they can be easily infected and spread the virus to their families and communities.

OBJECTIVE: This work aims to predict the medical needs (hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and respiratory assistance) and survivability of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Portugal. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 38,545 infected individuals during 2020 was used. Predictions of medical needs were performed using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches at various stages of a patient's cycle, namely, at testing (prehospitalization), at posthospitalization, and during postintensive care. A thorough optimization of state-of-the-art predictors was undertaken to assess the ability to anticipate medical needs and infection outcomes using demographic and comorbidity variables, as well as dates associated with symptom onset, testing, and hospitalization. RESULTS: For the target cohort, 75% of hospitalization needs could be identified at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Over 60% of respiratory needs could be identified at the time of hospitalization. Both predictions had >50% precision. CONCLUSIONS: The conducted study pinpoints the relevance of the proposed predictive models as good candidates to support medical decisions in the Portuguese population, including both monitoring and in-hospital care decisions.

METHODS: This was a single-centered, retrospective, observational study. Patients of Sino-French Eco-City section of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China attended by Peking University Supporting Medical Team and admitted from Jan. 29, 2020 to Mar. 20, 2020 were included. The positive nucleic acid of COVID-19 virus and combination with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes were in the standard. We collected the clinical data and laboratory examination results of the eligible patients to evaluate the related factors of death. RESULTS: In the study, 94 COVID-19 patients enrolled were divided into the group of death (13 cases) and the group of survivors (81 cases), the average age was 66.7 years. Compared with the survival group, the death group had faster basal heart rate(103.2 beats/min vs. 88.4 beats /min, P=0.004), shortness of breath(29.0 beats /min vs. 20.0 beats /min, P<0.001), higher neutrophil count(9.2×109/L vs. 3.8×109/L, P<0.001), lower lymphocyte count(0.5×109/L vs. 1.1×109/L, P<0.001), creatine kinase MB(CK-MB, 3.2 µg/L vs. 0.8 µg/L, P<0.001), high sensitivity cardiac troponin â (hs-cTnâ , 217.2 ng/L vs. 4.9 ng/L, P<0.001), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP; 945.0 µg/L vs. 154.0 µg/L, P<0.001), inflammatory factor ferritin(770.2 µg/L vs. 622.8 µg/L , P=0.050), interleukin-2 recepter(IL-2R, 1 586.0 U/mL vs. 694.0 U/mL, P<0.001), interleukin-6(IL-6, 82.3 ng/L vs. 13.0 ng/L, P<0.001), interleukin-10(IL-10, 9.8 ng/L vs. 5.0 ng/L, P<0.001)were higher than those in the survival group. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, abnormal increase of IL 2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Multivariate regression showed that old age (OR=1.11, 95%CI=1.03-1.19, P=0.026), low non oxygen saturation(OR=0.85, 95%CI=0.72-0.99, P=0.041), and abnormal increase of IL-10(ï¼9.1 ng/L, OR=101.93, 95%CI=4.74-2190.71, P=0.003)were independent risk factors for COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes. CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients combined with hypertension, coronary heart disease or diabetes, the risk factors for death were old age, low non oxygen saturation, low lymphocyte count, myocardial injury, and abnormal increase of IL-2R, IL-6, and IL-10. Old age, low non oxygen saturation and abnormal increase of IL-10 were independent risk factors.","Yang, H; Yang, L C; Zhang, R T; Ling, Y P; Ge, Q G",Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,434

267031,COVID-19 pandemic personal development plan: A model for maximising higher specialty training,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the challenges of women taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in a peri-urban area. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative study approach was used. Semi-structured questions were devised and used to elicit data on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on women accessing treatment for HIV. Twenty women were interviewed through contacts from community and faith organizations in peri-urban Harare. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo to make analysis easy. The data were thematically analyzed, underpinned by the four phases of data analysis in the Silences Framework. RESULTS: The study discovered that transport problems, confusing COVID-19 restrictions, abuse by police and soldiers at roadblocks, a shortage of medication, lack of health check-up routines, involuntary default of ART, and a shortage of personal protective equipment affected HIV-positive women accessing ART during the COVID-19 lockdown. CONCLUSION: People living with HIV need a robust supporting environment and a functioning health system. In response to COVID-19 all services were halted to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Pandemic preparedness is important in keeping an adequate supply of ART and responding to the needs of individuals on HIV treatment.","Nyashanu, Mathew; Chireshe, Rumbidzai; Mushawa, Fungisai; Ekpenyong, Mandu S",Int. j. gynaecol. obstet,,434
267048,"The Covid-19 pandemic and the regional peculiarities of its diffusion in the urban network segment in the state of Tocantins, Brazil",2020,"BACKGROUND: Starting from the first months of 2020, worldwide population has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Many nations, including Italy, took extreme actions to reduce the diffusion of the virus, profoundly changing lifestyles. The Italians have been faced with both the fear of contracting the infection and the consequences of enforcing social distancing. This study was aimed to understand the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the psychopathological outcomes related to the first phase of this emergency. METHODS: The study included 2291 respondents. An online survey collected information on socio-demographic variables, history of direct or indirect contact with COVID-19, and additional information concerning the COVID-19 emergency. Moreover, psychopathological symptoms such as anxiety, mood alterations and post-traumatic symptomatology were assessed. RESULTS: The results revealed that respectively 31.38%, 37.19% and 27.72% of respondents reported levels of general psychopathological symptomatology, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms over the cut-off scores. Furthermore, a significant worsening of mood has emerged. Being a female or under the age of 50 years, having had direct contact with people infected by the COVID-19, and experiencing uncertainty about the risk of contagion represent risk factors for psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic appear to impact not only on physical health but also on psychological well-being. Although these results need to be considered with caution being based on self-reported data collected at the beginning of this emergency, they should be used as a starting point for further studies aimed to develop interventions to minimize both the brief and long-term psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Forte, Giuseppe; Favieri, Francesca; Tambelli, Renata; Casagrande, Maria",,,434

In Canada, where this study took place, older adults have been encouraged to self-isolate while the rest of the population has been cautioned against in-person contact with them. Prior to COVID-19, social isolation and loneliness among older adults was considered a serious public health concern. Using a series of semi-structured interviews with 26 community-dwelling older adults (65+) living in rural Manitoba, we explore older adults' experiences of isolation and loneliness in the initial stages of the pandemic between the months of May and July 2020. Participants identified a loss of autonomy, loss of activities and social spaces (e.g., having coffee or eating out, volunteering, and going to church), and lack of meaningful connection at home as factors influencing their sense of isolation and loneliness. Although these loses initially influenced participants' self-reported isolation and loneliness, the majority developed strategies to mitigate isolation and loneliness, such as drawing on past experiences of isolation, engaging in physically distanced visits, connecting remotely, and ""keeping busy."" Our findings call attention to the role of different environments and resources in supporting older adults social and emotional wellbeing, particularly as they adapt to changes in social contact over time.","Herron, Rachel V; Newall, Nancy E G; Lawrence, Breanna C; Ramsey, Doug; Waddell, Candice M; Dauphinais, Jennifer",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,434

The COVID-19 less frequently affects the pediatric group, and asymptomatic children are commonly reported. This feature is important due to the potential transmissibility of COVID-19 through these cases. There is a variety of atypical clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations among children infected with COVID-19. Case presentation: We report two sisters with COVID-19 pneumonia who had close contact with their 77-year-old grandmother. Their grandmother expired with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The older sister (15 years old) firstly presented with severe cough, fever, dyspnea, diarrhea, and lymphopenia. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed atypical lobar pneumonic infiltration only in the left lower lobe. The younger sister (6 years old) was affected the following day with milder symptoms (i.e., fever and cough). Her chest CT scan demonstrated typical mild generalized patchy ground-glass opacity with interlobular septal thickening scattered in both lungs. The CT presentation of their grandmother showed typical bilateral white lungs with crazy paving appearance. The standard regimen for both sisters was administrated, and the patients’ respiratory conditions improved after 5 days of treatment. Both cases were discharged with good general conditions. Conclusion: Children are considered potentially important causes of COVID-19 transmission. The symptoms in children are milder, and clinicians should be aware of taking a definite history of infected family members. Atypical clinical symptoms and imaging features are more common in children than adults; therefore, it is necessary to identify the typical and atypical imaging patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pediatric population.","Gharekhanloo, Farideh; Sedighi, Iraj; Khazaei, Salman",Egypt.

Although healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a way of contagion for patients, vaccination coverage among them is low. Mandatory vaccination has been proposed, but controversies remain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the acceptance of mandatory vaccination by HCWs, and to investigate associated characteristics. MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL and Web of Science were used to search for studies assessing the topic. PRISMA statements were followed. Of the 13,457 univocal records found, 52 studies were included in the systematic review and 40 in the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of HCWs accepting the policy was of 61% (95% CI: 53%- 68%) but with great heterogeneity between continents (from 54% in Europe to 69% in Asia) and in different professionals (from 40% in nurses to 80% in students). Vaccinated HCWs agreed more frequently with mandatory vaccination than non-vaccinated ones. More studies that consider mandatory vaccination acceptance as the main outcome are needed, but the results of this study confirm that in some settings the majority of HCWs favour mandatory vaccination. This, combined with effects that a flu epidemic could have if overlapped to pandemics with similar symptoms, requires renewed considerations on mandatory vaccination.","Gualano, Maria Rosaria; Corradi, Alessio; Voglino, Gianluca; Catozzi, Dario; Olivero, Elena; Corezzi, Michele; Bert, Fabrizio; Siliquini, Roberta",Vaccine,,434

Online cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) programs provide scalable access to psychological interventions, however the effectiveness of these programs during the pandemic has not been investigated. This study examined the uptake and effectiveness of iCBT for symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first eight months of the pandemic in Australia (March- October 2020) and compared outcomes to the 12 months prior to COVID-19. METHODS: 6,132 adults commenced iCBT (5,074 during the pandemic and 1,058 in the year before) and completed measures of anxiety and depression symptom severity, and psychological distress pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: In the COVID-19 period, we observed a 504% increase in the number of monthly course registrations compared to the year prior (with a peak increase of 1,138% between April and June 2020). Baseline anxiety and depression symptom severity were similar for the COVID and pre-COVID groups. Prior to and during the pandemic, the iCBT course was associated with large effect size reductions in anxiety (g = 0.94-1.18) and depression (g = 0.92-1.12) symptom severity, as well as psychological distress (g = 1.08-1.35). LIMITATIONS: lack of control group and long-term follow-up, as well as lack of detailed information about course users (e.g., health status and life context). CONCLUSION: Results indicate the considerable increase in demand for psychological support during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia and demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of iCBT for symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Mahoney, Alison; Li, Ian; Haskelberg, Hila; Millard, Michael; Newby, Jill M",J Affect Disord,,434

273234,COVID-19 and dental education: A Malaysian perspective,2021,"Quantum machine learning (QML) can complement the growing trend of using learned models for a myriad of classification tasks, from image recognition to natural speech processing. A quantum advantage arises due to the intractability of quantum operations on a classical computer. Many datasets used in machine learning are crowd sourced or contain some private information. To the best of our knowledge, no current QML models are equipped with privacy-preserving features, which raises concerns as it is paramount that models do not expose sensitive information. Thus, privacy-preserving algorithms need to be implemented with QML. One solution is to make the machine learning algorithm differentially private, meaning the effect of a single data point on the training dataset is minimized. Differentially private machine learning models have been investigated, but differential privacy has yet to be studied in the context of QML. In this study, we develop a hybrid quantum-classical model that is trained to preserve privacy using differentially private optimization algorithm. This marks the first proof-of-principle demonstration of privacy-preserving QML. The experiments demonstrate that differentially private QML can protect user-sensitive information without diminishing model accuracy. Although the quantum model is simulated and tested on a classical computer, it demonstrates potential to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum devices (noisy intermediate-scale quantum [NISQ]).

METHODS: A non-blinded, prospective and single-arm evaluation was carried out over a 5-day period, in which micro-costing was used to compare single-use rhinolaryngoscopes with reusable rhinolaryngoscopes. RESULTS: Overall, 68 per cent of the investigators perceived the single-use rhinolaryngoscope to be 'good' or 'very good', while 85 per cent believed the single-use rhinolaryngoscope could replace the reusable rhinolaryngoscope (n = 59). The incremental costs of reusable rhinolaryngoscope eyepieces and videoscopes in the out-patient clinic, when compared to single-use rhinolaryngoscopes, were £30 and £11, respectively. The incremental costs of reusable rhinolaryngoscope eyepieces and videoscopes in the acute surgical assessment unit, when compared to single-use rhinolaryngoscopes, were -£4 and -£73, respectively. CONCLUSION: The single-use rhinolaryngoscope provides a clinically comparable, and potentially cost-minimising, alternative to the reusable rhinolaryngoscope for use in the acute surgical assessment unit of our hospital.","Mistry, R; Russell, R V; Walker, N; Ofo, E",J Laryngol Otol,,434

A part of the content on US elections is organic, coming from users discussing their opinions of the candidates, political positions, or relevant content presented on television. Another significant part of the content generated originates from organized campaigns, both official and by astroturfing. In this study, we obtain approximately 17.5M tweets containing 3M users, based on prevalent hashtags related to US election 2020, as well as the related YouTube links, contained in the Twitter dataset, likes, dislikes and comments of the videos and conduct volume, sentiment and graph analysis on the communities formed. Particularly, we study the daily traffic per prevalent hashtags, plot the retweet graph from July to September 2020, show how its main connected component becomes denser in the period closer to the elections and highlight the two main entities ('Biden' and 'Trump'). Additionally, we gather the related YouTube links contained in the previous dataset and perform sentiment analysis. The results on sentiment analysis on the Twitter corpus and the YouTube metadata gathered, show the positive and negative sentiment for the two entities throughout this period. The results of sentiment analysis indicate that 45.7% express positive sentiment towards Trump in Twitter and 33.8% positive sentiment towards Biden, while 14.55% of users express positive sentiment in YouTube metadata gathered towards Trump and 8.7% positive sentiment towards Biden. Our analysis fill the gap between the connection of offline events and their consequences in social media by monitoring important events in real world and measuring public volume and sentiment before and after the event in social media.","Shevtsov, Alexander; Oikonomidou, Maria; Antonakaki, Despoina; Pratikakis, Polyvios; Ioannidis, Sotiris",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08183v4.pdf,434
276227,Changes in Crime Rates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-19,"Since January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has dominated the media and exercises pressure on governments worldwide. Apart from its effects on economies, education systems and societies, the pandemic has also influenced climate change research. This paper examines the extent to which COVID-19 has influenced climate change research worldwide during the first wave at the beginning of 2020 and how it is perceived to exploit it in the future. This study utilised an international survey involving those dedicated to climate change science and management research from Academia, Government, NGOs, and international agencies in 83 countries. Results show that: (1) COVID-19 modified the way the surveyed researchers work, (2) there are indicators that COVID-19 has already influenced the direction of climate change and adaptation policy implementation, and (3) respondents perceived (explicitly concerning the COVID-19 lockdowns of March-April 2020), that the pandemic has drawn attention away from climate policy. COVID-19 has influenced the agenda of climate change research for more than half of the respondents and is likely to continue in the future, suggesting that the impacts on their research will still be felt for many years. The paper concludes by outlining critical implications for policy-making.","Filho, Walter Leal Wall Tony Nagy Gustavo J.; Alves, Fatima Carril Luis Ricardo Fernández Li Chunlan Mucova Serafino Platje Johannes Rayman-Bacchus Lez Totin Edmond Ayal Desalegn Y.; Lütz, Johannes Azeiteiro Ulisses M.; Vinuesa, Antonio Garcia Minhas Aprajita",Environmental Science &amp; Policy,,434

This outbreak warns diagnosing infected people is an important issue. So, in this research, a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system called COV-CAD is proposed for diagnosing COVID-19 disease. This COV-CAD system is created by a feature extractor, a classification method, and a content-based imaged retrieval (CBIR) system. The proposed feature extractor is created by using the modified AlexNet CNN. The first modification changes ReLU activation functions to LeakyReLU for increasing efficiency. The second change is converting a fully connected (FC) layer of AlexNet CNN with a new FC, which results in reducing learnable parameters and training time. Another FC layer with dimensions 1 × 64 is added at the end of the feature extractor as the feature vector. In the classification section, a new classification method is defined in which the majority voting technique is applied on outputs of CBIR, SVM, KNN, and Random Forest for final diagnosing. Furthermore, in retrieval section, the proposed method uses CBIR because of its ability to retrieve the most similar images to the image of a patient. Since this feature helps physicians to find the most similar cases, they could conduct further statistical evaluations on profiles of similar patients. The system has been evaluated by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and mean average precision and its accuracy for CT and X-ray datasets is 93.20% and 99.38%, respectively. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more efficient than other similar studies.","Shakarami, Ashkan; Menhaj, Mohammad Bagher; Tarrah, Hadis",Optik (Stuttg),,434

We then assessed whether this association is modified by disability status. METHODS: We used three waves of cohort data from the Longitudinal Surveys of Australian Youth. We fitted logistic regression models to account for confounders of the relationship between labour force status (employed, not in the labour force, unemployed and having problems looking for work) at age 21 years and psychological distress at age 22 years. We then estimated whether this association was modified by disability status at age 21 years. RESULTS: Being unemployed and having problems looking for work at age 21 years was associated with odds of psychological distress that were 2.48 (95% CI 1.95 to 3.14) times higher than employment. There was little evidence for additive effect measure modification of this association by disability status (2.52, 95% CI -1.21 to 6.25). CONCLUSIONS: Young people who were unemployed and having problems looking for work had increased odds of poor mental health. Interventions should focus on addressing the difficulties young people report when looking for work, with a particular focus on supporting those young people facing additional barriers to employment such as young people with disabilities.","Shields, Marissa; Dimov, Stefanie; King, Tania L; Milner, Allison; Kavanagh, Anne; Spittal, Matthew J; Disney, George",Occup. environ. med,,434

Combined multi-sample testing in pools instead of single tests might enhance laboratory capacity and reduce costs, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: The purpose of our study was to assess the value of a simple questionnaire to guide and further improve pooling strategies for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing. Methods: Pharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 testing were obtained from healthcare and police staff, hospital inpatients, and nursing home residents in the southwestern part of Germany. We designed a simple questionnaire, which included questions pertaining to a suggestive clinical symptomatology, recent travel history, and contact with confirmed cases to stratify an individual's pre-test probability of having contracted COVID-19. The questionnaire was adapted repeatedly in face of the unfolding pandemic in response to the evolving epidemiology and observed clinical symptomatology. Based on the response patterns, samples were either tested individually or in multi-sample pools. We compared the pool positivity rate and the number of total PCR tests required to obtain individual results between this questionnaire-based pooling strategy and randomly assembled pools. Findings: Between March 11 and July 5, 2020, we processed 25,978 samples using random pooling (n = 6,012; 23.1%) or questionnaire-based pooling (n = 19,966; 76.9%). The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.9% (n = 238). Pool positivity (14.6% vs. 1.2%) and individual SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (3.4% vs. 0.1%) were higher in the random pooling group than in the questionnaire group. The average number of PCR tests needed to obtain the individual result for one participant was 0.27 tests in the random pooling group, as compared to 0.09 in the questionnaire-based pooling group, leading to a laboratory capacity increase of 73% and 91%, respectively, as compared to single PCR testing. Conclusions: Strategies that combine pool testing with a questionnaire-based risk stratification can increase laboratory testing capacities for COVID-19 and might be important tools, particularly in resource-constrained settings.","Schneitler, Sophie; Jung, Philipp; Bub, Florian; Alhussein, Farah; Benthien, Sophia; Berger, Fabian K; Berkó-Göttel, Barbara; Eisenbeis, Janina; Hahn, Daphne; Halfmann, Alexander; Last, Katharina; Linxweiler, Maximilian; Lohse, Stefan; Papan, Cihan; Pfuhl, Thorsten; Rissland, Jürgen; Roth, Sophie; Schlotthauer, Uwe; Utzinger, Jürg; Smola, Sigrun; Gärtner, Barbara C; Becker, Sören L",Ann Glob Health,,434

BACKGROUND: Nurses are at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection because they are in closer, longer-duration contact with patients. These situations can negatively affect the mental health of nurses. METHODS: This study analysed data from COVID-19 module in the Korean Nurses' Health Study. Data from 906 participants were analysed. To identify the factors influencing mental health, descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Caring for patients who are COVID-19-positive increased levels of fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms of nurses. The hospital safety climate influenced mental well-being among nurses. CONCLUSION: Caring for patients with COVID-19 had a negative impact on fear, anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, the higher was the perceived hospital safety climate, the lower were the nurses' psychological symptoms. Further research on the mental health of nurses is warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Institutions should manage human resources to enable periodic rotation of nurses' work and working periods related to COVID-19. In addition, hospital managers should provide sufficient personal protective equipment, related education, and safety climate.","Cho, Mijung; Kim, Oksoo; Pang, Yanghee; Kim, Bohye; Jeong, Hyunseon; Lee, Jisun; Jung, Heeja; Jeong, Sun Young; Park, Hyun-Young; Choi, Hansol; Dan, Hyunju",Int Nurs Rev,,434

The disease process was initially defined by presence of respiratory symptoms; however, it is now well studied and shown in evidence that this is a multisystem process. Involvement of gastrointestinal (GI) system has been identified, and GI symptoms can be the only presenting symptoms in some patients. Hence, it is important to identify and understand the GI symptoms associated with COVID-19 for appropriate care of patient. We conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis to identify the GI symptoms of COVID-19 and identify association of diarrhea with severity of COVID-19. We performed extensive search of Medline and Embase from December 2019 to May 2020 to identify articles reporting GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was prevalence of GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients, and secondary outcome was the association of diarrhea with disease severity. A total of 38 studies with 8407 patients were included. Of the total patients, 15.47% patients had at least one GI symptom. The pooled prevalence of nausea/vomiting was 7.53% and diarrhea was 11.52%. On metaanalysis, patients with diarrhea as one of the presenting symptoms were more likely to have severe disease (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.11-3.38, p = 0.01). Our systematic review and metaanalysis demonstrated that GI symptoms are common in COVID-19. Presence of diarrhea as a presenting symptom is associated with increased disease severity and likely worse prognosis.

To reduce transmission, a 'lockdown' was introduced in Ireland between March-May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of Consultant Psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it's impact on Mental Health Services. METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to Consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of Information Technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (N=197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, N=95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, N=100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, N=88/136). Social isolation and reduced face-to-face mental health supports were among the main reasons identified. The needs of children and older adults were highlighted. Most consultants (76%, N=98/129) felt their working day was affected and their well-being reduced (52%, N=61/119). The majority felt IT equipment availability was inadequate (67%, N=88/132). Main themes identified from free-text sections were service management, relationship between patients and healthcare service and effects on consultants' lives. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on service provision and consultant wellness. This further supports the longstanding need to increase mental health service investment in Ireland.","Kelleher, Eric; Geary, Eoin; Tawfik, Mary; Ní Mhuircheartaigh, Eimear; Gavin, Blánaid; Wall, Mary; Lyne, John; Doherty, Anne M; McNicholas, Fiona",Ir J Psychol Med,,434

The aim was to determine the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care from 11 April through 30 June 2020. METHODS: We assumed three non-exponential scenarios for the development of the cumulative case numbers up to 30 June 2020 (linear, slow quadratic, and fast quadratic). We assumed that 3-10% of of patients would require intensive care, that 8 days would elapse from a positive test to the need for intensive care, and that intensive care would be necessary for 14 or 20 days. RESULTS: Extrapolation of the maximum registered daily COVID-19 cases reveals a range of 4133 to 12 233 cases. Assuming that 3-10% of newly detected COVID-19 cases become intensive care patients and the average length of ICU stay is between 14 and 20 days, we arrive at a maximum daily number of ICU cases between 1989 (linear extrapolation, 3% ICU, 14 days in ICU) and 20 966 (fast quadratic extrapolation, 10% ICU, 20 days in ICU). CONCLUSION: Our results give no rise for concern that triage of COVID-19 patients may become necessary in Germany. However, the occupancy of ICU beds should be managed centrally to ensure optimal use of bed capacity. If, contrary to expectations, an exponential increase in case numbers should occur after all, our results will become invalid.","Stang, Andreas; Stang, Maximilian; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz",Dtsch Arztebl Int,,434

282873,Introduction to Special Issue: Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on LGBTQ+ Health and Well-Being,2021,"This paper examines the trends and prospects of medical history in Japan. The study of medical history in Japan has developed in various periods and themes. In particular, many studies period have actively made full use of old documents and materials that have been well-preserved. This paper introduces the research trends of medical history in Japan, while discussing the issues surrounding the concept and designation of medical history in present day Japan. This can be seen as an inevitable phenomenon that emerged as methods of medical history research have become diversified, and there are many suggestions related to the future direction of this study. Based on this, this paper points out the characteristics of medical history research conducted in each period since the first half of the twentieth century. In particular, this investigation confirmed that the subjects and research methods of medical history became diversified under the influence of the nation state theory. Furthermore, this study also found that the major topics of medical history research are analysis of medical books, doctors and medical personnel, the starting point of modern medicine, the establishment and change of the medical system, the social impact of infectious diseases, and the discipline and management of the national body. In addition, studies are being conducted to compare how the regulations and operations of medicine and medical and hygiene systems are being developed in the context of ""East Asia.""","Kim, Youngsoo",Uisahak,,434
283510,A literature survey of the robotic technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Human social behavior plays a crucial role in how pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 or fake news spread in a population. Social interactions determine the contact network among individuals, while spreading, requiring individual-to-individual transmission, takes place on top of the network. Studying the topological aspects of a contact network, therefore, not only has the potential of leading to valuable insights into how the behavior of individuals impacts spreading phenomena, but it may also open up possibilities for devising effective behavioral interventions. Because of the temporal nature of interactions - since the topology of the network, containing who is in contact with whom, when, for how long, and in which precise sequence, varies (rapidly) in time - analyzing them requires developing network methods and metrics that respect temporal variability, in contrast to those developed for static (i.e., time-invariant) networks. Here, by means of event mapping, we propose a method to quantify how quickly agents mingle by transforming temporal network data of agent contacts. We define a novel measure called 'contact sequence centrality', which quantifies the impact of an individual on the contact sequences, reflecting the individual's behavioral potential for spreading. Comparing contact sequence centrality across agents allows for ranking the impact of agents and identifying potential 'behavioral super-spreaders'. The method is applied to social interaction data collected at an art fair in Amsterdam. We relate the measure to the existing network metrics, both temporal and static, and find that (mostly at longer time scales) traditional metrics lose their resemblance to contact sequence centrality. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for the sequential nature of contacts when analyzing social interactions.","Dekker, Mark M.; Blanken, Tessa F.; Dablander, Fabian; Ou, Jiamin; Borsboom, Denny; Panja, Debabrata",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01443v1.pdf,434

In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. MATERIAL: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. RESULTS: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71%, respectively). Approximatively, 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. CONCLUSION: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement). Urologists must anticipate for lockdown exit in order to catch-up delayed surgeries.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis were given a questionnaire consisting of general questions (age, sex, date of symptoms, smoking history, concomitant diseases), questions about the most obvious symptom at presentation (one option only), the severity and frequency of symptoms (general and ENT), and STL (recovery time and degree of recovery). RESULTS: The study population consisted of 172 patients, 18-65 years old (mean age, 37.8 ± 12.5 years; 51.2% female; 76.2% nonsmokers). Cough (n = 30, 17.4%) and loss of sense of smell (n = 18, 10.4%) were the most obvious general and ENT symptoms, respectively. Eighty-eight patients (51.2%) reported loss of sense of smell, and 81 patients (47.1%) reported loss of sense of taste. The mean recovery times for loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were 8.02 ± 6.41 and 8.20 ± 7.07 days, respectively. The loss of sense of smell and loss of sense of taste were the unique symptoms in four (4.54%) and one (1.23%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: STL is a common symptom in COVID-19 and may be the first and/or only symptom of this disease. In patients presenting with STL complaints, surveillance for possible COVID-19 disease and screening tests will facilitate the struggle against the disease.","Sakalli, Erdal; Temirbekov, Dastan; Bayri, Esra; Alis, Esra Ergun; Erdurak, Selcuk Cem; Bayraktaroglu, Mesut",Am J Otolaryngol,,434
284211,COVID-19 Pandemic: Impacts of Social Lockdown on Nutritional Health and Beyond,2021,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious lung injury in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This process often is difficult to reverse, eventually leading to the death of patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment can provide patients with cardiopulmonary function support and buy time for clinicians' treatment. However, some patients still suffer from poor oxygenation after ECMO treatment. At this time, nurses can change the patient's position to prone position to improve oxygenation level and promote sputum excretion. It is a great challenge for COVID-19 patients to change their postures while receiving ECMO treatment. This article provides suggestions for this process by reviewing our hospital's experience in treating severe COVID-19 patients.","Nie, Qing; Ye, Aiwu; Wei, Shixiong",Heart Surg Forum,,434

285598,Lessons Learned from Virtual Transitions of Undergraduate Student Support Programs due to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-10,"Simulation models are valuable tools for resource usage estimation and capacity planning. In many situations, reliable data is not available. We introduce the BuB simulator, which requires only the specification of plausible intervals for the simulation parameters. By performing a surrogate-model based optimization, improved simulation model parameters can be determined. Furthermore, a detailed statistical analysis can be performed, which allows deep insights into the most important model parameters and their interactions. This information can be used to screen the parameters that should be further investigated. To exemplify our approach, a capacity and resource planning task for a hospital was simulated and optimized. The study explicitly covers difficulties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It can be shown, that even if only limited real-world data is available, the BuB simulator can be beneficially used to consider worst- and best-case scenarios. The BuB simulator can be extended in many ways, e.g., by adding further resources (personal protection equipment, staff, pharmaceuticals) or by specifying several cohorts (based on age, health status, etc.).

287184,AAN Takes Leading Role in Virtual Advocacy During COVID-19 Pandemic—And It Pays Off,2020,"Leadership constituted a topic of high interest for researchers and practitioners alike for years. Numerous studies have focused on leadership styles, particularly charismatic leadership, as an antecedent to organizational achievements. However, most researchers neglected to consider the followers' perception of their leader's performance. Understanding and accommodating the needs of the followers is essential to the leader's success. The current study investigates the influence of charismatic leaders on dispersed teams in non-vocational educational institutions in Lebanon. This quantitative study utilized two structured questionnaires to investigate the charismatic leadership during the COVID-19 crisis from the perspective of educators who work in virtual teams. Five hypotheses on the effect of crisis-bound charismatic leadership on distant educational teams were tested. The relation between the number of years of experience and charisma was not explored since the majority of respondents fell in the category of five years or more at the institution. A total of seventy-seven respondents completed the survey online. Statistical analysis, using the software SPSS-23, showed that neither gender nor level of education affected the followers' perception of charismatic leadership during crises. Nonetheless, the study findings showed a strong positive correlation between charismatic leadership and the ability to lead in a crisis, concluding that charismatic leaders emerge in times of stress.

287268,ECMO Program Emergency Planning and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The current pandemic is, above all, a crisis of knowledge—Humanity had to find a vac-cine, and now we are not sure how to behave socially to minimize the pandemic bad effects. For organizations, this situation requires an update in the reflection regarding both the strategy and the actions that should be performed. Therefore, the current crisis requires new ways of apply-ing knowledge strategies and dealing with dynamic capabilities. We first analyze the two questions (knowledge strategies and dynamic capabilities) in abstract and general terms, and then we specifically focus on business education during the COVID-19 crisis. We conclude that COVID-19 creates a need for all knowledge strategies in terms of business education. Data, information, knowledge, and wisdom will be needed;above all, it requires the Unknown-Knowns, which is the basis for Knowledge Sharing, and the Unknown-Unknowns that base Knowledge Exploration because both Knowledge Exploitation and Knowledge Acquisition are strategies business schools use to perform in times of crisis. They are more difficult to implement because both the Known-Knowns and the Known-Unknowns are less valuable to solve a crisis like this one: all this will result in “agile universities”, which will be (and already are) those that will use the right strategies and the right dynamic capabilities and will have better results. The paper is original because we link Knowledge Management and Human Resources Development Concepts to generate a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the organizational behavior about a very specific problem—business education—in a very specific time of the COVID-19 crisis. The limits of the paper relate to the evolution of society itself;we do not know when the crisis will end, and we are not sure how much of the “new normal” will remain in the “post-COVID-19” situation. The topic and analysis are of interest for practitioners because daily, they experience how their reality changed and their need to adapt, yet they do not know how. This topic and analysis are also of interest to scholars because science is based on questions, explaining and providing ways to improve one’s reality.

METHODS: We estimated per-day unit costs of COVID-19 case management for patients. We used a bottom-up approach to estimate full economic costs and adopted a health system perspective and patient episode of care as our time horizon. We obtained data on inputs and their quantities from data provided by three public COVID-19 treatment hospitals in Kenya and augmented this with guidelines. We obtained input prices from a recent costing survey of 20 hospitals in Kenya and from market prices for Kenya. RESULTS: Per-day, per-patient unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 disease under home-based care are 1993.01 Kenyan shilling (KES) (US$18.89) and 1995.17 KES (US$18.991), respectively. When these patients are managed in an isolation centre or hospital, the same unit costs for asymptomatic patients and patients with mild-to-moderate disease are 6717.74 KES (US$63.68) and 6719.90 KES (US$63.70), respectively. Per-day unit costs for patients with severe COVID-19 disease managed in general hospital wards and those with critical COVID-19 disease admitted in intensive care units are 13 137.07 KES (US$124.53) and 63 243.11 KES (US$599.51). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 case management costs are substantial, ranging between two and four times the average claims value reported by Kenya's public health insurer. Kenya will need to mobilise substantial resources and explore service delivery adaptations that will reduce unit costs.","Barasa, Edwine; Kairu, Angela; Ng039,; ang039,; a, Wangari; Maritim, Marybeth; Were, Vincent; Akech, Samuel; Mwangangi, Mercy",,,434

289355,Social media effects among freshman medical students during COVID-19 lock-down: An online mixed research,2021,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine and telemonitoring have become invaluable tools in managing chronic diseases, such as heart failure (HF). With the recent pandemic, telemedicine has become the preferred method of providing consultative care. LOCAL PROBLEM: This rapid paradigm shift from face-to-face (F2F) consultations to telemedicine required a collaborative approach for successful implementation while maintaining quality of care. The processes for conducting a telemedicine visit for HF patient are not well defined or outlined. METHOD: Using a collaborative practice model and nurse practitioner led program, technology was leveraged to manage the high-risk HF population using virtual care (consultation via phone or video-to-home) with two aims: first to provide ongoing HF care using available telemedicine technologies or F2F care when necessary and, second, to evaluate and direct those needing urgent/emergent level of care to emergency department (ED). INTERVENTION: The process was converted into an intuitive algorithm that describes essential elements and team roles necessary for execution of a successful HF consultation. RESULTS: Following the algorithm, nurse practitioners conducted 132 visits, yielding 100% success in the conversion of F2F appointments to telemedicine, with 3 patients referred to ED for care.

Long-term antibody responses remain to be fully characterized in hospitalized patients who have a high risk of death. We compared specific Immunoglobulin responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) between two groups, intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU hospitalized patients over several weeks. Plasma specific IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were assessed using a commercial ELISA and compared to an in-house cell-based ELISA. Among the patients analyzed (mean (SD) of age, 64.4 (15.9) years, 19.2% female), 12 (46.2%) were hospitalized in ICU. IgG levels increased in non-ICU cases from the second to the eighth week after symptom onset. By contrast, IgG response was blunted in ICU patients over the same period. ICU patients with hematological malignancies had very weak or even undetectable IgG levels. While both groups had comparable levels of specific IgM antibodies, we found much lower levels of specific IgA in ICU versus non-ICU patients. In conclusion, COVID-19 ICU patients may be at risk of reinfection as their specific IgG response is declining in a matter of weeks. Antibody neutralizing assays and studies on specific cellular immunity will have to be performed.","Dobi, Anthony; Sandenon Seteyen, Anne-Laure; Lalarizo Rakoto, Mahary; Lebeau, Grégorie; Vagner, Damien; Frumence, Étienne; Giry, Claude; Septembre-Malaterre, Axelle; Raffray, Loïc; Gasque, Philippe",,,434

290318,"Mitigation strategies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic—present, future and beyond",2020,"Social distancing was planned as a preventive measure to control the extensive spread of COVID-19. COVID-19-related deaths in Brazil were analyzed during the period of social distancing measures. Mortality data for COVID-19 was obtained from the Worldometer website (www.worldometer.info). Deaths were estimated up to the 31st day after the occurrence of the 5th COVID-19-related death in Brazil. Social distance was measured using Google's community mobility reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). The Brazilian epidemic curves were interconnected, and mathematical models were evaluated to fit the mortality estimation curves. The optimistic model was defined in the opening period of social distancing and, therefore, in the lower mobility (40-60%). The realistic model was calculated according to relaxed social distance measures (<40%) and the pessimistic model was calculated based on the transmission rate between 2-3. Thus, the equations of the mathematical models provided the outcomes for the date of June 9, 2020, as follows: realistic model with 40,623 deaths, pessimistic model with 64,310 deaths and the optimistic model with a projection of 31,384 deaths. As a result of these analyzes, on May 24, 2020, there were a total of 22,965 deaths related to COVID-19, and those deaths included within the proposed mathematical models were 17,452 for the optimistic model, 22,623 for the realistic model and 32,825 for the pessimistic model. Thus, it is concluded that social distancing measures promoted by the Brazilian public managers contributes to the reduction in approximately ten thousand deaths related to COVID-19 in the current pandemic scenario.","Valenti, Vitor E; Menezes, Pedro de Lemos; Abreu, Ana Carolina Gonçalves de; Vieira, Gustavo Nakamura Alves; Garner, David M",J.

Most findings were reported in the form of case reports or case series, whereas a comprehensive overview is still lacking. We conducted a systematic review and searched for all published cases until July 20th 2020. We included 73 patients reported in 52 publications. A broad age range was affected (mean 55, min 11-max 94 years) with male predominance (68.5%). Most patients showed respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, and developed GBS manifestations after COVID-19. However, asymptomatic cases for COVID-19 were also described. The distributions of clinical variants and electrophysiological subtypes resemble those of classic GBS, with a higher prevalence of the classic sensorimotor form and the acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, although rare variants like Miller Fisher syndrome were also reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albuminocytological dissociation was present in around 71% cases, and CSF SARS-CoV-2 RNA was absent in all tested cases. More than 70% of patients showed a good prognosis, mostly after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Patients with less favorable outcome were associated with a significantly older age in accordance with previous findings regarding both classic GBS and COVID-19. COVID-19-associated GBS seems to share most features of classic post-infectious GBS and possibly the same immune-mediated pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, more extensive epidemiological studies are needed to clarify these issues.","Abu-Rumeileh, Samir; Abdelhak, Ahmed; Foschi, Matteo; Tumani, Hayrettin; Otto, Markus",J. neurol,,434

Objective To determine the root canal anatomy of mandibular first premolar in a Nepalese population using decalcification and clearing technique. Method One hundred and fifty extracted mandibular first premolars were collected from Nepalese population. Access cavities were prepared on the occlusal surface of each tooth. Teeth were decalcified by immerging in 5% nitric acid, dehydrated in ethyl alcohol and made transparent using methyl salicylate. Methylene blue dye was injected through access cavity and canal anatomy were observed and classified according to Vertucci's classification. Result The average length of mandibular first premolar was 20.43mm. One rooted teeth were 96% and two rooted were 4%. Vertucci's type I canal configuration was most prevalent (72%) followed by type V (18.6%), type III (3.3%), type II (2.6%) and type IV (2.6%). An unusual configuration was found in one tooth. Isthmus and apical deltas were found in 8.6%) and 14.6% of the cases respectively. Conclusion Type I canal configuration were the most frequently observed root canal configuration in mandibular first premolar followed by type V configuration. Such variation in root canal anatomy should be taken into consideration to ensure successful endodontic therapy of these teeth.","Shrestha, R; Srii, R; Shrestha, D",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),,434

DESIGN: Perspective supplemented with epidemiologic insights from available online databases. METHODS: We extracted data from the Global Vision Database (2017) and Global Burden of Disease Study (2017) to highlight temporal trends in global blindness since 1990, and provide a narrative overview of how COVID-19 may derail progress toward the goals of VISION 2020. RESULTS: Over 2 decades of VISION 2020 advocacy and program implementation have culminated in a universal reduction of combined age-standardized prevalence of moderate-to-severe vision impairment (MSVI) across all world regions since 1990. Between 1990 and 2017, low-income countries observed large reductions in the age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 persons of vitamin A deficiency (25,155 to 19,187), undercorrected refractive disorders (2,286 to 2,040), cataract (1,846 to 1,690), onchocerciasis (5,577 to 2,871), trachoma (506 to 159), and leprosy (36 to 26). Despite these reductions, crude projections suggest that more than 700 million persons will experience MSVI or blindness by 2050, principally owing to our growing and ageing global population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the many resounding successes of VISION 2020, the burden of global blindness and vision impairment is set to reach historic levels in the coming years. The impact of COVID-19, while yet to be fully determined, now threatens the hard-fought gains of global ophthalmology.

RESULTS: The authors identified 13 eligible controlled trials that randomized over 5400 participants to prespecified treatments of interest. Comparison with pooled historical data suggested a numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC over intravenous infliximab for almost every prespecified efficacy outcome evaluated, including Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (C-reactive protein/erythrocyte sedimentation rate), Clinical/Simplified Disease Activity Index scores, American College of Rheumatology responses, and multiple measures of disease remission and low disease activity; for the majority of outcomes, there was no overlap in 95% confidence intervals between groups. A numerical advantage for CT-P13 SC was also observed for safety outcomes (adverse events, infections and discontinuations). Similar, but less marked, trends were observed for comparison with historical efficacy and safety data for adalimumab/etanercept.

This research proposed an enhanced KNN (k NearestNeighbor) algorithm eKNN, which did not randomly choose the value of k. However, it used a mathematical function of the dataset's sample size while determining the k value. The enhanced KNN algorithm eKNN has experimented on 7 benchmark COVID-19 datasets of different size, which has been gathered from standard data cloud of different countries (Brazil, Mexico, etc.). It appeared that the enhanced KNN classifier performs significantly better than ordinary KNN. The second research question augmented the enhanced KNN algorithm with feature selection using ACO (Ant Colony Optimization). Results indicated that the enhanced KNN classifier along with the feature selection mechanism performed way better than enhanced KNN without feature selection.

291785,The state and prospects of TB control service in Russia during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Purpose: As a chronic condition, self-management via education and lifestyle treatments, such as exercise/physical activity and weight loss, is integral to minimizing pain and improving physical function in people with OA. However, OA care is suboptimal world-wide with under-use of lifestyle treatments a major problem. There are numerous barriers to uptake of, and adherence to, lifestyle treatments. One major barrier is difficulty accessing clinicians and/or enabling resources (due to geography, lack of clinicians, cost, inconvenience, or disability and more recently due to restrictions bought on by the COVID-19 pandemic). However, given the high adoption rate of computers, mobile devices and internet globally, digital health approaches provide opportunities for delivering lifestyle treatments remotely to people with OA and supporting them to self manage. The purpose of this presentation is to provide an overview of the research relating to the use of digital health approaches for the lifestyle management of OA. Methods: A narrative review was undertaken with a focus on evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Qualitative studies were also included to provide a more detailed understanding of patients’ and clinicians’ experiences and factors that may influence implementation. Although there are a variety of digital health approaches, those of most interest for this presentation were telehealth, mobile health and apps, web-based platforms, and wearable devices. Research related to digital health approaches for rehabilitation post joint replacement for OA was not covered. Results: A limited number of RCTs have investigated digital health approaches for lifestyle management in people with OA and most have been performed in those with knee OA. Of these RCTs, most have investigated care delivered via telehealth, either telephone or videoconference or internet-based programs. The focus has been on education and exercise/physical activity. There is some evidence that such interventions can reduce pain, improve function and increase physical activity compared to usual care or education control although this is not necessarily consistent across studies. Furthermore, adherence to internet-based programs without any clinician input can be problematic. Few studies have included cost-effectiveness analyses nor moderator analyses to explore patient subgroups who may respond best. Adequately-powered non-inferiority trial designs are needed to establish whether OA care delivered by telehealth or in person result in equivalent patient outcomes. Qualitative studies show that patients and clinicians describe mostly positive experiences but barriers to implementation exist. While many patient-facing apps available in the marketplace may be useful for OA, relatively few are specifically designed for OA. For example, a 2019 review (Choi et al. Health Informatics J. 2019) located only 23 such mobile apps. There is, however, a lack of research into the development and evaluation of apps for OA management. Conclusions: There is some evidence to show that digital health approaches for lifestyle management of OA are feasible, generally acceptable to patients and clinicians, and may be effective ways of improving patient outcomes. However, further high quality research is needed and with longer term follow up to confirm. This is particularly important given that the adoption of digital health services around the world has been dramatically accelerated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. This presents an opportunity to build on this momentum and drive innovation in research-informed digitally-enabled models of OA care.","Bennell, K.",Osteoarthritis and Cartilage,,434

292097,Emotional Well-being During the First Four Months of COVID-19 in the United States,2020,"CONTEXT: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (CO-VID-19) has rapidly evolved into a global pandemic. Kidney dysfunction is common among patients with COVID-19, and patients who develop acute kidney injury (AKI) have inferior outcomes. There is a growing body of evidence that AKI occurs in a substantial number of patients with COVID-19 and that developing AKI is associated with significantly worse outcomes for COVID-19 patients. The risk for death was amplified when AKI resulted in kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Subject of Review: The Study of the Treatment and Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) conducted a multicenter retrospective observational study enrolling 3,099 critically ill adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (J Am Soc Nephrol 2021;32:161-176). A total of 637 of 3,099 patients (20.6%) developed AKI treated with KRT (AKI-KRT) within 14 days of ICU admission, 350 of whom (54.9%) died within 28 days of ICU admission. Predictors of COVID-19 patients' progress to AKI-KRT were higher BMI, higher stages of CKD, lower ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2 ratio) on ICU admission, and greater number of vasopressors received on ICU admission. Second Opinion: Recently, some investigations revealed that the independent predictors of COVID-19 with AKI include older age, Black race, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, mechanical ventilation, higher interleukin-6 level, and use of vasopressor medications. It seems that the underlying comorbidities with preexisting vascular endothelial damage and/or the more serious critically ill CO-VID-19 patients can contribute to the development of AKI and even AKI-KRT.","Chen, Yung-Chang; Fang, Ji-Tseng; Yang, Chih-Wei",Nephron,,434

INTRODUCTION: Management of the severe thoracolumbar (TL) spine fracture-dislocation injuries have been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS: Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B. The post-operative VAS score improved to a mean value of 2.33. The improvement in kyphosis was 26.24° immediate postoperatively and maintained at 25.9°, percentage height loss reduced to 2.75% immediate postoperatively and maintained at 3.16% at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Management of TL fracture-dislocations in COVID times of health care resource scarcity can be challenging. Single surgeon with ODD is a useful technique for achieving good results in these injuries.","Mallepally, Abhinandan Reddy; Marathe, Nandan; Rustagi, Tarush; Mohapatra, Bibhudendu; Mahanjan, Rajat; Das, Kalidutta",Br J Neurosurg,,434

294021,Selection of the Best Healthcare Waste Disposal Techniques During and Post COVID-19 Pandemic Era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To identify and appraise articles describing criteria used to prioritize or withhold a critical care admission. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Medline, EBM Reviews, and CINAHL Complete databases. Gray literature searches and a manual review of references were also performed. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. STUDY SELECTION: We sought all articles and abstracts of original research as well as local, provincial, or national policies on the topic of ICU resource allocation. We excluded studies whose population of interest was neonatal, pediatric, trauma, or noncritically ill. Screening of 6,633 citations was conducted. DATA EXTRACTION: Triage and/or transport criteria were extracted, based on type of article, methodology, publication year, and country. An appraisal scale was developed to assess the quality of identified articles. We also developed a robustness score to further appraise the robustness of the evidence supporting each criterion. Finally, all criteria were extracted, evaluated, and grouped by theme. DATA SYNTHESIS: One-hundred twenty-nine articles were included. These were mainly original research (34%), guidelines (26%), and reviews (21%). Among them, we identified 200 unique triage and transport criteria. Most articles highlighted an exclusion (71%) rather than a prioritization mechanism (17%). Very few articles pertained to transport of critically ill patients (4%). Criteria were classified in one of four emerging themes: patient, condition, physician, and context. The majority of criteria used were nonspecific. No study prospectively evaluated the implementation of its cited criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified 200 criteria classified within four themes that may be included when devising triage programs including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. We identified significant knowledge gaps where research would assist in improving existing triage criteria and guidelines, aiming to decrease arbitrary decisions and variability.","Dahine, Joseph; Hébert, Paul C; Ziegler, Daniela; Chenail, Noémie; Ferrari, Nicolay; Hébert, Réjean",Crit Care Med,,434

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with 273 nodules were enrolled in this retrospective study. Each nodule was categorized according to the CEUS LI-RADS version 2017 and CECT/MRI LI-RADS version 2017. The diagnostic performance of CEUS and CECT/MRI was compared. The reference standard was histopathology diagnosis. Inter-modality agreement was assessed with Cohen's kappa. RESULTS: The inter-modality agreement for CEUS LI-RADS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS was fair with a kappa value of 0.319 (p < 0.001). The positive predictive values (PPVs) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in LR-5, LR-4, and LR-3 were 98.3%, 60.0%, and 25.0% in CEUS, and 95.9%, 65.7%, and 48.1% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The sensitivities and specificities of LR-5 for diagnosing HCC were 75.6% and 93.8% in CEUS, and 83.6% and 83.3% in CECT/MRI, respectively. The positive predictive values of non-HCC malignancy in CEUS LR-M and CECT/MRI LR-M were 33.9% and 93.3%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosing non-HCC malignancy were 90.9%, 84.5%, and 85.0% in CEUS LR-M and 63.6%, 99.6%, and 96.7% in CECT/MRI LR-M, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The inter-modality agreement of the LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. The positive predictive values of HCCs in LR-5 of the CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS are comparable. CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M. KEY POINTS: â¢ The inter-modality agreement for the final LI-RADS category between CEUS and CECT/MRI is fair. â¢ The LR-5 of CEUS and CECT/MRI LI-RADS corresponds to comparable positive predictive values (PPVs) of HCC. For LR-3 and LR-4 nodules categorized by CECT/MRI, CEUS examination should be performed, at least if they can be detected on plain ultrasound. â¢ CECT/MRI LR-M has better diagnostic performance for non-HCC malignancy than CEUS LR-M. For LR-M nodules categorized by CEUS, re-evaluation by CECT/MRI is necessary.","Ding, Jianmin; Long, Lei; Zhang, Xiang; Chen, Chen; Zhou, Hongyu; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Yandong; Jing, Xiang; Ye, Zhaoxiang; Wang, Fengmei",Eur. radiol,,434

We propose an AI approach to Cohort Optimization (AICO) through transformer-based natural language processing of the eligibility criteria and evaluation of the criteria using real-world data. The method can extract common eligibility criteria variables from a large set of relevant trials and measure the generalizability of trial designs to real-world patients. It overcomes the scalability limits of existing manual methods and enables rapid simulation of eligibility criteria design for a disease of interest.

The course comprised essential knowledge based on the patient safety curriculum provided by the WHO. We also explored perceptions and attitudes of students regarding patient safety. Methods: Fourth year medical students completed a questionnaire regarding knowledge, skills, and attitudes on patient safety and quality improvement in medical care. The questionnaire was voluntarily answered online prior to and after the course. Results: In total, 213 students completed the questionnaires. Most students were able to understand medical error, recognize failure and the nature of causation, perform root-cause analysis, and appreciate the role of patient safety interventions. Conversely, a disapproving perspective prevailed among students concerning the preventability of medical errors, utility of reporting systems, just culture and infrastructure (p < 0.05). Conclusion: We found students had a positive perspective concerning learning quality in healthcare and patient safety during our course; nevertheless, their perception of the usefulness of reporting systems to prevent future adverse events and prevent medical errors is uncomplimentary. Medical education should promote error reporting and just culture to change the current perception of medical students.","López-Hernández, Luz Berenice; Díaz, Benjamín Gómez; González, Edgar Oswaldo Zamora; Montes-Hernández, Karen Itzel; Díaz, Stephanie Simone Tlali; Toledo-Lozano, Christian Gabriel; Bustamante-Montes, Lilia Patricia; Vázquez-Cárdenas, Norma Alejandra",,,434

The aim of this study was to explore anxiety levels among adults and children in the UAE and to identify potential risk and protective factors for well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a web-based cross-sectional survey we collected data from 2200 self-selected, assessed volunteers and their children. Demographic information, knowledge and beliefs about COVID-19, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) using the (GAD-7) scale, emotional problems in children using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), worry and fear about COVID-19, coping mechanisms and general health information were collected. Descriptive analysis was carried out to summarize demographic and participant characteristics, Chi-square analysis to explore associations between categorical variables and anxiety levels and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of anxiety levels in adults and emotional problems in children. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of GAD in the general population was 71% with younger people (59.8%) and females (51.7%) reporting highest levels of anxiety. Parents who were teachers reported the highest percentage of emotional problems in children (26.7%). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for GAD-7 scores showed that being female, high levels of worry associated with COVID-19, intention to take the COVID-19 vaccine and smoking were associated with higher levels of anxiety. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression for SDQ showed that higher emotional problems were reported for children in lower and higher secondary education, and parents who had severe anxiety were seven times more likely to report emotional problems in their children. CONCLUSIONS: This study reports the psychological impact of COVID-19 among adults and children in the UAE and highlights the significant association between parental and child anxiety. Findings suggest the urgency for policy makers to develop effective screening and coping strategies for parents and especially children.","Saddik, Basema; Hussein, Amal; Albanna, Ammar; Elbarazi, Iffat; Al-Shujairi, Arwa; Temsah, Mohamad-Hani; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Stip, Emmanuel; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",BMC Psychiatry,,434

301230,Care of the dying person before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A quality improvement project,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Identify splatter/aerosol distribution from dental procedures in an open plan clinic and explore aerosol settling time after dental procedures. METHODS: In two experimental designs using simulated dental procedures on a mannequin, fluorescein dye was introduced: (1) into the irrigation system of an air-turbine handpiece; (2) into the mannequin's mouth. Filter papers were placed in an open plan clinic to collect fluorescein. An 8-metre diameter rig was used to investigate aerosol settling time. Analysis was by fluorescence photography and spectrofluorometry. RESULTS: Contamination distribution varied across the clinic depending on conditions. Unmitigated procedures have the potential to deposit contamination at large distances. Medium volume dental suction (159 L/min air) reduced contamination in the procedural bay by 53%, and in other areas by 81-83%. Low volume suction (40 L/min air) was similar. Cross-ventilation reduced contamination in adjacent and distant areas by 80-89%. In the most realistic model (fluorescein in mouth, medium volume suction), samples in distant bays (&#8805;5 m head-to-head chair distance) gave very low or zero readings (< 0.0016% of the fluorescein used during the procedure). Almost all (99.99%) of the splatter detected was retained within the procedural bay/walkway. After 10 min, very little additional aerosol settled. CONCLUSIONS: Cross-infection risk from dental procedures in an open plan clinic appears small when bays are &#8805; 5 m apart. Dilution effects from instrument water spray were observed, and dental suction is of benefit. Most settled aerosol is detected within 10 min indicating environmental cleaning may be appropriate after this. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Aerosols produced by dental procedures have the potential to contaminate distant sites and the majority of settled aerosol is detectable after 10 min.

301701,Developing Trust With Early Medical School Graduates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"As the COVID-19 outbreak peaks, millions of individuals are losing their income, and economic anxiety is felt worldwide. In three different countries (the USA, the UK, and Israel: N = 1200), the present study addresses four different sources of anxiety: health-related anxiety, economic-related anxiety, daily routine-change anxiety, and anxiety generated by social isolation. We hypothesized that, economic anxiety would have a similar or greater effect, compared to health anxiety. Results show that in all three countries, the levels of economic and health anxiety were essentially equal, and both surpassed routine-change and isolation anxiety. Although the COVID-19 crisis originated in the health field, this study emphasizes the need to move from a generalized concept of anxiety to specific types of distress, most notably economic anxiety. Economic anxiety results in serious mental and physical health problems and should be attended to by clinical professionals and by policy makers.","Bareket-Bojmel, Liad; Shahar, Golan; Margalit, Malka",Int J Cogn Ther,,434
301702,Developing Trust With Early Medical School Graduates During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The core-shell structure of nanoparticles (5 nm radius) of silica grafted with polymer growing from the particle (""grafting from"") is characterized by small angle neutron scattering (SANS), to our knowledge for the first time. This is made possible by a good control of the colloidal dispersion at each step of the synthesis. With this aim, we have improved our chemical procedure based on atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), which allows a good control of kinetics and polydispersity: the reaction takes place in a polar solvent, and the reaction medium remains always crystal clear. For such small particles, in contrary to direct space imaging, SANS is appropriate for characterization of the polymer corona as well as of the silica core using contrast matching provided by mixing normal and deuterated solvent. This allows checking of the level of aggregation at the nanoscale, which is found to be limited to a few percent of the particles in the reaction batch. After an initial slight increase, it is reduced by further polymerization, while the polymer layer grows progressively. After purification, grafted silica can be characterized accurately: its scattering can be fitted by a model of a silica core containing three to five particles surrounded by a polymer shell of thickness 7 nm. This is in good agreement with chain length and grafting density (214 sites per particle) evaluated by chemical analysis; hence SANS provides quantitative insight on chemical synthesis.","Carrot, G; Harrak, A El; Oberdisse, J; Jestin, J; Boué, F",Soft Matter,,434

302390,"In the Covid-19 pandemic, Brazil sees the SUS",2020,"The incidence of 2019 novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) has created a medical emergency throughout the world. Various efforts have been made to develop the vaccine or effective treatments against the disease. The discovery of crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease has made the in silico identification of its inhibitors possible. Based on its critical role in viral replication, the viral protease can prove to be a promising ""target"" for antiviral drug therapy. We have systematically screened an in-house library of 15,754 natural and synthetic compounds, established at International Center for Chemical and Biological Sciences, University of Karachi. The in silico search for potential viral protease inhibitors resulted in nine top ranked ligands (compounds 1-9) against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) based on docking scores, and predictive binding energies. The in silico studies were updated via carrying out the docking, and predictive binding energy estimation, with a recently reported crystal structure of main protease (PDB ID: 6Y2F) at a better resolution i.e., 1.95 Å. Compound 2 (molecular bank code AAA396) was found to have highest negative binding energy of -71.63 kcal/mol for 6LU7. While compound 3 (molecular bank code AAD146) exhibited highest negative binding energy of -81.92 kcal/mol for 6Y2F. The stability of the compounds- in complex with viral protease was analyzed by Molecular Dynamics simulation studies, and was found to be stable over the course of 20 ns simulation time. Compound 2, and 3 were predicted to be the significant inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolase (Mpro) among the nine short listed compounds.","Choudhary, M Iqbal; Shaikh, Muniza; Tul-Wahab, Atia-; Ur-Rahman, Atta-",PLoS One,,434

303020,Exploring the Traveler’s Intentions to Use Public Transport during the COVID-19 Pandemic While Complying with Precautionary Measures,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the measures taken to control it, have a profound impact on healthcare. This study was set up to gain insights into the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on the core competencies of general practice, as they are experienced by general practitioners (GPs) on the frontline. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: We performed a descriptive study using semistructured interviews with 132 GPs in Flanders, using a topic list based on the WONCA definition of core competencies in general practice. Data were analysed qualitatively using framework analysis. RESULTS: Changes in practice management and in consultation strategies were quickly adopted. There was a major switch towards telephone triage and consults, for covid-related as well as for non-covid related problems. Patient-centred care is still a major objective. Clinical decision-making is largely focused on respiratory assessment and triage, and GPs feel that acute care is compromised, both by their own changed focus and by the fact that patients consult less frequently for non-covid problems. Chronic care is mostly postponed, and this will have consequences that will extend and become visible after the corona crisis. Through the holistic eyes of primary care, the current outbreak-as well as the measures taken to control it-will have a profound impact on psychological and socioeconomic well-being. This impact is already visible in vulnerable people and will continue to become clear in the medium and long terms. GPs think that they are at high risk of getting infected. Dropping out and being unable to contribute their part or becoming virus transmitters are reported to be greater concerns than getting ill themselves. CONCLUSIONS: The current times have a profound impact on the core competences of primary care. Although the vast increase in patients soliciting medical help and the necessary separate covid and non-covid flows have been dealt with, GPs are worried about the continuity of regular care and the consequences of the anticovid measures. These may become a threat for the general health of the population and for the provision of primary healthcare in the near and distant future.","Verhoeven, Veronique; Tsakitzidis, Giannoula; Philips, Hilde; Van Royen, Paul",BMJ Open,,434

We examined the association of acid-base blood values (pH) with patient outcomes and calculated the pH test performance to predict prognosis. METHODS: This was a post-hoc analysis of data from the Continuous Chest Compression Trial, which enrolled non-traumatic adult emergency medical system-treated OHCA in Canada and the United States. We examined cases who survived a minimum of 24 hours post hospital arrival. The independent variables of interest were initial pH, final pH, and the change in pH (Î´pH). The primary outcome was neurological status at hospital discharge, with favorable status defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) &#8804; 3. We reported adjusted odds ratios for favorable neurological outcome using multivariable logistic regression models. We calculated the test performance of increasing pH thresholds in 0.1 increments to predict unfavorable neurological status (defined as mRS >3) at hospital discharge. RESULTS: We included 4189 patients. 32% survived to hospital discharge with favorable neurological status. In the adjusted analysis, higher initial pH (OR 6.82; 95% CI 3.71-12.52) and higher final pH (OR 7.99; 95% CI 3.26-19.62) were associated with higher odds of favorable neurological status. pH thresholds with highest positive predictive values were initial pH < 6.8 (92.5%; 95% CI 86.2%-98.8%) and final pH < 7.0 (100%; 95% CI 95.2%-100%). CONCLUSION: In patients with OHCA, pH values were associated with patients' subsequent neurological status at hospital discharge. Final pH may be clinically useful to predict unfavorable neurological status at hospital discharge.","Al Assil, Rahaf; Singer, Joel; Heidet, Matthieu; Fordyce, Christopher B; Scheuermeyer, Frank; Diepen, Sean van; Sekhon, Mypinder; Leung, K H Benjamin; Stenstrom, Rob; Christenson, Jim; Grunau, Brian",Resuscitation,,434
303538,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the social and educational aspects of Saudi university students' lives,2021,"After the initial outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)-in Wuhan, China-and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes remain unanswered but fast explored. More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreaks. Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.","Rahimi, Farid; Talebi Bezmin Abadi, Amin",Arch Med Res,,434

DESIGN: A nationally representative longitudinal survey study of Australian doctors analysed using regression analysis. SETTING: General practice in Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: 448 GPs who completed both the 11th wave (2018-2019) of the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life (MABEL) Survey and the MABEL COVID-19 Special Online Survey (May 2020). OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of all consultations delivered via telephone (audio) or video (audiovisual); proportion of telehealth consultations delivered via video. RESULTS: 46.1% of GP services were provided using telehealth in early May 2020, with 6.4% of all telehealth consultations delivered via video. Higher proportions of telehealth consultations were observed in GPs in larger practices compared with solo GPs: between +0.21 (95% CI +0.07 to +0.35) and +0.28 (95% CI +0.13 to +0.44). Greater proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered through video for GPs with appropriate infrastructure and for GPs with more complex patients: +0.10 (95% CI +0.04 to +0.16) and +0.04 (95% CI +0.00 to +0.08), respectively. Lower proportions of telehealth consultations were delivered via video for GPs over 55 years old compared with GPs under 35 years old: between -0.08 (95% CI -0.02 to -0.15) and -0.15 (95% CI -0.07 to -0.22), and for GPs in postcodes with a higher proportion of patients over 65 years old: -0.005 (95% CI -0.001 to -0.008) for each percentage point increase in the population over 65 years old. CONCLUSIONS: GP characteristics are strongly associated with patterns of telehealth use in clinical work. Infrastructure support and relative pricing of different consultation modes may be useful policy instruments to encourage GPs to deliver care by the most appropriate method.","Scott, Anthony; Bai, Tianshu; Zhang, Yuting",BMJ Open,,434
305663,Reply to Letter to the Editor: Elevated Liver Biochemistries in Hospitalized Chinese Patients With Severe COVID-19: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"Phylogenetic and pathogenesis studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) strains have highlighted some specific mutations that could confer the RNA genome fitness advantages and immunological resistance for their rapid spread in the human population. The analyses of 30 kb RNA SARS-CoVs genome sequences, protein structures, and functions have provided us a perspective of how host-virus protein-protein complexes act to mediate virus infection. The open reading frame (ORF)1a and ORF1b translation yields 16 non-structural (nsp1-16) and 6 accessory proteins (p6, p7a, p8ab, p9b) with multiple functional domains. Viral proteins recruit over 300 host partners forming hetero-oligomeric complexes enabling the viral RNA synthesis, packing, and virion release. Many cellular host factors and the innate immune cells through pattern-recognition receptors and intracellular RNA sensor molecules act to inhibit virus entry and intracellular replication. However, non-structural ORF proteins hijack them and suppress interferon synthesis and its antiviral effects. Pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines storm leads to dysfunctional inflammation, lung injury, and several clinical symptoms in patients. During the global pandemic, COVID-19 patients were identified with non-synonymous substitution of G614D in the spike protein, indicating virus co-evolution in host cells. We review findings that suggest that host RNA editing and DNA repair systems, while carrying on recombination, mutation, and repair of viral RNA intermediates, may facilitate virus evolution. Understanding how the host cell RNA replication process may be driven by SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome fitness will help the testing of vaccines effectiveness to multiple independent mutated coronavirus strains that will emerge.","Belizário, J.

Proning has become a standard treatment in the management of patients with ARDS who have difficulty achieving adequate oxygen saturation. The purpose of this study was to describe the use of early proning of awake, non-intubated patients in the emergency department (ED) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This pilot study was carried out in a single urban ED in New York City. We included patients suspected of having COVID-19 with hypoxia on arrival. A standard pulse oximeter was used to measure SpO2 . SpO2 measurements were recorded at triage and after 5 minutes of proning. Supplemental oxygenation methods included non-rebreather mask (NRB) and nasal cannula. We also characterized post-proning failure rates of intubation within the first 24 hours of arrival to the ED. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included. Overall, the median SpO2 at triage was 80% (IQR 69 to 85). After application of supplemental oxygen was given to patients on room air it was 84% (IQR 75 to 90). After 5 minutes of proning was added SpO2 improved to 94% (IQR 90 to 95). Comparison of the pre- to post-median by the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test yielded P = 0.001. Thirteen patients (24%) failed to improve or maintain their oxygen saturations and required endotracheal intubation within 24 hours of arrival to the ED. CONCLUSION: Awake early self-proning in the emergency department demonstrated improved oxygen saturation in our COVID-19 positive patients. Further studies are needed to support causality and determine the effect of proning on disease severity and mortality.","Caputo, Nicholas D; Strayer, Reuben J; Levitan, Richard",Acad Emerg Med,,434

Rapid spread of the virus around the world shows that identification of transmission routes and preventing environmental contamination, especially in healthcare settings plays a vital role in controlling the disease. In this study, air and surface contamination with SARSCoV-2 were evaluated in different wards of Hajar Hospital in Shahrekord. Materials and methods: In current study, 13 samples of different surfaces and 15 air samples were taken using sterile swabs impregnated with VTM and standard impinger, respectively. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed using RT-PCR. Results: Findings showed that 46.15% of surface samples and 26.66% of air samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These contaminations were detected only in areas which were in close contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: This study confirmed the contamination of air and surface with SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 admitting wards. Therefore, personal precautionary measures, including frequent handwashing, timely changing of face mask, and using more protective equipment are highly recommended in healthcare settings. Moreover, cleaning and regular disinfection of surfaces and equipment and appropriate ventilation of wards are crucial for preventing the disease transmission.

Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods: A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results: Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations: Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence. Conclusions: The specific effects of COVID-19 on the senses may have long-term implications for patient mental health well-being beyond the primary recovery period.

308865,A commentary on potential associations between narcissism and trauma-related outcomes during the coronavirus pandemic,2020,"Traditionally, the management of patients with pulmonary embolism has been accomplished with anticoagulant treatment with parenteral heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists. Although the administration of heparins and oral vitamin K antagonists still plays a role in pulmonary embolism management, the use of these therapies are limited due to other options now available. This is due to their toxicity profile, clearance limitations, and many interactions with other medications and nutrients. The emergence of direct oral anticoagulation therapies has led to more options now being available to manage pulmonary embolism in inpatient and outpatient settings conveniently. These oral therapeutic options have opened up opportunities for safe and effective pulmonary embolism management, as more evidence and research is now available about reversal agents and monitoring parameters. The evolution of the pharmacological management of pulmonary embolism has provided us with better understanding regarding the selection of anticoagulants. There is also a better understanding and employment of anticoagulants in pulmonary embolism in special populations, such as patients with liver failure, renal failure, malignancy, and COVID-19.","Panahi, Ladan; Udeani, George; Horseman, Michael; Weston, Jaye; Samuel, Nephy; Joseph, Merlyn; Mora, Andrea; Bazan, Daniela",Medicina (Kaunas),,434

Detailed compositional and lineage analysis of long read IGH repertoire sequencing, combining examples of pandemic, epidemic and endemic viral infections with control and vaccination samples, demonstrates general responses including increased use of IGHV4-39 in both EBOV and COVID-19 infection cohorts. We also show unique characteristics absent in RSV infection or yellow fever vaccine samples: EBOV survivors show unprecedented high levels of class switching events while COVID-19 repertoires from acute disease appear underdeveloped. Despite the high levels of clonal expansion in COVID-19 IgG1 repertoires there is a striking lack of evidence of germinal centre mutation and selection. Given the differences in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with age, it is also pertinent that we find significant differences in repertoire characteristics between young and old patients. Our data supports the hypothesis that a primary viral challenge can result in a strong but immature humoral response where failures in selection of the repertoire risks off-target effects.","Stewart, Alexander; Sinclair, Emma; Serangeli, Ilaria; Kasar, Nora; Longman, Katherine; Frampas, Cecile; Lewis, Holly-May; Costa, Catia; Kipling, David; Openshaw, Peter; Chiu, Christopher; Baillie, J Kenneth; Scott, Janet; Semple, Malcolm; Bailey, Melanie; Dunn-Walters, Deborah",,,434

All patients were on mechanical ventilation and full telemetery. Results: No drug-related serious adverse events were seen. Hypotension was seen in association with two infusions and diarrhea in association with one, but did not necessitate cessation of therapy. Bigeminy was seen in association with one infusion without sequelae. Seven of eight patients demonstrated a successful course during intensive care and were successfully removed from mechanical ventilation and discharged from intensive care. The eighth patient succumbed to purulent secretions in the lungs. Of those who were discharged from the ICU, six demonstrated successful 30 day survival. The seventh died from a cerebral infract at day 30, deemed unrelated to treatment with VIP. Serum levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor α were obtained in 6 patients at baseline and 24 hours and were seen to decrease with treatment in five patients. Conclusions: Initial clinical results of treatment with VIP in patients with ARDS demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous studies in normal volunteers. The successful clinical course seen in 7 of 8 patients in the setting of an expected 50% survival may suggest that VIP shows promise in the treatment of other infectious conditions that damage the pulmonary epithelium, particularly COVID-19.

311767,Assessing effects of reopening policies on COVID-19 pandemic in Texas with a data-driven transmission model,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has led to rapid and widespread use of remote consultations in general practice, but the health inequalities impact remains unknown. AIM: To explore the impact of remote consultations in general practice, compared to face-to-face consultations, on utilisation and clinical outcomes across socioeconomic and disadvantaged groups. DESIGN & SETTING: Systematic review. METHOD: The authors undertook an electronic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception to June 2020. The study included studies that compared remote consultations to face-to-face consultations in primary care and reported outcomes by PROGRESS Plus criteria. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: Based on 13 studies that explored telephone and internet-based consultations, this review found that telephone consultations were used by younger people of working age, the very old, and non-immigrants, with internet-based consultations more likely to be used by younger people. Women consistently used more remote forms of consulting than men. Socioeconomic and ethnicity findings were mixed, with weak evidence that patients from more affluent areas were more likely to use internet-based communication. Remote consultations appeared to help patients with opioid dependence remain engaged with primary care. No studies reported on the impact on quality of care or clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Remote consultations in general practice are likely to be used more by younger, working people, non-immigrants, older patients, and women, with internet-based consultations more by younger, affluent, and educated groups. Widespread use of remote consultations should be treated with caution until the inequalities impact on clinical outcomes and quality of care is known.","Parker, Ruth F; Figures, Emma L; Paddison, Charlotte Am; Matheson, James Idm; Blane, David N; Ford, John A",,,434

OBJECTIVES: Real-life evaluation of these tests is needed. Using 168 samples from patients hospitalized for COVID-19, non-hospitalized patients but infected with SARS-CoV-2, patients participating in screening campaigns, and samples from patients with a history of other seasonal coronavirus infections, we evaluated the clinical performance of 5 serological assays widely used worldwide (WANTAI®, BIORAD®, EUROIMMUN®, ABBOTT® and LIAISON®). RESULTS: For hospitalized patients, all these assays showed a sensitivity of 100 % from day 9 after the symptoms onset. On the other hand, sensitivity was much lower for patients who did not require hospitalization for COVID-19 confirmed by PCR (from 91.6 % for WANTAI® to 69 % for LIAISON®). These differences do not seem to be due to the antigens chosen by the manufacturers but more to the test formats (IgG detection versus total antibodies). In addition, more than 50 days after a positive PCR for CoV-2-SARS the proportion of positive patients seem to decrease. We did not observe any significant cross-reactions for these techniques with the four other seasonal coronaviruses. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the evaluation and knowledge of the serological tests used is important and should require an optimized strategy adaptation of the analysis laboratories to best meet patient's expectations in the face of this health crisis.","Brochot, Etienne; Demey, Baptiste; Handala, Lynda; François, Catherine; Duverlie, Gilles; Castelain, Sandrine",J Clin Virol,,434

313040,"Reducing Loneliness: The Impact of Mindfulness, Social Cognitions, and Coping",2021,"BACKGROUND: Emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers is critical to the quality of patient care, and effective function of health services. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated. The creation of a culturally-sensitive interdisciplinary blueprint for locally-viable actions model are strongly suggested ahead of future emergency situations.","Olagunju, Andrew T; Bioku, Ayodeji A; Olagunju, Tinuke O; Sarimiye, Foluke O; Onwuameze, Obiora E; Halbreich, Uriel",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,434

314833,The Importance of Well-Being on Resiliency of Filipino Adults During the COVID-19 Enhanced Community Quarantine: A Necessary Condition Analysis,2021,"The Covid-19 pandemic has generated a one-in-a-generation challenge upon the EU, consisting of immediate danger for life and health, savings and jobs of its citizens, as well as for the stability and proper functioning of political and legal systems of its Member States. The manner in which the EU as a whole reacted to such sudden and grave challenge is by no means indicative of its political and legal-constitutional substance, and, consequently, of its capacity to subsist in its present form or to develop further. The centrepiece of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) is the Recovery and Resilience Facility, which should help Member States address the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The establishment of the pandemic recovery fund may be regarded not only as an ad hoc measure, but also as a crucial milestone in the path to overcoming the disbalance between Union solidarity and national interests. However, the whole EU budget deal depended on the acceptance of the Rule of Law Mechanism by all Member States. In the first part, this paper will analyse the COVID-19 recovery fund compromise solution as it has been finally agreed. Firstly, we will try to determine the effectiveness of the conditionality mechanism, in the light of European Council Conclusions on the ""interpretative declaration on the new Rule of Law Mechanism"" and its legal effects. Secondly, we will tackle the issue of the enforcement of the Rule of Law protection mechanism, having in mind the causal link that should be detected, between the protection of the financial interests of the EU, with the non-respect of the EU values enshrined in the Article 2 TEU, by particular Member State(s). Consequently, we will try to envisage the impact of the implementation of this conditionality mechanism, taking into consideration which Member States, and EU citizens, would be ""hit"" hardest by it. In the second part of the paper an attempt shall be made to perceive the conditionality mechanism, tied to the recovery fund, from the perspective of the principle of solidarity. Ultimately, this paper will try to answer the following question: in view of the necessary shift of priorities and the need for urgent reaction to the COVID-19 crisis, is the common European answer, in view of the core values of the EU and the principle of solidarity, optimal, and above all, will it be effective?","Radović, Maja Lukić PhD Vlajković Marija PhD",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,,434

315787,Simultaneous Regional Election Polemics In The Middle Of The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Autoimmunity accounts for 90% of cases of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, AD). Affected persons present a significant co-occurrence of autoimmune conditions, hence, clustering of autoimmunity is also predicted among their relatives. AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate the burden of autoimmunity in families of people with AD. METHODS: 116 individuals with AD were surveyed about the occurrence of 23 autoimmune diseases among their relatives. RESULTS: 74.1% of persons with AD reported at least one relative with an autoimmune disorder - 257 cases were diagnosed in 221 relatives. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was found in 100 individuals, followed by Graves' disease and vitiligo - in 25 and 24 relatives, respectively. Type 1 diabetes was diagnosed in 23 relatives, psoriasis in 15, rheumatoid arthritis in 12, pernicious anaemia in 11, multiple sclerosis in 8, while premature menopause in 8 women. AD was found in 7 relatives, alopecia in 6, and celiac disease in 5. Other conditions were rare. Significant correlation was noticed between the number of autoimmune conditions in AD proband and the number of affected relatives (p = 0.031). 66.4% of people with AD had a first-degree relative suffering from autoimmunity. Autoimmune conditions were more frequent among females: sisters (p < 0.001), mothers (p = 0.002) and grandmothers (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Considerable prevalence of autoimmune conditions in relatives of persons with AD confirms substantial risk of autoimmunity, especially in females and relatives of patients affected by multiplex autoimmunity. Our data corroborate the recommendation of active screening for autoimmune disorders, particularly thyroid disease, among AD family members. This article is protected by copyright.

A comparison between the United Kingdom and India.' a commentary on ""the socio-economic implications of the coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic: A review""",2020,"The structurally unique ""fleximer"" nucleosides were originally designed to investigate how flexibility in a nucleobase could potentially affect receptor-ligand recognition and function. Recently they have been shown to have low-to-sub-micromolar levels of activity against a number of viruses, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, and flaviviruses. However, the synthesis of distal fleximers in particular has thus far been quite tedious and low yielding. As a potential solution to this issue, a series of proximal fleximer bases (flex-bases) has been successfully coupled to both ribose and 2'-deoxyribose sugars by using the N-deoxyribosyltransferaseâ II of Lactobacillus leichmannii (LlNDT) and Escherichia coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). To explore the range of this facile approach, transglycosylation experiments on a thieno-expanded tricyclic heterocyclic base, as well as several distal and proximal flex-bases were performed to determine whether the corresponding fleximer nucleosides could be obtained in this fashion, thus potentially significantly shortening the route to these biologically significant compounds. The results of those studies are reported herein.","Vichier-Guerre, Sophie; Ku, Therese C; Pochet, Sylvie; Seley-Radtke, Katherine L",Chembiochem,,434

317285,Expanding Hospital Capacity during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Family Voice Matters,2021,"This paper explores the influence of crisis-related information on customers’ recommendations and purchase intentions. Various studies have investigated the role of risk-related information in terms of its certainty and immediacy. This research introduces a model that differentiates and investigates different types of information provided by organizations through social network sites (SNSs) that are related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, including situational information and precautionary measures information specifically. The proposed model targeted users of SNSs in Saudi Arabia, where around 72.38% of its population is considered active SNSs users with 3 h of average daily time spent on SNSs. Based on the survey data collected from 356 online shoppers in Saudi Arabia, structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to test the proposed model. The reliability of instrument was tested using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), where the results showed acceptable model fit indices (X2/df = 2.6, GFI = 0.93, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.93, and RMSEA = 0.067). Based on that, the structural model was built and tested, which also showed acceptable fit indices (X2/df = 2.9, GFI = 0.92, CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91, and RMSEA = 0.073). The findings highlight that situational and adopted precautionary measures information had a significant impact on recommendations (γ=0.73) and purchase intentions (γ=0.39). Further, organizations that hold themselves accountable for broadcasting updated information related to the crisis and disseminating the necessary preventive measures develop a high level of recommendations and purchase intentions among customers. A personal recommendation construct was confirmed as a partial mediator, where an indirect significant influence was found of broadcasting information on purchase intention through personal recommendation (γ=0.309). Therefore, this paper suggests that organizations should consider offering customers all the necessary types of information related to the COVID-19 crisis.","Alhubaishy, Abdulaziz Aljuhani Abdulmajeed",Journal of Theoretical and Applied Electronic Commerce Research,,434

This study aimed to describe the features and outcomes of pregnant women with or without SARS-CoV-2 infection after the universal screening was established in a large tertiary care center admitting only obstetric related conditions without severe COVID-19 in Mexico City. This retrospective case-control study integrates data between April 22 and May 25, 2020, during active community transmission in Mexico, with one of the highest COVID-19 test positivity percentages worldwide. Only pregnant women and neonates with a SARS-CoV-2 result by quantitative RT-PCR were included in this study. Among 240 pregnant women, the prevalence of COVID-19 was 29% (95% CI, 24% to 35%); 86% of the patients were asymptomatic (95% CI, 76%-92%), nine women presented mild symptoms, and one patient moderate disease. No pregnancy baseline features or risk factors associated with severity of infection, including maternal age > 35 years, Body Mass Index >30 kg/m2, and pre-existing diseases, differed between positive and negative women. The median gestational age at admission for both groups was 38 weeks. All women were discharged at home without complications, and no maternal death was reported. The proportion of preeclampsia was higher in positive women than negative women (18%, 95% CI, 10%-29% vs. 9%, 95% CI, 5%-14%, P<0.05). No differences were found for other perinatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 test result was positive for nine infants of positive mothers detected within 24h of birth. An increased number of infected neonates were admitted to the NICU, compared to negative neonates (44% vs. 22%, P<0.05) and had a longer length of hospitalization (2 [2-18] days vs. 2 [2-3] days, P<0.001); these are potential proxies for illness severity.

This study aimed to examine the correlation between fear of COVID-19, stress with COVID-19, and technological stress in university students, and their resilience, self-esteem, and coping strategies. The final sample comprised 180 Spanish university students, with an average age of 20.76 years (SD = 4.59). The above-mentioned effects were administered a series of self-report scales. We found statistically significant associations between fear of COVID-19 and stress with COVID-19, technological stress (total score), overload, and complexity (subdimensions of technological stress). Likewise, we found inverse relationships between the students’ fear of COVID-19 and the use of the coping strategy, cognitive restructuring. Ascertaining the factors that influence the coping strategies of undergraduate university students and their fears, psychological stress, and resilience provides valuable information for the development of educational interventions. This research has relevant implications for the diagnosis, orientation, and design of psycho-educational and clinical interventions that can improve students’ well-being and training for effective coping strategies for daily stress and this pandemic situation.","Morales-Rodríguez, Francisco Manuel",Sustainability,,434

We report a case series of five clinically and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients from Bangladesh who suffered a second episode of COVID-19 illness after 70 symptom-free days. The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), is a leading public health research institution in South Asia. icddr, b staff were actively tested, treated and followed-up for COVID-19 by an experienced team of clinicians, epidemiologists, and virologists. From 21 March to 30 September 2020, 1370 icddr,b employees working at either the Dhaka (urban) or Matlab (rural) clinical sites were tested for COVID-19. In total, 522 (38%) were positive; 38% from urban Dhaka (483/1261) and 36% from the rural clinical site Matlab (39/109). Five patients (60% male with a mean age of 41 years) had real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) diagnosed recurrence (reinfection) of SARS-CoV-2. All had mild symptoms except for one who was hospitalized. Though all cases reported fair risk perceptions towards COVID-19, all had potential exposure sources for reinfection. After a second course of treatment and home isolation, all patients fully recovered. Our findings suggest the need for COVID-19 vaccination and continuing other preventive measures to further mitigate the pandemic. An optimal post-recovery follow-up strategy to allow the safe return of COVID-19 patients to the workforce may be considered.","Das, Pritimoy; Satter, Syed M; Ross, Allen G; Abdullah, Zarin; Nazneen, Arifa; Sultana, Rebeca; Rimi, Nadia Ali; Chowdhury, Kamal; Alam, Rashedul; Parveen, Shahana; Rahman, Md Mahfuzur; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Rahman, Mohammed Ziaur; Mazumder, Razib; Abdullah, Ahmed; Rahman, Mahmudur; Banu, Sayera; Ahmed, Tahmeed; Clemens, John D; Rahman, Mustafizur",,,434

We aim to report outcomes for children with LD and LT enrolled in the NASPGHAN/SPLIT SARS-CoV2 registry. METHODS: In this multicenter observational cohort study, we collected data from 91 patients <21âyears (LD 44, LT 47) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection between April 21 and September 17, 2020. RESULTS: Patients with LD were more likely to require admission (70% vs 43% LT, Pâ=â0.007) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) management (32% vs 4% LT, Pâ=â0.001). Seven LD patients required mechanical ventilation (MV) and 2 patients died; no patients in the LT cohort died or required MV. Four LD patients presented in pediatric acute liver failure (PALF), 2 with concurrent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); all recovered without LT. Two LD patients had MIS-C alone and 1 patient died. Bivariable logistic-regression analysis found that patients with nonalcoholic fatty LD (NAFLD) (odds ratio [OR] 5.6, Pâ=â0.02) and LD (OR 6.1, Pâ=â0.01, vs LT) had higher odds of severe disease (PICU, vasopressor support, MV, renal replacement therapy or death). CONCLUSIONS: Although not directly comparable, LT recipients had lower odds of severe SARS-CoV2 infection (vs LD), despite immunosuppression burden. NAFLD patients reported to the registry had higher odds of severe SARS-CoV2 disease. Future controlled studies are needed to evaluate effective treatments and further stratify LD and LT patients with SARS-CoV2 infection.","Kehar, Mohit; Ebel, Noelle H; Ng, Vicky L; Baquero, Jairo Eduardo Rivera; Leung, Daniel H; Slowik, Voytek; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Shah, Amit A; Arnon, Ronen; Miloh, Tamir; Gupta, Nitika; Mohammad, Saeed; Kogan-Liberman, Debora; Squires, James E; Sanchez, Maria Camila; Hildreth, Amber; Book, Linda; Chu, Christopher; Alrabadi, Leina; Azzam, Ruba; Chepuri, Bhavika; Elisofon, Scott; Falik, Rachel; Gallagher, Lisa; Kader, Howard; Mogul, Douglas; Mujawar, Quais; Namjoshi, Shweta S; Valentino, Pamela L; Vitola, Bernadette; Waheed, Nadia; Zheng, Ming-Hua; Lobritto, Steven; Martinez, Mercedes",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,,434

320965,Attractiveness of Cities during Social Isolation: Views of Residents of the Silesian Voivodeship (Poland),2020,"INTRODUCTION: Rapid technology development due to the introduction of Industrial Revolution 4.0 and Internet of Things has created a demand and gradual transition from traditional teaching and learning to technology-based learning in higher education, including healthcare education. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process, with educators now required to quickly adapt to and adopt such changes. The abundance of available systematic reviews has made the effectiveness of such approaches ambiguous especially in healthcare education. Therefore, a protocol of the overview of systematic reviews (OoSR) is planned to extrapolate the effectiveness of technology-based learning in undergraduate healthcare education. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Scopus, CINAHL, Academic Search Complete, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection databases were selected. Screening was conducted independently by at least two authors and the decision for inclusion was done through discussion or involvement of an arbiter against a predetermined criteria. Included articles will be evaluated for quality using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews and Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tools, while primary systematic review articles will be cross-checked and reported for any overlapping using the 'corrected covered area' method. Only narrative synthesis will be employed according to the predefined themes into two major dimensions-theory and knowledge generation (focusing on cognitive taxonomy due to its ability to be generalised across disciplines), and clinical-based competence (focusing on psychomotor and affective taxonomies due to discipline-specific influence). The type of technology used will be identified and extracted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The OoSR involves analysis of secondary data from published literature, thus ethical approval is not required. The findings will provide a valuable insight for policymakers, stakeholders, and researchers in terms of technology-based learning implementation and gaps identification. The findings will be published in several reports due to the extensiveness of the topic and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conferences.

322502,Offshore Royalty Relief: Status During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS: Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly. Iran has made many efforts to defeat the outbreak, but more coherent, timely and efficient action is required, now, more than ever, to save lives and slow the spread of this pandemic.","Raoofi, Azam; Takian, Amirhossein; Akbari Sari, Ali; Olyaeemanesh, Alireza; Haghighi, Hajar; Aarabi, Mohsen",Arch Iran Med,,434

In addition, these sectors were less affected by the labor availability and health issues from COVID‐19 (coronavirus disease‐2019) that plagued others, such as red meat processors. While the overall impacts were less than most other parts of the agri‐food system, some elements of supply managed products, particularly poultry processors, have experienced a reduction in returns and are still adjusting to the new demand and supply situation. The extent of the impact is correlated with the degree to which the supply chain further upstream was connected to the downstream hospitality sector.

En outre, ces secteurs ont été moins touchés par la disponibilité de la main‐d'oeuvre et les problèmes de santé liés à la COVID‐19 comparativement à d'autres, comme les transformateurs de viande rouge. Bien que les impacts globaux aient été inférieurs à ceux de la plupart des autres éléments du système agroalimentaire, certains secteurs sous gestion de l'offre, en particulier les transformateurs de volaille, ont connu une réduction des rendements et s'adaptent toujours à la nouvelle situation de l'offre et de la demande.

METHODS: Prospective, multicenter, observational study of critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and acute respiratory failure admitted from 63 ICUs in Spain. The objective was to utilize an unsupervised clustering analysis to derive clinical COVID-19 phenotypes and to analyze patient's factors associated with mortality risk. Patient features including demographics and clinical data at ICU admission were analyzed. Generalized linear models were used to determine ICU morality risk factors. The prognostic models were validated and their performance was measured using accuracy test, sensitivity, specificity and ROC curves. RESULTS: The database included a total of 2022 patients (mean age 64 [IQR 5-71] years, 1423 (70.4%) male, median APACHE II score (13 [IQR 10-17]) and SOFA score (5 [IQR 3-7]) points. The ICU mortality rate was 32.6%. Of the 3 derived phenotypes, the A (mild) phenotype (537; 26.7%) included older age (< 65 years), fewer abnormal laboratory values and less development of complications, B (moderate) phenotype (623, 30.8%) had similar characteristics of A phenotype but were more likely to present shock. The C (severe) phenotype was the most common (857; 42.5%) and was characterized by the interplay of older age (> 65 years), high severity of illness and a higher likelihood of development shock. Crude ICU mortality was 20.3%, 25% and 45.4% for A, B and C phenotype respectively. The ICU mortality risk factors and model performance differed between whole population and phenotype classifications. CONCLUSION: The presented machine learning model identified three clinical phenotypes that significantly correlated with host-response patterns and ICU mortality. Different risk factors across the whole population and clinical phenotypes were observed which may limit the application of a ""one-size-fits-all"" model in practice.","Rodríguez, Alejandro; Ruiz-Botella, Manuel; Martín-Loeches, Ignacio; Jimenez Herrera, María; Solé-Violan, Jordi; Gómez, Josep; Bodí, María; Trefler, Sandra; Papiol, Elisabeth; Díaz, Emili; Suberviola, Borja; Vallverdu, Montserrat; Mayor-Vázquez, Eric; Albaya Moreno, Antonio; Canabal Berlanga, Alfonso; Sánchez, Miguel; Del Valle Ortíz, María; Ballesteros, Juan Carlos; Martín Iglesias, Lorena; Marín-Corral, Judith; López Ramos, Esther; Hidalgo Valverde, Virginia; Vidaur Tello, Loreto Vidaur; Sancho Chinesta, Susana; Gonzáles de Molina, Francisco Javier; Herrero García, Sandra; Sena Pérez, Carmen Carolina; Pozo Laderas, Juan Carlos; Rodríguez García, Raquel; Estella, Angel; Ferrer, Ricard",Crit Care,,434

In this work, the B.1+L249S+E484K lineage was isolated along with A.1, B.1.420 and B.1.111 SARS-CoV-2 lineages without the E484K mutation and the neutralizing titer of convalescent sera was compared using microneutralization assays. While no significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers were found between A1 and B lineages without the E484K mutation, the neutralizing titers against B.1+L249S+E484K were 1.5, 1.9, 2.1, and 1.3-fold lower than against A.1, B.1.420, B.1.111-I, and B.1.111-II, respectively. However, molecular epidemiological data indicate that there is no increase in the transmissibility rate associated with this new lineage. Hence, although the evidence provided in this study support a Variant of Interest Status (VOI) for the B1+L249S+E484K lineage, enhanced laboratory characterization of this particular lineage and other emerging lineages with the E484K mutation should be carried out in individuals with immunity acquired by natural infection and vaccination. This study accentuated the capability of new variants with the E484K mutation to be resistant to neutralization by humoral immunity, and therefore the need to intensify surveillance programs. HIGHLIGHT The E484K mutation in B.1+L249S+E484K appears not to affect the viral titer Sensitivity of lineages without E484K mutation to neutralizing antibodies did not change B.1+L249S+E484K lineage shows a reduction in its neutralizing capacity","Diaz, Diego Alejandro Alvarez; Donato, Katherine Laiton; Garcia, Orlando Alfredo Torres; Moreno, Hector Alejandro Ruiz; Munoz, Carlos E Franco; Beltran, Maria Angie; Reyes, Marcela Mercado; Rueda, Miguel G; Ramirez, Ana Luisa Munoz",,,434
324011,"In Reply to ""Letter to the Editor Regarding Neurosurgery Services in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experience from a Developing Country""",2021,"In the past decade, multiple compounding crises-ecological, racial injustices, 'care crises' and multiple recent crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic-have reinforced the powerful role of critical and social policy researchers to push back against 'fake news', alternative facts', and a post-truth era that denigrates science and evidence-based research. These new realities can pose challenges for social scientists who work within relational, ontological, non-representational, new materialist, performative, decolonising, or ecological 'turns' in social theory and epistemologies. This article's overarching question is: How does one work within non-representational research paradigms while also attempting to hold onto representational, authoritative and convincing versions of truth, evidence, facts and data? Informed by my research on feminist philosopher and epistemologist Lorraine Code's 40-year trajectory of writing about knowledge making and ecological social imaginaries, I navigate these dilemmas by calling on an unexpected ally to family sociology and family policy: The late American environmentalist Rachel Carson. Extending Code's case study of Carson, I argue for an approach that combines (1) ecological relational ontologies, (2) the ethics and politics of knowledge making, (3) crossing social imaginaries of knowledge making and (4) a reconfigured view of knowledge makers as working towards just and cohabitable worlds. © Policy Press 2021.","Doucet, A.","Families, Relationships and Societies",,434

However, the two pandemics have their intrinsic characteristics that distinguish them considerably; for example, the virulence of the infectious agents and the availability of treatment and vaccine. Consequently, given this knowledge gap between the pH1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, we conducted this review to clarify and summarize, above all, the epidemiological historical aspects of these two viruses of great importance to global public health.","da Costa, Vivaldo Gomes; Saivish, Marielena Vogel; Santos, Dhullya Eduarda Resende; de Lima Silva, Rebeca Francielle; Moreli, Marcos Lázaro",J Infect Public Health,,434

In addition, characteristics of drug-drug interaction (DDI)-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in COVID-19 patients have not yet been studied in depth. The aim of the present case-series study is to describe clinical and pharmacological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients, focusing on ADRs, particularly those related to DDIs. We evaluated all reports of COVID-19 medication-related ADRs collected within the COVID-19 Units of Careggi University Hospital, Florence (Italy), between January 1st and 31st May 2020. Information regarding COVID-19 medications, patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, concomitant drugs, ADRs description and outcome, were collected. Each case was evaluated for the causality assessment and to identify the presence of DDIs. During the study period, 23 Caucasian patients (56.5% males, mean age 76.1 years) experienced one or more ADRs. The majority of them were exposed to polypharmacy and 17.4% presented comorbidities. ADRs were referred to cardiovascular, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders. The most frequently reported preferred term was QT prolongation (mean QT interval 496.1 ms). ADRs improved or resolved completely in 60.8% of cases. For all patients, a case-by-case evaluation revealed the presence of one or more DDIs, especially those related to pharmacokinetic interactions. Despite the small number of patients, our evidence underline the clinical burden of DDIs in SARS-CoV-2 hospitalised patients and the risk of unexpected and uncommon psychiatric ADRs.","Crescioli, Giada; Brilli, Valentina; Lanzi, Cecilia; Burgalassi, Andrea; Ieri, Alessandra; Bonaiuti, Roberto; Romano, Elias; Innocenti, Rinaldo; Mannaioni, Guido; Vannacci, Alfredo; Lombardi, Niccolò",Intern. emerg. med,,434

In group A, patients underwent surgery anesthesia with dexmedetomidine combined with sufentanil. In group B, patients underwent surgery anesthesia only with sufentanil. The anesthesia induced intubation, operation time and incidence of postoperative adverse reaction of patients were compared between the two groups. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were observed and recorded before induction, before intubation and after intubation. Blood coagulation analyzer was used to detect four items of coagulation before and after operation. FACSCalibur flow cytometry was used to detect T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of patients in the two groups. The pain scores (VAS) of patients in the two groups were measured and recorded after surgery at 4, 24 and 48 h. There was a difference in anesthesia induced intubation and operation time of patients in both groups (P<0.05). There were differences in HR, SBP and DBP of patients in both groups after intubation (P<0.05), in postoperative coagulation function (P<0.05), and in postoperative immune function of patients in both groups (P<0.05).

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in association with aspirin represents the main treatment for KD. However, 10-20% of patients fail to respond to standard treatment and have an increased risk of cardiac complications. There is currently no accepted protocol for treatment of resistant cases. Several authors highlighted the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) as a mediator of inflammation in KD and suggested the possibility of using IL-1 or its receptor as a target of therapy. The use of IL-1 inhibitors in patients with KD has been reported in the scientific literature, but data are largely limited to individual case reports and small case series. We summarized the scientific literature related to the use of anakinra, analyzing preclinical and clinical data. Thirty-eight patients have been described so far, most of them with KD-related complications. Twenty-two were described in case reports and case series, while 16 were patients from the completed KAWAKINRA phase IIa study. Almost all patients received clinical benefit, and no relevant side effects were noted. Based on this evidence, in our opinion, anakinra may be considered as an option after the failure of the first IVIG infusion, especially in patients with coronary involvement.","Ferrara, Giovanna; Giani, Teresa; Caparello, Maria Costanza; Farella, Carla; Gamalero, Lisa; Cimaz, Rolando",,,434

Also, the pandemic accelerated diffusion of technological innovations like teleconsultation among healthcare workers and patients. The present case study is about a young, breast cancer, female patient from rural India who was diagnosed with the disease just before the pandemic times. She was put on neo-adjuvent chemotherapy in a tertiary care hospital about 150 kms away from her native place but meanwhile lockdown was imposed in India to control COVID-19 spread. She was maintained on follow up through teleconsultation services. She was facilitated through travel restrictions for chemotherapy cycles by e-pass. Her concerns regarding disease, treatment options, follow ups, effect of treatment on her fertility and adverse effects of chemotherapy during her treatment course were satisfactorily addressed through teleconsultation. Necessary investigations done nearby were sent digitally to treating doctor that minimized her visits. After completion of chemotherapy she underwent breast conservation surgery.","Kumar, J.; Singh, T.; Singh, A.",Indian Journal of Community Health,,434
325453,"Why were the UK and USA unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic? The systemic weaknesses of neoliberalism: a comparison between the UK, USA, Germany, and South Korea",2020,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, to angiotensin-(1-7) and is also a membrane protein that enables coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infectivity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation of ACE2 enhances ACE2 stability. This mode of posttranslational modification of ACE2 in vascular endothelial cells is causative of a pulmonary hypertension (PH)-protective phenotype. The oncoprotein MDM2 (murine double minute 2) is an E3 ligase that ubiquitinates its substrates to cause their degradation. In this study, we investigated whether MDM2 is involved in the posttranslational modification of ACE2 through its ubiquitination of ACE2, and whether an AMPK and MDM2 crosstalk regulates the pathogenesis of PH. METHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were used to explore E3 ligase that ubiquitinates ACE2. Cultured endothelial cells, mouse models, and specimens from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension were used to investigate the crosstalk between AMPK and MDM2 in regulating ACE2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in the context of PH. RESULTS: Levels of MDM2 were increased and those of ACE2 decreased in lung tissues or pulmonary arterial endothelial cells from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and rodent models of experimental PH. MDM2 inhibition by JNJ-165 reversed the SU5416/hypoxia-induced PH in C57BL/6 mice. ACE2-S680L mice (dephosphorylation at S680) showed PH susceptibility, and ectopic expression of ACE2-S680L/K788R (deubiquitination at K788) reduced experimental PH. Moreover, ACE2-K788R overexpression in mice with endothelial cell-specific AMPK&#945;2 knockout mitigated PH. CONCLUSIONS: Maladapted posttranslational modification (phosphorylation and ubiquitination) of ACE2 at Ser-680 and Lys-788 is involved in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension and experimental PH. Thus, a combined intervention of AMPK and MDM2 in the pulmonary endothelium might be therapeutically effective in PH treatment.","Shen, Hui; Zhang, Jiao; Wang, Chen; Jain, Pritesh P; Xiong, Mingmei; Shi, Xinxing; Lei, Yuyang; Chen, Shanshan; Yin, Qian; Thistlethwaite, Patricia A; Wang, Jian; Gong, Kaizheng; Yuan, Zu-Yi; Yuan, Jason X-J; Shyy, John Y-J",Circulation,,434

Hyperinflammation triggers a hypercoagulable state, also thought to play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Disease severity is linked to age, sex and comorbid conditions, which in turn may be linked to oxidative stress and pre-existing depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). There is increasing evidence that the host genome may determine disease outcome. Since most information pertaining to COVID-19 has thus far been extrapolated from the 'global North', similar studies in African populations are warranted.

In our study, a new view of the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus has been presented in terms of the relationship between peak day and peak period and population density of nine countries. Data for nine different countries in different coronavirus situations have been analyzed. The analysis process was applied by using three programs, namely; WebPlotDigitizer, WSxM and Origin. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of social distancing by calculation of the effect of population density on coronavirus infection. That was applied by two stages, the first one by determination of two different groups of countries depending on the rate and range of coronavirus spread. These two groups were countries with developed and developing COVID19 which lead to calculate the peak day and the period times of developed groups. Then, analysis of that data with population density was evaluated to indicate there are significant effects of population density on peak day and peak period times which explain the importance of social distancing between people to manage and control that. The results showed that there are increasing in peak day and peak period times with increasing the population density.Récemment, de nombreux pays ont décidé de rouvrir progressivement et certains d'entre eux ont estimé que la distanciation sociale n'avait pas eu d'effet significatif.

This review details the latest evidence on the neuropathogenesis and neurologic complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Commonly reported neurologic complications include toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular disorders, seizures, and anoxic-brain injury. These complications represent secondary injury due to COVID-19 related hypoxia, sepsis, hypercoagulability, or hyperinflammation. Postinfectious complications, such as encephalitis, postinfectious demyelination, and Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported, but are rare. Recent reports of persistent neurocognitive symptoms highlight the possibility of lasting impairment. SUMMARY: Although some neurologic complications should be treated with standard practices, further investigations are still needed to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-related neurologic complications, such as ischemic stroke. Entering into the next phase of the pandemic, investigations into the long-term neurologic and cognitive impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be needed. Clinicians must have a high clinical suspicion for both acute and chronic neurologic complications among COVID-19 patients.","Hassett, Catherine E; Frontera, Jennifer A",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,434

Each HIV-pos was matched with 5 HIV-neg of the same age and sex randomly selected from COVID-19@Spain, a multicenter cohort of 4,035 patients hospitalized with PCR confirmed COVID-19 in Spain (Clin Microbiol Infect 2020;26:1525-36). Data were collected with the ISARIC-WHO Core case report form (https://isaric.org/document/COVID-19-crf/). The COVID-19 SEIMC score (predictive of 30-day mortality), based on age, sex, dyspnea, O2 saturation, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, was calculated at admission in all patients (ESCMID Conference on Coronavirus Disease, 2020, Abstract#00513). Outcomes included the need for mechanical ventilation and all-cause in-hospital mortality. Results: Forty-five patients with PCR confirmed COVID-19 were identified in CoRIS, 21 of which were hospitalized. A total of 105 age/sex-matched controls were selected from COVID-19@Spain. The median age in both groups was 53 (Q1-Q3, 46-56) years, and 90.5% were men.

Drug repurposing offers an innovative approach in this context. We report here new findings on the in silico potential of several antimalarial drugs for repurposing against COVID-19. We conducted analyses by docking the compounds against two SARS-CoV-2-specific targets: (1) the receptor binding domain spike protein and (2) the main protease of the virus (MPro) using the Schrödinger software. Importantly, the docking analysis revealed that doxycycline (DOX) showed the most effective binding to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, whereas halofantrine and mefloquine bound effectively with the main protease among the antimalarial drugs evaluated in the present study. The in silico approach reported here suggested that DOX could potentially be a good candidate for repurposing for COVID-19. In contrast, to decipher the actual potential of DOX and halofantrine against COVID-19, further in vitro and in vivo studies are called for. Drug repurposing warrants consideration as a viable research and innovation avenue as planetary health efforts to fight the COVID-19 continue.","Sachdeva, Cheryl; Wadhwa, Anju; Kumari, Anita; Hussain, Firasat; Jha, Preeti; Kaushik, Naveen K",OMICS,,434
330656,Content analysis of Persian/Farsi Tweets during COVID-19 pandemic in Iran using NLP,2020-05-17,"INTRODUCTION: Transmission of COVID-19 through close contact and droplets is well established, but the influence of aerosol and surface contamination remains to be determined. Literature is scarce and inconsistent about the viable virus particles free-distance from infected patients, as well as about different swabbing methods for surface contamination evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most sensitive method for the assessment of surface contamination, classify the likelihood of environmental contamination in risk zones and compare the environmental contamination between oxygenation and ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from potentially contaminated surfaces in a COVID-19 ward, with patients treated with different types of oxygen and ventilatory support, were collected. Three types of swabs were compared in order to evaluate the most sensitive collection method. For risk zone categorization, areas were divided according to the distance from the patient. RESULTS: Of the 63 swabs collected, 17 (27%) tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The highest positivity rate was observed with the sterile premoistened swab with saline (n = 8; 38%), but without statistically significant differences. The highest number of positive samples were collected from the high-risk zones, specifically those located one meter from the patient (n = 13; 48%), with statistically significant differences. Only the rooms of patients supported with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula had evidence of bedroom contamination, with 45% and 27% of swab positivity, with statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION: Our findings favour the premoistened swab without transport medium for surface contamination assessment, even though without statistical differences. A statistically significant trend supporting the division in risk zones, according to the distance from the patient, was also identified. The higher positivity rate from the non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula bedrooms suggests a significant association between ventilatory strategies and surface contamination, probably due to higher particle dispersion. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of the sterile premoistened swab without preservation medium, the classification of risk areas considering the distance from the patient, and the variability of RNA dispersion between oxygenation and ventilatory support.","Mendes, Marta; Andrade Oliveira, Ana; Pires, Olga; Branca, Fernando; Beirão, Maria; Santa-Cruz, André; Carvalho, Alexandre; Alves, Joana",Acta med. port,,434

331732,Using decision aids to support self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has become a global pandemic with a dramatic impact on healthcare systems. Concern for viral transmission necessitates the investigation of otologic procedures that use high-speed drilling instruments, including mastoidectomy, which we hypothesized to be an aerosol-generating procedure. METHODS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill was simulated using fresh-frozen cadaveric heads with fluorescein solution injected into the mastoid air cells. Specimens were drilled for 1-minute durations in test conditions with and without a microscope. A barrier drape was fashioned from a commercially available drape (the OtoTent). Dispersed particulate matter was quantified in segments of an octagonal test grid measuring 60âcm in radius. RESULTS: Drilling without a microscope dispersed fluorescent particles 360 degrees, with the areas of highest density in quadrants near the surgeon and close to the surgical site. Using a microscope or varying irrigation rates did not significantly reduce particle density or percent surface area with particulate. Using the OtoTent significantly reduced particle density and percent surface area with particulate across the segments of the test grid beyond 30âcm (which marked the boundary of the OtoTent) compared with the microscope only and no microscope test conditions (Kruskall-Wallis test, pâ=â0.0066). CONCLUSIONS: Mastoidectomy with a high-speed drill is an aerosol-generating procedure, a designation that connotes the potential high risk of viral transmission and need for higher levels of personal protective equipment. A simple barrier drape significantly reduced particulate dispersion in this study and could be an effective mitigation strategy in addition to appropriate personal protective equipment.","Chen, Jenny X; Workman, Alan D; Chari, Divya A; Jung, David H; Kozin, Elliott D; Lee, Daniel J; Welling, D Bradley; Bleier, Benjamin S; Quesnel, Alicia M",Otol Neurotol,,434

332766,COVID-19 Reveals Why We Need Physician Advocates Now,2020,"Many viruses disrupt host gene expression by degrading host mRNAs and/or manipulating translation activities to create a cellular environment favorable for viral replication. Often, virus-induced suppression of host gene expression, including those involved in antiviral responses, contributes to viral pathogenicity. Accordingly, clarifying the mechanisms of virus-induced disruption of host gene expression is important for understanding virus-host cell interactions and virus pathogenesis. Three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have emerged in the past two decades. All of them encode nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) in their genomes. Nsp1 of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exhibit common biological functions for inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs and inhibition of host translation, while viral mRNAs evade the nsp1-induced mRNA cleavage. SARS-CoV nsp1 is a major pathogenic determinant for this virus, supporting the notion that a viral protein that suppresses host gene expression can be a virulence factor, and further suggesting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 nsp1, which has high amino acid identity with SARS-CoV nsp1, may serve as a major virulence factor. This review summarizes the gene expression suppression functions of nsp1 of CoVs, with a primary focus on SARS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1.","Nakagawa, Keisuke; Makino, Shinji",,,434

We establish results to determine the corresponding time-dependent joint probability distribution, allowing for general intensity decay functions, general intensity jumps, and general sojourn times. We obtain an exact, full characterization of the time-dependent joint transform of the multivariate population process and its underlying intensity process in terms of a fixed-point representation and corresponding convergence results. We also derive the asymptotic tail behavior of the population process and its underlying intensity process in the setting of heavy-tailed intensity jumps. By exploiting the results we establish, arbitrary joint spatial-temporal moments and other distributional properties can now be readily evaluated using standard transform differentiation and inversion techniques, and we illustrate this in a few examples.","Karim, Raviar; Laeven, Roger J.

Information about the differences between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension is limited. To explore the characteristics and outcomes differences between COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, the medical records and cardiac biomarkers of 414 patients were analyzed. A total of 149 patients had a history of hypertension, while 265 patients did not have hypertension, and the groups were compared based on their clinical characteristics and laboratory findings as well as the hazard risk for composite outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, or death. The results are as follows. On admission, 22.1% of patients in hypertension group had elevated high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TNI > 26 pg/mL), which was higher than the proportion in the nonhypertension group (6.4%). Median NT-proBNP levels in patients with hypertension (141.9 pg/mL) were higher than those in patients without hypertension (77.3 pg/mL). Patients in the hypertension group had a higher risk for in-hospital death [HR: 2.57, 95% CI (1.46~4.51)]. However, the impact of hypertension on the prognosis was not significant after adjusting for age and sex. Multivariate Cox hazard regression confirmed that NT-proBNP levels in the highest tertile (upper 75 % of patients with hypertension) was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death in all COVID-19 patients. Taken together, hypertension per se had a modest impact on the prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In COVID-19 patients with and without hypertension, NT-proBNP may be a better predictor of prognosis than hs-TNI.","Yao, Qi; Ni, Jian; Hu, Tong-Tong; Cai, Zhu-Lan; Zhao, Jin-Hua; Xie, Qing-Wen; Liu, Chen; Wu, Qing-Qing",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,434

To support this case study we construct a new dataset PUBHEALTH of 11.8K claims accompanied by journalist crafted, gold standard explanations (i.e., judgments) to support the fact-check labels for claims. We explore two tasks: veracity prediction and explanation generation. We also define and evaluate, with humans and computationally, three coherence properties of explanation quality.

(Special Issue: COVID-19: conventional therapies, fates, and mechanisms.)",2020,"Background: Amid the rapid global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many governments enforced country-wide lockdowns, likely with severe well-being consequences. The actions by governments triggered a debate on whether the costs of a lockdown, economically and in well-being, surpass the benefits perceived from a lower infection rate. Aim: To use the Gross National Happiness index (GNH), derived from Big Data, to investigate the determinants of happiness before and during the first few months of a lockdown in a country as an extreme case, South Africa (a country with low levels of well-being and stringent lockdown regulations). Next, to estimate (1) the probability of being happy during a pandemic year, before and after the implemented lockdown, relative to the mean happiness levels of the previous year, and (2) to utilise simulations to estimate the probability of being happy if there were no lockdown. Setting: This study considers the effect of government-mandated lockdown on happiness in South Africa. Methods: We use Big Data in the forms of Twitter and Google Trends to derive variables and ordinary least squares and ordered probit estimation methods. Results: What contributes to happiness under lockdown, except for COVID-19 cases, are the factors linked to the implemented regulations themselves. If we compare scenarios pre- and post-lockdown, we report a happiness cost of 9%. The simulations indicate that assuming there were no lockdown in 2020, the relative well-being gain is 3%. Conclusion: If policymakers want to increase happiness levels and the probability of achieving the same happiness levels as in 2019, they should consider factors related to the regulations that can increase happiness levels.","Rossouw, S.; Greyling, T.; Adhikari, T.",South African Journal of Economic and Management Sciences,,434
334562,In the COVID-19 Pandemic Living with a Stoma and Being a Stoma Nurse,2020,"There were excellent reasons to reform intensive animal agriculture prior to COVID-19. Unfortunately, though, intensive animal agriculture has grown rapidly over the last century. All signs indicate that it will continue to grow in the future. This is bad news for billions of animals. It's also bad news for those who want an animal-friendly food system. Because the public isn't very concerned about the plight of animals-or is concerned, but has a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance-animal activists regularly engage in indirect activism. Indirect activism involves arguing that some cause that's indirectly related to the activist's primary agenda provides reasons to act in ways that are congruent with that agenda. In this paper, we consider the two indirect arguments that animal activists advanced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: first, some used COVID-19 to criticize intensive animal agriculture-many of these had US-based audiences as their target;second, and more modestly, some activists used COVID-19 to condemn wet markets specifically. We contend that both arguments had the risk of backfiring: they risked promoting the very systems that are worst for animals. We then assess the moral significance of this risk, concluding that while it may have been permissible to advance these arguments, there were some serious moral considerations against doing so-ones that weren't addressed by flagging animal activists' concern for animals or any other stakeholder in the discussion. In both cases, we think there are plausible precautionary arguments against the strategies that these activists pursued. Additionally, in the case of arguments against wet markets specifically, we contend that the precautionary argument can be supplemented with a side constraint condition that, arguably, activists violated insofar as they were acting in ways that maintain a racist and xenophobic system.","Spiehler, A.; Fischer, B.",Food Ethics,,434

Despite much research in the statistical literature highlighting the potential advantages of adaptive designs over traditional fixed designs, the uptake of such methods in clinical research has been slow. One major reason for this is that different adaptations to trial designs, as well as their advantages and limitations, remain unfamiliar to large parts of the clinical community. The aim of this paper is to clarify where adaptive designs can be used to address specific questions of scientific interest; we introduce the main features of adaptive designs and commonly used terminology, highlighting their utility and pitfalls, and illustrate their use through case studies of adaptive trials ranging from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory Phase III studies.","Burnett, Thomas; Mozgunov, Pavel; Pallmann, Philip; Villar, Sofia S.; Wheeler, Graham M.; University, Thomas Jaki Lancaster; University, Cardiff; Cambridge, University of; London, University College",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12811v1.pdf,434

This global event is also a ""learnable moment"" for medical education-an opportunity to decisively incorporate public health, including public health systems, through the continuum of medical education. Although medical educators have made progress in integrating public health content into medical curricula, ""public health"" is not a phrase that is consistently used in curricular standards, and public health colleagues are not identified as unique and critical partners to improve and protect health. The COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated how a strong public health system is necessary to support the health of patients and populations, as well as the practice of medicine. Partnerships between medical and public health communities, through individual- and population-based interventions, can also more effectively combat more common threats to health, such as chronic diseases, health inequities, and substance abuse.To achieve a more effective medicine-public health relationship in practice, curricula across the continuum of medical education must include explanations of public health systems, the responsibilities of physicians to their local and state governmental public health agencies, and opportunities for collaboration. Medical education should also prepare physicians to advocate for public health policies, programs, and funding in order to improve and protect the health of their patients and communities. Pandemic COVID-19 demonstrates with laser focus that all physicians are part of public health systems and that public health content has a distinct and essential place across the continuum of medical education to prepare physicians to participate in, collaborate with, and advocate for public health systems.","Maeshiro, Rika; Carney, Jan K",Acad Med,,434

This study is aimed at determining the association between psychological factors, including emotional stress, depression, anxiety, and sleep pattern among BMS patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 19 patients with idiopathic BMS were enrolled along with a control group equivalent in age and sex, but without BMS. Questionnaires used were the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Demographic information was also recorded and analyzed. Results: There was a significant correlation among the two groups of BMS and non-BMS patients regarding stress, depression, and sleep disorder. The average severity of the burning score was 8.31 among the patients. Furthermore, a significant correlation was observed among mental disorders and educational level and sex, but not with age. There was also no significant correlation among the severity of the burning score with sex, education, and mental disorder. Conclusion: BMS is significantly associated with psychological symptoms.

It is the best measure to maintain extreme social distancing which has been effective in controlling the infection and saving lives. But they are causing huge loss economically, disrupting social life and causing distress around the world. Reopening too quickly or too boldly without a goal-oriented strategy could mean a second wave of infection as fierce or even worse as the first. The fundamentals of the virus remain the same - one infected person will, without a lockdown pass it onto three others on average. The consequences of lifting the lockdown are unforeseeable and the stakes are high. Due to the different spectrum of severity with same strain of virus and uncertainty of post lockdown era, lifting the lockdown will be a trial and error approach. Nevertheless, at some point the lockdown has to be lifted. The strategic approach would be innumerable testing, investigations, strong contact tracing, isolation and follow-up. In a low-income country like Nepal, this will mean negotiating a tricky balance between terminating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and allowing people to recover their livelihoods before they slip into extreme poverty and anguish.","Rajbhandari, Bibek; Gurung, Minani; Poudel, Lisasha; Shrestha, Archana; Karmacharya, Biraj Man",JNMA J Nepal Med Assoc,,434

We characterised 30-day outcomes and mortality after hospitalisation with COVID-19 among patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, and compared outcomes after hospital admissions among similar patients with seasonal influenza. Design: Multinational network cohort study. Setting: Electronic health records data from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) (NYC, United States [US]), Optum [US], Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) (US), Information System for Research in Primary Care-Hospitalisation Linked Data (SIDIAP-H) (Spain), and claims data from IQVIA Open Claims (US) and Health Insurance and Review Assessment (HIRA) (South Korea). Participants: All patients with prevalent autoimmune diseases, diagnosed and/or hospitalised between January and June 2020 with COVID-19, and similar patients hospitalised with influenza in 2017-2018 were included. Main outcome measures: 30-day complications during hospitalisation and death. Results: We studied 133,589 patients diagnosed and 48,418 hospitalised with COVID-19 with prevalent autoimmune diseases. The majority of participants were female (60.5% to 65.9%) and aged &#8805;50 years. The most prevalent autoimmune conditions were psoriasis (3.5 to 32.5%), rheumatoid arthritis (3.9 to 18.9%), and vasculitis (3.3 to 17.6%). Amongst hospitalised patients, Type 1 diabetes was the most common autoimmune condition (4.8% to 7.5%) in US databases, rheumatoid arthritis in HIRA (18.9%), and psoriasis in SIDIAP-H (26.4%).Compared to 70,660 hospitalised with influenza, those admitted with COVID-19 had more respiratory complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and higher 30-day mortality (2.2% to 4.3% versus 6.3% to 24.6%). Conclusions: Patients with autoimmune diseases had high rates of respiratory complications and 30-day mortality following a hospitalization with COVID-19. Compared to influenza, COVID-19 is a more severe disease, leading to more complications and higher mortality. Future studies should investigate predictors of poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients with autoimmune diseases.

What this study adds: Most people with autoimmune diseases who required hospitalisation for COVID-19 were women, aged 50 years or older, and had substantial previous comorbidities.Patients who were hospitalised with COVID-19 and had prevalent autoimmune diseases had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes as compared to those with prevalent autoimmune diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19.A variable proportion of 6% to 25% across data sources died within one month of hospitalisation with COVID-19 and prevalent autoimmune diseases.For people with autoimmune diseases, COVID-19 hospitalisation was associated with worse outcomes and 30-day mortality compared to admission with influenza in the 2017-2018 season.","Tan, Eng Hooi; Sena, Anthony G; Prats-Uribe, Albert; You, Seng Chan; Ahmed, Waheed-Ul-Rahman; Kostka, Kristin; Reich, Christian; Duvall, Scott L; Lynch, Kristine E; Matheny, Michael E; Duarte-Salles, Talita; Bertolin, Sergio Fernandez; Hripcsak, George; Natarajan, Karthik; Falconer, Thomas; Spotnitz, Matthew; Ostropolets, Anna; Blacketer, Clair; Alshammari, Thamir M; Alghoul, Heba; Alser, Osaid; Lane, Jennifer C E; Dawoud, Dalia M; Shah, Karishma; Yang, Yue; Zhang, Lin; Areia, Carlos; Golozar, Asieh; Relcade, Martina; Casajust, Paula; Jonnagaddala, Jitendra; Subbian, Vignesh; Vizcaya, David; Lai, Lana Yh; Nyberg, Fredrik; Morales, Daniel R; Posada, Jose D; Shah, Nigam H; Gong, Mengchun; Vivekanantham, Arani; Abend, Aaron; Minty, Evan P; Suchard, Marc; Rijnbeek, Peter; Ryan, Patrick B; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel",,,434
337197,Balancing incomplete COVID-19 evidence and local priorities: risk communication and stakeholder engagement strategies for school re-opening,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children accounts for a small proportion of all infections and is usually mild or asymptomatic. There are few studies on the clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, and the causes of the low prevalence in children remain unclear. Herein, we compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection between adults and children. Fifty-two patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were retrospectively analyzed, including 38 adults and 14 children. Their clinical information such as epidemiological exposure history, laboratory indicators, chest computed tomography (CT) performance, and number of SARS-CoV-2 positive days were analyzed and compared. In children, 5 (35.71%) had mild COVID-19 and 9 (64.29%) had common type, while, in adults, 9 (23.68%) cases were mild, and 29 (76.32%) were common COVID-19. Among them, family clustering infection accounted for 50% (7/14) of child cases and 23.68% (9/36) of adult cases. Epidemiological exposure history, clinical classification, clinical symptoms, chest CT manifestations, and number of SARS-CoV-2-positive days were not significantly different between children and adults. However, the percentage of neutrophils in adults was significantly higher than that in children (P < 0.05). The percentage and absolute value of lymphocytes, platelet counts, aspartate aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase in adults were lower than those in children (P < 0.05). Conclusively, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 show the characteristics of family clustering, and the proportion of mild and asymptomatic infections is higher. For families with a history of epidemiological exposure, routine SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing and chest CT examination should be performed in asymptomatic children to determine whether they are infected. Unlike adults, although the reduction of lymphocytes and platelets in children is not common, it is necessary to be alert to the increased risk of liver damage in children.","Li, Xiaoli; Rong, Yan; Zhang, Peiyan; Wang, Junli; Qie, Liping; Rong, Lei; Xu, Jian",Biomed Res Int,,434

337924,The return volatility of crypto currencies during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessing the news effect,2021,"BACKGROUND: While the Covid-19 pandemic was spreading worldwide, the Italian government stated lockdown, with a drastic reorganization in of healthcare systems. The psychological and social effects of the pandemic and to the restrictions of freedom could have had a detrimental impact on people with physical disabilities, for whom well-being depends strongly on their social environment. AIM: Our main aim was to describe the overall impact of the pandemic on mental health, social condition and illness perception among patients with disabilities, to provide early interventions for this particularly vulnerable population. For this purpose, we performed a specific screening protocol to detect the prevalence of any psychological distress. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: Telephonic interview administered to patients and their caregivers attending the Neurorehabilitation unit of the University Hospital of Pisa. POPULATION: 134 patients with physical disability related to neurological disorders, who had their outpatient appointment cancelled, because of the government dispositions, were enrolled. METHODS: A specific questionnaire (COVID19-q) was designed to test patients' psychosocial state, including a section addressed to the caregiver. Moreover, a standardized psychological evaluation, using the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), was also performed. RESULTS: Results show a different impact in our study population compared to the general population on psychological aspect. Patients did not manifest any clinically relevant distress, as assessed with CORE-OM. However, patients with higher disability degree reported a statistically lower outcome in the social function and in the well-being domains and an increase in risk behaviour. Results from COVID19-q show that most of our patients reported none or mild change in their psycho-social habits and perception of illness during lockdown. However, reduction of family cohesion and lack of healthcare support are two important aspects that people with disability had to face with during the pandemic emergency. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: People with physical disabilities surprisingly shown milder effects of the pandemic on their psychological state and good coping skills in facing social isolation, manifesting resilience resources. However, the is a need to give concrete support to healthcare and social care, especially in the management of severe disability. This unexpected and reassuring result may reveal a worrying scenario regarding the social participation and quality of life of people with disabilities: were they already in lockdown?","Dalise, Stefania; Tramonti, Francesco; Armienti, Enrica; Niccolini, Viola; Caniglia Tenaglia, Marta; Chisari, Carmelo",Eur. j. phys. rehabil. med.

337925,The return volatility of crypto currencies during the COVID-19 pandemic: Assessing the news effect,2021,"At the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the XC skiing, biathlon and nordic combined events will be held at altitudes of ~ 1700 m above sea level, possibly in cold environmental conditions and while requiring adjustment to several time zones. However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may lead to sub-optimal preparations. The current commentary provides the following evidence-based recommendations for the Olympic preparations: make sure to have extensive experience of training (&gt; 60 days annually) and competition at or above the altitude of competition (~ 1700 m), to optimize and individualize your strategies for acclimatization and competition. In preparing for the Olympics, 10–14 days at ~ 1700 m seems to optimize performance at this altitude effectively. An alternative strategy involves two–three weeks of training at &gt; 2000 m, followed by 7–10 days of tapering off at ~ 1700 m. During each of the last 3 or 4 days prior to departure, shift your sleeping and eating schedule by 0.5–1 h towards the time zone in Beijing. In addition, we recommend that you arrive in Beijing one day earlier for each hour change in time zone, followed by appropriate timing of exposure to daylight, meals, social contacts, and naps, in combination with a gradual increase in training load. Optimize your own individual procedures for warming-up, as well as for maintaining body temperature during the period between the warm-up and competition, effective treatment of asthma (if necessary) and pacing at ~ 1700 m with cold ambient temperatures. Although we hope that these recommendations will be helpful in preparing for the Beijing Olympics in 2022, there is a clear need for more solid evidence gained through new sophisticated experiments and observational studies.","Sandbakk, Øyvind Solli Guro Strøm Talsnes Rune Kjøsen Holmberg Hans-Christer",Journal of Science in Sport and Exercise,,434

Based on the imprinting theory, this study investigates whether childhood experiences of SARS have an imprinting effect that significantly influences the fear of COVID-19. Furthermore, we propose that this effect is contingent on the applications of AI and big data. We test our framework with a sample of 1871 questionnaires that covered students in universities across all provincial regions in China, and the results suggest that the imprinting of SARS increases the individuals' fear of COVID-19, and this effect is reduced with the applications of AI and big data. Overall, this study provides a novel insight of the fear caused by the childhood experience of the similar health crisis and the unique role of AI and big data applications into fighting against COVID-19.","Yao, Haitang; Liu, Wei; Wu, Chia-Huei; Yuan, Yu-Hsi",Socioecon Plann Sci,,434

The main feature of our model lies in the fact that the disease's transmission rate is a diffusive stochastic process whose trend can be adjusted via costly confinement policies. We provide a complete theoretical analysis, as well as numerical experiments illustrating the structure of the optimal lockdown policy. In all our experiments the latter is characterized by three distinct periods: the epidemic is first let freely evolve, then vigorously tamed, and finally a less stringent containment should be adopted. Moreover, the optimal containment policy is such that the product ''reproduction number x percentage of susceptible'' is kept after a certain date strictly below the critical level of one, although the reproduction number is let oscillate above one in the last more relaxed phase of lockdown.","Federico, Salvatore; Ferrari, Giorgio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10870v1.pdf,434

341096,Changes in employment and relationship satisfaction in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the German family Panel,2020,"Context: Inflammation is a significant factor driving the rise of multiple cases of viral pneumonia, including COVID-19 infection. Peripheral white blood cells (WBCs), the neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR) ratio, and hemoglobin (Hb) are markers of systematic inflammatory reaction and often predict disease severity. Objective: The current study intended to examine the prognostic importance of hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophile count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), NLR, d-NLR [derived NLR = ANC/(WBC-ANC)], absolute platelet count (APC), and PLR, based on complete blood counts (CBCs) for COVID-19 patients. Design: The research team designed a retrospective that was conducted between March 27 and June 5, 2020, after the first COVID-19 case was reported in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India on March 27. Setting: The study took place at Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Medical College in Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. Participants: The study included 364 participants who were all COVID-positive patients who came to the hospital during the study's period, including patients from various age groups and of both genders. Outcome Measures: Using the results of the CBC, the research team measured: (1) Hb in g/dl, (2) ANC, (3) ALC, and (4) APC. The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated from measurements of the levels of the circulating biomarkers, as cells × 103/µl. Result: For participants who were severely symptomatic, the mean age was 57.86 ± 8.92. Males were more likely to experience severe symptoms. Participants' Hb values were significantly different between groups, and TLC, ANC, NLR, d-NLR, and PLR were highest in the severely symptomatic group and lowest in the asymptomatic group. NLR was positively associated with a risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, while Hb was negatively associated with development of pneumonia. Conclusions: Disease severity and age are independent predictors of poor outcomes. The NLR should be used as a routine blood test that can help in the diagnosis of disease severity in COVID-19. NLR is very simple tool that can be used as a fast and low-cost test that is easily available, even in small centers where the facilities for other tests, such as tests of LDH, CRP, and IL-6, and high resolution CT scans aren't available. Thus, NLR can be used as single independent predictor of COVID-19 disease severity.","Kumar Gothwal, Sunil; Singh, V B; Shrivastava, Mayank; Banseria, Ruchita; Goyal, Kanika; Singh, Saranshi; Ali, Haider; Saad Alharbi, Khalid; Singh, Yogendra; Gupta, Gaurav",Altern. ther. health med,,434

METHODS: We searched for patients with primary SS presenting with SARS-CoV-2 infection (defined following and according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control guidelines) among those included in the Big Data Sjögren Registry, an international, multicentre registry of patients diagnosed according to the 2002/2016 classification criteria. RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were included in the study (46 women, mean age at diagnosis of infection of 60 years). According to the number of patients with primary SS evaluated in the Registry (n = 8211), the estimated frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 0.62% (95% CI 0.44, 0.80). All but two presented with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever (82%), cough (57%), dyspnoea (39%), fatigue/myalgias (27%) and diarrhoea (24%), and the most frequent abnormalities included raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (88%), CRP (81%) and D-dimer (82%) values, and lymphopenia (70%). Infection was managed at home in 26 (51%) cases and 25 (49%) required hospitalization (five required admission to ICU, four died). Compared with patients managed at home, those requiring hospitalization had higher odds of having lymphopenia as laboratory abnormality (adjusted OR 21.22, 95% CI 2.39, 524.09). Patients with comorbidities had an older age (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.00, 1.11) and showed a risk for hospital admission six times higher than those without (adjusted OR 6.01, 95% CI 1.72, 23.51) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Baseline comorbidities were a key risk factor for a more complicated COVID-19 in patients with primary SS, with higher rates of hospitalization and poor outcomes in comparison with patients without comorbidities.","Brito-Zerón, Pilar; Melchor, Sheila; Seror, Raphaèle; Priori, Roberta; Solans, Roser; Kostov, Belchin; Baldini, Chiara; Carubbi, Francesco; Callejas, Jose Luis; Guisado-Vasco, Pablo; Hernández-Molina, Gabriela; Pasoto, Sandra G; Valim, Valeria; Sisó-Almirall, Antoni; Mariette, Xavier; Carreira, Patricia; Ramos-Casals, Manuel",Rheumatology (Oxford),,434

Recruitment of older adults, rurality of the program's setting, time constraints, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were the greatest barriers. The collaborative relationship developed with community health care partners was the greatest facilitator. This relationship promoted shared ideas and adjustments in program design to achieve the outcome goals. The lessons learned from process evaluation may benefit future researchers or community health promotion planners with designing community-based programs for older adults in rural areas.

Unforeseen challenges have been noted during administration of usual haematology care in these unusual COVID-19 times. Medical services have been overstretched and frontline health workers have borne the brunt of COVID-19 pandemic. Movement restrictions during lockdown prevented large sections of population from accessing health care, blood banks from holding blood drives, and disrupted delivery of diagnostic hematology services. The disruption in hematology care due to COVID-19 pandemic in India has been disproportionately higher compared to other subspecialities as hematology practice in India remains restricted to major cities. In this review we chronicle the challenges encountered in caring for hematology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in India and put forth recommendations for minimizing their impact on provision of hematology care with special emphasis on hematology practice in lower and middle income countries (LMICs).","Kar, Rakhee; Dolai, Tuphan Kanti; Shekhawat, Prakash Singh; Malhotra, Pankaj; Singh, Avinash; Naithani, Rahul; Mandal, Prakas Kumar; Ganesan, Prasanth; Manivannan, Prabhu; Basu, Debdatta; Srivastava, Alok; Das, Reena; Bhattacharya, Maitreyee; Mahapatra, Manoranjan; Dhawan, Rishi; Jain, Arihant; Bhandary, Chandni; Pati, Hara Prasad; Chatterjee, Tathagata; Tilak, Vijai; Chandra, Sarmila; Shetty, Shrimati Dharampal; Jena, Rabindra Kumar",Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,,434

345360,The COVID-19 Pandemic: A Global Natural Experiment,2020,"Background and aims Women with chronic pelvic pain represent a heterogeneous group, and it is suggested that the existence of sub-groups can explain varying results and inconclusiveness in clinical trials. Some predictors of treatment outcome are suggested, but the evidence is limited. The primary aim of this study was to explore if selected pre-treatment characteristics of the participants in a recently conducted randomized controlled trial were associated with treatment outcome. Methods In this study secondary analysis of data collected in a randomized trial were conducted. The participants were women with chronic pelvic pain randomized to two different physical therapy treatments. Analyses in this study were performed for the whole group as a cohort. The primary outcome measure was change in pain intensity from baseline to 12 months, measured with the numeric rating scale (0-10). The women were asked to rate their mean pelvic pain intensity during the last 7 days. Based on previous research and on available variables from the randomized controlled trial four potential predictive factors were derived from the baseline data and assessed one by one in a linear regression model, adjusted for age and treatment group. The variables with strongest association (p < 0.10) with the primary outcome were further included in a multivariable linear regression model with backward selection, adjusted for age and treatment group. Results Fifty women (mean age 38.1, SD = 12.2) were included in the analysis. For these women the mean change in pain intensity was -1.2 points (95% CI -1.8 to -0.7) from baseline to 12 months. The multivariable regression model showed that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less decrease in pain intensity with a regression coefficient of 1.3 (95% CI 0.3-2.4). Baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after PT treatment with a regression coefficient per SD increase in baseline pain of -0.6 (95% CI -1.1 to -0.1). None of the women with main pain site other places than in the pelvis reported any pain reduction after physical therapy treatment, but due to the small numbers the predictor was not included in the regression analysis. Conclusions We identified that pelvic pain duration of 6 years or more was associated with less pain reduction, and that higher baseline pain intensity was associated with higher pain reduction after physical therapy treatment in this sample of women with chronic pelvic pain. For the variable main pain site other places than the pelvis the results are unsure due to small numbers. Implications Based on our finding of long pain duration as a negative predictor for pain reduction, we emphasize that early intervention is important. Many of the participants in our RCT reported pelvic surgeries or other treatments prior to referral for PT, and we suggest that referral to a non-invasive intervention such as PT should be considered at an earlier stage. In order to tailor interventions to the individual women's needs, thorough baseline assessments, preferably in a multidisciplinary setting, should be performed.","Nygaard, Ane S; Haugstad, Gro K; Wilsgaard, Tom; Øian, Pål; Stedenfeldt, Mona",Scandinavian journal of pain (Online),,434
345545,Managing the risk of shortages and medication errors with curares during the COVID-19 pandemic: a hospital pharmacy experience,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic include pandemic triggered feelings of fear, uncertainty, and anxiety added to the effects of restricting the population's activities in lockdown. AIM: We aimed to study the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on sexual satisfaction of females and males in Egypt and to evaluate possible predictive factors. METHODS: Married men and females in Egypt were invited to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed medical history, socioeconomic status, sexual performance satisfaction before and during the lockdown in addition to validated Arabic questionnaires for depression, sexual function in males and females, and sexual satisfaction (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function-5, Index of Sexual Satisfaction, respectively). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were frequency of depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and sexual satisfaction in males and females during COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 479 females and 217 males completed the questionnaire. Sexual satisfaction was significantly higher before (91.2%, 73.5%) than during lockdown (70.5%, 56.2%) in both males and females, respectively. During lockdown, significantly more males (70.5%) reported being satisfied with their sexual performance than females (56.2%) (P < .001). More than half of the male subjects (68.2%) had no erectile dysfunction while 97.3% females scored &#8804;26.5 on the Female Sexual Function Index scale suggestive of sexual difficulties. Sexual stress was significantly greater in females (70.8%) than males (63.1%). Educational level, occupation, anxiety, and erectile dysfunction were independently associated with sexual stress in males. Being a housewife or unemployed, husband's age >35 years, marriage duration of 5-10 years, anxiety, and female sexual dysfunction were predictors of sexual relation stress in females. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic was associated with lower sexual satisfaction in both genders. Females however suffered more anxiety and depression and thereby greater risk of sexual function difficulties and sexual dissatisfaction. Intervention strategies in order to lessen the suffering of affected individuals particularly after the pandemic are recommended. Omar SS, Dawood W, Eid N, et al.

345627,Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on field instruction and remote teaching alternatives: Results from a survey of instructors,2020,"Background: A terrible pandemic, Covid-19, has captivated scientists to investigate if SARS-CoV-2 virus infects the central nervous system (CNS). A crucial question is if acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the main cause of death in this pandemic, and often refractory to treatments, can be explained by respiratory center dysfunction. Objective: To discuss that ARDS can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem. Materials and Methods: I reviewed literature about SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms to infect the respiratory center in the brainstem. Results and Conclusions: An increasing amount of reports demonstrates that neurotropism is a common feature of coronavirus, which have been found in the brains of patients and experimental models, where the brainstem was severely infested. Recent studies have provided tremendous indication of the incidence of acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the brainstem. SARS-CoV-2 might infect the CNS through the olfactory bulb, spreading from the olfactory nerves to the rhinencephalon, and finally reaching the brainstem. Hence, the virus infection causes respiratory center dysfunctions, leading to ARDS in COVID-19 patients. I conclude that acute ARDS in Covid-19 can be caused by SARS-CoV-2 invasion of brainstem respiratory center, suggesting the needs of more specific and aggressive treatments, with the direct participation of neurologists and neurointensivists.","Machado, Calixto; DeFina, Phillip A; Chinchilla, Mauricio; Machado, Yanín; Machado, Yazmina",Neurol India,,434

Preparedness plans based on lessons learned from past epidemics can guide behavioral and pharmacological interventions to contain and treat emergent diseases. Although conventional biologics production systems can meet the pharmaceutical needs of a community at homeostasis, the COVID-19 pandemic has created an abrupt rise in demand for vaccines and therapeutics that highlight the gaps in this supply chain's ability to quickly develop and produce biologics in emergency situations given a short lead time. Considering the projected requirements for COVID-19 vaccines and the necessity for expedited large scale manufacture the capabilities of current biologics production systems should be surveyed to determine their applicability to pandemic preparedness. Plant-based biologics production systems have progressed to a state of commercial viability in the past 30 years with the capacity for production of complex, glycosylated, ""mammalian compatible"" molecules in a system with comparatively low production costs, high scalability, and production flexibility. Continued research drives the expansion of plant virus-based tools for harnessing the full production capacity from the plant biomass in transient systems.

Some disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic may cause this deficiency. This paper investigates two integrated OR and PACU scheduling problems;one with few PACU beds, and the other with few PACU nurses. For each problem, a mathematical model and a matheuristic are proposed for minimising the number of cancellations. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study that investigates the implications of a severe lack of the PACU beds or nurses on the number of cancellations. The matheuristics hybridise the decomposition of each instance into some small-sized sub-instances with a variable neighbourhood search algorithm. The main advantages of these methods are their flexibility to incorporate many problem details (such as a step-wise demand for the PACU nurses) and to solve any large-scale problem. Numerical results for a data set with 22 ORs show that with an increasingly severe lack of PACU capacity there is progressively greater benefit of the matheuristics than their initial solutions. Moreover, these results show the influence of the overtime and the recovery in ORs on improving the situation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Khorasanian, D.; Dexter, F.; Demeulemeester, E.; Moslehi, G.",International Journal of Production Research,,434

The approaches targeting the autophagy processes might have promising diagnostic and therapeutic values against Coronavirus infection. Here, we aimed to investigate the relationship of Beclin-1 (BECN1), an autophagy-related protein, with blood parameters and the clinical severity in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 108 patients with COVID-19 and 21 healthy controls in this study, from September 2020 to January 2021 and divided all patients into two groups according to the severity of the disease: The non-severe group and the severe group. BECN1 levels and blood parameters were measured with Enzyme-Linked Absorbent Assay and routine techniques, respectively. KEY FINDINGS: Serum BECN1 levels were increased in patients with COVID-19 compared to the healthy controls, and its concentrations were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group (p < 0.001). BECN1 levels showed a significantly positive correlation with coagulation markers such as D-dimer and Fibrinogen (FIB) and inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), Ferritin and biochemical markers such as Blood urea nitrogen and Lactate dehydrogenase (p < 0.001). We detected that areas under the ROC curve for BECN1, D-dimer, FIB, PCT, CRP and Ferritin were 0.8662, 0.9110, 0.8278, 0.9996 and 0.9284, respectively (p < 0.0001). SIGNIFICANCE: BECN1 may serve as a predictive biomarker in evaluating the disease severity of COVID-19. Our data suggest that BECN1 mediated-autophagy modulation might have a promising value in improving the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.","Okuyan, Hamza Malik; Dogan, Serdar; Bal, Tayibe; Çabalak, Mehmet",Life Sci,,434

Analysis of Social Attitudes towards the Order to Cover Mouth and Nose during the Covid-19 Pandemic [article in Polish]],2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by respiratory syndrome coronavirus qualified as SARS-CoV-2.

In several countries, the COVID-19 evolution was relatively benign compared to others and despite noncompliance with health recommendations on several occasions. In this overview, we attempt to define the criteria that could explain such a difference. Among these criteria, the specificity of Lactobacillus genus strains, as a part of nasal microbiota, could play a role of a barrier against viral penetration and could strengthen the host's immune system in some populations rather than others. In fact, several studies have shown the role of lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacilli, in the prevention of viral respiratory infections.

We aimed to determine the impact of the lockdown on physical activity levels (PAL) in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Starting in May 2018, we are conducting an observational study with a 1-year follow-up on PAL in patients from 4 hemodialysis clinics in New York City. Patients active in the study as of March 22, 2020, were included. PAL was defined by steps taken per day measured by a wrist-based monitoring device (Fitbit Charge 2). Average steps/day were calculated for January 1 to February 13, 2020, and then weekly from February 14 to June 30. RESULTS: 42 patients were included. Their mean age was 55 years, 79% were males, and 69% were African Americans. Between January 1 and February 13, 2020, patients took on average 5,963 (95% CI 4,909-7,017) steps/day. In the week prior to the mandated lockdown, when a national emergency was declared, and in the week of the shutdown, the average number of daily steps had decreased by 868 steps/day (95% CI 213-1,722) and 1,222 steps/day (95% CI 668-2300), respectively. Six patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Five of them exhibited significantly higher PAL in the 2 weeks prior to showing COVID-19 symptoms compared to COVID-19 negative patients. CONCLUSION: Lockdown measures were associated with a significant decrease in PAL in hemodialysis patients. Patients who contracted COVID-19 had higher PAL during the incubation period. Methods to increase PAL while allowing for social distancing should be explored and implemented.","Han, Maggie; Preciado, Priscila; Thwin, Ohnmar; Tao, Xia; Tapia-Silva, Leticia M; Fuentes, Lemuel Rivera; Hakim, Mohamad; Patel, Amrish; Tisdale, Lela; Zhang, Hanjie; Kotanko, Peter",Blood Purif,,434

350151,Unwed single mothers in South Korea: Increased vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

350227,Capturing Beneficial Changes to Racehorse Veterinary Care Implemented during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"We aimed to evaluate whether there was a relationship between endocan (human endothelial cell-specific molecule-1) levels and disease prognosis in patients who presented to the emergency department with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A total of 60 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized from the emergency department to clinical wards and a control group consisting of healthy adult individuals (n = 28), were included in the study. The majority (93.3%) of the patients were discharged after recovery; 6.7% died. The median endocan value was 243.5 ng/mL in the patient group versus 201.5 ng/mL in the control group (P = .002). The median endocan level was 240.5 ng/mL in those discharged with recovery and 558 ng/mL in those who died (P = .001). There was no significant relationship in hospitalization duration, sex, tomography findings, and clinical outcomes. A 202 ng/mL serum endocan level had 86.7% sensitivity and 50% specificity for COVID-19. Serum endocan levels may be a useful biomarker both for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to predict mortality.","Görgün, Selim; Cindoruk, Sener; Özgen, Emre; Yadigaroglu, Metin; Demir, Mehmet Tevfik; Yücel, Murat; Akpinar, Çetin Kürsad; Güzel, Murat",Angiology,,434
350635,Emergency Surgery in Urology during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed cancer care with the rapid expansion of telemedicine, but given the limited use of telemedicine in oncology, concerns have been raised about the quality of care being delivered. We assessed the patient experience with telemedicine in routine radiation oncology practice to determine satisfaction, quality of care, and opportunities for optimization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients seen within a multistate comprehensive cancer center for prepandemic office visits and intrapandemic telemedicine visits in December 2019 through June 2020 who completed patient experience questionnaires were evaluated. Patient satisfaction between office and telemedicine consultations were compared, patient visit-type preferences were assessed, and factors associated with an office visit preference were determined. RESULTS: In total, 1,077 patients were assessed (office visit, n=726; telemedicine, n=351). The telemedicine-consult survey response rate was 40%. No significant differences were seen in satisfaction scores between office and telemedicine consultations, including the appointment experience versus expectation, quality of physician's explanation, and level of physician concern and friendliness. Among telemedicine survey respondents, 45% and 34% preferred telemedicine and office visits, respectively, and 21% had no preference for their visit type. Most respondents found their confidence in their physician (90%), understanding of the treatment plan (88%), and confidence in their treatment (87%) to be better or no different than with an office visit. Patients with better performance status and who were married/partnered were more likely to prefer in-person office visit consultations (odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.08]; P=.047, and 2.41 [95% CI, 1.14-5.47]; P=.009, respectively). Patients with telephone-only encounters were more likely to report better treatment plan understanding with an office visit (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.00-4.77; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to assess telemedicine in routine radiation oncology practice, and found high patient satisfaction and confidence in their care. Optimization of telemedicine in oncology should be a priority, specifically access to audiovisual capabilities that can improve patient-oncologist communication.","Shaverdian, Narek; Gillespie, Erin F; Cha, Elaine; Kim, Soo Young; Benvengo, Stephanie; Chino, Fumiko; Kang, Jung Julie; Li, Yuelin; Atkinson, Thomas M; Lee, Nancy; Washington, Charles M; Cahlon, Oren; Gomez, Daniel R",J Natl Compr Canc Netw,,434

METHODS: This study included all patients with a FTMH that developed after RRD repair from January 1, 2015-July 31, 2020. The main outcome was the rate of FTMH formation following RRD repair as well as characteristics of FTMH following RRD repair that spontaneously close. RESULTS: There were 470 eyes with a diagnosis of both a FTMH and a RRD during the study period. Of these, 27 (0.28%) developed a FTMH following RRD repair. The median time to FTMH diagnosis was 91 days (25th, 75th quartiles 40, 204 days). The mean minimum hole diameter was 514.5 ± 303.6 microns. There were 4 FTMHs (14.8%) that spontaneously closed without surgical intervention. The spontaneous closure was noted from 4 to 12 weeks after the initial diagnosis of the FTMH. These holes were smaller than the holes that did not close spontaneously (mean minimum diameter 161.8 ± 85.2 vs 588.7 ± 279.3 microns, p = 0.0058). Of the 27 post-operative FTMHs, there were 23 eyes (85%) that underwent surgical intervention with pars plana vitrectomy and internal limiting membrane peeling. Nineteen eyes (83%) closed with one surgery, 20 eyes (87%) ultimately closed, while 3 eyes (11.1%) did not close. CONCLUSIONS: FTMH is relatively uncommon to occur following RRD repair with a prevalence of 0.28% in our series with 87% of these holes achieving closure following surgery or spontaneously. Approximately 15% of FTMHs following RRD repair closed spontaneously and these holes were significantly smaller.","Starr, Matthew R; Lee, Crystal; Arias, Diego; Mahmoudzadeh, Raziyeh; Salabati, Mirataollah; Kuriyan, Ajay E; Regillo, Carl D; Hsu, Jason; Yonekawa, Yoshihiro; Gupta, Omesh P",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,434

A web-based survey of antimicrobial leads gathered data about the use of procalcitonin testing. Responses were received from 148/151 (98%) eligible hospitals. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was widespread introduction and expansion of PCT use in NHS hospitals. The number of hospitals using PCT in emergency/acute admissions rose from 17 (11%) to 74/146 (50.7%) and use in Intensive Care Units (ICU) increased from 70 (47.6%) to 124/147 (84.4%). This increase happened predominantly in March and April 2020, preceding NICE guidance. Approximately half of hospitals used PCT as a single test to guide decisions to discontinue antibiotics and half used repeated measurements. There was marked variation in the thresholds used for empiric antibiotic cessation and guidance about interpretation of values. Procalcitonin testing has been widely adopted in the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic in an unevidenced, heterogeneous way and in conflict with relevant NICE guidance.

METHODS: a multi-cohort, deterministic, static Markov model was populated by real-world data on the clinical and economic impact of Influenza-Like Illness and Lower Respiratory Tract Infection over 1 year. Four scenarios featuring different vaccine coverage rates were compared with the base case; coverage rates in subjects with and without risk factors were considered separately. RESULTS: compared with the base case, adopting scenarios 1-4 would reduce the annual number of influenza cases by 6.5%, 10.8%, 13.8% and 3.4%, Emergency Department accesses by 10.7%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.6%, complications by 8.9%, 9.9%, 14.7% and 4.1%, and the hospitalization of complicated cases by 11%, 9.1%, 15.4% and 4.5%, respectively. The four scenarios would require an additional investment (vaccine purchase and administration) of 316,996, 529,174, 677,539, and 168,633, respectively, in comparison with the base case. Scenario 1 proved to be cost-saving in the 60-64-year age-group. The incremental costs of implementing the other hypothetical scenarios ranged from 2.7% (scenario 4) to 13.2% (scenario 3). CONCLUSIONS: lowering the recommended age for influenza vaccination to 60 years would allow a high proportion of subjects at risk for severe influenza to be reached and would save money.","Trucchi, Cecilia; D039,; Amelio, Marco; Amicizia, Daniela; Orsi, Andrea; Loiacono, Idalba; Tosatto, Roberta; Piazza, Maria Francesca; Paganino, Chiara; Pitrelli, Andrea; Icardi, Giancarlo; Ansaldi, Filippo",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,434

353516,Information Technology in Support of Our Heroes during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Commentary,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide, at different levels. The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. METHOD: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. RESULT: The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. DISCUSSION: The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health. This underlines the need for specialized psychological help for nursing staff.","Mboua, Pierre Célestin; Keubo, François Roger Nguépy; Fouaka, Sylvain Gautier Ngueuteu",Evol. psychiatr(Paris),,434

Although industry stakeholders implemented strategies to minimize cattle welfare impacts of increased weights, days on feed (DOF), and increasing temperatures, there were concerns that mobility challenges would be observed at slaughter facilities. The objectives of this study were to characterize mobility in fed cattle during this recovery period and to identify factors impacting mobility. A total of 158 groups of cattle (15,388 animals) from one slaughter facility were included in the study. A 4-point mobility scoring system was used to assess cattle mobility. Cattle at the facility with normal mobility scores were reduced from the historical average of 96.19% to 74.55%. No increase in highly elevated mobility scores was observed. Mobility was impacted by weight, temperature humidity index (THI), distance hauled, sex, and DOF, with results differing by mobility category. Weather was a key contributor to mobility challenges;the relative risk of observing an elevated mobility score was 45.76% greater when the THI changed from No Stress to Mild Stress. Despite the challenges that the industry faced during this period, efforts to minimize negative effects on cattle welfare by enhanced focus on low-stress handling were effective.","Mijares, S.; Calvo-Lorenzo, M.; Betts, N.; Alexander, L.; Edwards-Callaway, L.

355632,Constructivist Retelling of the Epic of Gilgamesh: Implications for the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, as demonstrated by numerous well-documented superspreading events. The infection commonly starts in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but can migrate to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and other organs, often with severe consequences. Whereas LRT infection can lead to shedding of virus via breath and cough droplets, URT infection enables shedding via abundant speech droplets. Their viral load can be high in carriers with mild or no symptoms, an observation linked to the abundance of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cells in the oral cavity epithelium. Expelled droplets rapidly lose water through evaporation, with the smaller ones transforming into long-lived aerosol. Although the largest speech droplets can carry more virions, they are few in number, fall to the ground rapidly and therefore play a relatively minor role in transmission. Of more concern is small speech aerosol, which can descend deep into the LRT and cause severe disease. However, since their total volume is small, the amount of virus they carry is low. Nevertheless, in closed environments with inadequate ventilation, they can accumulate, which elevates the risk of direct LRT infection. Of most concern is the large fraction of speech aerosol that is intermediate-sized because it remains suspended in air for minutes and can be transported over considerable distances by convective air currents. The abundance of this speech-generated aerosol, combined with its high viral load in pre- and asymptomatic individuals, strongly implicates airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through speech as the primary contributor to its rapid spread.","Stadnytskyi, V; Anfinrud, P; Bax, A",J. intern. med,,434
355999,Clinician burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccine administration,2021,"Introduction: Since the declaration of COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a global pandemic on 11th March 2020, the number of deaths continue to increase worldwide. Reports on its pathologic manifestations have been published with very few from the Sub-Saharan African region. This article reports autopsies on COVID-19 patients from the Ga-East and the 37 Military Hospitals to provide pathological evidence for better understanding of COVID-19 in Ghana. Methods: Under conditions required for carrying out autopsies on bodies infected with category three infectious agents, with few modifications, complete autopsies were performed on twenty patients with ante-mortem and/or postmortem RT -PCR confirmed positive COVID-19 results, between April and June, 2020. Results: There were equal proportion of males and females. Thirteen (65%) of the patients were 55years or older with the same percentage (65%) having Type II diabetes and/or hypertension. The most significant pathological feature found at autopsy was diffuse alveolar damage. Seventy per cent (14/20) had associated thromboemboli in the lungs, kidneys and the heart. Forty per cent (6/15) of the patients that had negative results for COVID-19 by the nasopharyngeal swab test before death had positive results during postmortem using bronchopulmonary specimen. At autopsy all patients were identified to have pre-existing medical conditions. Conclusion: Diffuse alveolar damage was a key pathological feature of deaths caused by COVID-19 in all cases studied with hypertension and diabetes mellitus being major risk factors. Individuals without co-morbidities were less likely to die or suffer severe disease from SARS-CoV-2.

356000,Clinician burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccine administration,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic halted non-emergency surgery across Scotland. Measures to mitigate the risks of transmitting COVID-19 are creating significant challenges to restarting all surgical services safely. We describe the development of a risk stratification tool to prioritise patients for cataract surgery taking account both specific risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as surgical 'need'. In addition we report the demographics and comorbidities of patients on our waiting list. METHODS: A prospective case review of electronic records was performed. A risk stratification tool was developed based on review of available literature on systemic risk factors for poor outcome from COVID-19 infection as well as a surgical 'need' score. Scores derived from the tool were used to generate 6 risk profile groups to allow prioritised allocation of surgery. RESULTS: There were 744 patients awaiting cataract surgery of which 66 (8.9 %) patients were 'shielding'. One hundred and thirty-two (19.5 %) patients had no systemic comorbidities, 218 (32.1 %) patients had 1 relevant systemic comorbidity and 316 (46.5 %) patients had 2 or more comorbidities. Five hundred and ninety patients (88.7 %) did not have significant ocular comorbidities. Using the risk stratification tool, 171 (23 %) patients were allocated in the highest 3 priority stages. Given an aging cohort with associated increase in number of systemic comorbidities, the majority of patients were in the lower priority stages 4 to 6. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has created an urgent challenge to deal safely with cataract surgery waiting lists. This has driven the need for a prompt and pragmatic change to the way we assess risks and benefits of a previously regarded as low-risk intervention. This is further complicated by the majority of patients awaiting cataract surgery being elderly with comorbidities and at higher risk of mortality related to COVID-19. We present a pragmatic method of risk stratifying patients on waiting lists, blending an evidence-based objective assessment of risk and patient need combined with an element of shared decision-making. This has facilitated safe and successful restarting of our cataract service.","Cheng, Kelvin Kw; Anderson, Martin J; Velissaris, Stavros; Moreton, Robert; Al-Mansour, Ahmed; Sanders, Roshini; Sutherland, Shona; Wilson, Peter; Blaikie, Andrew",BMC Health Serv Res,,434

357327,Complete protection from covid-19 is possible for health workers,2020,"Stimulator of interferon genes (STING), as a signaling hub in innate immunity, plays a central role for the effective initiation of host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. Upon binding of its ligand cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) produced by the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) or invading bacteria, STING is activated, leading to the induction of both type I interferon responses and autophagy, which are critical for the control of certain microbial infections. RNA viruses, such as Parainfluenza virus (PIV) and Rhinovirus (HRV), are among the leading causes of respiratory infections that affect human health without effective treatments. Activation of STING pathway may provide a new therapeutic approach fighting against these viruses. However, the role of STING in the control of RNA virus infection remains largely unexplored. In this study, using dimeric amidobenzimidazole (diABZI), a newly discovered synthetic small molecule STING receptor agonist with much higher potency than CDNs, we found that activation of STING elicits potent antiviral effects against parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) and human rhinovirus 16 (HRV16), two representative respiratory viral pathogens. Notably, while anti-PIV3 activity was depend on the induction of type I interferon responses through TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), anti-HRV16 activity required the induction of autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5)-dependent autophagy, indicating that two distinct antiviral mechanisms are engaged upon STING activation. Antiviral activity and individual specific pathway was further confirmed in infected primary bronchial epithelial cells. Our findings thus demonstrate the distinct antiviral mechanisms triggered by STING agonist and uncover the potential of therapeutic effect against different viruses.","Zhu, Qingyuan; Hu, Hui; Liu, Haixia; Shen, Hong; Yan, Zhipeng; Gao, Lu",Antiviral Res,,434

Since SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entering into host cells, to target COVID-19 from therapeutic angle, we engineered a hexapeptide corresponding to the ACE2-interacting domain of SARS-CoV-2 (AIDS) that inhibits the association between receptor-binding domain-containing spike S1 and ACE-2. Accordingly, wild type (wt), but not mutated (m), AIDS peptide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-induced activation of NF-&#954;B and expression of IL-6 in human lungs cells. Interestingly, intranasal intoxication of C57/BL6 mice with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 led to fever, increase in IL-6 in lungs, infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs, arrhythmias, and impairment in locomotor activities, mimicking some of the important symptoms of COVID-19. However, intranasal treatment with wtAIDS, but not mAIDS, peptide reduced fever, protected lungs, improved heart function, and enhanced locomotor activities in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1-intoxicated mice. Therefore, selective targeting of ACE2-to-SARS-CoV-2 interaction by wtAIDS may be beneficial for COVID-19.","Paidi, Ramesh K; Jana, Malabendu; Mishra, Rama K; Dutta, Debashis; Raha, Sumita; Pahan, Kalipada",J. neuroimmune pharmacol,,434

In the current study, by considering a collection of social textual contents related to COVID-19 gathered on the Twitter microblogging platform in the period between August and December 2020, we aimed at evaluating the possible effects of some critical factors related to the pandemic on the mental well-being of the population. In particular, we aimed at investigating potential lexicon identifiers of vulnerability to psychological distress in digital social interactions with respect to distinct COVID-related scenarios, which could be “at risk” from a psychological discomfort point of view. Such scenarios have been associated with peculiar topics discussed on Twitter. For this purpose, two approaches based on a “top-down” and a “bottom-up” strategy were adopted. In the top-down approach, three potential scenarios were initially selected by medical experts, and associated with topics extracted from the Twitter dataset in a hybrid unsupervised-supervised way. On the other hand, in the bottom-up approach, three topics were extracted in a totally unsupervised way capitalising on a Twitter dataset filtered according to the presence of keywords related to vulnerability to psychological distress, and associated with at-risk scenarios. The identification of such scenarios with both approaches made it possible to capture and analyze the potential psychological vulnerability in critical situations.","Viviani, Marco Crocamo Cristina Mazzola Matteo Bartoli Francesco Carrà Giuseppe Pasi Gabriella",Future Generation Computer Systems,,434

However, the common surgical masks cannot be reused, resulting in the increasing economic and resource consumption around the world. Herein, we report a superhydrophobic, photo-sterilize, and reusable mask based on graphene nanosheet-embedded carbon (GNEC) film, with high-density edges of standing structured graphene nanosheets. The GNEC mask exhibits an excellent hydrophobic ability (water contact angle: 157.9°) and an outstanding filtration efficiency with 100% bacterial filtration efficiency (BFE). In addition, the GNEC mask shows the prominent photo-sterilize performance, heating up to 110 °C quickly under the solar illumination. These high performances may facilitate the combat against the COVID-19 outbreaks, while the reusable masks help reducing the economic and resource consumption.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of respiratory viruses in the lower airways of individuals undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation, with and without acute lower respiratory infection (respectively WRI and WORI groups). METHODS: We studied 44 mini-bronchoalveolar lavage samples (collected with a double catheter, Combicath® kit) from patients with mean age in the seventh decade, 20 from WORI group and 24 from WRI group, who were hospitalized for acute respiratory failure in Intensive Care Units of two hospitals in the Lisbon area. Real-time PCR was applied to verify analyse the presence of 15 common respiratory viruses (adenovirus, human bocavirus, influenza virus A and B, repiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, human enterovirus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus group 1 (229E, NL63) and 2 (OC43, HKU1). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were detected in six of the 20 patients in the WORI group: influenza AH3 (n = 2), parainfluenza virus 1/3 (n = 2), human rhinovirus (n = 2), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 1) and human metapneumovirus (n = 1). In the WRI group, respiratory viruses were detected in 12 of the 24 patients: influenza AH3 (n = 3), human rhinovirus (n = 3), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 3), human metapneumovirus (n = 3), human bocavirus (n = 2) and human enterovirus (n = 1). Simultaneous detection of two viruses was recorded in two samples in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the presence of common respiratory viruses in the lower respiratory tract without causing symptomatic infection, even in carefully collected lower samples. This may have important implications on the interpretation of the results on the diagnostic setting.","Nazareth, Raquel; Chasqueira, Maria-Jesus; Rodrigues, Maria-Lúcia; Paulino, Carolina; Conceição, Catarina; Lêdo, Lia; Segura, Úrsula; Santos, Madalena; Messias, António; Póvoa, Pedro; Paixão, Paulo",BMC Pulm Med,,434

We analysed the impact of COVID-19 on our oncological surgical activity. METHODS: To address the emergency and guarantee safety of patients referred to our Unit, reproducible guidelines were followed. Surgical activity data during COVID-19 were compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). RESULTS: From 21st February to 25th of May 113 surgical procedures were performed. The average of the two selected years (2018-2019) is 84.5, showing an increase of 34.5% of our activities (statistically significant, p = 0.0011). No patient showed perioperative or postoperative contagion. CONCLUSION: Due to the conversion of regular Hospitals into COVID Centers, Cancer Centers may encounter an increased demand for procedures. Following strict guidelines, it seems possible to face surgical activity on cancer patients and respect standard procedures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 infection.","Salzano, Giovanni; Maglitto, Fabio; Guida, Agostino; Perri, Francesco; Maglione, Maria Grazia; Buonopane, Sergio; Muto, Paolo; Ionna, Franco",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,434

Although skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) certified by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have federal COVID-19 reporting requirements, national surveillance data are less readily available for other types of LTCFs, such as assisted living facilities (ALFs) and those providing similar residential care. However, many state and territorial health departments publicly report COVID-19 surveillance data across various types of LTCFs. These data were systematically retrieved from health department websites to characterize COVID-19 cases and deaths in ALF residents and staff members. Limited ALF COVID-19 data were available for 39 states, although reporting varied. By October 15, 2020, among 28,623 ALFs, 6,440 (22%) had at least one COVID-19 case among residents or staff members. Among the states with available data, the proportion of COVID-19 cases that were fatal was 21.2% for ALF residents, 0.3% for ALF staff members, and 2.5% overall for the general population of these states. To prevent the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in their facilities, ALFs should 1) identify a point of contact at the local health department; 2) educate residents, families, and staff members about COVID-19; 3) have a plan for visitor and staff member restrictions; 4) encourage social (physical) distancing and the use of masks, as appropriate; 5) implement recommended infection prevention and control practices and provide access to supplies; 6) rapidly identify and properly respond to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases in residents and staff members; and 7) conduct surveillance of COVID-19 cases and deaths, facility staffing, and supply information (2).","Yi, Sarah H; See, Isaac; Kent, Alyssa G; Vlachos, Nicholas; Whitworth, J Carrie; Xu, Kerui; Gouin, Katryna A; Zhang, Shirley; Slifka, Kara Jacobs; Sauer, Ann Goding; Kutty, Preeta K; Perz, Joseph F; Stone, Nimalie D; Stuckey, Matthew J",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,434

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We identified 88,747 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between 3/1/20-5/14/20 in the Veterans Affairs (VA) national healthcare system, including 75,315 with no cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 negative (C0-S0), 9826 with no cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 positive (C0-S1); 3301 with cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 negative (C1-S0); and 305 with cirrhosis-SARS-CoV-2 positive (C1-S1). Patients were followed through 6/22/20. Hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and death were modeled in time-to-event analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression. Patients with cirrhosis were less likely to test positive than patients without cirrhosis (8.5% vs. 11.5%, adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.69-0.99). Thirty-day mortality and ventilation rates increased progressively from C0-S0 (2.3% and 1.6%), to C1-S0 (5.2% and 3.6%), to C0-S1 (10.6% and 6.5%), to C1-S1(17.1% and 13.0%). Among patients with cirrhosis, those who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were 4.1 times more likely to undergo mechanical ventilation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 4.12, 95% CI 2.79-6.10) and 3.5 times more likely to die (aHR 3.54, 95% CI 2.55-4.90) than those who tested negative. Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, those with cirrhosis were more likely to be hospitalized (aHR 1.37, 95% CI 1.12-1.66), undergo ventilation (aHR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-2.46) or die (aHR 1.65, 95% CI 1.18-2.30) than patients without cirrhosis. Among patients with cirrhosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most important predictors of mortality were advanced age, cirrhosis decompensation and high MELD score. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a 3.5-fold increase in mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Cirrhosis was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ioannou, George N; Liang, Peter S; Locke, Emily; Green, Pamela; Berry, Kristin; O039,; Hare, Ann M; Shah, Javeed A; Crothers, Kristina; Eastment, McKenna C; Fan, Vincent S; Dominitz, Jason A",Hepatology (Baltim.),,434

To address this, we conduct a retrospective study, which involved patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Hefei, China and being discharged between January 20 2020 and March 16 2020. Demographic information, clinical treatment, and laboratory data for the participants were extracted from medical records. A prolonged LOS was defined as equal to or greater than the median length of hospitable stay. The median LOS for the 75 patients was 17 days (IQR 13-22). We used univariable and multivariable logistic regressions to explore the risk factors associated with a prolonged hospital LOS. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. The median age of the 75 patients was 47 years. Approximately 75% of the patients had mild or general disease. The univariate logistic regression model showed that female sex and having a fever on admission were significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalization. The multivariate logistic regression model enhances these associations. Odds of a prolonged LOS were associated with male sex (aOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.05-0.63, p = 0.01), having fever on admission (aOR 8.27, 95% CI 1.47-72.16, p = 0.028) and pre-existing chronic kidney or liver disease (aOR 13.73 95% CI 1.95-145.4, p = 0.015) as well as each 1-unit increase in creatinine level (aOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.9-0.98, p = 0.007). We also found that a prolonged LOS was associated with increased creatinine levels in patients with chronic kidney or liver disease (p < 0.001). In conclusion, female sex, fever, chronic kidney or liver disease before admission and increasing creatinine levels were associated with prolonged LOS in patients with COVID-19.","Guo, Anping; Lu, Jin; Tan, Haizhu; Kuang, Zejian; Luo, Ying; Yang, Tian; Xu, Junlan; Yu, Jishuang; Wen, Canhong; Shen, Aizong",Sci Rep,,434

365562,Emotional responses and coping strategies in nurses and nursing students during Covid-19 outbreak: A comparative study,2020,"BACKGROUND: Vaccine hesitancy poses serious challenges for achieving coverage for population immunity. It is necessary to achieve high COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rates and medical students' coverage as future health care providers. The study aimed to explore the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and determine the factors and barriers that may affect vaccination decision-making. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out among medical students in Tanta and Kafrelsheikh Universities, Egypt. Data collection was done via an online questionnaire during January 2021 from 2133 students. RESULTS: The majority of the participant students (90.5%) perceived the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine, 46% had vaccination hesitancy, and an equal percentage (6%) either definitely accepted or refused the vaccine. Most of the students had concerns regarding the vaccine's adverse effects (96.8%) and ineffectiveness (93.2%). The most confirmed barriers of COVID-19 vaccination were deficient data regarding the vaccine's adverse effects (potential 74.17% and unknown 56.31%) and insufficient information regarding the vaccine itself (72.76%). CONCLUSION: The government, health authority decision-makers, medical experts, and universities in Egypt need to work together and make efforts to reduce hesitancy and raise awareness about vaccinations, consequently improving the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Saied, Shimaa M; Saied, Eman M; Kabbash, Ibrahim Ali; Abdo, Sanaa Abd El-Fatah",J. med. virol,,434

366121,Necessity and the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: The performance of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 varies with sampling site(s), illness stage, and infection site. Methods: Unilateral nasopharyngeal, nasal midturbinate, throat swabs, and saliva were simultaneously sampled for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR from suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. True positives were defined as patients with at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 detected by rRT-PCR from any site on the evaluation day or at any time point thereafter, until discharge. Diagnostic performance was assessed and extrapolated for site combinations. Results: We evaluated 105 patients; 73 had active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, nasopharyngeal specimens had the highest clinical sensitivity at 85%, followed by throat, 80%, midturbinate, 62%, and saliva, 38%-52%. Clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, midturbinate, and saliva was 95%, 88%, 72%, and 44%-56%, respectively, if taken &#8804;7 days from onset of illness, and 70%, 67%, 47%, 28%-44% if >7 days of illness. Comparing patients with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) vs pneumonia, clinical sensitivity for nasopharyngeal, throat, midturbinate, and saliva was 92% vs 70%, 88% vs 61%, 70% vs 44%, 43%-54% vs 26%-45%, respectively. A combination of nasopharyngeal plus throat or midturbinate plus throat specimen afforded overall clinical sensitivities of 89%-92%; this rose to 96% for persons with URTI and 98% for persons &#8804;7 days from illness onset. Conclusions: Nasopharyngeal specimens, followed by throat specimens, offer the highest clinical sensitivity for COVID-19 diagnosis in early illness. Clinical sensitivity improves and is similar when either midturbinate or nasopharyngeal specimens are combined with throat specimens. Upper respiratory specimens perform poorly if taken after the first week of illness or if there is pneumonia.","Sutjipto, Stephanie; Lee, Pei Hua; Tay, Jun Yang; Mendis, Shehara M; Abdad, Mohammad Yazid; Marimuthu, Kalisvar; Ng, Oon Tek; Cui, Lin; Chan, Monica; Soon, Margaret; Lin, Raymond T P; Leo, Yee-Sin; De, Partha P; Barkham, Timothy; Vasoo, Shawn",Open Forum Infect Dis,,434
366296,The Endemic Amid the Pandemic: Seeking Help for Violence Against Women in the Initial Phases of COVID-19,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with cardiovascular complications and coagulation disorders. Objectives: To explore clinical and biological parameters of COVID-19 patients with hospitalization criteria that could predict referral to intensive care unit (ICU). Methods: Analyzing the clinical and biological profiles of COVID-19 patients at admission. Results: Among 99 consecutive patients that fulfilled criteria for hospitalization, 48 were hospitalized in the medicine department, 21 were first admitted to the medicine ward department and referred later to ICU, and 30 were directly admitted to ICU from the emergency department. At admission, patients requiring ICU were more likely to have lymphopenia, decreased SpO2, a D-dimer level above 1,000 ng/mL, and a higher high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (Hs-cTnI) level. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified Hs-cTnI above 9.75 pg/mL as the best predictive criteria for ICU referral [area under the curve (AUC), 86.4; 95% CI, 76.6-96.2]. This cutoff for Hs-cTnI was confirmed in univariate [odds ratio (OR), 22.8; 95% CI, 6.0-116.2] and multivariate analysis after adjustment for D-dimer level (adjusted OR, 20.85; 95% CI, 4.76-128.4). Transthoracic echocardiography parameters subsequently measured in 72 patients showed an increased right ventricular (RV) afterload correlated with Hs-cTnI (r = 0.42, p = 0.010) and D-dimer (r = 0.18, p = 0.047). Conclusion: Hs-cTnI appears to be the best relevant predictive factor for referring COVID-19 patients to ICU. This result associated with the correlation of D-dimer with RV dilatation probably reflects a myocardial injury due to an increased RV wall tension. This reinforces the hypothesis of a COVID-19-associated microvascular thrombosis inducing a higher RV afterload.","Goudot, Guillaume; Chocron, Richard; Augy, Jean-Loup; Gendron, Nicolas; Khider, Lina; Debuc, Benjamin; Aissaoui, Nadia; Peron, Nicolas; Hauw-Berlemont, Caroline; Vedie, Benoit; Cheng, Charles; Mohamedi, Nassim; Krzisch, Daphné; Philippe, Aurélien; Puscas, Tania; Hermann, Bertrand; Brichet, Julie; Juvin, Philippe; Planquette, Benjamin; Messas, Emmanuel; Pere, Hélène; Veyer, David; Gaussem, Pascale; Sanchez, Olivier; Diehl, Jean-Luc; Mirault, Tristan; Smadja, David M",Front Med (Lausanne),,434

367706,"Evaluating the impact of a time orientation intervention on well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown: past, present or future?",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To design a standardized imaging diagnostic reporting mode for screening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to prospectively verify its effectiveness in clinical practice. METHODS: A new classification and standardized imaging diagnosis report mode of viral pneumonia was established by studying and summarizing the imaging findings of various kinds of viral pneumonia, combining with lesion density, interstitial changes, pleural effusion, lymph nodes, and some special signs. After systematic training, the radiologist experienced clinical practice for screening CT features. COVID-19 cases were screened retrospectively in the single-center. The confirmed cases were verified, and the diagnostic efficacy of the standardized imaging reporting system in screening COVID-19 was tested. RESULTS: There were 912 patients in this stage receiving the screening imaging examination. Of them, 190 patients were screened in the report mode and 30 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19. The CT manifestation of COVID-19 was characterized by pure ground glass lesions or with a few solid components, predominant subpleural distribution, no lymph node enlargement and pleural effusion, and often with paving-way sign and air bronchus sign. In combination with the above signs, the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 was 0.942. CONCLUSIONS: The standardized imaging diagnosis report mode based on COVID-19 chest image features is effective and practical, which should be popularized.","Wang, Tianming; Xiong, Zeng; Zhou, Hui; Luo, Weijun; Tang, Haixiong; Liu, Jinkang",Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,434
367987,Using Unstated Cases to Correct for COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak and Its Impact on Easing the Intervention for Qatar,2021,"It has been demonstrated in a number of communities that the rates of serious crimes such as homicides and intimate partner violence have increased as a result of lockdowns due to COVID-19. To ascertain whether this is a universal trend the electronic autopsy files at Forensic Science South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, were searched for all homicides occurring between January 2015 and December 2020. There were 92 cases with 17 homicides in 2015 out of a total of 1356 cases (1.3%),18 in 2016 (18/1340 = 1.3%), 23 in 2017 (23/1419 = 1.6%); 14 in 2018 (14/1400 = 1.0%), 15 in 2019 (15/1492 = 1.0%) but in 2020 there were only 5 (5/1374 = 0.4%) (p < 0.02). Thus the incidence of homicides has fallen significantly in South Australia since the beginning of the pandemic. As the occurrence of serious crimes of violence and homicide has not followed a standard pattern in different communities it will be important to evaluate specific populations and subgroups rather than merely relying on accrued national data or extrapolating from one country to another. Pathologists, epidemiologists and health officials will need to specifically monitor local trends to understand more clearly what effects, if any, the pandemic has had on particular subgroups of deaths in order to more clearly understand causal relationships.","Byard, Roger W",Forensic sci. med. pathol.

Why did the issue generate so many vivid debates in the United States and so few in most European countries, although the latter were also affected by the rationing of health care resources? Are countries with socialized health care systems better equipped to face the hard choices of triaging? Important lessons in transparency, trust, and accountability for policy-makers can be drawn from this comparison, demonstrating that fostering public involvement and ethical debate remains a critical element for the sustained acceptance of any triage plan.","Orfali, Kristina",Hastings Cent Rep,,434

Herein, we investigated the role of LUS imaging in COVID-19 pneumonia patients and the relationship between LUS findings and disease severity. This was a retrospective, observational study at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, on 48 recruited patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including 32 non-critically ill patients and 16 critically ill patients. LUS was performed and the respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) index, disease severity, and confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure and age (CURB-65) score were recorded on days 0-7, 8-14, and 15-21 after symptom onset. Lung images were divided into 12 regions, and the LUS score (0-36 points) was calculated. Chest computed tomography (CT) scores (0-20 points) were also recorded on days 0-7. Correlations between the LUS score, ROX index, and CURB-65 scores were examined. LUS detected COVID-19 pneumonia in 38 patients. LUS signs included B line (34/38, 89.5%), consolidation (6/38, 15.8%), and pleural effusion (2/41, 5.3%). Most cases showed more than one lesion (32/38, 84.2%) and involved both lungs (28/38, 73.7%). Compared with non-critically ill patients, the LUS scores of critically ill patients were higher (12 (10-18) vs 2 (0-5), pâ<â0.001). The LUS score showed significant negative correlations with the ROX index on days 0-7 (r = -0.85, pâ<â0.001), days 8-14 (râ=â-0.71, pâ<â0.001), and days 15-21 (râ=â-0.76, pâ<â0.001) after symptom onset. However, the LUS score was positively correlated with the CT score (râ=â0.82, pâ<â0.001). The number of patients with LUS-detected lesions decreased from 27 cases (81.8%) to 20 cases (46.5%), and the LUS scores significantly decreased from 4 (2-10) to 0 (0-5) (pâ<â0.001) from days 0-7 to 17-21. We conclude that LUS can detect lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia patients in a portable, real-time, and safe manner. Thus, LUS is helpful in assessing COVID-19 pneumonia severity in critically ill patients.","Zhu, Fengxue; Zhao, Xiujuan; Wang, Tianbing; Wang, Zhenzhou; Guo, Fuzheng; Xue, Haiyan; Chang, Panpan; Liang, Hansheng; Ni, Wentao; Wang, Yaxin; Chen, Lei; Jiang, Baoguo",,,434

The sequence analysis of S protein of CoV-2 has shown that it has acquired a 'polybasic cleavage site' consisting of 12 aminoacids that has been predicted to enable its cleavage by other cellular proteases possibly increasing its transmissibility. The aminoacids present in receptor binding domain of S protein of SARS CoV which are critical for its binding to cellular receptor are different in CoV-2. The presence of heptanucleotide slippery sequence in ORF1 resulting in ribosomal frameshifting, and presence of transcription regulatory sequences between ORFs resulting in discontinuous transcription, are peculiar features of Coronavirus infection cycle. The exonuclease activity of nsp14 provides possible proofreading ability to RNA polymerase makes coronaviruses different from other RNA viruses allowing coronaviruses to maintain their relatively large genome size.

It is unclear how vaccine-induced antibody levels quantitatively compare to the wide spectrum induced by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vaccine response kinetics and magnitudes in persons with prior COVID-19 compared to virus-naiÌve persons are not well-defined. The relative stability of vaccine-induced versus infection-induced antibody levels is unclear. We addressed these issues with longitudinal assessments of vaccinees with and without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of anti-RBD antibodies. SARS-CoV-2-naiÌve individuals achieved levels similar to mild natural infection after the first vaccination; a second dose generated levels approaching severe natural infection. In persons with prior COVID-19, one dose boosted levels to the high end of severe natural infection even in those who never had robust responses from infection, increasing no further after the second dose. Antiviral neutralizing assessments using a spike-pseudovirus assay revealed that virus-naiÌve vaccinees did not develop physiologic neutralizing potency until the second dose, while previously infected persons exhibited maximal neutralization after one dose. Finally, antibodies from vaccination waned similarly to natural infection, resulting in an average of â¼90% loss within 90 days. In summary, our findings suggest that two doses are important for quantity and quality of humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2-naiÌve persons, while a single dose has maximal effects in those with past infection. Antibodies from vaccination wane with kinetics very similar to that seen after mild natural infection; booster vaccinations will likely be required.","Ibarrondo, F Javier; Hofmann, Christian; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Goodman-Meza, David; Mu, William; Hausner, Mary Ann; Ali, Ayub; Balamurugan, Arumugam; Taus, Ellie; Elliott, Julie; Krogstad, Paul; Tobin, Nicole H; Ferbas, Kathie G; Kitchen, Scott G; Aldrovandi, Grace M; Rimoin, Anne W; Yang, Otto O",ACS nano,,434
371038,HOW CAN I SURVIVE THIS? Coping during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"South Africa had its first coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case on 06 March 2020 in an individual who travelled overseas. Since then, cases have constantly increased and the pandemic has taken a toll on the health system. This requires extra mobilisation of resources to curb the disease and overcome financial loses whilst providing social protection to the poor. Assessing the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system is critical to identify challenges and act timely to strike a balance between managing the emergency and maintaining essential health services. We applied the World Health Organization (WHO) health systems framework to assess the effects of COVID-19 on South African health system, and proposed solutions to address the gaps, with a focus on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and expanded programme on immunisation (EPI) programmes. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has direct impact on the health system, negatively affecting its functionality, as depletion of resources to curb the emergency is eminent. Diversion of health workforce, suspension of services, reduced health-seeking behaviour, unavailability of supplies, deterioration in data monitoring and funding crunches are some of the noted challenges. In such emergencies, the ability to deliver essential services is dependent on baseline capacity of health system. Our approach advocates for close collaboration between essential services and COVID-19 teams to identify priorities, restructure essential services to accommodate physical distancing, promote task shifting at primary level, optimise the use of mobile/web-based technologies for service delivery/training/monitoring and involve private sector and non-health departments to increase management capacity. Strategic responses thus planned can assist in mitigating the adverse effects of the pandemic whilst preventing morbidity and mortality from preventable diseases in the population.","Nyasulu, Juliet; Pandya, Himani",Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med,,434
371593,Clinical Evaluation of Locally Made Flocked Swabs in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Developing Country,2020,"Craniofacial reconstruction of critical bone defects typically requires a bone graft. As graft availability may be restricted by disease or co-morbidities, tissue engineering approaches are actively sought. The pericranium could provide new bone graft material. During development and repair, bone transitions through a chondrogenic phase. However, with tissue engineering pluripotent cells can differentiation directly into bone cells. Does ability to recapitulate bone formation in vitro affect osteogenesis and vascularization of pericranium grafts? To answer this, we obtained tissue from nine patients with pre-planned craniotomy surgery and studied 3D osteogenesis and angiogenesis of pericranium-derived spheroids. First, we established growth and differentiation conditions on Matrigel. For each spheroid sample we investigated a) continuous osteogenic differentiation (COD), and b) osteogenic differentiation preceded by chondrogenesis (CDï OD). The effect of VEGF was compared to VEGF supplemented with FGF, IL-1, IL-6, PDGF, and TNF-&#945;, a growth factor mix (GFM) with possible synergistic effects. In this limited sample we observed no age or sex-related differences in cell expansion. Similarly, no statistically significant differences in osteogenic or angiogenic scores between COD or CDï OD spheroids were noted with regular media. In COD however, VEGF statistically significantly increased angiogenesis compared to control media (p=0.007)). Also in COD, both VEGF and VEGF+GFM increased osteogenesis (p=0.047 and p=0.038, respectively). By contrast, in CDï OD neither VEGF nor VEGF+GFM yielded statistically significant angiogenesis or osteogenesis scores compared to control media. To understand these results we characterized spheroid protein expression by nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). Nine angiogenic proteins were either uniquely expressed or upregulated in COD compared to CDï OD: a) endothelial markers JUP, PTGIS, PTGS2, and TYMP, b) tissue remodeling factors CHI3L1 and MMP14, and c) metabolic pathways modulators ANGPTL4, ITGA5, and WNT5A. ANGPTL4, ITGA5, PTGIS, PTGS2, WNT5A define a conserved angiogenic network and were >2 fold increased in VEGF compared to VEGF+GFM. Finally, we examined bone formation on printable poly-(propylene-fumarate) (PPF) scaffolds for individualized grafting. Under COD+VEGF conditions, PPF scaffolds loaded with PDCs displayed hallmarks of spongiform-like bone formation. Thus, the human pericranium may be a potential repository for bone-generating cells with applications in craniofacial bone repair using tissue printing.","San-Marina, Serban; Prummer, Christopher; Voss, Stephen; Hunter, Danielle; Madden, Benjamin; Charlesworth, Mary Cristine; Ekbom, Dale; Janus, Jeffrey R",Tissue engineering.

375075,Geospatial Variability in Excess Death Rates during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Mexico: Examining Socio Demographic and Population Health Characteristics,2021,"Importance: Telehealth has emerged as a means of improving access and reducing cost for medical oncology care; however, use by specialists prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic still remained low. Medical oncology professionals' perceptions of telehealth for cancer care are largely unknown, but are critical to telehealth utilization and expansion efforts. Objective: To identify medical oncology health professionals' perceptions of the barriers to and benefits of telehealth video visits. Design, Setting, and Participants: This qualitative study used interviews conducted from October 30, 2019, to March 5, 2020, of medical oncology health professionals at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, an urban academic health system in the US with a cancer center. All medical oncology physicians, physicians assistants, and nurse practitioners at the hospital were eligible to participate. A combination of volunteer and convenience sampling was used, resulting in the participation of 29 medical oncology health professionals, including 20 physicians and 9 advanced practice professionals, in semistructured interviews. Main Outcomes and Measures: Medical oncology health professionals' perceptions of barriers to and benefits of telehealth video visits as experienced by patients receiving cancer treatment. Results: Of the 29 participants, 15 (52%) were women and 22 (76%) were White, with a mean (SD) age of 48.5 (12.0) years. Respondents' perceptions were organized using the 4 domains of the National Quality Forum framework: clinical effectiveness, patient experience, access to care, and financial impact. Respondents disagreed on the clinical effectiveness and potential limitations of the virtual physical examination, as well as on the financial impact on patients. Respondents also largely recognized the convenience and improved access to care enabled by telehealth for patients. However, many reported concern regarding the health professional-patient relationship and their limited ability to comfort patients in a virtual setting. Conclusions and Relevance: Medical oncology health professionals shared conflicting opinions regarding the barriers to and benefits of telehealth in regard to clinical effectiveness, patient experience, access to care, and financial impact. Understanding oncologists' perceptions of telehealth elucidates potential barriers that need to be further investigated or improved for telehealth expansion and continued utilization; further research is ongoing to assess current perceptions of health professionals and patients given the rapid expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Heyer, Arianna; Granberg, Rachel E; Rising, Kristin L; Binder, Adam F; Gentsch, Alexzandra T; Handley, Nathan R",JAMA Netw Open,,434

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: London North West Healthcare NHS Trust (LNWH). PARTICIPANTS: Patients tested and/or admitted for COVID-19 at LNWH during March and April 2020 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive and analytical epidemiology of demographic and clinical outcomes (intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation and mortality) of those who tested positive for COVID-19. RESULTS: The outbreak began in the first week of March 2020 and reached a peak by the end of March and first week of April. In the study period, 6183 tests were performed in on 4981 people. Of the 2086 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases, 1901 were admitted to hospital. Older age group, men and those of black or Asian minority ethnic (BAME) group were predominantly affected (p<0.05). These groups also had more severe infection resulting in ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation (p<0.05). However, in a multivariate analysis, only increasing age was independently associated with increased risk of death (p<0.05). Mortality rate was 26.9% in hospitalised patients. CONCLUSION: The findings confirm that men, BAME and older population were most commonly and severely affected groups. Only older age was independently associated with mortality.","Gopal Rao, Guduru; Allen, Alexander; Papineni, Padmasayee; Wang, Liyang; Anderson, Charlotte; McGregor, Alastair; Whittington, Ashley; John, Laurence; Harris, Miriam; Hiles, Stephen; Nicholas, Thomas; Adams, Katherine; Akbar, Ayesha; Blomquist, Paula; Decraene, Valerie; Patel, Bharat; Manuel, Rohini; Chow, Yimmy; Kuper, Martin",BMJ Open,,434

However, wearing cumbersome PPE may negatively affect their performance in life-saving procedures. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of wearing extensive PPE, including a powered air-purifying respirator with a loose-fitting hood or an N95 filtering facepiece respirator, on the first-pass success (FPS) rate of endotracheal intubation (ETI) in the emergency department (ED). This study was a single-center, observational before-and-after study of 934 adult (&#8805;18 years old) patients who underwent ETI in the academic ED. The study period was divided into a control period (from 20 January 2019, to 30 September 2019, and from 20 January 2018, to 30 September 2018) and an intervention period (from 20 January 2020, to 30 September 2020). Extensive PPE was not donned during the control period (control group, n = 687) but was donned during the intervention period (PPE group, n = 247). The primary outcome was the FPS rate. We used propensity score matching between the PPE and control groups to reduce potential confounding. Propensity score matching identified 247 cases in the PPE group and 492 cases in the control group. In the matched cohort, no significant difference was found in the FPS rate between the PPE and control groups (83.8% (n = 207) vs. 81.9% (n = 403); p = 0.522). In multivariable analysis, wearing PPE was not associated with the FPS rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-1.40; p = 0.629) after adjusting for the level of the intubator (junior resident, senior resident, or emergency medicine (EM) specialist). In conclusion, the FPS rate is not significantly affected by wearing extensive PPE in the ED.","Choi, Jeonghyun; Shin, Tae Gun; Park, Jong Eun; Lee, Gun Tak; Kim, Young Min; Lee, Soo Ah; Kim, Seonwoo; Hwang, Na Young; Hwang, Sung Yeon",,,434

METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were retrieved in a cohort of 146 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Potential risk factors for the development of severe COVID-19 were evaluated. RESULTS: On admission, lymphocytes, CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, eosinophils, and albumin and pre-albumin were dramatically lower, whereas neutrophils, and interleukin (IL)-10, C-reactive protein (CRP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were significantly higher in severe cases. By the second week after discharge, all variables improved to normal levels. Covariate logistic regression results showed that the CD8+ cell count and CRP level were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Lower peripheral immune cell subsets in patients with severe disease recovered to normal levels as early as the second week after discharge. CD8+ T cell counts and CRP levels on admission are independent predictive factors for severe COVID-19.","Jin, Xiao-Hong; Zhou, Hui-Li; Chen, Ling-Ling; Wang, Guan-Fu; Han, Qiu-Yue; Zhang, Jian-Gang; Zhang, Xia; Chen, Qiong-Yuan; Ye, Yao-Han; Lin, Aifen; Yan, Wei-Hua",Clin Immunol,,434

More than 7 million world population have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the number of deaths is increasing every day. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients with an acute respiratory infection (ARI). During an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 909 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonia, including 517 (56.9%) males and 392 (43.1%) females. All the collected samples were from different cities of Khuzestan province from 19 February to- 27 March 2020. The RNA was extracted from samples and subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2. Simultaneously, the computerized tomography (CT) scan was tested for the presence of ground-glass opacity in the lung among the patients. Of the total number of 909 specimens, 328 (36.08%) cases, including 185 (20.35%) females and 143 (15.73%) males, were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 while, 581 (63.9%) cases, including 374 (41.14%) males and 207 (22.77%) were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR (p=0.001).Four hundred sixteen (45.76%) cases were positive for ground-glass opacity in the lung by CT scan, while 328/909 (36.08%) trials proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the real-time PCR (p=0.003). In this study, 36.08% of patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although the results of positive cases by CT scan showed higher than real-time PCR, screening the SARS-COV-2 with a real-time PCR method is the first line of choice.","Abolnezhadian, Farhad; Makvandi, Manoochehr; Alavi, Seyed Mohammad; Azaran, Azarakhsh; Jalilian, Shahram; Rashno, Mohammad; Kaydani, Gholam Abbas; Arshadi, Maniya; Hosseinizadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Boostani, Hatam; Seyedian, Seyed Saeed; Moogahi, Sasan; Salmanzadeh, Shokrolah; Varnaseri, Mehran; Neisi, Niloofar; Keifarrokhi, Hooman; Shariati, Gholamreza; Amiri, Homayoun; Parsanahad, Mehdi; Nashibi, Roohangiz; Yousefi, Farid; Ahmadi, Fatemeh; AhmadiAngali, Kambiz",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,,434

METHODS: A comprehensive electronic literature search was done on PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Cochrane database, and SCOPUS for the published English language articles from December 1, 2019, to February 28, 2021. A meta-analysis of the proportion was expressed as a pooled proportion with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Representative forest plots showing individual studies and the combined effect size were generated to provide an overview of the results. RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed 15 published MIS-C studies with a total of 785 patients. Neurological manifestations in patients with MIS-C was found in 27.1%. We found that 27% developed headaches, 17.1% developed meningism/meningitis and 7.6 % developed encephalopathy. Other uncommon neurological manifestations of MIS-C includes anosmia, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, global proximal muscle weakness and bulbar palsy. In MIS-C patients with neurological feature, neuroimaging showed signal changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Electroencephalography showed slow wave pattern and nerve conduction studies and electromyography showed mild myopathic and neuropathic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that neurological manifestations are not uncommon in patients with MIS-C.

In this contribution we analyze the trends of the cases reported in all the Chinese provinces, as well as in some countries that, until March 15th, 2020, have more than 500 cases reported. Notably and differently from other epidemics, the provinces did not show an exponential phase. The data available at the Johns Hopkins University site seem to fit well an algebraic sub-exponential growing behavior as was pointed out recently. All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down with growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic was contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries like, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other European countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first countries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems to follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most affected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local case. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give interpretations and possible explanations for them.

Shortening spacer length could significantly enhance RNA-targeting efficiency of PspCas13b in mammalian cells compared to the natural length of 30 nucleotides without compromising multiplex targeting by a crRNA array. Our results demonstrate the potentials of applying PspCas13b RNP to suppress RNA virus infection, with implications in targeting host RNA as well.","Singsuksawat, Ekapot; Onnome, Suppachoke; Posiri, Pratsaneeyaporn; Suphatrakul, Amporn; Srisuk, Nittaya; Nantachokchawapan, Rapirat; Praneechit, Hansa; Sae-Kow, Chutimon; Chidpratum, Pala; Hongeng, Suradej; Avirutnan, Panisadee; Duangjinda, Thaneeya; Siridechadilok, Bunpote",,,434

Our study investigated the occupational and health conditions of anesthesiologists in a COVID-19 hub hospital in Latium, Italy. Ninety out of a total of 155 eligible workers (59%; male 48%) participated in the cross-sectional survey. Occupational stress was assessed with the Effort Reward Imbalance (ERI) questionnaire, organizational justice with the Colquitt Scale, insomnia with the Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), and mental health with the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS). A considerable percentage of workers (71.1%) reported high work-related stress, with an imbalance between high effort and low rewards. The level of perceived organizational justice was modest. Physical activity and meditation-the behaviors most commonly adopted to increase resilience-decreased. Workers also reported insomnia (36.7%), anxiety (27.8%), and depression (51.1%). The effort made for work was significantly correlated with the presence of depressive symptoms (r = 0.396). Anesthetists need to be in good health in order to ensure optimal care for COVID-19 patients. Their state of health can be improved by providing an increase in individual resources with interventions for better work organization.","Magnavita, Nicola; Soave, Paolo Maurizio; Ricciardi, Walter; Antonelli, Massimo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,434

382321,The COVID-19 Pandemic’s Impact on Religiosity in Poland,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis impacting population health and the economy. We describe a cost-effectiveness framework for evaluating acute treatments for hospitalized patients with COVID-19, considering a broad spectrum of potential treatment profiles and perspectives within the US healthcare system to ensure incorporation of the most relevant clinical parameters, given evidence currently available. METHODS: A lifetime model, with a short-term acute care decision tree followed by a post-discharge three-state Markov cohort model, was developed to estimate the impact of a potential treatment relative to best supportive care (BSC) for patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The model included information on costs and resources across inpatient levels of care, use of mechanical ventilation, post-discharge morbidity from ventilation, and lifetime healthcare and societal costs. Published literature informed clinical and treatment inputs, healthcare resource use, unit costs, and utilities. The potential health impacts and cost-effectiveness outcomes were assessed from US health payer, societal, and fee-for-service (FFS) payment model perspectives. RESULTS: Viewing results in aggregate, treatments that conferred at least a mortality benefit were likely to be cost-effective, as all deterministic and sensitivity analyses results fell far below willingness-to-pay thresholds using both a US health payer and FFS payment perspective, with and without societal costs included. In the base case, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) ranged from $22,933 from a health payer perspective using bundled payments to $8028 from a societal perspective using a FFS payment model. Even with conservative assumptions on societal impact, inclusion of societal costs consistently produced ICERs 40-60% lower than ICERs for the payer perspective. CONCLUSION: Effective COVID-19 treatments for hospitalized patients may not only reduce disease burden but also represent good value for the health system and society. Though data limitations remain, this cost-effectiveness framework expands beyond current models to include societal costs and post-discharge ventilation morbidity effects of potential COVID-19 treatments.","Sheinson, Daniel; Dang, Joseph; Shah, Anuj; Meng, Yang; Elsea, David; Kowal, Stacey",Adv Ther,,434

Our aim in this study is to assess the incidence of life-threatening complications like pneumothorax, haemothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema, probable risk factors and effect on mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ARDS patients treated with mechanical ventilation (MV). Data from 96 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 ARDS diagnosis from 11 March to 31 July 2020 were retrospectively assessed. A total of 75 patients abiding by the study criteria were divided into two groups as the group developing ventilator-related barotrauma (BG) (N = 10) and the group not developing ventilator-related barotrauma (NBG) (N = 65). In 10 patients (13%), barotrauma findings occurred 22 ± 3.6 days after the onset of symptoms. The mortality rate was 40% in the BG-group, while it was 29% in the NBG-group with no statistical difference identified. The BG-group had longer intensive care admission duration, duration of time in prone position and total MV duration, with higher max positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and lower min pO2/FiO2 levels. The peak lactate dehydrogenase levels in blood were higher by statistically significant level in the BG-group (P < 0.05). The contribution of MV to alveolar injury caused by infection in COVID-19 ARDS patients may cause more frequent barotrauma compared to classic ARDS and this situation significantly increases the MV and intensive care admission durations of patients. In terms of reducing mortality and morbidity in these patients, MV treatment should be carefully maintained within the framework of lung-protective strategies and the studies researching barotrauma pathophysiology should be increased.","Guven, Bulent Baris; Erturk, Tuna; Kompe, Özge; Ersoy, Aysin",Epidemiol Infect,,434

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (S-protein), which consists of trimeric polypeptide chains with glycosylated residues on the surface, triggers the virus entry into a host cell. Extensive structural and functional studies on this protein have rapidly advanced our understanding of the S-protein structure at atomic resolutions, although most of these structural studies overlook the effect of glycans attached to the S-protein on the conformational stability and functional motions between the inactive down and active up forms. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of both down and up forms of a fully glycosylated S-protein in solution as well as targeted molecular dynamics simulations between them to elucidate key interdomain interactions for stabilizing each form and inducing the large-scale conformational transitions. The residue-level interaction analysis of the simulation trajectories detects distinct amino acid residues and N-glycans as determinants on conformational stability of each form. During the conformational transitions between them, interdomain interactions mediated by glycosylated residues are switched to play key roles on the stabilization of another form. Electrostatic interactions, as well as hydrogen bonds between the three receptor binding domains, work as driving forces to initiate the conformational transitions toward the active form. This study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying conformational stability and functional motions of the S-protein, which are relevant for vaccine and antiviral drug developments.","Mori, Takaharu; Jung, Jaewoon; Kobayashi, Chigusa; Dokainish, Hisham M; Re, Suyong; Sugita, Yuji",Biophys. j,,434

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter prospective study, data on the intensity and type of pain were collected on 169 patients with active severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection at 2 teaching hospitals in the United States and Korea and on 8 patients with acute pain at another large teaching hospital between February 1, 2020, and June 15, 2020. RESULTS: Sixty-five of 169 patients (38.5%) reported an active pain condition. Among the 73 patients with pain, the most common pain symptoms were headache (n=22; 30.1%), chest pain (n=17; 23.3%), spinal pain (n=18; 24.7%), myalgia (n=13; 17.8%), abdominal or pelvic pain (n=13; 17.8%), arthralgia (n=11; 15.1%), and generalized pain (n=9; 12.3%). Those reporting headache as their main symptom were less likely to require ICU admission (P=.003). Acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed to 80.8% (n=59), opioids to 17.8% (n=13), adjuvants to 8.2% (n=6), and ketamine to 5.5% (n=4) of patients with pain. When age 65 years and older and sex were controlled for in multivariable analysis, the absence of pain was associated with ICU admission (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.42 to 6.28; P=.004) and death (odds ratio, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.40 to 9.76; P=.01). CONCLUSION: Acute pain is common during active COVID-19 infection with the most common manifestations being headache, chest pain and spine pain. Individuals without pain were more likely to require intensive care and expire than those with pain. Reasons why pain may be associated with reduced mortality include that an intense systemic stimulus (eg, respiratory distress) might distract pain perception or that the catecholamine surge associated with severe respiratory distress might attenuate nociceptive signaling.","Knox, Nigel; Lee, Chang-Soon; Moon, Jee Youn; Cohen, Steven P",Mayo Clin Proc,,434

However, almost all of the reported viral RdRp inhibitors (either repurposed drugs or new antiviral agents) lack selectivity against the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Herein, I discovered a new favipiravir derivative, (E)-N-(4-cyanobenzylidene)-6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (cyanorona-20), as the first potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor with very high selectivity (209- and 45-fold more potent than favipiravir and remdesivir, respectively). Based on the significant reduction in the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 replication/copies, strong computational cyanorona-20 ligand-RdRp protein interactions, and anti-RdRp activity of the parent favipiravir drug, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition is thought to be mediated through the coronaviral-2 RdRp inhibition. This promising selective anti-COVID-19 compound is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first bioactive derivative of favipiravir, the known antiinfluenza and antiviral drug. This new nucleoside analog was designed, synthesized, characterized, computationally studied (through pharmacokinetic calculations along with computational molecular modeling and prediction), and biologically evaluated for its anti-COVID-19 activities (through a validated in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay). The results of the biological assay showed that cyanorona-20 surprisingly exhibited very significant anti-COVID-19 activity (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC50 = 0.45 µM), and, in addition, it could be also a very promising lead compound for the design of new anti-COVID-19 agents. Cyanorona-20 is a new favipiravir derivative with promise for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We aimed to determine the incidence, association, and risk factors associated with development of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study at Dhaka Medical College Hospital between June 01, 2020 and August 10, 2020. All the enrolled patients were followed up for a month after clinical improvement, which was defined according the World Health Organization and Bangladesh guidelines as normal body temperature for successive 3 days, significant improvement in respiratory symptoms (respiratory rate <25/breath/minute with no dyspnea), and oxygen saturation >93% without assisted oxygen inhalation. FINDINGS: Among the 400 recruited patients, 355 patients were analyzed. In total, 46% patients developed post-COVID-19 symptoms, with post-viral fatigue being the most prevalent symptom in 70% cases. The post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with female gender (relative risk [RR]: 1.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.48, p = 0.03), those who required a prolonged time for clinical improvement (p<0.001), and those showing COVID-19 positivity after 14 days (RR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.00-1.19, p<0.001) of initial positivity. Patients with severe COVID-19 at presentation developed post-COVID-19 syndrome (p = 0.02). Patients with fever (RR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.05-2.27, p = 0.03), cough (RR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02-1.81, p = 0.04), respiratory distress (RR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.4-1.56, p = 0.001), and lethargy (RR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.06-1.35, p = 0.003) as the presenting features were associated with the development of the more susceptible to develop post COVID-19 syndrome than the others. Logistic regression analysis revealed female sex, respiratory distress, lethargy, and long duration of the disease as risk factors. CONCLUSION: Female sex, respiratory distress, lethargy, and long disease duration are critical risk factors for the development of post-COVID-19 syndrome.","Mahmud, Reaz; Rahman, Md Mujibur; Rassel, Mohammad Aftab; Monayem, Farhana Binte; Sayeed, S K Jakaria Been; Islam, Md Shahidul; Islam, Mohammed Monirul",PLoS One,,434
385854,"COVID 19-an overview on epidemiology, symptoms, prevention, management, treatment and role of health workers",2020,"Synthetic or natural derived cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are vastly investigated as tools for the intracellular delivery of membrane-impermeable molecules. As viruses are intracellular obligate parasites, viral originated CPPs have been considered as suitable intracellular shuttling vectors for cargo transportation. A total of 310 CPPs were identified in the proteome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Screening the proteome of the cause of COVID-19 reveals that SARS-CoV-2 CPPs (SCV2-CPPs) span the regions involved in replication, protein-nucleotide and protein-protein interaction, protein-metal ion interaction, and stabilization of homo/hetero-oligomers. However, to find the most appropriate peptides as drug delivery vectors, one might face several hurdles. Computational analyses showed that 94.3% of the identified SCV2-CPPs are non-toxins, and 38% are neither antigenic nor allergenic. Interestingly, 36.70% of SCV2-CPPs were resistant to all four groups of protease families. Nearly 1/3 of SCV2-CPPs had sufficient inherent or induced helix and sheet conformation leading to increased uptake efficiency. Heliquest lipid-binding discrimination factor revealed that 44.30% of the helical SCV2-CPPs are lipid-binding helices. Although Cys-rich derived CPPs of helicase (NSP13) can potentially fold into a cyclic conformation in endosomes with a higher rate of endosomal release, the most optimal SCV2-CPP candidates as vectors for drug delivery were SCV2-CPP118, SCV2-CPP119, SCV2-CPP122, and SCV2-CPP129 of NSP12 (RdRp). Ten experimentally validated viral-derived CPPs were also used as the positive control to check the scalability and reliability of our protocol in SCV2-CPP retrieval. Some peptides with a cell-penetration ability known as bioactive peptides are adopted as biotherapeutics themselves. Therefore, 59.60%, 29.63%, and 32.32% of SCV2-CPPs were identified as potential antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungals, respectively.

386421,The Effect of “Wuhan Closure” on the COVID-19 Pandemic in China,2021,"Coastal communities in regions like the Pacific have been impacted by COVID-19 related public health measures that limit the movement of people, trade and access to resources. In disaster-prone countries, like Vanuatu, such measures add to existing pressures on coastal communities' adaptive capacity. To understand how coastal communities in Vanuatu were impacted in the immediate period after COVID-19 measures were placed, and how people responded to the changing circumstances, a rapid appraisal survey was carried out following a nationally declared state of emergency in March 2020. Results reveal changes in village population, loss of cash income, difficulties in accessing food and shifting pressures on particular resources and habitats. The findings provide insights into the ways local adaptive capacity to satisfy livelihood and food security needs differed among rural contexts. From this we argue that broad quantitative impact assessments are important in guiding strategic and longer term responses and adaptations, but that these are made more useful when complemented with qualitative insights on people and place in the short-term.","Steenbergen, D J; Neihapi, P T; Koran, D; Sami, A; Malverus, V; Ephraim, R; Andrew, N",Mar Policy,,434

The inflammatory pathways in which IL-6 is involved are also partly responsible of the development and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), opening interesting perspectives in terms of therapy. Anti-IL-6 drugs are being used with variable degrees of success in other diseases and are being tested in RA. Results have been encouraging, particularly when anti-IL-6 has been used with other drugs, such as metothrexate (MTX). In this review we discuss the main immunologic aspects that make anti-IL-6 a good candidate in RA, but despite the main therapeutic options available to target IL-6, no gold standard treatment has been established so far.","Pandolfi, Franco; Franza, Laura; Carusi, Valentina; Altamura, Simona; Andriollo, Gloria; Nucera, Eleonora",,,434

DESIGN: Analysis of cross-sectional data from Phase 1 (April 23 - July 21, 2020) of the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey, a weekly national online survey. SETTING: California, and three Californian Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), including San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSAs. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18 years and older living in households. RESULTS: Among the three metropolitan areas, food insufficiency rates were lowest in the San Francisco-Oakland-Berkeley MSA. Measures of disadvantage (e.g. having low-income, being unemployed, recent loss of employment, and pre-pandemic food insufficiency) were widely associated with household food insufficiency. However, disadvantaged households in the San Francisco Bay Area, the area with the lowest poverty and unemployment rates, were more likely to be food insufficient compared to those in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim and Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario MSAs. CONCLUSIONS: Food insufficiency risk among disadvantaged households differed by region. To be effective, governmental response to food insufficiency must address the varied local circumstances that contribute to these disparities.","Blumenberg, E.; Pinski, M.; Nhan, L. A.; Wang, M.

389066,"Distant learning of BLS amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Influence of the outbreak on lay trainees' willingness to attempt CPR, and the motivating effect of the training",2020,"Based on harmonized census data from 81 countries, we estimate how age and coresidence patterns shape the vulnerability of countries' populations to outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We estimate variation in deaths arising due to a simulated random infection of 10% of the population living in private households and subsequent within-household transmission of the virus. The age structures of European and North American countries increase their vulnerability to COVID-related deaths in general. The coresidence patterns of elderly persons in Africa and parts of Asia increase these countries' vulnerability to deaths induced by within-household transmission of COVID-19. Southern European countries, which have aged populations and relatively high levels of intergenerational coresidence, are, all else equal, the most vulnerable to outbreaks of COVID-19. In a second step, we estimate to what extent avoiding primary infections for specific age groups would prevent subsequent deaths due to within-household transmission of the virus. Preventing primary infections among the elderly is the most effective in countries with small households and little intergenerational coresidence, such as France, whereas confining younger age groups can have a greater impact in countries with large and intergenerational households, such as Bangladesh.","Esteve, Albert; Permanyer, Iñaki; Boertien, Diederik; Vaupel, James W",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,434

The questionnaire was designed in English language and included a set of 44 multiple-choice close-ended questions that covered demographic profile of participants, awareness of symptoms and practice against COVID-19. It also included a set of questions that attempted to investigate the attitudes and perceptions towards the uptake of vaccine. Out of the total 186 who participated in this study, 48.4% were 24 years old or younger and 55.9% were health field students. The results showed that majority of participants were aware of most common symptoms and causes of COVID-19 and had positive attitude toward the protective measures against the disease. Regarding the acceptability of vaccination against COVID-19, around 44% of the total participants showed hesitancy to uptake the vaccine of whom, 68.3% were concerned about the adverse effects of the vaccine. Significant differences were found between gender and current position at university of Jeddah in term of vaccine acceptance with p-values of &lt; 0.001. Despite this high level of awareness, health field community at the university of Jeddah have medium acceptance level of disease vaccine. Thus, health educational programs are important to increase the acceptance level among such societies which will contribute to increase the acceptance level among the whole society.

389210,World trade organization’s export-oriented compulsory licensing mechanism: Foreseen policy concern for Africa to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID 19 in December 2019 spread quickly and overwhelmed the local healthcare system of the epicenter. A total of 346 medical assistance teams with 42,600 reserve medics were mobilized from around the country for emergency assistance. This study aims to examine the incidence of mental health symptoms and predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) symptoms among the reserve medics working in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province. METHODS: An anonymous survey was conducted from April 4-6, 2020 among the medics upon their returning home. A total of 225 surveys were returned with a response rate of 83%. The survey consisted of questionnaires about the medics' demographic information, social relations, mental health status (e.g. IES-R and DASS-21) and other work-related information. Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test and hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: During the stay in Wuhan, the medics experienced high levels of depression (46.7%), anxiety (35.6%) and stress symptoms (16.0%). Upon returning home, the overall prevalence of clinically concerned PTSD symptoms was as high as 31.6%. Further analyses revealed that PTSD symptoms and its subscales were significantly associated with age, collegial relationship and mental health status during their service. CONCLUSION: The reserve medics reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress as well as clinically concerned PTSD symptoms. Comprehensive screening and intervention programs should be in place to help reserve medics cope with mental health challenges and build resilience during the COVID 19 pandemic.","Li, Xueyuan; Li, Shijian; Xiang, Mi; Fang, Yue; Qian, Kun; Xu, Jiawei; Li, Jiahui; Zhang, Zhiruo; Wang, Bing",J Psychosom Res,,434

SEM) This procedure was preferred for three reasons: the exploratory nature of complex models, the predictive orientation of models, and the measurement of multiple variables with one-item questioning Results Three predictors out of 16 tested had a positive relationship to the frequency of positive experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being - subjectively assessed health, personal belief in a just world, and a positive reappraisal;rumination was in a negative relationship Six predictors were related to the frequency of negative experiencing as an affective component of subjective well-being and to symptoms of depression -

The COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) is a cross-sectional multicountry study that collected data on higher-education students during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020. The dataset allows description of: (1) living conditions, financial conditions, and academic workload before and during the COVID-19 outbreak; (2) the current level of mental well-being and effects on healthy lifestyles; (3) perceived stressors; (4) resources (e.g., social support and economic capital); (5) knowledge related to COVID-19; and (6) attitudes toward COVID-19 measures implemented by the government and relevant HEI. The dataset additionally includes information about COVID-19 measures taken by the government and HEI that were in place during the period of data collection. The collected data provide a comprehensive and comparative dataset on student well-being. In this article, we present the rationale for this study, the development and content of the survey, the methodology of data collection and sampling, and the limitations of the study. In addition, we highlight the opportunities that the dataset provides for advancing social science research on student well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in varying policy contexts. Thus far, this is, to our knowledge, the first cross-country student well-being survey during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a unique dataset that enables high-priority socially relevant research.","Van de Velde, Sarah; Buffel, Veerle; Bracke, Piet; Van Hal, Guido; Somogyi, Nikolett M; Willems, Barbara; Wouters, Edwin",Scand J Public Health,,434

To do this, it calls for the fortification of the traditional course of study that introduces students to the analysis of literary texts. However, a traditional approach to school-based literary analysis that attends exclusively to a text's formal properties in order to determine its meaning is insufficient to get ahead of the world risk curve. Instead, the article turns to the concept of allegory as theorized in curriculum theory and to a theory of preventative foresight to interpret a famous dream (of a world-shattering contagion) in a famous work of literature (Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment) that provides a novel opportunity to understand the significance of sense in the time of plagues.","Spector, Hannah",Prospects (Paris),,434

Entanglement between inflammation and coagulation and resistance to heparin provide a rationale to consider other therapeutic approaches in order to preserve endothelial function and limit microthrombosis, especially in severe forms. These strategies include nebulized heparin, N-acetylcysteine, plasma exchange and/or fresh frozen plasma, plasma derivatives to increase the level of endogenous anticoagulants (tissue factor pathway inhibitor, activated protein C, thrombomodulin, antithrombin), dipyridamole, complement blockers, different types of stem cells, and extracellular vesicles.

Approximately one hour before this episode, she was almost fine but in a slightly worse humor than usual. On arrival at our hospital, sever acidosis but no clear sign of inflammatory response was denoted. A chest computed tomography scan showed weak consolidations in the upper right lung as well as atelectasis in the lower left lung. No sign of congenital heart disease or cardiomyopathy was observed in echocardiography, and no significant arrhythmia was observed in the later clinical course.

This is quite similar to that observed in the autoimmune and chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It was hypothesized that RA patients are at a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19; however, recent studies reported that they are not when compared to the rest of the population. In this review, we aim to highlight the mutual pathological features, cytokine profiles and risk factors between COVID-19 and RA. Also, many researchers are currently working to explore therapeutic agents that could aid in the eradication of COVID-19 infection. Due to the similarity between the inflammation status in COVID-19 and RA, many anti-rheumatic drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, baricitinib and anakinra were proposed to be therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 infection.","Elemam, Noha Mousaad; Maghazachi, Azzam A; Hannawi, Suad",Curr Med Res Opin,,434
393034,Mozambican Adolescents and Youths during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Knowledge and Awareness Gaps in the Provinces of Sofala and Tete,2021,"BACKGROUND: Authorities in Somalia responded with drastic measures after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in mid-March 2020, closing borders, schools, limiting travel and prohibiting most group functions. However, the impact of the pandemic in Somalia thereafter remained unclear. This study employs a novel remote qualitative research method in a conflict-affected setting to look at how some of the most at-risk internally displaced and host populations were impacted by COVID-19, what determined their responses, and how this affected their health and socio-economic vulnerability. METHODS: We conducted a remote qualitative study, using Katikati, a 1-to-1 conversation management and analysis platform using short message service (SMS) developed by Lark Systems with Africa's Voices Foundation (AVF), for semi-structured interviews over three months with participants in Mogadishu and Baidoa. We recruited a gender balanced cohort across age groups, and used an analytical framework on the social determinants of health for a narrative analysis on major themes discussed, triangulating data with existing peer-reviewed and grey literature. RESULTS: The remote research approach demonstrated efficacy in sustaining trusted and meaningful conversations for gathering qualitative data from hard-to-reach conflict-affected communities. The major themes discussed by the 35 participants included health, livelihoods and education. Two participants contracted the disease, while others reported family or community members affected by COVID-19. Almost all participants faced a loss of income and/or education, primarily as a result of the strict public health measures. Some of those who were heavily affected economically but did not directly experienced disease, denied the pandemic. Religion played an important role in participants' beliefs in protection against and salvation from the disease. As lockdowns were lifted in August 2020, many believed the pandemic to be over. CONCLUSIONS: While the official COVID-19 burden has remained relatively low in Somalia, the impact to people's daily lives, income and livelihoods due to public health responses, has been significant. Participants describe those 'secondary' outcomes as the main impact of the pandemic, serving as a stark reminder of the need to broaden the public health response beyond disease prevention to include social and economic interventions to decrease people's vulnerability to future shocks.","Braam, D.

393523,Social Isolation During COVID-19 Pandemic. Perceived Stress and Containment Measures Compliance Among Polish and Italian Residents,2021,"The rapid finding of effective therapeutics requires the efficient use of available resources in clinical trials. The use of covariate adjustment can yield statistical estimates with improved precision, resulting in a reduction in the number of participants required to draw futility or efficacy conclusions. We focus on time-to-event and ordinal outcomes. A key question for covariate adjustment in randomized studies is how to fit a model relating the outcome and the baseline covariates to maximize precision. We present a novel theoretical result establishing conditions for asymptotic normality of a variety of covariate-adjusted estimators that rely on machine learning (e.g., l1-regularization, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines), under the assumption that outcome data is missing completely at random. We further present a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance. Importantly, the conditions do not require the machine learning methods to converge to the true outcome distribution conditional on baseline variables, as long as they converge to some (possibly incorrect) limit. We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned prediction methods in COVID-19 trials using longitudinal data from over 1,500 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 at Weill Cornell Medicine New York Presbyterian Hospital. We found that using l1-regularization led to estimators and corresponding hypothesis tests that control type 1 error and are more precise than an unadjusted estimator across all sample sizes tested. We also show that when covariates are not prognostic of the outcome, l1-regularization remains as precise as the unadjusted estimator, even at small sample sizes (n = 100). We give an R package adjrct that performs model-robust covariate adjustment for ordinal and time-to-event outcomes.","Williams, Nicholas; Rosenblum, Michael; D'iaz, Iv'an",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.04294v1.pdf,434

Within this context, the ability of pain specialists to accurately diagnose and plan appropriate interventional spine procedures based entirely on telemedicine visits, without an in-person evaluation, remains to be established. In this study, our primary objective was to assess the relevance of telemedicine to interventional spine procedure planning by determining whether procedure plans established solely from virtual visits changed following in-person evaluation. METHODS: We reviewed virtual and in-person clinical encounters from our academic health system's 10 interventional spine specialists. We included patients who were seen exclusively via telemedicine encounters and indicated for an interventional procedure with documented procedural plans. Virtual plans were then compared with the actual procedures performed following in-person evaluation. Demographic data as well as the type and extent of physical examination performed by the interventional spine specialist were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 87 new patients included, the mean age was 60 years (SE 1.4 years) and the preprocedural plan established by telemedicine, primarily videoconferencing, did not change for 76 individuals (87%; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94) following in-person evaluation. Based on the size of our sample, interventional procedures indicated solely during telemedicine encounters may be accurate in 79%-94% of cases in the broader population. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that telemedicine evaluations are a generally accurate means of preprocedural assessment and development of interventional spine procedure plans. These findings clearly demonstrate the capabilities of telemedicine for evaluating spine patients and planning interventional spine procedures.","Crawford, Alexander M; Lightsey, Harry M; Xiong, Grace X; Striano, Brendan M; Greene, Nattaly; Schoenfeld, Andrew J; Simpson, Andrew K",Reg Anesth Pain Med,,434

The initial presentation of the disease in symptomatic patients is invariably respiratory, with dry cough being the main symptom, but an increasing number of reports reveal multiple organ involvement. The aim of this review is to summarise the potential role of the renin-angiotensin system activated phagocytes in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Data for this review were identified by searches of PubMed, and references from relevant articles using the search terms ""SARS"", ""COVID-19"", ""renin-angiotensin-system"", ""phagocyte"", ""reactive free radical"", ""antioxidant"", ""ARDS"", ""thrombosis"", ""myocardial"", ""ischaemia"", ""reperfusion"", ""microvascular"", and ""ACE2"". Abstracts and reports from meetings were not included in this work. Only articles published in English between 1976 and 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: The cellular target of SARS viruses is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a critical regulating protein in the renin-angiotensin system. The elimination of this enzyme by the viral spike protein results in excessive activation of phagocytes, migration into the tissues via the high endothelial venules, and an oxidative burst. In the case of an over-stimulated host immune response, not only devastating respiratory symptoms, but even systemic or multiorgan involvement may be observed. CONCLUSION: Early-stage medical interventions may assist in returning the exaggerated immune response to a normal range; however, some therapeutic delay might result in excessive tissue damages, occasionally mimicking a systemic disease with a detrimental outcome.","Göbölös, Laszlo; Rácz, István; Hogan, Maurice; Remsey-Semmelweis, Erno; Atallah, Bassam; AlMahmeed, Wael; AlSindi, Fahad; Suri, Rakesh M; Bhatnagar, Gopal; Tuzcu, Emin Murat",J. vasc. surg,,434

This increase in patient demand and potential for provider shortages is particularly apparent for palliative medicine, where there are already shortages in the provision of this care. In response to the developing pandemic, our Geriatrics and Palliative (GAP) Medicine team formulated a 2-team approach which includes triage algorithms for palliative consults as well as acute symptomatic management for both patients diagnosed with or under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19. These algorithms provided a delineated set of guidelines to triage patients in need of palliative services and included provisions for acute symptoms management and the protection of both the patient care team and the families of patients with COVID-19. These guidelines helped with streamlining care in times of crisis, providing care to those in need, supporting frontline staff with primary-level palliative care, and minimizing the GAP team's risk of infection and burnout during the rapidly changing pandemic response.","Lopez, Santiago; Decastro, Gene; Van Ogtrop, Katlynn M; Weiss-Domis, Sindee; Anandan, Samuel R; Magalee, Christopher J; Roofeh, Regina; Liberman, Tara A",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,,434

DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Global Health, Cochrane, PsycINFO, PsychExtra, Web of Science and Scopus were searched for any paper from 2019 onwards that focused on the mental health impact of COVID-19 on imprisoned people and prison staff. A grey literature search focused on international and government sources and professional bodies representing healthcare, public health and prison staff was also performed. We also performed hand searching of the reference lists of included studies. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF STUDIES: All papers, regardless of study design, were included if they examined the mental health of imprisoned people or prison staff specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Imprisoned people could be of any age and from any countries. All languages were included. Two independent reviewers quality assessed appropriate papers. RESULTS: Of 647 articles found, 83 were eligible for inclusion, the majority (58%) of which were opinion pieces. The articles focused on the challenges to prisoner mental health. Fear of COVID-19, the impact of isolation, discontinuation of prison visits and reduced mental health services were all likely to have an adverse effect on the mental well-being of imprisoned people. The limited research and poor quality of articles included mean that the findings are not conclusive. However, they suggest a significant adverse impact on the mental health and well-being of those who live and work in prisons. CONCLUSIONS: It is key to address the mental health impacts of the pandemic on people who live and work in prisons. These findings are discussed in terms of implications for getting the balance between infection control imperatives and the fundamental human rights of prison populations.","Johnson, Luke; Gutridge, Kerry; Parkes, Julie; Roy, Anjana; Plugge, Emma",BMJ Open,,434
398540,"COVID-19 Pandemic, Transparency, and ""Polidemic"" in the Republic of Korea",2021,"The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global lockdown with severe health and economical consequences. As a result, authorities around the globe have expressed their needs for better tools to monitor the spread of the virus and to support human labor. Researchers and technology companies such as Google and Apple have offered to develop such tools in the form of contact tracing applications. The goal of these applications is to continuously track people's proximity and to make the smartphone users aware if they have ever been in contact with positively diagnosed people, so that they could self-quarantine and possibly have an infection test. A fundamental challenge with these smartphone-based contact tracing technologies is to ensure the security and privacy of their users. Moving from manual to smartphone-based contact tracing creates new cyber risks that could suddenly affect the entire population. Major risks include for example the abuse of the people's private data by companies and/or authorities, or the spreading of wrong alerts by malicious users in order to force individuals to go into quarantine. In April 2020, the Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) was announced with the goal to develop and evaluate secure solutions for European countries. However, after a while, several team members left this consortium and created DP-3T which has led to an international debate among the experts. At this time, it is confusing for the non-expert to follow this debate; this report aims to shed light on the various proposed technologies by providing an objective assessment of the cybersecurity and privacy risks. We first review the state-of-the-art in digital contact tracing technologies and then explore the risk-utility trade-offs of the techniques proposed for COVID-19.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight hundred and twelve medical workers took part in a cross-sectional Internet survey. The questionnaire included a socio-demographic block, a block of questionnaires for assessing the level of symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The data were processed using statistical methods. RESULTS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare providers during the pandemic was 48.77% and 57.63% respectively. Subjectively poor quality of sleep was noted by 37.4% of respondents. Cluster analysis distinguished 4 groups of respondents: group 1 was characterized by high scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a low subjective assessment of sleep quality; group 2 had low scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a high subjective assessment of sleep quality; respondents from clusters 3 and 4 had average total scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7, however, group 4 was characterized by significantly lower values of subjective sleep quality assessment. CONCLUSION: The division into clusters makes it possible to understand which groups of medical workers require psychological (psychotherapeutic) support in the first place. Cluster 1 respondents with high levels of anxiety and depression, as well as poor sleep quality, need priority assistance.","Bachilo, E V; Novikov, D E; Efremov, A A",Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova,,434

There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing ""trained"" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in COVID-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with MMR in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to COVID-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with MMR in high-risk populations may provide a ""low-risk-high-reward"" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.","Fidel, Paul L; Noverr, Mairi C",mBio (Online),,434

400636,"‘No one understands what we go through’: self-identification of health risks by women sanitation workers in Pune, India during the COVID-19 pandemic",2021,"BACKGROUND: Often the first opportunity for clinicians to assess risk of preterm birth is when women present with threatened preterm labour symptoms (such as period-like pain, tightening's or back ache). However, threatened preterm labour symptoms are not a strong predictor of imminent birth. Clinicians are then faced with a complex clinical dilemma, the need to ameliorate the consequences of preterm birth requires consideration with the side-effects and costs. The QUiPP app is a validated app which can aid clinicians when they triage a women who is in threatened preterm labour. AIM: Our aim was to produce a toolkit to promote a best practice pathway for women who arrive in threatened preterm labour. METHODS: We worked with two hospitals in South London. This included the aid of a toolkit midwife at each hospital. We also undertook stakeholder focus groups and worked with two Maternity Voice Partnership groups to ensure a diverse range of voices was heard in the toolkit development. While we aimed to produce the toolkit in September 2020, we rapidly rolled out and produced the first version of the toolkit in April 2020 due to COVID-19. As the QUiPP app can reduce admissions and hospital transfers, there was a need to enable all hospitals in England to have access to the toolkit as soon as possible. RESULTS: While the rapid rollout of The QUiPP App Toolkit due to COVID-19 was not planned, it has demonstrated that toolkits to improve clinical practice can be produced promptly. Through actively welcoming continued feedback meant the initial version of the toolkit could be continually and iteratively refined. The toolkit has been recommended nationally, with National Health Service England recommending the app and toolkit in their COVID-19 update to the Saving Babies Lives Care Bundle and in the British Association of Perinatal Medicine Antenatal Optimisation Toolkit.","Carlisle, Naomi; Watson, Helena A; Shennan, Andrew H",,,434
400687,Refugee and migrant health in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: assessment tool for response at municipal level in the WHO European Region,2020,"Introduction: in order to curb the increasing spread of COVID-19 amongst health care workers (HCWs), the World Health Organization (WHO) released the COVID-19 Rights, Roles and Responsibilities of Health workers (COVID-19 RRRHW) policy document aimed at protecting HCWs amidst the on-going pandemic. This study determined the level of implementation of the document in a tertiary hospital in Southwest Nigeria. Methods: this was a cross-sectional descriptive study among HCWs in a tertiary hospital in South-western Nigeria that assessed the level of implementation of the WHO COVID-19 RRRHW document using a closed ended structured questionnaire. Results: five hundred and thirty-five HCWs participated in the study comprising 165(30.8%) males and 370(69.2%) females. Majority (87.3%) of the HCWs were 40 years and below. One hundred and sixty-three (30.5%) of the HCWs had been involved in the care of COVID-19 patients; less than 60% of the respondents were aware of the presence of an official platform for dissemination of information on suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 435(81.3%) were aware of hospital training on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC); 191(35.7%) have had uninterrupted supplies of personal protective equipment(PPE) and IPC materials; 211(39.4%) were aware of mental and counselling services in the hospital while only 106(19.8%) knew how to access these services; 289(54%) have attended IPC training and 307(57.4%) are able to don and doff PPE. Conclusion: this study showed inadequate implementation of the WHO COVID-19 RRRHW document. There is urgent need for all stakeholders to familiarize with the document in order to ensure adequate protection of HCWs and minimize their risk of contracting COVID-19.","Adejumo, Oluseyi Ademola; Adejumo, Oludamilola Adebola; Egbi, Oghenekaro Godwin; Abolarin, Olatunji Sunday; Alli, Oladimeji Emmanuel",Pan Afr Med J,,434

(Special edition for COVID-19.)",2020,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating and life-threatening syndrome that results in high morbidity and mortality. Current pharmacologic treatments and mechanical ventilation have limited value in targeting the underlying pathophysiology of ARDS. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown potent therapeutic advantages in experimental and clinical trials through direct cell-to-cell interaction and paracrine signaling. However, safety concerns and the indeterminate effects of MSCs have resulted in the investigation of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) due to their low immunogenicity and tumorigenicity. Over the past decades, soluble proteins, microRNAs, and organelles packaged in EVs have been identified as efficacious molecules to orchestrate nearby immune responses, which attenuate acute lung injury by facilitating pulmonary epithelium repair, reducing acute inflammation, and restoring pulmonary vascular leakage. Even though MSC-EVs possess similar bio-functional effects to their parental cells, there remains existing barriers to employing this alternative from bench to bedside. Here, we summarize the current established research in respect of molecular mechanisms of MSC-EV effects in ARDS and highlight the future challenges of MSC-EVs for clinical application.","Su, Yue; Guo, Haiyan; Liu, Qinghua",J Leukoc Biol,,434
401423,Comparison of air pollutants and their health effects in two developed regions in China during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization considers coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a public emergency threatening global health. During the crisis, the public's need for web-based information and communication is a subject of focus. Digital inequality research has shown that internet access is not evenly distributed among the general population. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide a timely understanding of how different people use the internet to meet their information and communication needs and the outcomes they gain from their internet use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also sought to reveal the extent to which gender, age, personality, health, literacy, education, economic and social resources, internet attitude, material access, internet access, and internet skills remain important factors in obtaining internet outcomes after people engage in the corresponding uses. METHODS: We used a web-based survey to draw upon a sample collected in the Netherlands. We obtained a dataset with 1733 respondents older than 18 years. RESULTS: Men are more likely to engage in COVID-19-related communication uses. Age is positively related to COVID-19-related information uses and negatively related to information and communication outcomes. Agreeableness is negatively related to both outcomes and to information uses. Neuroticism is positively related to both uses and to communication outcomes. Conscientiousness is not related to any of the uses or outcomes. Introversion is negatively related to communication outcomes. Finally, openness relates positively to all information uses and to both outcomes. Physical health has negative relationships with both outcomes. Health perception contributes positively to information uses and both outcomes. Traditional literacy has a positive relationship with information uses and both outcomes. Education has a positive relationship with information and communication uses. Economic and social resources played no roles. Internet attitude is positively related to information uses and outcomes but negatively related to communication uses and outcomes. Material access and internet access contributed to all uses and outcomes. Finally, several of the indicators and outcomes became insignificant after accounting for engagement in internet uses. CONCLUSIONS: Digital inequality is a major concern among national and international scholars and policy makers. This contribution aimed to provide a broader understanding in the case of a major health pandemic by using the ongoing COVID-19 crisis as a context for empirical work. Several groups of people were identified as vulnerable, such as older people, less educated people, and people with physical health problems, low literacy levels, or low levels of internet skills. Generally, people who are already relatively advantaged are more likely to use the information and communication opportunities provided by the internet to their benefit in a health pandemic, while less advantaged individuals are less likely to benefit. Therefore, the COVID-19 crisis is also enforcing existing inequalities.","van Deursen, Alexander Jam",J Med Internet Res,,434

402305,Asian American Trainees During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Adequate preparation and support for healthcare workers (HCWs) managing high-consequence infectious diseases (HCIDs) is critical to the overall clinical management of HCIDs. Qualitative studies examining how well prepared and supported HCWs feel are lacking despite their key role. This study investigated how prepared and supported front-line HCWs at an Australian tertiary hospital felt about managing HCIDs such as viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used to undertake interviews with 45 Royal Melbourne Hospital medical and nursing staff from emergency, intensive care and infectious diseases. Interview questions captured data on HCWs' role, familiarity with using protocols, psychological attributes and training for scenarios related to VHF patient management. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Categorical responses were analysed quantitatively and open-ended responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants indicated feeling capable of undertaking their role in managing VHF patients; 77% felt supported through personnel/resources. However, 69% indicated barriers to managing these patients effectively; and 68% felt anxious at the prospect of managing VHF patients. Themes emerging from participants' observations included concerns about training frequency, miscommunication, difficulty with uncertainty, feeling underprepared, and fear of transmitting infection to others. CONCLUSION: Although the majority of HCWs feel confident about their ability to care for VHF patients, they also have a moderately-high degree of anxiety. Perceptions of interviewed staff have fed into recommendations to increase HCW preparedness and reduce anxiety, which include investigating support services, and exploring training options that create multi-departmental groups of highly specialised medical officers and nurses.","Fryk, Jesse J; Tong, Steven; Marshall, Caroline; Rajkhowa, Arjun; Buising, Kirsty; MacIsaac, Christopher; Walsham, Nicola; Thevarajan, Irani",Infect.

402438,Adapting ambulatory care learning environments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The news recommender systems are marked by a few unique challenges specific to the news domain. These challenges emerge from rapidly evolving readers' interests over dynamically generated news items that continuously change over time. News reading is also driven by a blend of a reader's long-term and short-term interests. In addition, diversity is required in a news recommender system, not only to keep the reader engaged in the reading process but to get them exposed to different views and opinions. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network that jointly learns informative news and readers' interests into a unified framework. We learn the news representation (features) from the headlines, snippets (body) and taxonomy (category, subcategory) of news. We learn a reader's long-term interests from the reader's click history, short-term interests from the recent clicks via LSTMSs and the diversified reader's interests through the attention mechanism. We also apply different levels of attention to our model. We conduct extensive experiments on two news datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","Raza, Shaina; Ding, Chen",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08458v2.pdf,434

Formatted by the school and all forms of education to accommodate themselves into a competitive, individualistic world, they acutely suffer the consequences of the current collapses, climatic and institutional. Many of them are falling into conditions of extreme misery and deprivation. Even those in better conditions, with a guaranteed income and a good job, are affected by the current plague, as isolation and divisiveness rage violently around them, driven by Global Fear. It is a divisiveness of ancient hatreds converging with modern ones, feeding their capacities for despair. We ask: how to heal from these illnesses exacerbated by COVID-19 times? This essay explores hospitality as the antidote to globalized fear. It explores the art of organizing hope, drawing upon the courageous autonomous efforts of BIPOC around the world. Through acts of radical hospitality, flowering into friendship, ways of embracing radical differences are revealed, warmly and kindly hosting the otherness of the other.

403776,Consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on global maritime trade industry,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, many elementary, middle, and high schools made an emergency transition to online learning. Students have faced numerous access issues during this time, but little is known about how well students with disabilities can access online course content. Many teachers are unfamiliar with adapting, developing, and creating accessible online course content and there is scant research on younger students' experiences with accessible online course content and platforms. Previous research, however, provides insights on how to identify and address challenges that students with disabilities face when accessing online learning in institutions of higher education. In this paper, we review and analyze 14 papers published in the past 11 years on e-learning accessibility to translate insights into actionable recommendations to improve the accessibility of platforms at the time of the COVID-19 crisis, as well as future pandemics. Based on the reviewed research, we present several recommendations including building organizational cultures of accessibility with support for educators as accessible content creators and increased awareness of the many types of disabilities that may affect students and how accessible content can prevent increasing opportunity gaps. Although emergency online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic will likely and hopefully end in the near future, the lessons learned should continue to inform future improvements in accessible education for all learners. © 2021 ACM.","Russ, S.; Hamidi, F.","18th International Web for All Conference, W4A 2021",,434

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey of physician members of Pediatric Emergency Research Canada and the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians explored: personal safety/responsibility to care; patient interactions; ethical issues in pandemic care; institutional dynamics and communication practices. Data analysis was descriptive: categorical data were summarised with frequency distributions, continuous data [100 mm visual analog scales (VAS)] were analysed using measures of central tendency. Short open-ended items were coded to identify frequencies of responses. RESULTS: From June 29 to July 29, 2020, 187 respondents (13% response rate) completed the survey: 39% were from Ontario and 20% from Quebec, trained in general (50%) or pediatric (37%) emergency medicine. Respondents reported a high moral obligation to care for patients (97/100, IQR: 85-100, on 100 mm VAS). Fear of contracting COVID-19 changed how 82% of respondents reported interacting with patients, while 97% reported PPE negatively impacted patient care. Despite reporting a high proportion of negative emotions (84%), respondents (59%) were not/slightly concerned about their mental health. Top concerns included a potential second wave, Canada's financial situation, worldwide solidarity, and youth mental health. Facilitators to provide emergency care included: teamwork, leadership, clear communications strategies. CONCLUSION: Canadian emergency physicians felt a strong sense of responsibility to care, while dealing with several ethical dilemmas. Clear communication strategies, measures to ensure safety, and appropriate emergency department setups facilitate pandemic care. Emergency physicians were not concerned about their own mental health, requiring further exploration.","Gaucher, Nathalie; Trottier, Evelyne D; Côté, Anne-Josee; Ali, Huma; Lavoie, Bertrand; Bourque, Claude-Julie; Ali, Samina",CJEM,,434

Although the virological, epidemiological, clinical, and management outcome features of COVID-19 patients have been defined rapidly, the inflammatory and immune profiles require definition as they influence pathogenesis and clinical expression of COVID-19. Here we show lymphopenia, selective loss of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and NK cells, excessive T-cell activation and high expression of T-cell inhibitory molecules are more prominent in severe cases than in those with mild disease. CD8+ T cells in patients with severe disease express high levels of cytotoxic molecules. Histochemical studies of lung tissue from one fatality show sub-anatomical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and massive infiltration of T cells and macrophages. Thus, aberrant activation and dysregulation of CD8+ T cells occur in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, an effect that might be for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and indicate that immune-based targets for therapeutic interventions constitute a promising treatment for severe COVID-19 patients.","Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Chao; Fan, Xing; Meng, Fan-Ping; Xu, Zhe; Xia, Peng; Cao, Wen-Jing; Yang, Tao; Dai, Xiao-Peng; Wang, Si-Yu; Xu, Ruo-Nan; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Li, Wen-Gang; Zhang, Da-Wei; Zhao, Peng; Shi, Ming; Agrati, Chiara; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Maeurer, Markus; Zumla, Alimuddin; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Zhang, Ji-Yuan",Nat Commun,,434

Between May and July 2020, we distributed an online survey to investigate the role of several factors on feline and canine QoL, including lockdown-related factors. We used existing scales to measure human and pets’ personalities (Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Personality Questionnaire, RST-PQ;RST-Dog;RST-Cat) and the human–animal relationship (Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale, LAPS) and the Milan Pet Quality of Life instrument (MPQL). Overall, 235 participants reported about 242 adult pets (Ncats = 78, Ndogs = 164). Factor analysis confirmed the structure and internal reliability of the existing scales (RST-PQ, RST-Dog, RST-Cat, LAPS) and suggested a four-factor structure for the MPQL (physical, psychological, social, environmental). The results indicate that the pets’ psysical QoL was largely explained by pet-related elements (pets’ demographics and life experience, and pets’ personality). Conversely, the pets’ psychological QoL was explained mostly by owner-related elements, such as the owners’ demographics, COVID-19-related changes, and the owners’ personality. Predictably, the pets’ environmental QoL is mostly explained by environmental factors, such as the outdoor access in the home environment and the country. Finally, the pets’ social QoL was explained by the larger combination of models: pets’ characteristics and personality, environment and COVID-19-related changes, and the pet–human relationship. These findings can be explained by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms. The reported changes may be a by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic’s psychological and lifestyle effects on the owners, which in turn alter the way the owners interact with their pets and look after them. However, the owners’ characteristics and mood may bias their answers regarding their pets.","Piotti, Patrizia Karagiannis Christos Satchell Liam Michelazzi Manuela Albertini Mariangela Alleva Enrico Pirrone Federica",Animals,,434
405421,Decline in Marriage Associated with the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States,2020,"Explanations of Italy's and Germany's position within the Eurozone commonly focus on trade ‘competitiveness,’ a concept measured in terms of unit labour costs. This trade-centric view offers a poor explanation for the evolution of the two countries external debt levels following the adoption of the Euro. It also fails to explain the external financial fragility that Italy has repeatedly experienced in the period since 2010. Both outcomes are better explained by dynamics in cross-border financial markets. Monetary union created large incentives for banks in the Eurozone's core states, including Germany, to direct funds to banks in the Eurozone's periphery (those countries whose banks had earlier faced higher currency-related risk premia in obtaining external financing). Domestic policy decisions in Germany further contributed to this outcome. In the period since 2010, the Eurozone's rules-based governance model and the failure of governments to create a common safe asset for banks became a major factor contributing to Italy's financial fragility. It remains to be seen whether Europe's response to the COVID-crisis will mark a watershed, and break these financial markets dynamics.

For the first time, iodide was recovered in the form of triiodide by forward osmosis (FO) for thin-film transistor liquid crystal display industries by preoxidation of iodide to triiodide. Partial oxidation by NaOCl was used to convert the iodide to iodine and then to form triiodide. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na), a commonly used chelating agent in the industry, was used as the draw solute because of its low reverse salt flux. The results revealed that the ideal efficiency of iodide recovery was at pH 3 with a preoxidation (adding 0.0150 M NaClO) for the 0.048 M iodide wastewater with a recovery of 98.5%. Additionally, the Pourbaix diagram and starch indicator were used to verify the formation of triiodide. Membrane distillation was demonstrated to recover the EDTA-2Na draw solute, and more than 99% of recoveries for the draw solutes with initial water flux of 12.0 L/m2 h were achieved, indicating that simultaneous recovery of the EDTA-2Na draw solute and water is feasible.","Chang, Hau-Ming; Chen, Shiao-Shing; Chen, Yu-Ting; Chang, Wen-Shing; Li, Chi-Wang; Nguyen, Nguyen Cong; Ray, Saikat Sinha; Cao, Dan Thanh Ngoc",J Hazard Mater,,434

Epidemiological studies rapidly filled in key gaps in our understanding of the susceptibility of reproductive aged women to the virus, transmission dynamics during pregnancy and lactation, and the effect of infection during the prenatal, pregnancy and post-partum periods. This data guided the development of clinical guidelines written by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine as patients and clinicians navigated reproductive decisions during a time of uncertainty. We present a review of epidemiologic studies published between March and December 2020 that directly informed prenatal and fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a significant increase in our knowledge base over the past year, many questions remain about the impact of COVID-19 on conception, pregnancy, fetal development, and lactation. In the future, a commitment toward inclusion of pregnant persons and those attempting pregnancy in the design of observational and interventional trials is necessary to gain earlier insights about outcomes and assist providers and patients in making data driven decisions.","Dionne-Odom, Jodie; Klipstein, Sigal",Am. j. epidemiol,,434

We enrolled a cohort of 545 COVID-19 patients from Hubei, China, who were followed up up to 7 months, and determined the dynamics of NAbs to SARS-CoV-2 by using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). In our validation study, sVNT IC50 titers and the neutralization rate measured at a single dilution (1:20) were well correlated with FRNT titers (r = 0.85 and 0.84, respectively). The median time to seroconversion of NAbs was 5.5 days post onset of symptoms. The rate of positive sVNT was 52% in the first week, reached 100% in the third week, and remained above 97% till 6 months post onset. Quantitatively, NAbs peaked in the fourth week and only a quarter of patients had an estimated peak titer of >1000. NAbs declined with a half-time of 61 days (95% CI: 49-80 days) within the first two months, and the decay deaccelerated to a half-time of 104 days (95% CI: 86-130 days) afterward. The peak levels of NAbs were positively associated with severity of COVID-19 and age, while negatively associated with serum albumin levels. The observation that the low-moderate peak neutralizing activity and fast decay of NAbs in most naturally infected individuals called for caution in evaluating the feasibility of antibody-based therapy and vaccine durability. NAbs response positively correlated with disease severity, warning for the possibility of repeat infection in patients with mild COVID-19.","Xu, Xin; Nie, Sheng; Wang, Yanqun; Long, Quanxin; Zhu, Hong; Zhang, Xiaoyong; Sun, Jian; Zeng, Qinglang; Zhao, Jincun; Liu, Li; Li, Ling; Huang, Ailong; Hou, Jinlin; Hou, Fan Fan",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,434

412399,Excess mortality in the United States during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Actively thinking of one's future as an older individual could increase perceived risk and risk aversion. This could be particularly relevant for COVID-19, if we consider the common representation of the risk of being infected by COVID-19 as associated with being older. Increased perceived risk could bear consequences on the adoption of preventive behaviours. Thus, we investigated whether increasing the salience of individuals' future as an older adult would impact on their perceived risk for COVID-19 and medical conditions varying for age-relatedness. One hundred and forty-four Italian adults (Mage = 27.72, range: 18-56) were randomly assigned to either a future as older adult thinking or control condition. Perceived risk for COVID-19 and other strongly, and weakly age-related medical conditions during the lifetime was measured. Results showed that thinking about the future as an older adult increased perceived risk for strongly and weakly age-related diseases, but not for COVID-19. The salience of the COVID-19 outbreak may have raised the perceived risks in both experimental conditions, making the manipulation ineffective. In conclusion, manipulating future-oriented thinking might be a successful communication strategy to increase people's perceived risk of common diseases, but it might not work for highly salient pathologies such as COVID-19.","Monzani, Dario; Marinucci, Marco; Pancani, Luca; Rusconi, Patrice; Mazzoni, Davide; Pravettoni, Gabriella",,,434

412733,Quantitative fit testing of filtering face-piece respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals anthropometric deficits in most respirators available in Iran,2021,"BACKGROUND: Among several potential transmission sources in the spreading of the COVID-19, dental services have received a high volume of attention. Several reports, papers, guidelines, and suggestions have been released on how this infection could be transmitted through dental services and what should be done. This study aimed to review the guidelines in order to develop a practical feasibility protocol for the re-opening of dental clinics and the reorientation of dental services. METHODS: This study systematically reviewed the published literature and the guidelines of international health care institutions on dentistry and COVID-19. We searched Pubmed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS electronic databases using MESH terms. The recommendations identified were tested with a convenience sample of experienced practitioners, and a practical step-by-step protocol is presented in this paper. RESULTS: To the date this paper was drafted, 38 articles were found, of which 9 satisfied our inclusion criteria. As all the nine studies were proposed in a general consensus, any elective non-emergency dental care for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 should be postponed for at least 2 weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Only urgent treatment of dental diseases can be performed during the COVID-19 outbreak taking into consideration pharmacological management as the first line and contagion-reduced minimally invasive emergency treatment as the secondary and final management. CONCLUSIONS: While the currently available evidence has not demonstrated a clear and direct relationship between dental treatment or surgery and the possibility of the transmission of COVID-19, there is clearly the potential for transmission. Therefore, following the protective protocols in the COVID-19 crisis is of utmost importance in a dental setting.","Banakar, Morteza; Bagheri Lankarani, Kamran; Jafarpour, Dana; Moayedi, Sedigheh; Banakar, Mohammad Hasan; MohammadSadeghi, Ashkan",BMC Oral Health,,434

We surveyed the impact on sexual behaviour of men having sex with men (MSM) to inform future SHS provision. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey among HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection who attended 56 Dean Street, a sexual health and HIV clinic. The survey was conducted over a 7-day period in August 2020. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and related mental well-being experienced during lockdown (defined as 23 March-30 June 2020) were extracted. Categorical and non-categorical variables were compared according to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. RESULTS: 814 MSM completed the questionnaire: 75% were PrEP users; 76% reported they have been sexually active, of which 76% reported sex outside their household. 75% reported fewer partners than prior to lockdown. Isolation/loneliness (48%) and anxiety/stress (27%) triggered sexual activity, and 73% had discussed COVID-19 transmission risks with their sexual partners. While 46% reported no change to emotions ordinarily experienced following sex, 20% reported guilt for breaching COVID-19 restrictions. 76% implemented one or more changes to their sexual behaviour, while 58% applied one or more steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission during sex. 36% accessed SHS and 30% reported difficulties in accessing testing/treatment. Of those who accessed SHS, 28% reported an STI diagnosis. PrEP users reported higher partner number, engagement in 'chemsex' and use of SHS than non-PrEP users. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions had a considerable impact on sexual behaviour and mental well-being in our survey respondents. High rates of sexual activity and STI diagnoses were reported during lockdown. Changes to SHS provision for MSM must respond to high rates of psychological and STI-related morbidity and the challenges faced by this population in accessing services.","Hyndman, Iain; Nugent, Diarmuid; Whitlock, Gary George; McOwan, Alan; Girometti, Nicolò",Sex. transm. infect,,434

The objective of this study was to assess the role of income level (IL) and the perception of older adults, regarding COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, on adopting stay-at-home preventive behavior during the first week of the outbreak in Mexico. Participants in this cross-sectional study were urban community dwellers, aged &#8805; 65 years from Mexico City. A total of 380 interviews were conducted over the phone. The mean respondent age was 72.9 years, and 76.1% were women. Over half (54.2%) of the participants perceived their susceptibility to COVID-19 as very low or low. Similarly, 33.4% perceived COVID-19 severity as being very low or low, and 57.6% had decided to stay at home: this behavior was associated with IL (ß = 1.05, p < 0.001), and its total effect was partially mediated (15.1%) by perceived severity. Educational attainment was also associated with staying at home (ß = 0.10, p = 0.018) and its total effect was partially mediated (15.0%) by perceived susceptibility. Interventions aimed at low income and less educated older adults should be developed to improve preventive behaviors in this vulnerable group during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Irigoyen-Camacho, Maria Esther; Velazquez-Alva, Maria Consuelo; Zepeda-Zepeda, Marco Antonio; Cabrer-Rosales, Maria Fernanda; Lazarevich, Irina; Castaño-Seiquer, Antonio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,434
414761,Tweaking of radiation and chemotherapy schedules is the new normal during the COVID-19 crisis: Perspective from oncologists at a tertiary care health institute,2021,"BACKGROUND: Randomized placebo-controlled trials are considered to be the gold standard in clinical research and have the highest importance in the hierarchical system of evidence-based medicine. However, from the viewpoint of decision makers, due to lower external validity, practical results of efficacy research are often not in line with the huge investments made over decades. METHOD: We conducted a narrative review. With a special focus on homeopathy, we give an overview on cohort, comparative cohort, case-control and cross-sectional study designs and explain guidelines and tools that help to improve the quality of observational studies, such as the STROBE Statement, RECORD, GRACE and ENCePP Guide. RESULTS: Within the conventional medical research field, two types of arguments have been employed in favor of observational studies. First, observational studies allow for a more generalizable and robust estimation of effects in clinical practice, and if cohorts are large enough, there is no over-estimation of effect sizes, as is often feared. We argue that observational research is needed to balance the current over-emphasis on internal validity at the expense of external validity. Thus, observational research can be considered an important research tool to describe ""real-world"" care settings and can assist with the design and inform the results of randomised controlled trails. CONCLUSIONS: We present recommendations for designing, conducting and reporting observational studies in homeopathy and provide recommendations to complement the STROBE Statement for homeopathic observational studies.","Teut, Michael; Walach, Harald; Varanasi, Roja; Manchanda, Raj K; Oberai, Praveen; Thompson, Elizabeth; Ulbrich-Zürni, Susanne",Homeopathy,,434

Most efforts worldwide by the scientific community and commercial companies focus on the formulation of protocols for SARS CoV-2 analysis in wastewater and approaches addressing the quantitative relationship between WBE and medical surveillance are lacking. In the present study, a mathematical model is developed which uses as input the number of daily positive medical tests together with the highly non-linear shedding rate curve of individuals to estimate the evolution of virus shedding rate in wastewater along calendar days. A comprehensive parametric study by the model using as input actual medical surveillance and WBE data for the city of Thessaloniki ([~]700,000 inhabitants, North Greece) during the outbreak of November 2020 reveals the conditions under which WBE can be used as an early warning tool for predicting pandemic outbreaks. It is shown that early warning capacity is different along the days of an outbreak and depends strongly on the number of days apart between the day of maximum shedding rate of infected individuals in their disease cycle and the day of their medical testing. The present data indicate for Thessaloniki an average early warning capacity of around 2 days. Moreover, the data imply that there exists a proportion between unreported cases (asymptomatic persons with mild symptoms that do not seek medical advice) and reported cases. The proportion increases with the number of reported cases. The early detection capacity of WBE improves substantially in the presence of an increasing number of unreported cases. For Thessaloniki at the peak of the pandemic in mid-November 2020, the number of unreported cases reached a maximum around 4 times the number of reported cases.

Future decision-making policies require consistent data on the management and prognosis of the older patients (> 70 years old) with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Characteristics, management, and prognosis of critically ill old patients (> 70 years) were extracted from the international prospective COVID-ICU database. A propensity score weighted-comparison evaluated the impact of intubation upon admission on Day-90 mortality. RESULTS: The analysis included 1199 (28% of the COVID-ICU cohort) patients (median [interquartile] age 74 [72-78] years). Fifty-three percent, 31%, and 16% were 70-74, 75-79, and over 80 years old, respectively. The most frequent comorbidities were chronic hypertension (62%), diabetes (30%), and chronic respiratory disease (25%). Median Clinical Frailty Scale was 3 (2-3). Upon admission, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 154 (105-222). 740 (62%) patients were intubated on Day-1 and eventually 938 (78%) during their ICU stay. Overall Day-90 mortality was 46% and reached 67% among the 193 patients over 80 years old. Mortality was higher in older patients, diabetics, and those with a lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio upon admission, cardiovascular dysfunction, and a shorter time between first symptoms and ICU admission. In propensity analysis, early intubation at ICU admission was associated with a significantly higher Day-90 mortality (42% vs 28%; hazard ratio 1.68; 95% CI 1.24-2.27; p < 0·001). CONCLUSION: Patients over 70 years old represented more than a quarter of the COVID-19 population admitted in the participating ICUs during the first wave. Day-90 mortality was 46%, with dismal outcomes reported for patients older than 80 years or those intubated upon ICU admission.","Dres, Martin; Hajage, David; Lebbah, Said; Kimmoun, Antoine; Pham, Tai; Béduneau, Gaëtan; Combes, Alain; Mercat, Alain; Guidet, Bertrand; Demoule, Alexandre; Schmidt, Matthieu",Ann Intensive Care,,434
418872,Ni una menos: Colombia’s crisis of gendered violence during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"WATERLIT Abstract: The nutrition situation in Sudan is one of the worst in northeast Africa and it is characterized by persistently high levels of acute and chronic malnutrition that have increased over the last two decades. The underlying causes of malnutrition are multi-sectoral and are mainly due to inequalities, inadequate food practices, and limited access to healthcare services. Based on the report The Economic and Social Impacts of Child Undernutrition in Sudan, this study assesses the impact that malnutrition has on health, education, and productivity in Sudan. The country is estimated to have lost an equivalent of about 11.6 billion Sudanese pound (1 United States dollar = 55.3 Sudanese pound) in 2014, which represented 2.6% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Productivity-related losses contributed the largest costs at 1.5% of GDP followed by health and education sectors at 1.1% and 0.1%, respectively. In 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic further exposed the fragility of Sudan's health, social, and economic system. It is mandatory that all stakeholders address child nutrition as a main concern and stunting is incorporated in the center of the development agenda. In particular, the national development frameworks should be updated to ensure the reduction of the stunting prevalence and to put in place a comprehensive multi-sectoral nutrition policy, strategy, and plan of action","Abu-Fatima, O.; Abbas, A.

Objective: We wanted to study more comprehensively how practitioners emotionally respond to RCs. Method: We conducted a world-wide survey with the participation of 201 software practitioners. In our survey, we used the Job-related Affective Well-being Scale (JAWS) and open-ended questions to capture participants emotions when handling RCs in their work and query about the different circumstances when they feel these emotions. We used a combined approach of statistical analysis, JAWS, and Socio-Technical Grounded Theory (STGT) for Data Analysis to analyse our survey data. Findings: We identified (1) emotional responses to RCs, i.e., the most common emotions felt by practitioners when handling RCs; (2) different stimuli -- such as the RC, the practitioner, team, manager, customer -- that trigger these emotions through their own different characteristics; (3)emotion dynamics, i.e., the changes in emotions during the project and RC handling life cycles; (4) distinct events where particular emotions are triggered:project milestones, and RC stages; (5) and time related matters that regulate the emotion dynamics. Conclusion: Practitioners are not pleased with receiving RCs all the time. Last minute RCs introduced closer to a deadline especially violate emotional well-being of practitioners. We present some practical recommendations for practitioners to follow, including a dual-purpose emotion-centric decision guide to help decide when to introduce or accept an RC, and some future key research directions.","Madampe, Kashumi; Hoda, Rashina; Grundy, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03993v1.pdf,434
419097,Urgent Arthroplasty Interventions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Operating Risks in Low-Prevalence Areas,2020,"How will the novel coronavirus evolve? I study a simple SEPAIRD model, in which mutations may change the properties of the virus and its associated disease stochastically and antigenic drifts allow new variants to partially evade immunity. I show analytically that variants with higher infectiousness, longer disease duration, and shorter latency period prove to be fitter.""Smart""containment policies targeting symptomatic individuals may redirect the evolution of the virus, as they give an edge to variants with a longer incubation period and a higher share of asymptomatic infections. Reduced mortality, on the other hand, does not per se prove to be an evolutionary advantage. I then implement this model as an agent-based simulation model in order to explore its aggregate dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations show that a) containment policy design has an impact on both speed and direction of viral evolution, b) the virus may circulate in the population indefinitely, provided that containment efforts are too relaxed and the propensity of the virus to escape immunity is high enough, and crucially c) that it may not be possible to distinguish between a slowly and a rapidly evolving virus looking only at short-term epidemiological outcomes. Thus, what looks like a successful mitigation strategy in the short run, may prove to have devastating long-run effects. These results suggest that optimal containment policy must take the propensity of the virus to mutate and escape immunity into account, strengthening the case for genetic and antigenic surveillance even in the early stages of an epidemic.","Mellacher, Patrick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04358v1.pdf,434

Drawing on qualitative methods, we apply ideas on digitalisation, value, and power to investigate the implementation and impact of digital technologies in Ghana's state water utility company. We find digital water innovations to be recent, and delivering relatively limited impacts as yet, with value mainly accruing at the utility's operational rather than strategic level. The digital technologies present avenues for power shifts and struggles internally and externally as well as some changes in water management structures and responsibilities.

In comparison with the current available medical modalities, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging is the simplest and fastest means for probing the tissue perfusion. Specifically, the perfusion parameters estimated from the ultrasound time-intensity curve (TIC) and statistics-based time-Nakagami parameter curve (TNC) approaches were found able to quantify the perfusion. However, due to insufficient tolerance on tissue clutters and subresolvable effects, these approaches remain short of reproducibility and robustness. Consequently, the window-modulated compounding (WMC) Nakagami parameter ratio imaging was proposed to alleviate these effects, by taking the ratio of WMC Nakagami parameters corresponding to the incidence of two different acoustic pressures from an employed transducer. The time-Nakagami parameter ratio curve (TNRC) approach was also developed to estimate perfusion parameters. Measurements for the assessment of muscle perfusion were performed from the flow phantom and animal subjects administrated with a bolus of ultrasound contrast agents. The TNRC approach demonstrated better sensitivity and tolerance of tissue clutters than those of TIC and TNC. The fusion image with the WMC Nakagami parameter ratio and B-mode images indicated that both the tissue structures and perfusion properties of ultrasound contrast agents may be better discerned.","Lin, Huang-Chen; Wang, Shyh-Hau",,,434
420998,Rapid Adaptation to Remote Didactics and Learning in GME,2020,"Flavonoid glycosides exist widely in medicine herbs and often used as nutraceuticals because of their excellent bioactivity and low toxicity. For accurate quality control and bioactivity assessment of Sphaerophysa salsula, a rapid and productive method to isolate flavonoid glycosides is needed. Therefore, this work reports the development of a novel comprehensive strategy based on an online middle-pressure chromatography and preparative HPLC for rapid enrichment and separation of flavonoid glycosides from Sphaerophysa salsula. First, the flavonoid glycosides were enriched using an online middle-pressure chromatographic column containing stationary MCI phase. During this process, the high-volume injection of the extracting solution was realized by an empty pre-column positioned before the main chromatographic tower. Then, the compounds were separated through preparative HPLC with Megress C18. As a result, one new flavonol 3-O-glycoside (2) together with two known flavonol 3-O-glycosides (1, 3) were targetedly isolated from Sphaerophysa salsula. The content of compounds 1-3 in Sphaerophysa salsula was 0.09, 0.11, and 0.18 wt%, respectively. Comparing to traditional enrichment and separation methods, our technique offers significantly shorter sample pretreatment time as well as high reproducibility. We believe that our separation method has a strong potential to be used for the processing of other medicinal plants. This article is protected by copyright.

Herein, we analyse the main challenges of the recycling sector in Brazil to cope with this scenario. Understanding difficulties during the pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 can help improve waste recycling in the post-pandemic period in Brazil and other developing nations that face similar issues. The current pandemic exposed the deficiencies of this system, and some important lessons can be learned. Recommendations are drawn to advance the proper management of recyclables in the country. The Government must increase total investments in the recycling industry's infrastructure and support local recycling initiatives during a public health crisis and beyond. In sum, this paper strengthens the idea that waste segregation at the source and selective collection will not be sufficient without massive investments in the recycling sector's infrastructure. The future challenge includes strengthening the economic markets for recycled materials.","de Almeida, Ronei; de Souza, Roberta Guimarães; Campos, Juacyara Carbonelli",Waste Dispos Sustain Energy,,434

This dataset comprises all COVID-19-tested patients and their individual histories of medical service use from January 1, 2017 to May 15, 2020. All patients >19 years with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The primary endpoint was a composite of death and intensive care unit admission. In total, 7162 adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in this study. The prevalence of AF was 1.8% (n = 130). Patients with AF had unfavorable characteristics, such as older age and higher prevalence of comorbidities. The primary endpoint was more common in patients with AF than in those without (33.9% vs 12.9%, P < .001). In the multivariable model, age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.035, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.030-1.040), female sex (OR: 0.618, 95% CI: 0.535-0.713), diabetes (OR: 1.341, 95% CI: 1.093-1.580), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 2.714, 95% CI: 1.541-4.777) were associated with the primary endpoint.

A number of studies suggest that assessment of C. burnetii-specific T-cell IFNÎ³ responses may be a more sensitive tool to assess past exposure. In this study, we assessed the performance of a whole blood C. burnetii IFNÎ³ release assay in comparison to serological detection in an area of high Q fever incidence in 2014, up to seven years after initial exposure during the Dutch Q fever outbreak 2007-2010. In a cohort of >1500 individuals from the Dutch outbreak village of Herpen, approximately 60% had mounted IFNÎ³ responses to C. burnetii. This proportion was independent of the Coxiella strain used for stimulation and much higher than the proportion of individuals scored sero-positive using the serological gold standard immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, C. burnetii-specific IFNÎ³ responses were found to be more durable than antibody responses in two sub-groups of individuals known to have sero-converted as of 2007 or previously reported to the municipality as notified Q fever cases. A novel ready-to-use version of the IFNÎ³ release assay assessed in a subgroup of pre-exposed individuals in 2021 (10-14 years post exposure) proved again to be more sensitive than serology in detecting past exposure. These data demonstrate that C. burnetii-induced IFNÎ³ release is indeed a more sensitive and durable marker of exposure to C. burnetii than are serological responses. In combination with a simplified assay version suitable for implementation in routine diagnostic settings, this makes the assessment of IFNÎ³ responses a valuable tool for exposure screening to obtain epidemiological data, and to identify previously exposed individuals in pre-vaccination screens.","Scholzen, Anja; de Vries, Margot; Duerr, Hans-Peter; Roest, Hendrik-Jan; Sluder, Ann E; Poznansky, Mark C; Kouwijzer, Milou L C E; Garritsen, Anja",Front Immunol,,434

Methods: We randomly selected 238 T2DM patients from a list of 2460 patients from the Jabber Abulizz Hospital. We interviewed them face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the determinants of KAP regarding the recommended diets for T2DM patients. Results: Majority of the patients demonstrated good knowledge (54.6%), positive attitude (79%); and good practice (58%). The result revealed that patients with formal education had 3.0 (95% CI: 1.6-5.7) times higher odds of having good diabetic dietary knowledge than those with informal education. While patients who had good knowledge and a positive attitude were respectively 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4-8.9) and 3.2 (95% CI: 1.5-6.7) times more likely to follow dietary recommendations than the patients with poor knowledge and negative attitudes. Conclusion: Irrespective of the socio-demographic position, the good knowledge and the positive attitude towards the recommended diet, all the T2DM patients complied with the dietary recommendations. These findings highlight the need for improving knowledge and promoting positive attitudes towards the recommended diet among T2DM patients.","Adam, Halla Mahagoub Idrees; Elmosaad, Yousif Mohammed; Ahmed, Abd Elbasit Elawad; Khan, Asif; Mahmud, Ilias",Afr Health Sci,,434

METHODS: A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between January 18 and March 20, 2020, including people with confirmed COVID-19 from 56 hospitals officially designated in 3 Chinese regions; data were extracted from medical records. New-onset neurologic events as assessed by neurology consultants based on manifestations, clinical examination, and investigations were noted, in which critical events included disorders of consciousness, stroke, CNS infection, seizures, and status epilepticus. RESULTS: We enrolled 917 people with average age 48.7 years and 55% were male. The frequency of new-onset critical neurologic events was 3.5% (32/917) overall and 9.4% (30/319) among those with severe or critical COVID-19. These were impaired consciousness (n = 25) or stroke (n = 10). The risk of critical neurologic events was highly associated with age above 60 years and previous history of neurologic conditions. Noncritical events were seen in fewer than 1% (7/917), including muscle cramp, unexplained headache, occipital neuralgia, tic, and tremor. Brain CT in 28 people led to new findings in 9. Findings from lumbar puncture in 3 with suspected CNS infection, unexplained headache, or severe occipital neuralgia were unremarkable. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19 aged over 60 and with neurologic comorbidities were at higher risk of developing critical neurologic impairment, mainly impaired consciousness and cerebrovascular accidents. Brain CT should be considered when new-onset brain injury is suspected, especially in people under sedation or showing an unexplained decline in consciousness.

To answer this question, we have turned to Sustainable Tourism Pedagogy (STP), a framework for the critical analysis of tourism studies based on six areas of literacy that this article will use for empirical analysis. The STP core literacies have been evaluated in a statistically validated questionnaire addressed to 393 respondents and data analysis has been performed with analytical descriptive techniques. The results show: i) that Tourism Degrees do not meet the needs of today's students, especially because of a major lack of sustainability issues, ii) significant gaps between the perception of teachers and students, iii) that there are calls for a more sustainable tourism pedagogy in Higher Education.

Patients with COVID-19 who were treated in the ICU during periods of increased COVID-19 ICU demand had increased risk of mortality compared with patients treated during periods of low COVID-19 ICU demand (ie, demand of &#8804;25%); the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.81-1.22; P = .93) for patients treated when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 25% to 50%, 1.19 (95% CI, 0.95-1.48; P = .13) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 50% to 75%, and 1.94 (95% CI, 1.46-2.59; P < .001) when COVID-19 ICU demand was more than 75% to 100%. No association between COVID-19 ICU demand and mortality was observed for patients with COVID-19 not in the ICU. The association between COVID-19 ICU load and mortality was not consistent over time (ie, early vs late in the pandemic). Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found that although facilities augmented ICU capacity during the pandemic, strains on critical care capacity were associated with increased COVID-19 ICU mortality. Tracking COVID-19 ICU demand may be useful to hospital administrators and health officials as they coordinate COVID-19 admissions across hospitals to optimize outcomes for patients with this illness.","Bravata, Dawn M; Perkins, Anthony J; Myers, Laura J; Arling, Greg; Zhang, Ying; Zillich, Alan J; Reese, Lindsey; Dysangco, Andrew; Agarwal, Rajiv; Myers, Jennifer; Austin, Charles; Sexson, Ali; Leonard, Samuel J; Dev, Sharmistha; Keyhani, Salomeh",JAMA Netw Open,,434
423574,Increase in suicides during COVID-19 pandemic: A collaborative reflection,2021,"COVID-19 is now a pandemic with increasing numbers of cases and deaths. In addition to the economic and social damage caused by COVID-19 outbreak prolongation, damage caused by delayed treatment of other diseases such as severe cirrhosis is also serious. We aimed to describe the effect of COVID-19 on the number of liver transplants (LT) in South Korea. The number of LT performed in Korea during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, and the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with the average number of LT performed in the past 5 years. There were 108.5 cases of LT performed per month during the MERS outbreak. It was 11% lower than the average of 122.8 cases per month for the last 5 years. LDLT and DDLT decreased by 13% to 75.3 cases and by 7.5% to 33.2 cases per month during the MERS epidemic, respectively. From January to March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak), the number of LT did not decrease significantly. The lockdown caused by COVID-19 did not affect the number of liver transplants in Korea. Establishing a safe process and procedure of liver transplantation within safe boundaries can be beneficial in reducing the side effects of lockdown and saving patients' lives.","Lee, Jeong-Moo",Transpl Infect Dis,,434

New technologies present novel opportunities and challenges, and globalisation has created new pathways and increased the speed, volume and routes by which organisms can spread. The UK Biological Security Strategy (2018) acknowledges the importance of research on biological security in the UK. Given the breadth of potential research, a targeted agenda identifying the questions most critical to effective and coordinated progress in different disciplines of biological security is required. We used expert elicitation to generate 80 policy-relevant research questions considered by participants to have the greatest impact on UK biological security. Drawing on a collaboratively-developed set of 450 questions, proposed by 41 experts from academia, industry and the UK government (consulting 168 additional experts) we subdivided the final 80 questions into six categories: bioengineering; communication and behaviour; disease threats (including pandemics); governance and policy; invasive alien species; and securing biological materials and securing against misuse. Initially, the questions were ranked through a voting process and then reduced and refined to 80 during a one-day workshop with 35 participants from a variety of disciplines. Consistently emerging themes included: the nature of current and potential biological security threats, the efficacy of existing management actions, and the most appropriate future options. The resulting questions offer a research agenda for biological security in the UK that can assist the targeting of research resources and inform the implementation of the UK Biological Security Strategy. These questions include research that could aid with the mitigation of Covid-19, and preparation for the next pandemic. We hope that our structured and rigorous approach to creating a biological security research agenda will be replicated in other countries and regions. The world, not just the UK, is in need of a thoughtful approach to directing biological security research to tackle the emerging issues.","Kemp, Luke; Aldridge, David C; Booy, Olaf; Bower, Hilary; Browne, Des; Burgmann, Mark; Burt, Austin; Cunningham, Andrew A; Dando, Malcolm; Dick, Jaimie T A; Dye, Christopher; Weiss Evans, Sam; Gallardo, Belinda; Godfray, H Charles J; Goodfellow, Ian; Gubbins, Simon; Holt, Lauren A; Jones, Kate E; Kandil, Hazem; Martin, Phillip; McCaughan, Mark; McLeish, Caitríona; Meany, Thomas; Millett, Kathryn; ÓhÉigeartaigh, Sean S; Patron, Nicola J; Rhodes, Catherine; Roy, Helen E; Shackelford, Gorm; Smith, Derek; Spence, Nicola; Steiner, Helene; Sundaram, Lalitha S; Voeneky, Silja; Walker, John R; Watkins, Harry; Whitby, Simon; Wood, James; Sutherland, William J",PLoS One,,434

This study compared the accuracy of the Dexcom G5 Mobile (Dexcom, San Diego, CA) transcutaneous sensor (DG5) and the first version of Eversense (Senseonics,Inc., Germantown, MD) implantable sensor (EVS). METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and using EVS wore simultaneously DG5 for seven days. At day 3, patients were admitted to a clinical research center (CRC) to receive breakfast with delayed and increased insulin bolus to induce glucose excursions. At CRC, venous glucose was monitored every 15 min (or 5 min during hypoglycemia) for 6 h by YSI 2300 STAT PLUS&#8482; glucose and lactate analyzer. At home patients were requested to perform 4 fingerstick glucose measurements per day. Eleven patients (9 males, age 47.4 ± 11.3 years, M±SD) were enrolled. During home-stay the median [25th-75th percentile] absolute relative difference (ARD) over all CGM-fingerstick matched-pairs was 11.64% [5.38-20.65]% for the DG5 and 10.75% [5.15-19.74]% for the EVS (p-value = 0.58). At CRC, considering all the CGM-YSI matched-pairs, the DG5 showed overall smaller median ARD than EVS, 7.91% [4.14-14.30]% vs 11.4% [5.04-18.54]% (p-value<0.001). Considering accuracy during blood glucose swings, DG5 performed better than EVS when glucose rate-of-change was -0.5 to -1.5 mg/dL/min, with median ARD of 7.34% [3.71-12.76]% vs 13.59% [4.53-20.78]% (p-value<0.001), and for rate-of-change < -1.5 mg/dl/min, with median ARD of 5.23% [2.09-15.29]% vs 12.73% [4.14-20.82]% (p-value = 0.02).

Since then, all hospitals have required a complete restructuring of their usual facilities and the treatments provided. Our goal was to detail the remodeling of a tertiary hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak and analyze pitfalls to avoid increasing surgical department burdens. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of data affecting patients during their admission in our institution during March 2020. Data from general admission, intensive care units, and elective and emergency surgeries were collected and analyzed. All patients who underwent a surgical procedure were reviewed to elucidate limitations in the deployment of the hospital transformation to a COVID-19 hospital. RESULTS: A total of 688 patients have been treated in our institution. Of those, 186 required intensive care. More than 120 new intensive care beds have been created during this period, and a decrease in elective surgeries of more than 75% was observed. Inadvertent COVID-19 patients accounted for 70%. Thirty percent of the patients who underwent surgery while infected with COVID-19 died in our institution. CONCLUSIONS: The complete reorganization of surgical departments will be requested during the outbreak and adaptive solutions are needed in order to avoid increased mortality rates and infection among patients and to promote maximal optimization of surgical spaces. Timing, governmental decisions, and scientific society's recommendations may be limitations in the efficient deployment of hospital transformations to COVID-19 facilities.","Vilallonga, Ramon; Garcia Ruiz de Gordejuela, Amador; Cossio-Gil, Yolima; Domínguez González, José Manuel; Martín Sánchez, Rocio; Armengol Carrasco, Manel",Langenbecks Arch Surg,,434

METHODS: All consecutive COVID-19 adult patients admitted between March and June 2020 to the ICU of a referral, university hospital in Northern-Italy were enrolled. MR-proADM and routine laboratory test were measured within 48 hours from ICU admission, on day 3, 7 and 14. Survival curves difference with MR-proADM cut-off set to 1.8 nmol/L were tested using log-rank test. Predictive ability was compared using area under the curve and 95% confidence interval of different receiver-operating characteristics curves. RESULTS: 57 patients were enrolled. ICU and overall mortality were 54.4%. At admission, lymphocytopenia was present in 86% of patients; increased D-dimer and CRP levels were found in 84.2% and 87.7% of patients respectively, while PCT values > 0.5 µg/L were observed in 47.4% of patients. MR-proADM, CRP and LDH were significantly different between surviving and non-surviving patients and over time, while PCT, D-dimer and NT-pro-BNP did not show any difference between the groups and over time; lymphocytes were different between surviving and non-surviving patients only. MR-proADM was higher in dying patients (2.65±2.33vs1.18±0.47, p<0.001) and a higher mortality characterized patients with MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L (p = 0.016). The logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and PCT values confirmed an odds ratio = 10.3 [95%CI:1.9-53.6] (p = 0.006) for MR-proADM >1.8 nmol/L and = 22.2 [95%CI:1.6-316.9] (p = 0.022) for cardiovascular disease. Overall, MR-proADM had the best predictive ability (AUC = 0.85 [95%CI:0.78-0.90]). CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 ICU-patients, MR-proADM seems to have constantly higher values in non-survivor patients and predict mortality more precisely than other biomarkers. Repeated MR-proADM measurement may support a rapid and effective decision-making. Further studies are needed to better explain the mechanisms responsible of the increase in MR-proADM in COVID-19 patients.","Montrucchio, Giorgia; Sales, Gabriele; Rumbolo, Francesca; Palmesino, Filippo; Fanelli, Vito; Urbino, Rosario; Filippini, Claudia; Mengozzi, Giulio; Brazzi, Luca",PLoS One,,434

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"Myocardial damage with a consequent rise in cardio-specific troponin level is a frequent phenomenon in severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Its causes are capillary endothelial cell dysfunction, associated carditis, low oxygenization, and increased sympathetic tone, which all worsen myocardial stiffness and microvascular dysfunction (MD). They lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and a significant rise in death cases. During COVID-19, no specific cardiological treatment is started. As adjuvant therapy, anxiolytics in COVID-19 are widely used, but not in all anxious patients who had been infected with coronavirus. Anxiolytics can be useful to moderate MD and immunosuppressive effect of anxiety. The favorable effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the treatment of myocardial ischemia and heart failure had previously been proven, and also their anti-inflammatory effects had been suspected; however, they have not yet been used in COVID-19 cases. TMZ promotes glucose-mediated ATP production, which requires less oxygen, which explains its advantageous cardiac effects. Since it lowers serum and myocardial tissue proinflammatory cytokine levels and inhibits myocardial macrophage infiltration, it was suspected that TMZ might represent a novel therapeutic agent to prevent and treat sepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction. CoQ10 plays an important role in cellular ATP production; however, its concentration is decreased in cardiovascular diseases and in influenza patients. Due to its anti-inflammatory effect, CoQ10 has been suspected to have a key therapeutic target in influenza infection. We suggest considering these medicines to alleviate myocardial damage and inflammation in COVID-19.","Medvegy, Mihály; Simonyi, Gábor",,,434
428295,From the EditorCommentary: Addressing Inequities in the Era of COVID-19: The Pandemic and the Urgent Need for Critical Race Theory,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The most serious COVID-19 deriving from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes a cytokine release storm and it is associated with worse outcomes. In COVID-19 patients, interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels are significantly elevated. Blocking IL-6 preliminarily resulted in the improvement of this hyperinflammatory state. It is unknown which patients could require higher doses of tocilizumab to get out of the cytokine storm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia were included. All the patients underwent tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenously and were tested for serum IL-6 24 to 48 hours before and 12 to 48 hours after tocilizumab infusion. Comparisons between survivors and nonsurvivors were performed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were discharged, while six patients died, with no clinical or laboratory differences between the two groups at baseline. IL-6 was not different at baseline (P = .41), while 24 to 48 hours post-tocilizumab IL-6 serum levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors (2398.5 [430.5-9372] vs 290.5 [58.5-1305.5] pg/mL, P = .022). Serum IL-6 post-tocilizumab showed a good predictive ability to discriminate survivors from nonsurvivors (area under the curve, 0.815; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.99, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Repeated measurement of the serum level of IL-6 early after tocilizumab may distinguish nonsurvivors from survivors and support the choice of deeper targeting IL-6 in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Quartuccio, Luca; Sonaglia, Arianna; Pecori, Davide; Peghin, Maddalena; Fabris, Martina; Tascini, Carlo; De Vita, Salvatore",J Med Virol,,434

METHOD: Lactation records from 7256 pedigree Jersey heifers were grouped by AFC. Analysis comprised mixed effects multivariable regression modelling and binary logistic regression modelling. RESULTS: Increased lifetime daily yield (LDY) was significantly associated with a reduced AFC; calving UK Jersey heifers at 24 months or below is optimal. Heifers calving at 25-26 months had a significantly lower mean calving interval (391 days; 95 per cent CI 386 to 397) than those calving over 30 months (399; 95 per cent CI 394 to 405) (P=0.03). Heifers with an AFC over 30 months were less likely to survive to second lactation than those with an AFC 18-24 months. Spring calving heifers produced significantly less milk per day (9.87 kg; 95 per cent CI 9.64 to 10.1) than autumn (10.18; 95 per cent CI 9.94 to 10.41) or winter calvers (10.07; 95 per cent CI 9.84 to 10.3) (P&#8804;0.01). Heifers that calved in the winter had a significantly shorter calving interval (389 days; 95 per cent CI 394 to 383) (P&#8804;0.01) than heifers calved in other seasons. CONCLUSION: The impact of AFC on Jersey production, fertility and longevity traits shows a similar trend to that seen in the Holstein, potentially on a lesser scale.","Boothby, F; Grove-White, Dai; Oikonomou, G; Oultram, J W H",Vet. rec,,434

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, survey-based, national study evaluating academic otolaryngologists. Burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression were assessed by the single-item Mini-Z Burnout Assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, 15-item Impact of Event Scale, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 349 physicians completed the survey. Of them, 165 (47.3%) were residents and 212 (60.7%) were males. Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression were reported in 167 (47.9%), 210 (60.2%), 76 (21.8%), and 37 (10.6%) physicians, respectively. Attendings had decreased burnout relative to residents (odds ratio [OR] 0.28, confidence interval [CI] [0.11-0.68]; P = .005). Females had increased burnout (OR 1.93, CI [1.12.-3.32]; P = .018), anxiety (OR 2.53, CI [1.59-4.02]; P < .005), and distress (OR 2.68, CI [1.64-4.37]; P < .005). Physicians in states with greater than 20 000 positive cases had increased distress (OR 2.01, CI [1.22-3.31]; P = .006).

While polymerase chain reaction-based assays are used for diagnosis, there is a need for high-throughput, rapid serologic methods. A Luminex binding assay was developed and used to assess simultaneously the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-specific antibodies in human serum and plasma. Clear differentiation was achieved between specimens from infected and uninfected subjects, and a wide range of serum/plasma antibody levels was delineated in infected subjects. All 25 specimens from 18 patients with COVID-19 were positive in the assays with both the trimeric spike and the receptor-binding domain proteins. None of the 13 specimens from uninfected subjects displayed antibodies to either antigen. There was a highly statistically significant difference between the antibody levels of COVID-19-infected and -uninfected specimens (Pâ <â .0001). This high-throughput antibody assay is accurate, requires only 2.5 hours, and uses 5 ng of antigen per test.","Weiss, Svenja; Klingler, Jéromine; Hioe, Catarina; Amanat, Fatima; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Kojic, Erna Milunka; Stoever, Jonathan; Liu, Sean T H; Jurczyszak, Denise; Bermudez-Gonzalez, Maria; Simon, Viviana; Krammer, Florian; Zolla-Pazner, Susan",J Infect Dis,,434
431248,Anatomy of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Epidemiologists View Point,2020,"(1) Background: The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal samples through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the standard gold method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antigen detection (AD) tests are more rapid, less laborious, and less expensive alternatives but still require clinical validation. (2) Methods: This study compared the clinical performance of five AD tests, including four rapid AD (RAD) tests (biotical, Panbio, Healgen, and Roche) and one automated AD test (VITROS). For that purpose, 118 (62.8%) symptomatic patients and 70 (37.2%) asymptomatic subjects were tested, and results were compared to RT-PCR. (3) Results: The performance of the RAD tests was modest and allowed us to identify RT-PCR positive patients with higher viral loads. For Ct values &#8804;25, the sensitivity ranged from 93.1% (95% CI: 83.3-98.1%) to 96.6% (95% CI: 88.1-99.6%), meaning that some samples with high viral loads were missed. Considering the Ct value proposed by the CDC for contagiousness (i.e., Ct values &#8804;33) sensitivities ranged from 76.2% (95% CI: 65.4-85.1%) to 88.8% (95% CI: 79.7-94.7%) while the specificity ranged from 96.3% (95% CI: 90.8-99.0%) to 99.1% (95% CI: 95.0-100%). The VITROS automated assay showed a 100% (95% CI: 95.5-100%) sensitivity for Ct values &#8804;33, and had a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 96.6-100%); (4) Conclusions: Compared to RAD tests, the VITROS assay fully aligned with RT-PCR for Ct values up to 33, which might allow a faster, easier and cheaper identification of SARS-CoV-2 contagious patients.","Favresse, Julien; Gillot, Constant; Oliveira, Maxime; Cadrobbi, Julie; Elsen, Marc; Eucher, Christine; Laffineur, Kim; Rosseels, Catherine; Van Eeckhoudt, Sandrine; Nicolas, Jean-Baptiste; Morimont, Laure; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Douxfils, Jonathan",,,434
431587,Impact of COVID-19 in the UAE Cardiovascular Services: A Statement from Emirates Cardiac and Emirates Intensive Care Societies,2020,"During the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to the infection of millions of people and has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The entry of the virus into cells depends on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Although there is currently no vaccine, it is likely that antibodies will be essential for protection. However, little is known about the human antibody response to SARS-CoV-21-5. Here we report on 149 COVID-19-convalescent individuals. Plasma samples collected an average of 39 days after the onset of symptoms had variable half-maximal pseudovirus neutralizing titres; titres were less than 50 in 33% of samples, below 1,000 in 79% of samples and only 1% of samples had titres above 5,000. Antibody sequencing revealed the expansion of clones of RBD-specific memory B cells that expressed closely related antibodies in different individuals. Despite low plasma titres, antibodies to three distinct epitopes on the RBD neutralized the virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) as low as 2 ng ml-1. In conclusion, most convalescent plasma samples obtained from individuals who recover from COVID-19 do not contain high levels of neutralizing activity. Nevertheless, rare but recurring RBD-specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity were found in all individuals tested, suggesting that a vaccine designed to elicit such antibodies could be broadly effective.","Robbiani, Davide F; Gaebler, Christian; Muecksch, Frauke; Lorenzi, Julio C C; Wang, Zijun; Cho, Alice; Agudelo, Marianna; Barnes, Christopher O; Gazumyan, Anna; Finkin, Shlomo; Hägglöf, Thomas; Oliveira, Thiago Y; Viant, Charlotte; Hurley, Arlene; Hoffmann, Hans-Heinrich; Millard, Katrina G; Kost, Rhonda G; Cipolla, Melissa; Gordon, Kristie; Bianchini, Filippo; Chen, Spencer T; Ramos, Victor; Patel, Roshni; Dizon, Juan; Shimeliovich, Irina; Mendoza, Pilar; Hartweger, Harald; Nogueira, Lilian; Pack, Maggi; Horowitz, Jill; Schmidt, Fabian; Weisblum, Yiska; Michailidis, Eleftherios; Ashbrook, Alison W; Waltari, Eric; Pak, John E; Huey-Tubman, Kathryn E; Koranda, Nicholas; Hoffman, Pauline R; West, Anthony P; Rice, Charles M; Hatziioannou, Theodora; Bjorkman, Pamela J; Bieniasz, Paul D; Caskey, Marina; Nussenzweig, Michel C",Nature,,434

This study aimed to identify its effects on sports medicine physicians during the early phase of this pandemic. DESIGN: Survey study. SETTING: Sports medicine providers. PARTICIPANTS: Physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine were surveyed between March 25 and April 4, 2020. A total of 810 responses were obtained from 2437 physicians who viewed the survey. INTERVENTIONS: The survey consisted of questions examining demographics, prepandemic practice patterns, anxiety and depression screening, and new beliefs and behaviors following government-based medical policy changes resulting from the pandemic. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in clinical volume and treatment practices, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: The mean in-person clinic visits reduced to 17.9%, telephone visits to 24.4%, telemedicine (video) visits to 21.8%, and procedural visits to 13.8% of prepandemic practice volume. The mean PHQ-4 scores for physicians were 2.38 ± 2.40. Clinic and procedural volumes were reduced less by male physicians, as well as more experienced physicians, nonphysical medicine and rehabilitation training background, in government or private practice, and in the Southern region of the United States (P < 0.05). Physicians were more likely to reduce their anti-inflammatory (37.8% decreasing vs 6.8% increasing, P < 0.001) and opioid (10.5% vs 6.8%, P = 0.003) prescriptions rather than increase. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic sports medicine physicians reported reducing in-person evaluation, management, and procedure volume by over 80%. Multiple demographic and geographic factors were associated with practice volume changes.","Cushman, Daniel M; Teramoto, Masaru; Babu, Ashwin; Olafsen, Nathan; Onishi, Kentaro; Asay, Alexandra; McCormick, Zachary L",Clin. j. sport med,,434

A qualitative study on psychotherapists, psychology trainees and students, and community people",2020,"Nigeria has one of the largest concentration of human resources for health in Africa. There are 46 accredited medical schools and the majority are owned by the various State Governments. The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The Federal Government of Nigeria through the Federal Ministry of Education closed all tertiary institutions in Nigeria including the medical schools on the 19th of March 2020 so as to curtail the effects of the pandemic. The effect of COVID-19 pandemic on tertiary institutions in Nigeria include the disruption of the academic calendar of the schools. This is capable of affecting the mental health of medical students. The smooth financing of medical education in Nigeria could be at risk. The career progression of medical students and those in the Residency Training Program and the doctors seeking greener pastures abroad are all affected. Unfortunately the state of infrastructure in the medical schools could be said to be poor. However, a good medical education scheme is said to guarantee the medical security of the populace. The Government and its agencies should work out plans of ameliorating the effects of the pandemic on medical education. This could also be a period to re-position the sector so as to be able to face similar challenges in future. The time has come for the full application of technology in delivering medical education in Nigeria. Incidentally, the pandemic has encouraged the application of e-learning techniques for the continuing professional development of medical doctors in the country. This should be the new way to go.","Ossai, Edmund Ndudi",Pan Afr Med J,,434

In Germany, AgeWell.de is the first large-scale initiative investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component lifestyle intervention against cognitive decline. We aimed to investigate the recruitment process and baseline characteristics of the AgeWell.de participants to gain an understanding of the at-risk population and who engages in the intervention. General practitioners across five study sites recruited participants (aged 60-77 years, Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Incidence of Dementia/CAIDE dementia risk score &#8805; 9). Structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with eligible participants, including neuropsychological assessments. We analyzed group differences between (1) eligible vs. non-eligible participants, (2) participants vs. non-participants, and (3) between intervention groups. Of 1176 eligible participants, 146 (12.5%) dropped out before baseline; the study population was thus 1030 individuals. Non-participants did not differ from participants in key sociodemographic factors and dementia risk. Study participants were M = 69.0 (SD = 4.9) years old, and 52.1% were women. The average Montreal Cognitive Assessment/MoCA score was 24.5 (SD = 3.1), indicating a rather mildly cognitively impaired study population; however, 39.4% scored &#8805; 26, thus being cognitively unimpaired.

432865,From the Editor: The COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Structural characterization of infection- and vaccination-elicited antibodies in complex with antigen provides insight into the evolutionary arms race between the host and the pathogen and informs rational vaccine immunogen design. We isolated a germline-like monoclonal antibody (mAb) from plasmablasts activated upon mRNA vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and determined its structure in complex with the spike glycoprotein by cryo-EM. We show that the mAb engages a previously uncharacterized neutralizing epitope on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). The high-resolution structure reveals details of the intermolecular interactions and shows that the mAb inserts its HCDR3 loop into a hydrophobic NTD cavity previously shown to bind a heme metabolite, biliverdin. We demonstrate direct competition with biliverdin and that - because of the conserved nature of the epitope - the mAb maintains binding to viral variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our study illustrates the feasibility of targeting the NTD to achieve broad neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","Altomare, Clara Gilda; Adelsberg, Daniel Cole; Carreno, Juan Manuel; Sapse, Iden Avery; Amanat, Fatima; Ellebedy, Ali; Simon, Viviana; Krammer, Florian; Bajic, Goran",,,434

This study analyzed the application of classic prescriptions in the diagnosis and treatment schemes based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Schemes for Coronavirus Disease at the country, provincial and municipal levels, and further explored its disrobing effect on COVID-19 disease severe phase network, and selected representative prescriptions for core target screening and gene enrichment analysis, so as to reveal its mechanism of action. Among them, 13 prescriptions were found to be used for 10 times or more, including Maxing Shigan Tang, Yinqiao San, Shengjiang San, Dayuan Drink, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. In addition, the COVID-19 efficacy prediction analysis platform(TCMATCOV platform) was used to calculate the network disturbances of the Chinese classic prescriptions involved. Based on the prediction results, 68 classic prescriptions were assessed on the COVID-19 disease network robustness disturbance. The average disturbance scores for the interaction confidence scores were ranked to be 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 from the highest to the lowest. There were 7 prescriptions with a score of 17 or more, and 50 prescriptions with a score of 13 or more. Among them, the top three prescriptions were Ganlu Xiaodu Dan(18.19), Lengxiao Wan(17.74), and Maxing Shigan Tang(17.62). After further mining the action targets of these three prescriptions, it was found that COVID-19 disease-specific factors Ccl2, IL10, IL6 and TNF were all the targets of three prescriptions. Through the enrichment analysis of the biological processes of the core targets, it was found that the three prescriptions may prevent the development of the disease by affecting cell-to-cell adhesion, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and chronic inflammatory responses to COVID-19 at the severe phase. This study showed that the TCMATCOV platform could evaluate the disturbance effect of different prescriptions on the COVID-19 disease network, and predict potential effectiveness based on the robustness of drug-interfered pneumonia disease networks, so as to provide a reference for further experiments or clinical verification.","Tang, Xuan; Tong, Lin; Guo, Fei-Fei; Tang, Shi-Huan; Yang, Hong-Jun",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,,434

434147,Increased Use of Blood Transfusions to Manage Urological Conditions during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Binary decision-making process is ubiquitous in social life and is of vital significance in many real-world issues, ranging from public health to political campaigns. While continuous opinion evolution independent of discrete choice behavior has been extensively studied, few works unveil how the group binary decision-making result is determined by the coupled dynamics of these two processes. To this end, we propose an agent-based model to study the collective behaviors of individual binary decision-making process through competitive opinion dynamics on social networks. Three key factors are considered: bounded confidence that describes the cognitive scope of the population, stubbornness level that characterizes the opinion updating speed, and the opinion strength that represents the asymmetry power or attractiveness of the two choices. We find that bounded confidence plays an important role in determining competing evolution results. As bounded confidence grows, population opinions experience polarization to consensus, leading to the emergence of phase transition from co-existence to winner-takes-all state under binary decisions. Of particular interest, we show how the combined effects of bounded confidence and asymmetry opinion strength may reverse the initial supportive advantage in competitive dynamics. Notably, our model qualitatively reproduces the important dynamical pattern during a brutal competition, namely, cascading collapse, as observed by real data. Finally and intriguingly, we find that individual cognitive heterogeneity can bring about randomness and unpredictability in binary decision-making process, leading to the emergence of indeterministic oscillation. Our results reveal how the diverse behavioral patterns of binary decision-making can be interpreted by the complicated interactions of the proposed elements, which provides important insights toward competitive dynamics","Chen, Xuyang; Wang, Xin; Liu, Longzhao; Tang, Shaoting; Zheng, Zhiming",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11616v1.pdf,434

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with preexisting MG presenting with concurrent COVID-19 between September 21st and November 4th, 2020 when attending the emergency department or routine neurology consultation at the National Institute Mongi Ben Hamida of Neurology of Tunis, Tunisia. RESULTS: Five patients were identified. The Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America scores (MGFA) prior to COVID-19 infection were class I in one patient, class II (IIa, IIb) in two patients, and class IIIb in one patient. Four patients had mild to moderate courses of COVID-19 infection. One patient presented a critical infection with acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Two of them also demonstrated signs of MG exacerbation requiring the use of intravenous immunoglobulin in one case. We maintained immunosuppressant therapy to MG in all our patients. All our patients received Azithromycin (AZM) as a part of specific drug treatment of COVID-19 infection. Outcome was favorable in 4 patients and rapidly fatal evolution was observed in the patient with ADRS. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION: The results from our study suggest that prior MG activity could partially influence the subsequent clinical outcomes. It emerged also that ongoing long-term immunosuppressive immunotherapy to MG should be maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic and that AZM can be used safely in MG patients and concurrent COVID-19 infection.","Saied, Zakaria; Rachdi, Amine; Thamlaoui, Saber; Nabli, Fatma; Jeridi, Cyrine; Baffoun, Nader; Kaddour, Chokri; Belal, Samir; Ben Sassi, Samia",Acta neurol. scand,,434

SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells through ACE2 receptors, leading to COVID-19-related pneumonia. The rapid increase in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control of COVID-19 extremely serious. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays remain the molecular test of choice for the etiologic diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection while radiographic findings (chest computed tomography [CT]) and antibody-based techniques are being introduced as supplemental tools. Novel virus also cause chronic damage to the cardiovascular system, and attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during treatment for COVID-19. Acute cardiac injury determined by elevated high-sensitivity troponin levels is commonly observed in severe cases and is strongly associated with mortality. This review suggests that cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with COVID-19 and such patients are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The continuation of clinically indicated ACE inhibitor and ARB medications is recommended in COVID-19. We review the basics of coronaviruses, novel molecular targets for the coronaviruses with a focus on COVID-19, along with their effects on the cardiovascular system.","Srivastava, Kamna",IJC Heart Vascul.,,434

Employing both Delphi and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods, three stakeholder groups are surveyed: academicians; hotel managers; and, hotel customers. Results reveal that three traditional CSR domains (legal, ethical, and social/philanthropic) are primary contributors to CSR performance, followed by two new environmental domains (room and restaurant; other general areas), and financial/economic domains as secondary contributors. This study shows the high level of consistency in the responses from stakeholder groups, supporting the effectiveness of the scale as a valuable tool to measure hotel CSR performance. Notably, domain weighted scores do differ slightly by respondent characteristic, indicating that the impacts of CSR are sensitive to respondent diversity.","Wong, Antony King Fung; Kim, Seongseop; Lee, Suna; Elliot, Statia",J.

Maxwell suggested that a cluster of particles embedded in an infinite medium subjected to a uniform electrical field has the same far-field asymptotic as an equivalent sphere whose conductivity is equal to the effective one; this yields closed-form formula for the effective conductivity. Our review focuses on subsequent developments of Maxwell's idea in various applications and on its range of applicability. The conclusion is that, 145 years later, the methodology is still alive and well.","Sevostianov, I; Mogilevskaya, S G; Kushch, V I",Int J Eng Sci,,434

Coronavirus's morbidity and its status as a global pandemic transmittable from one person to another has subsequently intensified the personal perception of distress. The projected shortage of vital medical equipment to fight coronavirus due to daily increases in COVID-19 cases creates social unrest. The world confronts perpetual news about high numbers of coronavirus cases, more people in quarantine, and more deaths; those not infected feel increasing fear about its proximity. Social media, print media, and electronic sources offer much advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection. Pandemics extend beyond pathophysiology and medical phenomena to associations with intense psychosocial impact. Studies have established that people with existing mental disorders are prone to relapses, the fear of faulty COVID-19 prevention measures, distress, and suicidal thoughts during pandemics. Precautionary measures aim to slow the spread of coronavirus, but these radical repetitive measures create great anxiety in the mental health of individuals suffering from OCD. Despite the nature of their conditions, these people must adhere to routine processes, such as washing hands, wearing masks and gloves, and sanitizing hands. Given the asymptomatic nature of people suffering from OCD, the routine measures for addressing COVID-19 have a hectic and adverse effect on their mental health and their state of relaxation. Through a systematic literature review, this paper provides insight into the coronavirus pandemic's implications for OCD symptoms.","Sulaimani, Mona F; Bagadood, Nizar H",Rev. environ. health,,434

Moreover the difference between predictions of classic constant parameter epidemiological models and those with variation and stochastic evolution can be reduced to simple""convexity""formulas. A novel feature of this approach is that we do not attempt to locate a true model but only a model that is equivalent after permutations. Convexity adjustments can also be used for cross sectional comparisons and we derive easy to use rules of thumb for estimating threshold infection level in one region given knowledge of threshold infection in another.","Cotton, Peter",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07341v2.pdf,434

We test the predictive power of a wide range of determinants on bitcoins' price direction under the continuous transfer entropy approach as a feature selection criterion. Accordingly, the statistically significant assets in the sense of permutation test on the nearest neighbour estimation of local transfer entropy are used as features or explanatory variables in a deep learning classification model to predict the price direction of bitcoin. The proposed variable selection methodology excludes the NASDAQ index and Tesla as drivers. Under different scenarios and metrics, the best results are obtained using the significant drivers during the pandemic as validation. In the test, the accuracy increased in the post-pandemic scenario of July 2020 to January 2021 without drivers.

438954,"The COVID-19 Pandemic and State Healthcare Capacity: Government Responses and Citizen Assessments in Estonia, Georgia, and Ukraine",2021,"There is a growing appreciation that the regulation of the melatonergic pathways, both pineal and systemic, may be an important aspect in how viruses drive the cellular changes that underpin their control of cellular function. We review the melatonergic pathway role in viral infections, emphasizing influenza and covid-19 infections. Viral, or preexistent, suppression of pineal melatonin disinhibits neutrophil attraction, thereby contributing to an initial ""cytokine storm"", as well as the regulation of other immune cells. Melatonin induces the circadian gene, Bmal1, which disinhibits the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), countering viral inhibition of Bmal1/PDC. PDC drives mitochondrial conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), thereby increasing the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP production. Pineal melatonin suppression attenuates this, preventing the circadian ""resetting"" of mitochondrial metabolism. This is especially relevant in immune cells, where shifting metabolism from glycolytic to oxidative phosphorylation, switches cells from reactive to quiescent phenotypes. Acetyl-CoA is a necessary cosubstrate for arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, providing an acetyl group to serotonin, and thereby initiating the melatonergic pathway. Consequently, pineal melatonin regulates mitochondrial melatonin and immune cell phenotype. Virus- and cytokine-storm-driven control of the pineal and mitochondrial melatonergic pathway therefore regulates immune responses. Virus-and cytokine storm-driven changes also increase gut permeability and dysbiosis, thereby suppressing levels of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate, and increasing circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The alterations in butyrate and LPS can promote viral replication and host symptom severity via impacts on the melatonergic pathway. Focussing on immune regulators has treatment implications for covid-19 and other viral infections.","Anderson, George; Reiter, Russel J",Rev Med Virol,,434

However, a severe post-infectious inflammatory process known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children has been observed in association with COVID-19. This inflammatory process is a result of an abnormal immune response with similar clinical features to Kawasaki disease. It is well established that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children is associated with myocardial dysfunction, coronary artery dilation or aneurysms, and occasionally arrhythmias. The most common electrocardiographic abnormalities seen include premature atrial or ventricular ectopy, variable degrees of atrioventricular block, and QTc prolongation, and rarely, haemodynamically significant arrhythmias necessitating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. However, presentation with fever, hypotension, and relative bradycardia with a left axis idioventricular rhythm has not been previously reported.

Measures undertaken to contain the spread of the virus are far-reaching, and older adults were among the first groups to experience restrictions on face-to-face contact. Although reducing viral transmission is critical, physical distancing is associated with negative psychosocial implications, such as increased rates of depression and anxiety. Promising evidence suggests that participatory digital co-design, defined as the combination of user-centered design and community engagement models, is associated with increased levels of engagement with mobile technologies among individuals with mental health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted shortcomings of existing technologies and challenges in their uptake and usage; however, strategies such as co-design may be leveraged to address these challenges both in the adaptation of existing technologies and the development of new technologies. By incorporating these strategies, it is hoped that we can offset some of the negative mental health implications for older adults in the context of physical distancing both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Cosco, Theodore D; Fortuna, Karen; Wister, Andrew; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin; Sixsmith, Andrew",J Med Internet Res,,434

Strategies have been developed to improve vaccines' performance in terms of broadly reactive and long-lasting immune response induction. AREAS COVERED: We have summarized the advancements in the development of cross-protective influenza vaccines and discussed the challenges in evaluating them in preclinical and clinical trials. Here, the literature regarding the current stage of development of universal influenza vaccine candidates was reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Although various strategies aim to redirect adaptive immune responses from variable immunodominant to immunosubdominant antigens, more conserved epitopes are being investigated. Approaches that improve antibody responses to conserved B cell epitopes have increased the protective efficacy of vaccines within a subtype or phylogenetic group of influenza viruses. Vaccines that elicit significant levels of T cells recognizing highly conserved viral epitopes possess a high cross-protective potential and may cover most circulating influenza viruses. However, the development of T cell-based universal influenza vaccines is challenging owing to the diversity of MHCs in the population, unpredictable degree of immunodominance, lack of adequate animal models, and difficulty in establishing T cell immunity in humans.

DESIGN: Prospective phase I clinical trial. SETTING: Medical center in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. PATIENTS: Moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO2/FIO2 ratio less than 200. INTERVENTIONS: Scaling for doses was required by Taiwan Food and Drug Administration as follows: the first three patients received low-dose human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (1.0 × 10 cells/kg), the next three patients with intermediate dose (5.0 × 10 cells/kg), and the final three patients with high dose (1.0 × 10 cells/kg) between December 2017 and August 2019. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Nine consecutive patients were enrolled into the study. In-hospital mortality was 33.3% (3/9), including two with recurrent septic shock and one with ventilator-induced severe pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. No serious prespecified cell infusion-associated or treatment-related adverse events was identified in any patient. Serial flow-cytometric analyses of circulating inflammatory biomarkers (CD14CD33/CD11b+CD16+/CD16+MPO+/CD11b+MPO+/CD14CD33+) and mesenchymal stem cell markers (CD26+CD45-/CD29+CD45-/CD34+CD45-/CD44+CD45-/CD73+CD45-/CD90+CD45-/CD105+CD45-/CD26+CD45-) were notably progressively reduced (p for trend < 0.001), whereas the immune cell markers (Helper-T-cell/Cytotoxity-T-cell/Regulatory-T-cell) were notably increased (p for trend < 0.001) after cell infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The result of this phase I clinical trial showed that a single-dose IV infusion of human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells was safe with favorable outcome in nine acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.","Yip, Hon-Kan; Fang, Wen-Feng; Li, Yi-Chen; Lee, Fan-Yen; Lee, Chen-Hsiang; Pei, Sung-Nan; Ma, Ming-Chun; Chen, Kuan-Hung; Sung, Pei-Hsun; Lee, Mel S",Crit Care Med,,434
442848,The Decline of the Experimental Paradigm During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Template for the Future,2020,"Preliminary reports suggest that the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has led to disproportionate morbidity and mortality among historically disadvantaged populations. We investigate the racial and socioeconomic associations of COVID- 19 hospitalization among 418,794 participants of the UK Biobank, of whom 549 (0.13%) had been hospitalized. Both Black participants (odds ratio 3.7; 95%CI 2.5-5.3) and Asian participants (odds ratio 2.2; 95%CI 1.5-3.2) were at substantially increased risk as compared to White participants. We further observed a striking gradient in COVID- 19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend Deprivation Index - a composite measure of socioeconomic deprivation - and household income. Adjusting for socioeconomic factors and cardiorespiratory comorbidities led to only modest attenuation of the increased risk in Black participants, adjusted odds ratio 2.4 (95%CI 1.5-3.7). These observations confirm and extend earlier preliminary and lay press reports of higher morbidity in non-White individuals in the context of a large population of participants in a national biobank. The extent to which this increased risk relates to variation in pre-existing comorbidities, differences in testing or hospitalization patterns, or additional disparities in social determinants of health warrants further study.","Patel, Aniruddh P; Paranjpe, Manish D; Kathiresan, Nina P; Rivas, Manuel A; Khera, Amit V",Int J Equity Health,,434

444398,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food price indexes and data collection,2020,"BackgroundThe Algerian COVID-19 vaccination campaign, which started by the end of January 2021, is marked by a slowly ascending curve despite the deployed resources. To tackle the issue, we assessed the levels and explored determinants of engagement towards the COVID-19 vaccine among the Algerian population. MethodsA nationwide, online-based cross-sectional study was conducted between March 27 and April 30, 2021. A two-stage stratified snowball sampling method was used to include an equivalent number of participants from the four cardinal regions of the country. A vaccine engagement scale was developed, defining vaccine engagement as a multidimensional parameter (5 items) that combined self-stated acceptance and willingness with perceived safety and efficacy of the vaccine. An Engagement score was calculated and the median was used to define engagement versus nonengagement. Sociodemographic and clinical data, perceptions about COVID-19 and levels of adherence to preventive measures were analyzed as predictors for nonengagement. ResultsWe included 1,019 participants, 54% were female and 64% were aged 18-29 years. Overall, there were low rates of self-declared acceptance (26%) and willingness (21%) to take the vaccine, as well as low levels of agreement regarding vaccine safety (21%) and efficacy (30%). Thus, vaccine engagement rate was estimated at 33.5%, and ranged between 29.6-38.5% depending on the region (p>0.05). Nonengagement was independently associated with female gender (OR=2.31, p<0.001), low adherence level to preventive measures (OR=6.93p<0.001), private sector jobs (OR=0.53, p=0.038), perceived COVID-19 severity (OR=0.66, p=0.014), and fear from contracting the disease (OR=0.56, p=0.018). Concern about vaccine side effects (72.0%) and exigence for more efficacy and safety studies (48.3%) were the most commonly reported barrier and enabler for vaccine acceptance respectively; whereas beliefs in the conspiracy theory were reported by 23.4%. ConclusionsThe very low rates of vaccine engagement among the Algerian population probably explain the slow ascension of the vaccination curve in the country. Vaccine awareness campaigns should be implemented to address the multiple misconceptions and enhance the levels of knowledge and perception both about the disease and the vaccine, by prioritizing target populations and engaging both healthcare workers and the general population.","Kacimi, Salah Eddine Oussama; Klouche-Djedid, Selma Nihel; Riffi, Omar; Belaouni, Hadj Ahmed; Yasmine, Farah; Taouza, Fatma Asma; Belakhdar, Yasmine; Fellah, Saliha Chiboub; Benmelouka, Amira Yasmine; Ahmed, Shoaib; Aloulou, Mohammad; Bendelhoum, Abdellah; Merzouk, Hafida; Ghozy, Sherief; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Haireche, Mohamed Amine",,,434
444424,The Rights of Elders in Ireland during COVID-19,2021,"Today, reverse logistics (RL) is one of the main activities of supply chain management that covers all physical activities associated with return products (such as collection, recovery, recycling and destruction). In this regard, the designing and proper implementation of RL, in addition to increasing the level of customer satisfaction, reduces inventory and transportation costs. In this paper, in order to minimize the costs associated with fixed costs, material flow costs, and the costs of building potential centres, a complex integer linear programming model for an integrated direct logistics and RL network design is presented. Due to the outbreak of the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020 and the consequent increase in medical waste, the need for an inverse logistics system to manage waste is strongly felt. Also, due to the worldwide vaccination in the near future, this waste will increase even more and careful management must be done in this regard. For this purpose, the proposed RL model in the field of COVID-19 waste management and especially vaccine waste has been designed. The network consists of three parts - factory, consumers' and recycling centres - each of which has different sub-parts. Finally, the proposed model is solved using the cuckoo optimization algorithm, which is one of the newest and most powerful meta-heuristic algorithms, and the computational results are presented along with its sensitivity analysis.","Shadkam, Elham",Waste Manag Res,,434

Therefore, it remains important to identify risk factors for death in critically patients. METHODS: We collected demographic and clinical data on all severe inpatients with COVID-19. We used univariable and multivariable Cox regression methods to determine the independent risk factors related to likelihood of 28-day and 60-day survival, performing survival curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 325 patients enrolled in the study, Multi-factor Cox analysis showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with basic illness (hazard ratio [HR] 6.455, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.658-25.139, P = 0.007), lymphopenia (HR 0.373, 95% CI 0.148-0.944, P = 0.037), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score on admission (HR 1.171, 95% CI 1.013-1.354, P = 0.033) and being critically ill (HR 0.191, 95% CI 0.053-0.687, P = 0.011). Increasing 28-day and 60-day mortality, declining survival time and more serious inflammation and organ failure were associated with lymphocyte count < 0.8 × 109/L, SOFA score > 3, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score > 7, PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg, IL-6 > 120 pg/ml, and CRP > 52 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Being critically ill and lymphocyte count, SOFA score, APACHE II score, PaO2/FiO2, IL-6, and CRP on admission were associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients.","Gao, Jinghua; Zhong, Li; Wu, Ming; Ji, Jingjing; Liu, Zheying; Wang, Conglin; Xie, Qifeng; Liu, Zhifeng",BMC Infect Dis,,434

Although several clinical trials have evaluated the use of convalescent plasma containing virus-neutralizing antibodies, the levels of neutralizing antibodies are usually not assessed and the effectiveness has not been proven. We show that hamsters treated prophylactically with a 1:2560 titer of human convalescent plasma or a 1:5260 titer of monoclonal antibody were protected against weight loss, had a significant reduction of virus replication in the lungs and showed reduced pneumonia . Interestingly, this protective effect was lost with a titer of 1:320 of convalescent plasma. These data highlight the importance of screening plasma donors for high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Our data show that prophylactic administration of high levels of neutralizing antibody, either monoclonal or from convalescent plasma, prevent severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in a hamster model, and could be used as an alternative or complementary to other antiviral treatments for COVID-19.","Haagmans, Bart L; Noack, Danny; Okba, Nisreen M A; Li, Wentao; Wang, Chunyan; Bestebroer, Theo; de Vries, Rory; Herfst, Sander; de Meulder, Dennis; Verveer, Elwin; van Run, Peter; Lamers, Mart M; Rijnders, Bart; Rokx, Casper; van Kuppeveld, Frank; Grosveld, Frank; Drabek, Dubravka; GeurtsvanKessel, Corine; Koopmans, Marion; Bosch, Berend Jan; Kuiken, Thijs; Rockx, Barry",J. infect. dis,,434

During the COVID-19 outbreak, numerous schools and universities have had to close. Ensuring pedagogical continuity requires alternatives to the traditional classroom, especially in medical education. Usual distance learning tools such as videos and downloadable handouts are not sufficient to promote efficient teaching. Distance learning requires self-motivation and does not give you direct access to your instructor. Some students fear the loss of human contact with an instructor - like asking questions during and after class - which promotes learning, understanding and communication. Moreover, classical distance learning methods do not offer immediate feedback that can help students in their understanding of the lecture. In this context, interactive pedagogic tools (IPT) could be useful for medical education continuity and for maintaining human contact necessary in pedagogy. We briefly evaluated interactive pedagogic tool compared to traditionnal distancial tools on medical students. This study showed the importance to have direct contact with a teacher and feedback during a lecture and to not exclusively perform distance learning without direct interaction and feedback. Hence, in the present context, we encourage teacher to use this type of tools to maintain direct interaction with students - which is essential in pedagogy - and ensure a qualitative pedagogical continuity.","Grzych, Guillaume; Schraen-Maschke, Susanna",Ann Biol Clin (Paris),,434

Since then, it has continued to spread rapidly in numerous countries, while the search for effective therapeutic options persists. Coronaviruses, including SARS­CoV­2, are known to suppress and evade the antiviral responses of the host organism mediated by interferon (IFN), a family of cytokines that plays an important role in antiviral defenses associated with innate immunity, and has been used therapeutically for chronic viral diseases and cancer. On the other hand, OncoTherad, a safe and effective immunotherapeutic agent in the treatment of non­muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), increases IFN signaling and has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for COVID­19 in a case report that described the rapid recovery of a 78­year­old patient with NMIBC with comorbidities. The present review discusses the possible synergistic action of OncoTherad with vitamin D, zinc and glutamine, nutrients that have been shown to facilitate immune responses mediated by IFN signaling, as well as the potential of this combination as a therapeutic option for COVID­19.","Name, José João; Vasconcelos, Andrea Rodrigues; Souza, Ana Carolina Remondi; Fávaro, Wagner José",Int J Mol Med,,434

Grounded in the edutainment approach, we explored how songs are being used to create awareness about COVID-19 in Ghana, a sub-Saharan African country. YouTube was searched, and 28 songs met the study inclusion criteria. We conducted a thematic analysis of the song lyrics. Most lyrics were in English, Ghanaian Pidgin English, Akan, Ga, or Dagbani. Reflecting the multilingual population of Ghana, half of the songs contained three languages to convey their message, and only five songs were in one language. Eight themes emerged from the analysis: public health guidelines, COVID-19 is real and not a hoax, COVID-19 is infectious, prayer as method to stop the virus, emotional reaction and disruption of ""everyday"" activities; verbally expelling the virus, call for unity and collective efforts, and inspiring hope. We show that songs have the potential as a method for rapidly sharing information about emerging public health crises. Even though, it is beyond the scope of this study to draw conclusions about the reception and impact of songs on awareness and knowledge, the study shows that examining song lyrics can still be useful in understanding local attitudes toward COVID-19, as well as strategies for promoting preventive behaviors. We note that additional multidimensional efforts are needed to increase awareness among the general public about the COVID-19 pandemic.","Thompson, Rachel G A; Nutor, Jerry John; Johnson, Julene K",Front Public Health,,434

We compared two demonstrative countries: France who applied strict lockdown rules (n=26,196) and Germany, who applied partial lockdown (n=26,847). Subgroup analysis was conducted in users of activity trackers and home blood pressure monitors (HBPM). Linear growth curve modeling and clustering trajectories analyses were performed Results: During lockdown a signi ficant reduction in PWV, weight, BP and physical activity was observed in the overall population. PWV reduction was signi fi-cantly greater in France than in Germany, corresponding to an improvement of 5.2 months in vascular age In the French population three clusters of PWV trajectories were identi fied: decreasing (21.1%), stable (60.6%) and increasing PWV (18.2%). Decreasing and increasing PWV clusters had both higher PWV and vascular age at baseline compared to stable PWV cluster. Only decreasing PWV cluster showed a signi ficant weight reduction (-400 g), whereas living alone was associated with increasing PWV Conclusions: Total lockdown induced a reduction in vascular stiffness in a signi ficant proportion of French smart scale users.

While marginal food security falls next to high food security on the spectrum, new quantitative research indicates marginal food security status is associated with negative health outcomes and poor academic performance among college students. Qualitative research focusing on college students experiencing marginal food security has not been conducted. The current study aims to qualitatively explore experiences of college students with marginal food security and to identify themes to better understand and provide context regarding how marginal food security impacts students. DESIGN: Students were recruited for semi-structured interviews with questions designed to study the challenges associated with students' food situations. All interviews were recorded and transcribed with themes identified via an inductive approach. SETTING: A large public university on the US west coast. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty college students. RESULTS: Key themes that emerged: purchasing cheap unhealthy foods, insufficient time to prepare and eat meals on a regular basis, stress and anxiety around the inability to eat healthy food and future health issues, self-perception of health when eating poorly along with physical symptoms and low academic motivation by not fully participating in their courses due to few healthy food options or missing meals. CONCLUSION: Marginal food security can potentially diminish students' health and their capacity to learn and succeed in their coursework. The results emphasise that students experiencing marginal food security should not be grouped with students experiencing high food security.","Gamba, Ryan J; Schmeltz, Michael T; Ortiz, Nancy; Engelman, Alina; Lam, Juleen; Ampil, Adianez; Pritchard, Maria M; Santillan, Joshua Kier Adrian; Rivera, Esteban S; Wood, Lana Mariko; Ingram, Darice; Cheyne, Kate; Taylor, Sarah",Public Health Nutr,,434

Athletes and their entourage experience this uncertainty as stressful. Sport psychology practitioners (SPPs) are in a key position to support athletes in coping with these unforeseeable stressors. However, SPPs are similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneously have to cope with stress. Salutogenesis, which describes how to manage stress and to stay well, provides a theoretical approach to how to cope with uncertainty. The salutogenetic approach aims at strengthening individuals' sense of coherence (SoC) and consists of three components, namely comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Although it is known that the SoC can be enhanced via psychological skills training, so far, this approach has not been systematically applied to the elite sport context. Athletes have been advised to see SPPs for help;thus, the question of how SPPs handle the time of uncertainty while supporting others emerges. The aim of this contribution was to outline how the salutogenetic approach can be applied to strengthening SPPs' SoC via a single-day four-part workshop. Additionally, we applied the workshop to N = 26 volleyball coaches and evaluated the workshop's effects on participants' psychological aspects [i.e., the Sense of Coherence-Leipziger short version (SoC-L9), resilience (RS-13): coping with uncertainty, affective response, and stress via semantic differentials] and the workshop's quality ratings (i.e., Quality Questionnaire for Sport Psychological Coaching, QS-17). The evaluation provides results that show a positive impact on a descriptive level of the participants' SoC, uncertainty, affect, and stress perception;however, the results show no significant main effect of time [F(8, 10) = 1.04, p = 0.467, eta p 2 = 0.454]. Workshop quality (on average, 3.60 +/- 0.35 out of 4.00) and skill acquisition (on average, 3.00 +/- 0.64 out of 4.00) were positively evaluated;82.00% of the participants would use the learned tools in the future. Thus, we outline how this workshop might help strengthen SPPs' SoC and at the same time empower them to strengthen their athletes' SoC. Overall, we add a theoretical (i.e., salutogenesis in sports) and a practical perspective (i.e., coping techniques based on salutogenesis) on how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for SPPS, athletes, and their support network.","Leisterer, S.; Lautenbach, F.; Walter, N.; Kronenberg, L.; Elbe, A.

Patients in incubation period and healthy carriers are possible sources for transmission. However, such sources of infection cannot be effectively identified due to the symptoms absent. The research evidence is very lacking so far, although there are a few studies suggesting that presymptomatic or asymptomatic carrier may cause COVID-19 transmission. Nearly half of the literature is in the state of preprint without peer review. The question of ""the degree to which presymptomatic or asymptomatic infections can transmit"" is not fully understood. There is an urgent need to screen infected carriers in larger close contacts or in the general population, and assess their risk for transmission.","Gao, W J; Li, L M",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,434

We described epidemiological data and observed the impact of control measures on the epidemic.Of the 219 cases (110 men and 109 women), 88 (40%) had exposure to Wuhan. The median age was 48 years (range, 2-88 years; IQR, 35-60). Thirty-three severe patients with a median age of 66 years (range, 33-82 years, IQR, 57-76) were treated in intensive care units; out of these patients, 66.7% (22) were men and 19 (57.5%) had chronic diseases, including hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Under the control measures, the number of new patients gradually decreased and nearly disappeared after 18 days. Wearing masks in all kinds of situations prevents most infections and is one of the most effective prevention and control measures.In conclusion, all people are susceptible to COVID-19, and older males and those with comorbid conditions are more likely to become severe cases. Even though COVID-19 is highly contagious, control measures have proven to be very effective, particularly wearing masks, which could prevent most infections.","Gao, Qijun; Hu, Yingfu; Dai, Zhiguo; Xiao, Feng; Wang, Jing; Wu, Jing",Medicine (Baltimore),,434

448055,"[Systemic Racism and health inequalities, a sanitary emergency revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic]",2020,"The infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a serious global pandemic. Different studies have shown that increasing temperature can play a crucial role in the spread of the virus. Most of these studies were limited to winter or moderate temperature levels and were conducted using conventional models. However, traditional models are too simplistic to investigate complex, non-linear relationships and suffer from some restrictions. Therefore, we employed copula models to examine the impact of high temperatures on virus transmission. The findings from the copula models showed that there was a weak to moderate effect of temperature on the number of infections and the effect almost vanished under a lockdown policy. Therefore, this study provides new insight into the relationship between COVID-19 and temperature, both with and without social isolation practices. Such results can lead to improvements in our understanding of this new virus. In particular, the results derived from the copula models examined here, unlike existing traditional models, provide evidence that there is no substantial influence of high temperatures on the active COVID-19 outbreak situation. In addition, the results indicate that the transmission of COVID-19 is strongly influenced by social isolation practices. To the best of the author knowledge, this is the first copula model investigation applied to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Alanazi, Fadhah Amer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10265v1.pdf,434

449874,'What is Inconvenient for You is Life-saving for Me': How Health Inequities are playing out during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background and objectivesThe COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized as a cause of direct and indirect psychological consequences that impact mental health such as acute stress disorders, anxiety, irritability, poor concentration, and insomnia. This study was planned to evaluate the sleep quality and mental health of undergraduate students amidst the COVID-19 lockdown of 2021. Materials and MethodsThis observational cross-sectional study was conducted in Lahore, Pakistan, where 261 undergraduate medical and dental students enrolled at a private medical and dental school were approached from March to May 2021. The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to identify the sleep quality along with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) to establish anxiety symptoms and the Physical Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression symptoms. ResultsThe results show that 212 (81.2%) female and 49 (18.8%) male students participated in the study. Of the participants 75.1% experienced poor sleep quality, 90% had symptoms of depression, and 85.4% had symptoms of anxiety. The mean score on the PSQI scale was 8.59{+/-}4.10, on the GAD-7 scale was 11.36{+/-}5.94 and on the PHQ-9 scale was 13.70{+/-}6.81. Multiple regression analysis showed that anxiety symptoms ({beta} = 0.315, p = 0.000) and depression symptoms ({beta} = 0.398, p = 0.000) were significant predictors of sleep quality amongst the undergraduate medical and dental students. ConclusionA high majority of the study participants are experiencing poor sleep quality along with suffering from depression and anxiety amidst the COVID-19 lockdown. It is concluded from the analysis that anxiety and depression symptoms are significant predictors of sleep quality. Relevant authorities need to set up systems that help undergraduate medical students in alleviating and coping with these symptoms midst the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sheikh, Naveen Siddique; Anwar, Aiza; Pervaiz, Iqra; Arshad, Zunaira; Khan, Huma Saeed; Hafeez, Farida",,,434

Primary diagnosis by whole-slide imaging (WSI) is a key component that would aid departments in providing uninterrupted histopathology diagnosis and maintaining revenue streams from disruption. We sought to perform rapid validation of the use of WSI in primary diagnosis meeting recommendations of the College of American Pathologists guidelines. METHODS: Glass slides from clinically reported cases from 5 participating pathologists with a preset washout period were digitally scanned and reviewed in settings identical to typical reporting. Cases were classified as concordant or with minor or major disagreement with the original diagnosis. Randomized subsampling was performed, and mean concordance rates were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 171 cases were included and distributed equally among participants. For the group as a whole, the mean concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 90) was 83.6% counting all discrepancies and 94.6% counting only major disagreements. The mean pathologist concordance rate in sampled cases (n = 18) ranged from 90.49% to 97%. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel double-blinded method for rapid validation of WSI for primary diagnosis.

Overall, the rate of positive screen for depression (PHQ-9 score &#8805; 11) significantly increased from 48.5% to 63.8% and of those scoring within severe depression range (PHQ-9 &#8805;20) from 10% to 27%; for anxiety (GAD-7 score &#8805; 11) increased from 23.8% to 49.5% and of those scoring within severe anxiety range (GAD-7&#8805;17) from 3.8% to 20.5%. After taking sex and baseline (one month prior to the lockdown) levels of depression and anxiety into account, the level of lockdown experienced distress was predictive of depression and anxiety levels in time of home confinement, accounting for about 30% of variance in symptoms severity scores. Although our results may be subject to sampling and recall bias, the unexpectedly high rates of anxiety and depression warrant an urgent call to action aiming at mitigating and managing mental health risks of senior high school students in future waves of pandemic.","Giannopoulou, Ioanna; Efstathiou, Vasiliki; Triantafyllou, Georgia; Korkoliakou, Panagiota; Douzenis, Athanassios",Psychiatry Res,,434

One of them, proposed by Segreto and Deigin, assumes artificial chimeric construction of SARS-CoV-2 from a backbone of RaTG13-like CoV and receptor binding domain (RBD) of a pangolin MP789-like CoV, followed by serial cell or animal passage. Here we show that this hypothesis relies on incorrect or weak assumptions, and does not agree with the results of comparative genomics analysis. The genetic divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and both its proposed ancestors is too high to have accumulated in a lab, given the timeframe of several years. Furthermore, comparative analysis of S-protein gene sequences suggests that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 probably represents an ancestral non-recombinant variant. These and other arguments significantly weaken the hypothesis of a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2, while the hypothesis of a natural origin is consistent with all available genetic and experimental data.","Tyshkovskiy, Alexander; Panchin, Alexander Y",Bioessays,,434

453208,(Un)covering the COVID-19 pandemic: Framing analysis of the crisis in Canada,2020,"As the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing, the therapeutic gaps in conventional management have highlighted the need for the integration of traditional knowledge systems with modern medicine. Ayurvedic medicines, especially Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal, WS), may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19. WS is a widely prescribed Ayurvedic botanical known as an immunomodulatory, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and adaptogenic agent. The chemical profile and pharmacological activities of WS have been extensively reported. Several clinical studies have reported its safety for use in humans. This review presents a research synthesis of in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (WS) and discusses its potential for prophylaxis and management of COVID-19. We have collated the data from studies on WS that focused on viral infections (HIV, HSV, H1N1 influenza, etc.) and noncommunicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc.). The experimental literature indicates that WS has the potential for 1) maintaining immune homeostasis, 2) regulating inflammation, 3) suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, 4) organ protection (nervous system, heart, lung, liver, and kidney), and 5) anti-stress, antihypertensive, and antidiabetic activities. Using these trends, the review presents a triangulation of Ayurveda wisdom, pharmacological properties, and COVID-19 pathophysiology ranging from viral entry to end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The review proposes WS as a potential therapeutic adjuvant for various stages of COVID-19 management. WS may also have beneficial effects on comorbidities associated with the COVID-19. However, systematic studies are needed to realize the potential of WS for improving clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19.","Saggam, A.; Limgaokar, K.; Borse, S.; Chavan-Gautam, P.; Dixit, S.; Tillu, G.; Patwardhan, B.",Frontiers in Pharmacology,,434

453401,Role of Telemedicine and Mobile Health in Management COVID-19 Pandemic (preprint),2021,"Fertilizer-induced changes in soil nutrients regulate nitrogen (N) fixation in the terrestrial biosphere, but the influences of N and phosphorus (P) fertilization on the diazotroph communities in successive crop seasons were unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of N and P (high vs. low doses) on the abundance and structure of N2-fixation communities after wheat and soybean harvest in a long-term (34 and 35 years) fertilization experiment. In both seasons, long-term N addition significantly decreased the abundance of nifH genes and 16S rDNA; in addition, high doses of N and P fertilizer decreased the richness of diazotrophs, whereas low doses did not. The proportion of the dominant genus, Bradyrhizobium, in the soybean season (86.0%) was higher than that in the wheat season (47.9%). Fertilization decreased diazotroph diversity and the relative abundance of Bradyrhizobium in the wheat season, but had insignificant effects in the soybean season. The addition of N, but not P, significantly changed the communities of both diazotrophs (at the genus level) and rhizobia (at the species level) in the two seasons. Soil pH was positively associated with nifH abundance and diazotrophic richness; soil NO3- content was negatively correlated with diazotrophic richness and positively correlated with diversity. Soil pH and NO3- content were the two main drivers shaping the soil diazotrophic community. Overall, long-term inorganic N had a greater influence than P on both diazotrophic abundance and community composition, and diazotrophic diversity was more clearly affected by fertilization in the wheat season than in the soybean season.","Zhou, Jing; Ma, Mingchao; Guan, Dawei; Jiang, Xin; Zhang, Nianxin; Shu, Fengyue; Kong, Yong; Li, Jun",Sci Rep,,434

453831,Trajectories of COVID-19 vaccine intentions among U.S. adults: The role of race and ethnicity,2021,"Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, can be dispersed and potentially transmitted by aerosols directly or via ventilation systems. We therefore investigated ventilation openings in one COVID-19 ward and central ducts that expel indoor air from three COVID-19 wards at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, during April and May 2020. Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. Central ventilation HEPA filters, located several stories above the wards, were removed and portions analyzed in the same manner. In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19 room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust filters from the ward were found positive for both genes in three samples. Corresponding filters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be taken into consideration for preventive measures.","Nissen, Karolina; Krambrich, Janina; Akaberi, Dario; Hoffman, Tove; Ling, Jiaxin; Lundkvist, Åke; Svensson, Lennart; Salaneck, Erik",Sci Rep,,434

METHODS: Out of the five different classes of DPP-4 inhibitors, two had relatively favourable heart to plasma concentration ratios and anticalcification ability in murine and in vitro experiments and were thus categorised as 'favourable'. We reviewed the medical records of 212 patients (72±8 years, 111 men) with diabetes and mild-to-moderate AS who underwent echocardiographic follow-up and classified them into those who received favourable DPP-4 inhibitors (n=28, 13%), unfavourable DPP-4 inhibitors (n=69, 33%) and those who did not receive DPP-4 inhibitors (n=115, 54%). RESULTS: Maximal transaortic velocity (Vmax) increased from 2.9±0.3 to 3.5±0.7 m/s during follow-up (median, 3.7 years), and the changes were not different between DPP-4 users as a whole and non-users (p=0.143). However, the favourable group showed significantly lower Vmax increase than the unfavourable or non-user group (p=0.018). Severe AS progression was less frequent in the favourable group (7.1%) than in the unfavourable (29.0%; p=0.03) or the non-user (29.6%; p=0.01) group. In Cox regression analysis after adjusting for age, baseline renal function and AS severity, the favourable group showed a significantly lower risk of severe AS progression (HR 0.116, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.551, p=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties were associated with lower risk of AS progression. These results should be considered in the preparation of randomised clinical trials on the repositioning of DPP-4 inhibitors.","Lee, Sahmin; Lee, Seung-Ah; Choi, Bongkun; Kim, Ye-Jee; Oh, Soo Jin; Choi, Hong-Mi; Kim, Eun Kyoung; Kim, Dae-Hee; Cho, Goo-Yeong; Song, Jong-Min; Park, Seung Woo; Kang, Duk-Hyun; Song, Jae-Kwan",Heart,,434

454795,COVID-19 Pandemic in Nigeria: Palliative Measures and the Politics of Vulnerability,2020,"COVID-19 was first confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and is now spreading worldwide. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is sometimes difficult due to the absence of symptoms and its tendency to be masked by other diseases. In this paper, we report a COVID-19 case in which diagnosis was delayed due to aspiration pneumonia. A 64-year-old man visited our department for evaluation of swallowing function. However, during the examination, the patient aspirated testing food and subsequently developed a fever. Based on his medical history and computed tomography (CT) images, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and admitted to the hospital to begin treatment. However, after admission, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and the result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Previous reports have shown that CT images in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were normal in the early phase, and abnormalities usually appeared approximately 6-11 days after onset. Common findings of COVID-19 are consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and a distribution of lesions predominantly in the bilateral inferior lung field periphery. It is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of pneumonia; it should therefore be listed as a differential diagnosis during the current pandemic.","Matsushita, Yutaka; Kurihara, Sho; Omura, Kazuhiro; Kojima, Hiromi",Auris nasus larynx,,434

455036,The Nature of Cities and the Covid-19 Pandemic,2020,"Vaccination programs against COVID-19 are being scaled up. We aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics on vaccine hesitancy among healthcare workers in a multi-center survey conducted within French healthcare facilities from 1 December 2020 to 26 March 2021. We invited any healthcare workers naïve of COVID-19 vaccination to complete an online self-questionnaire. They reported on their socio-demographic characteristics, as well as their perception and beliefs towards vaccination. We measured their willingness to get vaccinated in eight scenarios for candidates’ vaccines presented sequentially (1 to 4-point scale). Candidates’ vaccines varied for efficacy (25%, 50%, 100%), length of immunization (1 year or lifetime), frequency (&lt;1/100, &lt;1/10,000), and severity (none, moderate, severe) of adverse events. We analyzed 4349 healthcare workers’ responses with interpretable questionnaires. The crude willingness to get vaccinated was 53.2% and increased over time. We clustered the trajectories of responses using an unsupervised classification algorithm (k-means) and identified four groups of healthcare workers: those willing to get vaccinated in any scenario (18%), those not willing to get vaccinated at all (22%), and those hesitating but more likely to accept (32%) or reject (28%) the vaccination depending on the scenario. In these last two subgroups, vaccine acceptance was growing with age, educational background and was higher among men with condition. Compared to an ideal vaccine candidate, a 50% reduced efficacy resulted in an average drop in acceptance by 0.8 (SD ± 0.8, −23.5%), while it was ranging from 1.4 (SD ± 1.0, −38.4%) to 2.1 (SD ± 1.0, −58.4%) in case of severe but rare adverse event. The acceptance of a mandatory immunization program was 29.6% overall and was positively correlated to the willingness to get vaccinated, ranging from 2.4% to 60.0%. Even if healthcare workers represent a heterogeneous population, most (80%) could accept the vaccination against COVID-19. Their willingness to get the vaccine increased over time and as immunization programs became available. Among hesitant professionals, the fear of adverse events was the main concern. Targeted information campaigns reassuring about adverse events may increase vaccine coverage, in a population with a strong opinion about mandatory immunization programs.","Janssen, Cécile Maillard Alexis Bodelet Céline Claudel Anne-Laure Gaillat Jacques Delory Tristan Group on behalf of the ACV Alpin Study",Vaccines,,434

456165,Preserving and empowering local languages amidst the Covid-19 pandemic Lessons from East Kalimantan,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between trauma volume and alcohol prohibition during the COVID-19 lockdown in South Africa. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of trauma volume from Worcester Regional Hospital in South Africa from 1 January to 28 December 2020. We compared total volume and incidence rates during five calendar periods; one when alcohol sales were allowed as per normal and four when alcohol sales were completely or partially banned. Poisson regression was used to model differences between alcohol ban and non-ban periods. RESULTS: During the first period (pre-COVID-19, no ban), the trauma admission rate was 95 per 100 days, compared to 39 during the second period (complete ban 1), 74 during the third period (partial ban 1), 40 during the fourth period (complete ban 2) and 105 during the fifth period (partial ban 2). There was a 59-69% decrease in trauma volume between the no ban and complete ban 1 periods. When alcohol sales were partially reinstated, trauma volume significantly increased by 83-90% then dropped again by 39-46% with complete ban 2. By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again (partial ban 2), trauma volume increased by 163-250%, thus returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a clear trend of decreased trauma volume during periods of complete alcohol prohibition compared to non- and partial alcohol bans. This finding suggests that temporary alcohol bans can be used to decrease health facility traffic during national emergencies.","Chu, Kathryn M; Marco, Jenna-Lee; Owolabi, Eyitayo Omolara; Duvenage, Riaan; Londani, Mukhethwa; Lombard, Carl; Parry, Charles D H",Drug alcohol rev,,434
457636,Facing the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Sense of Coherence,2020,"To determine the incidence of acute cardiac injury (ACI), the factors associated with ACI and the in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe patients. All consecutive in-patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during February 1 and March 29, 2020 were included. The demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory, radiological and treatment data were collected. Univariate and Firth logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with ACI and in-hospital mortality, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative in-hospital mortality. Among 1031 patients included, 215 (20.7%) had ACI and 501 (48.6%) were severe cases. Overall, 165 patients died; all were from the severe group, and 131 (79.39%) had ACI. ACI (OR = 2.34, P = 0.009), male gender (OR = 2.58, P = 0.001), oximeter oxygen saturation (OR = 0.90, P < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 3.26, P < 0.001), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (OR = 8.59, P < 0.001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (OR = 3.29, P = 0.016), N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (OR = 2.94, P = 0.001) were independent risk factors for the in-hospital mortality in severe patients. The mortality was significantly increased among severe patients with elevated hs-CRP, IL-6, hs-cTnI, and/or NT-proBNP. Moreover, the mortality was significantly higher in patients with elevation of both hs-cTnI and NT proBNP than in those with elevation of either of them. ACI develops in a substantial proportion of patients with COVID-19, and is associated with the disease severity and in-hospital mortality. A combination of hs-cTnI and NT-proBNP is valuable in predicting the mortality.","He, Xingwei; Wang, Luyan; Wang, Hongjie; Xie, Yang; Yu, Yongfu; Sun, Jianhua; Yan, Jiangbo; Du, Yuxin; Shen, Yin; Zeng, Hesong",Sci Rep,,434

The aim of our study was to assess the effect of stay-at-home orders on glycemic control in children. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 238 children with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of South Alabama. Average Hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels in the year prior to stay-at home orders (May 2019-April 2020) were compared with A1c values during the quarantine period (May 2020-July 2020) using a paired t-test. We also analyzed the change of A1c level with respect to sex, race, type of diabetes, type of insurance, and mode of insulin administration, using a 2-sample t-test. RESULTS: The average A1c significantly increased from 9.2% during the previous year to 9.5% during the quarantine period (p = 0.0097). The increase of A1c was significantly higher in public insurance patients (0.49% increase) compared to private insurance patients (0.03% increase), (p = 0.0137). We also observed a significant association between the direction of change and type of insurance. Forty-eight percent of public insurance patients had an A1c increase of > 0.5% while 54% of private insurance patients had no change or decrease in A1c (p = 0.0079). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in worsening glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes, with those on public insurance affected in greater proportion than those with private insurance.","Gayoso, Miriannette; Lim, Whei Ying; Mulekar, Madhuri S; Kaulfers, Anne-Marie D",Clin Diabetes Endocrinol,,434

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic determined a relevant impact on mental health, due to the infection itself and its socio-economic consequences. The present study is aimed at analyzing the prevalence of suicidality during the Covid-19 pandemic among subjects requiring a psychiatric consultation in an emergency setting. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Socio-demographic and clinical information was collected at the emergency department of the General Hospital of Perugia from June 1st, 2020 to January 31st, 2021. Data was entered into an electronic datasheet and retrospectively analysed. Pearson's bivariate correlation was performed in order to assess significant associations between suicide-related variables and specific socio-demographic and clinical features (p<0.05). RESULTS: Among 447 subjects included in the analysis, 109 (24.4%) showed suicidality-related phenomena, particularly suicide attempts (SA) (n=44, 9.8%), suicidal ideation (SI) (n=41, 9.2%), non suicidal self-injury (NSSI) (n=31, 6.9%), that in some cases co-occurred. A statistically significant association was detected between NSSI and living with marital family (p=0.024) and between suicidality-related phenomena and adjustment disorders (p=0.018). None of the examined subjects reported a previous positivity for Covid-19 and neither did their relatives. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on suicide-related phenomena. Consultation psychiatry fulfills a key role in the early detection and clinical management of these conditions, that require targeted intervention strategies.","Menculini, G.; Moretti, P.; Pandolfi, L.

This epidemiological finding raises the question of whether physiological mechanisms underlying the acclimatization to high altitude identifies therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome pivotal to the reduction of global mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article compares the symptoms of acute mountain sickness (AMS) with those of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explores overlapping patho-physiological mechanisms of the respiratory system including impaired oxygen transport, pulmonary gas exchange and brainstem circuits controlling respiration. In this context, we also discuss the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on oxygen sensing in the carotid body. Finally, since erythropoietin (EPO) is an effective prophylactic treatment for AMS, this article reviews the potential benefits of implementing FDA-approved erythropoietin-based (EPO) drug therapies to counteract a variety of acute respiratory and non-respiratory (e.g. excessive inflammation of vascular beds) symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Soliz, Jorge; Schneider-Gasser, Edith M; Arias-Reyes, Christian; Aliaga-Raduan, Fernanda; Poma-Machicao, Liliana; Zubieta-Calleja, Gustavo; Furuya, Werner I; Trevizan-Baú, Pedro; Dhingra, Rishi R; Dutschmann, Mathias",Respir Physiol Neurobiol,,434
459235,Physical activity of early school-age children in Poland during classes in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic fractures (PPFs) are a growing matter for orthopaedic surgeons, and patients with PPFs may represent a frail target in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether hospital reorganisations during the most severe phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affected standards of care and early outcomes of patients treated for PPFs in Northern Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were retrieved from a multicentre retrospective orthopaedics and traumatology database, including 14 hospitals. The following parameters were studied: demographics, results of nasopharyngeal swabs, prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), comorbidities, general health status (EQ-5D-5L Score), frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale, CFS), pain (visual analogue scale, VAS), anaesthesiologic risk (American Society of Anaesthesiology Score, ASA Score), classification (unified classification system, UCS), type of operation and anaesthesia, in-hospital and early complications (Clavien-Dindo Classification, CDC), and length of stay (LOS). Data were analysed by means of descriptive statistics. Out of 1390 patients treated for any reason, 38 PPFs were included. RESULTS: Median age was 81 years (range 70-96 years). Twenty-three patients (60.5%) were swabbed on admission, and two of them (5.3%) tested positive; in three patients (7.9%), the diagnosis of COVID-19 was established on a clinical and radiological basis. Two more patients tested positive post-operatively, and one of them died due to COVID-19. Thirty-three patients (86.8%) presented a proximal femoral PPF. Median ASA Score was 3 (range, 1-4), median VAS score on admission was 3 (range, 0-6), median CFS was 4 (range, 1-8), median EQ-5D-5L Score was 3 in each one of the categories (range, 1-5). Twenty-three patients (60.5%) developed post-operative complications, and median CDC grade was 3 (range, 1-5). The median LOS was 12.8 days (range 2-36 days), and 21 patients (55.3%) were discharged home. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of PPFs did not seem to change during the lockdown. Patients were mainly elderly with comorbidities, and complications were frequently recorded post-operatively. Despite the difficult period for the healthcare system, hospitals were able to provide effective conventional surgical treatments for PPFs, which were not negatively influenced by the reorganisation. Continued efforts are required to optimise the treatment of these frail patients in the period of the pandemic, minimising the risk of contamination, and to limit the incidence of PPFs in the future.

Only 17 (17%) of the 100 participants experienced a severe asthma exacerbation. Moreover, there was no confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 in this population.Conclusion: Patients with severe asthma did not show higher rates of exacerbations during the pandemic outbreak as well as no increased risk of contracting COVID-19 infection or developing the disease. Self-administration of biological drugs could be useful to maintain high rates of adherence to therapy, and, at the same time, to decrease the risk of exacerbations or Intensive Care Unit (ICU) room access.","Caruso, Cristiano; Colantuono, Stefania; Urbani, Sara; Heffler, Enrico; Canonica, Giorgio Walter; Andriollo, Gloria; Di Michele, Loreta; Scarlata, Simone; Zennaro, Danila; Rigon, Amelia; Vadacca, Marta; Moroni, Rossana; Nucera, Eleonora; Gasbarrini, Antonio",Expert Rev Respir Med,,434

METHODS: In this retrospective single-center study, 117 patients with coexistent COVID-19 and type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. Patients were divided into two groups based on HbA1c values. Clinical data and laboratory parameters were collected from patients' medical records. Also, the chest computed tomography (CT) score was defined by the summation of individual scores from 5 lung lobes: scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were respectively assigned for each lobe if pulmonary involvement was 0%, less than 5%, 5%-25%, 26%-49%, 50%-75%, or more than 75% of each region. RESULTS: Among all patients with diabetes, 93 (79.5%) patients had poorly-controlled diabetes and 24 (20.5%) had well-controlled diabetes; 66 (56.4%) patients were male and the median age was 66 years (IQR, 55-75 years).

Also, the mortality and recovery rates were similar between the two groups (p = 0.54 and p = 0.85, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on the results, clinical outcomes and chest CT severity scores are similar between patients with well-controlled and poorly-controlled diabetes among the Iranian population with COVID-19.","Raoufi, Masoomeh; Khalili, Shayesteh; Mansouri, Mohsen; Mahdavi, Ali; Khalili, Neda",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,434
460046,Future Evolution of COVID-19 Pandemic in North Carolina: Can We Flatten the Curve?,2020-07-03,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has dramatically changed medical practices worldwide. These changes have been aimed both to reallocate resources toward fighting the novel coronavirus and to prevent its transmission during nonurgent medical and surgical interventions. Heart and lung transplantation could not be an exception, as most transplant centers have either restricted their activity to only urgent, lifesaving procedures or stopped these surgical procedures for various periods of time depending on the local virus epidemiology. The effect of this infection on the immunosuppressed heart and lung transplant recipient is still questionable; however, there are limited reports suggesting that there is no increased risk of transmission or more severe disease course compared with that shown in the general population. Transplant organizations have disseminated early recommendations as a guidance in a yet evolving situation. Finally, data suggest that lung transplant could potentially serve as an ultimate, lifesaving procedure for COVID-19-related end-stage respiratory failure in carefully selected patients.","Kapriniotis, Konstantinos; Giannis, Dimitrios; Geropoulos, Georgios; Evangeliou, Alexandros P; Ziogas, Ioannis A; Panagiotopoulos, Nikolaos",Exp. clin. transplant,,434

The immediate actions from both academia and industry have led to the development of many COVID-19 diagnostic systems that have secured fast-track regulatory approvals and have been serving our healthcare frontlines since the early stage of the pandemic. On diagnostic technologies, many of these clinically validated systems have significantly benefited from the recent advances in micro- and nanotechnologies in terms of platform design, analytical method, and system integration and miniaturization. The continued development of new diagnostic platforms integrating micro- and nanocomponents will address some of the shortcomings we have witnessed in the existing COVID-19 diagnostic systems. This Perspective reviews the previous and ongoing research efforts on developing integrated micro- and nanosystems for nucleic acid-based virus detection, and highlights promising technologies that could provide better solutions for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and other viral infectious diseases. With the summary and outlook of this rapidly evolving research field, we hope to inspire more research and development activities to better prepare our society for future public health crises.","Qin, Zhen; Peng, Ran; Baravik, Ilina Kolker; Liu, Xinyu",,,434

Statins could potentiate the ASA therapy. METHODS: This is a series of 14 cases with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients underwent the ASA therapy. Those who had risk factors for vascular disease also underwent the high-potency statin therapy. When symptoms were totally or practically resolved, patients were discharged and advised to continue medications for a complementary time, according to the clinical evolution of each patient. RESULTS: The mean age of monitored patients was 48.6 years. A total of 78.6% patients presented with at least one comorbidity, which could have contributed as a risk factor for a poor prognosis in the evolution of COVID-19. Four patients had secondary bacterial infections; three patients needed hospitalization. None of the cases progress to stage III, and all patients had remission of symptoms, with 100% survival. CONCLUSIONS: the process of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 involves disseminated thrombosis, initially microvascular and later expansion into larger vessels. ASA could act as a secondary prophylaxis and prevent thrombosis from developing and reaching stage III of the disease. As this was a case series, we cannot provide definitive conclusions; however, this study allows us to formulate hypotheses and support clinical trials to evaluate benefits of the ASA therapy in the treatment of COVID-19.","Florêncio, Francisco Kleyton Zacarias; Tenório, Maiza de Oliveira; Macedo Júnior, Aluísio Roberto Andrade; Lima, Sandro Gonçalves de",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,,434
463425,Remote Treatment Delivery in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has affected over 100 countries in a short while, progresses more mortally in elderly patients with comorbidities. In this study, we examined the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the patients aged 60 and over who had been infected with COVID-19. METHODS: The data of the patients admitted to the hospital within 1 month from May 8, 2020 onwards and hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia were obtained from the hospital medical records, and the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters of the patients during the admission to the emergency department were examined. Patients were divided into 2 groups regarding the criteria of having in-hospital mortality (mortality group) and being discharged with full recovery (survivor group). The factors, which could have an impact on the mortality, were investigated using a univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 113 patients aged 60 years and older, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The mean age of the patients was 70.7 ± 7.9, and 64.6% (n = 73) of them were male. The mortality rate was 19.4% (n = 22). Among the comorbid illnesses, only renal failure was significant in the mortality group (p = 0.04). A CURB-65score &#8805;3 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) class &#8805;4 manifested a remarkable discrimination ability to predict 30-day mortality (p < 0.001). When the laboratory parameters were considered, the value of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was significant in predicting mortality in univariate and multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.03-1.21; p = 0.006, and OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.11-2.39; p = 0.044, respectively). CONCLUSION: In our study, NLR was determined to be an independent marker to predict in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19. PSI and CURB-65 revealed a considerably precise prognostic accuracy for the patients with COVID-19 in our study as well. Moreover, thanks to that NLR results in a very short time, it can enable the clinician to predict mortality before the scoring systems are calculated and hasten the management of the patients in the chaotic environment of the emergency room.","Genc Yavuz, Burcu; Colak, Sahin; Guven, Ramazan; Altundag, Ibrahim; Seyhan, Avni Uygar; Gunay Inanc, Rumeysa",Gerontology,,434

Patients with abnormalities in laboratory parameters are more susceptible to COVID-19. Therefore, we explored the association of blood biochemical parameters with severity and mortality of COVID-19 amongst 3695 patients across seventeen studies. MethodsWe searched PubMed, Cochrane library and LitCOVID database until February 28, 2021. Seventeen studies were included in the meta-analysis with 3695 COVID-19 patients. ResultsThe pooled analysis showed that compared to non-severe group, severe group was characterised by significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (standardised mean difference [SMD]: 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23 to 1.06; p<0.001, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (SMD: 0.55, 95%CI: 0.02 to 1.07 p=0.004) and lymphopenia (SMD: -1.22, 95% CI: -2.15 to -0.30; p<0.01), decreased serum albumin (SMD: -1.60, 95% CI: -2.96 to -0.22 ; p<0.001), creatinine (SMD: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.90; p<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)(SMD: -1.54, 95% CI: - 2.27 to -0.80; p=0.002) and haemoglobin (SMD:-0.89, 95% CI: ; p<0.001). Additionally, in the non-survivor group, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (SMD: 1.54 95% CI: -2.27 to 0.80; p=0.002), decreased serum albumin (SMD: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.75 to 1.42; p<0.001) were reported. There was no comorbidity which was found to be significant in the severe group. ConclusionSerum albumin, ALT, ESR, lymphopenia, haemoglobin, and leucocytosis can reflect the severity of COVID-19, while the LDH, leucocytosis and albumin can be considered as risk factor to higher mortality. SummaryOur manuscript discusses the various blood biochemical markers as potential predictors of disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. The timely detection of these parameters can help in providing appropriate course of treatment and reducing the mortality rate in the patients. We have found an association between the blood biochemical markers and disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Serum albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), lymphopenia, hemoglobin, and leukocytosis can reflect the severity of the disease, while the LDH, leukocytosis and albumin can be considered as risk factor to higher mortality.","Majid, Afsha; Mishra, Pinki; Parveen, Rizwana; Bajpai, Ram; Khan, Mohd Ashif; Agarwal, Nidhi Bharal",,,434

Objective: To determine if any significant placental histopathologic changes occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection during pregnancy and whether these changes are correlated with the presence or absence of symptoms associated with the infection. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of women diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who delivered at a single center from April 9, 2020 to April 27, 2020, and had placental specimens reviewed by the Department of Pathology. Women with singleton gestations and laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were eligible for inclusion. Historical controls selected from a cohort of women who delivered 6 months before the study period were matched in a 1:1 fashion by weeks of gestation at delivery. Histopathologic characteristics were evaluated in each placenta, and the incidence of these findings was compared between placentas of those who received a diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and historical controls, and between placentas from patients with or without typical symptoms related to the infection. Statistical analyses included the use of Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test for the comparison of categorical and continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as a P value of <.05. Results: A total of 50 placentas after the diagnosis of maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and 50 historical controls were analyzed. Among the placentas from patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 3 (6%) were preterm (33 3/7, 34 6/7, and 36 6/7 weeks of gestation), 16 (32%) were from patients with typical symptoms related to the infection, and 34 (68%) were from patients without typical symptoms related to the infection. All patients had received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in the third trimester. Decidual vasculopathy was not visualized in any of the placentas from patients diagnosed as having severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. There was no statistically significant difference in placental histopathologic characteristics between the groups. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test results for all neonates at 24 hours of life were negative. Conclusion: Based on the results of this study, there are no significant placental histopathologic changes that occur after the diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in women during the third trimester of pregnancy compared with a gestational age-matched historical control group. Similar incidences of histopathologic findings were also discovered when comparing placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with or without the presence of symptoms typically related to the infection.","Gulersen, Moti; Prasannan, Lakha; Tam Tam, Hima; Metz, Christine N; Rochelson, Burton; Meirowitz, Natalie; Shan, Weiwei; Edelman, Morris; Millington, Karmaine A",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,,434

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eighty extracted mandibular incisors with small oval root canals were instrumented with the Self-Adjusting File (Redent Nova). GuttaFlow 2 was placed using a lentulo spiral, paper point, master point, or sonically activated CanalBrush (Coltène/Whaledent), followed by the placement of a master point and accessory points (MP+) (part 1). GuttaFlow 2 was placed using a lentulo spiral without a gutta-percha point, together with a single point, with a chloroform-dipped master point, or the latter with accessory points (ChMP+) (part 2). Serial cuts were made at 1-mm intervals up to 10 mm. The percentages of gutta-percha filled area (PGFA), sealer, voids, and debris were evaluated using interactive image analysis software. RESULTS: For part 1 of the study (sealer placement), significant differences regarding PGFA at 2 and 5 mm from the apex were found, whereas for part 2 (filling technique), significant differences were found at all levels besides 2 and 4 mm (Kruskal-Wallis test, P &#8804; .05). ChMP+ reached 85% PGFA at 3 mm from the apex, but only 30% near the apex. The MP+ groups showed a relatively equal distribution of PGFA by 60% to 80% at different levels. GuttaFlow 2 without a gutta-percha point exhibited significantly more voids and debris than the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P &#8804; .05). CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, MP+ could be recommended for clinical use. The presence of voids and debris for the group without a gutta-percha point needs further investigation.","Haverroth Schüneman N, Fernanda; Höpfner Canani, Soraia; Lohbauer, Ulrich; Petschelt, Anselm; Metzger, Zvi; Ebert, Johannes",Quintessence Int,,434
465716,Clinical and laboratory findings of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"PURPOSE: PCR on a nasopharyngeal sample is the reference method for the detection of SARS-nCoV-2. However, combined throat/nasal sampling as a testing method has several advantages. We compared the combined throat/nasal sampling with nasopharyngeal sampling for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers suspected of COVID-19. METHODS: In 107 healthcare workers with symptoms of COVID-19, combined throat/nasal sampling and nasopharyngeal sampling was performed. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by RT-PCR targeting. RESULTS: A total of 80 healthcare workers (74.8%) tested negative with both sampling methods, and 25 healthcare workers (23.4%) tested positive with both sampling methods. There were two discrepant results with positive PCR in combined throat/nasal swabs and negative PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs (1.9%). The &#954; index for concordance between the 2 sampling methods was high (0.95). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR on nasopharyngeal samples was significantly lower than the Ct value of PCR on combined throat/nasal samples (19 (IQR 17-20) versus 21 (IQR 18-29) cycles, p value 0.01). CONCLUSION: Combined throat/nasal swabs yield a similar sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 as nasopharyngeal swabs and are a good alternative sampling method, despite a lower Ct value for the nasopharyngeal samples.","Vlek, A L M; Wesselius, T S; Achterberg, R; Thijsen, S F T",Eur. j. clin. microbiol. infect. dis,,434
465719,The Health Crisis of Marginalized Populations during COVID-19 Pandemic: Challenges and Recommendations,2020,"In this research article, we introduced an algorithm to evaluate COVID-19 patients admission in hospitals at source shortage period. Many researchers have expressed their conclusions from different perspectives on various factors such as spatial changes, climate risks, preparedness, blood type, age and comorbidities that may be contributing to COVID-19 mortality rate. However, as the number of people coming to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment increases, the mortality rate is likely to increase due to the lack of medical facilities. In order to provide medical assistance in this situation, we need to consider not only the extent of the disease impact, but also other important factors. No method has yet been proposed to calculate the priority of patients taking into account all the factors. We have provided a solution to this in this research article. Based on eight key factors, we provide a way to determine priorities. In order to achieve the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method, we studied individuals with different results on all factors. The sigmoid function helps to easily construct factors at different levels. In addition, the Cobweb solution model allows us to see the potential of our proposed algorithm very clearly. Using the method we introduced, it is easier to sort high-risk individuals to low-risk individuals. This will make it easier to deal with problems that arise when the number of patients in hospitals continues to increase. It can reduce the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Medical professionals can be very helpful in making the best decisions.","Geetha, Selvaraj; Narayanamoorthy, Samayan; Manirathinam, Thangaraj; Kang, Deakook",Expert Syst Appl,,434

OBJECTIVE: To carry out a narrative review of the information available on infection by SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients, especially patients with cancer, transplanted, neurological diseases, primary and secondary immunodeficiencies. RESULTS: Patients with cancer and recent cancer treatment (chemotherapy or surgery) and SARS-CoV-2 infection have a higher risk of worse outcomes. In transplant patients (renal, cardiac and hepatic), with neurological pathologies (multiple sclerosis [MS], neuromyelitis optica [NMODS], myasthenia gravis [MG]), primary immunodeficiencies and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in association with immunosuppressants, studies have shown no tendency for worse outcomes. CONCLUSION: Given the little evidence we have so far, the behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunosuppressed patients is unclear, but current studies have not shown worse outcomes, except for patients with cancer.","Cajamarca-Baron, Jairo; Guavita-Navarro, Diana; Buitrago-Bohorquez, Jhon; Gallego-Cardona, Laura; Navas, Angela; Cubides, Hector; Arredondo, Ana María; Escobar, Alejandro; Rojas-Villarraga, Adriana",Reumatol. clin.

For many public health interventions, the choice is not between sufficiently powered trials and underpowered trials, but between underpowered trials and no trials at all. Underpowered trials should be viewed as contributions to the larger body of evidence, alongside other studies of various sizes and designs, collectively assessed and synthesized in systematic reviews. Overemphasis on sample size calculation is probably more of a hindrance than a help to scientific progress.","Fretheim, Atle",Trials,,434

466959,Calling for a COVID-19 One Health Research Coalition,2020,"Approximately 13% of the total UK workforce is employed in the health and care sector. Despite substantial workforce planning efforts, the effectiveness of this planning has been criticised. Education, training, and workforce plans have typically considered each health-care profession in isolation and have not adequately responded to changing health and care needs. The results are persistent vacancies, poor morale, and low retention. Areas of particular concern highlighted in this Health Policy paper include primary care, mental health, nursing, clinical and non-clinical support, and social care. Responses to workforce shortfalls have included a high reliance on foreign and temporary staff, small-scale changes in skill mix, and enhanced recruitment drives. Impending challenges for the UK health and care workforce include growing multimorbidity, an increasing shortfall in the supply of unpaid carers, and the relative decline of the attractiveness of the National Health Service (NHS) as an employer internationally. We argue that to secure a sustainable and fit-for-purpose health and care workforce, integrated workforce approaches need to be developed alongside reforms to education and training that reflect changes in roles and skill mix, as well as the trend towards multidisciplinary working. Enhancing career development opportunities, promoting staff wellbeing, and tackling discrimination in the NHS are all needed to improve recruitment, retention, and morale of staff. An urgent priority is to offer sufficient aftercare and support to staff who have been exposed to high-risk situations and traumatic experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to growing calls to recognise and reward health and care staff, growth in pay must at least keep pace with projected rises in average earnings, which in turn will require linking future NHS funding allocations to rises in pay. Through illustrative projections, we show that, to sustain annual growth in the workforce at approximately 2·4%, increases in NHS expenditure of 4% annually in real terms will be required. Above all, a radical long-term strategic vision is needed to ensure that the future NHS workforce is fit for purpose.","Anderson, Michael; O039,; Neill, Ciaran; Macleod Clark, Jill; Street, Andrew; Woods, Michael; Johnston-Webber, Charlotte; Charlesworth, Anita; Whyte, Moira; Foster, Margaret; Majeed, Azeem; Pitchforth, Emma; Mossialos, Elias; Asaria, Miqdad; McGuire, Alistair",Lancet,,434

Travel medicine practitioners were increasingly called upon to provide pre-cruise travel advice and medical clearance. Demand for these services will return at some time in the future. METHODS: The clinical conditions seen in those presenting for care on 6 small vessel scientific cruises to Antarctica were analyzed. RESULTS: Personnel presented on 196 occasions resulting in 257 consultations (when initial plus all follow up consultations were included). Personnel presented with a clinical condition at a rate of 17.9 per 1000 person days at sea. The total consultation rate was 23.5 per 1000 person days at sea. Injury accounted for 24% of all presentations at a rate of 4.3 per 1000 person days at sea. Dermatological, soft tissue and musculoskeletal, general malaise and motion sickness were the four most common presentations. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-cruise advice for travelers planning small vessel cruises to polar regions needs to include skin care, prevention and management of sea sickness and how to reduce the risk of injury. Those providing medical care on such cruises should be prepared to manage a wide range of clinical presentations.","Visser, Jenny T",J. travel med,,434

In this study, three typical ventilation strategies were studied using computational fluid dynamics in a prefabricated Coronavirus disease 2019 double-patient ward. Pollutants are the respiratory droplets and aerosols injected from two manikins. They are modelled as particles with different diameters (3 µm, 6 µm, 12 µm, 20 µm, 45 µm and 175 µm) by the Eulerian-Lagrangian model. Three ventilation strategies with an identical air change rate of 12.3 h-1 but different layouts of inlets and outlets are implemented. The flow field, flow structures and particle trajectories have been analysed and compared among the three ventilation strategies. The fate of particles is analysed and compared quantitatively. It is found that small particles (<20 µm) can move along with the main flow streams. Most of them are removed by ventilation to the outlet(s). Large particles (>45 µm) cannot move with the flow streams over a long path. Most of them deposit on solid surfaces in different regions of the ward in each ventilation strategy. Health workers should pay close attention to these polluted areas. Targeted cleaning of the polluted areas is necessary in a prefabricated inpatient ward. To promote the removal of some large particles (e.g., 45 µm) by the outlet(s), the outlet(s) should be installed inside the landing area of large particles and close to the polluted source(s).","Ren, Juan; Wang, Yue; Liu, Qibo; Liu, Yu",Build Environ,,434
467839,"Hand Hygiene Strategy, Masks, Social Distancing, and Modified Rounds During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Medical Center",2020,"Mathematical modeling of disease spreading plays a crucial role in understanding, controlling and preventing epidemic outbreaks. In a microscopic description of the propagation of a disease over the complex network of human contacts, the probability that an individual is in a given state (susceptible, infectious, recovered etc) depends on the state of its neighbors in the network. Thus it depends on the state of pairs of nodes, which in turns depends on triples, in a hierarchy of dynamical dependencies. In order to produce models that are at the same time reliable and manageable, one has to understand how to truncate such a hierarchy, and how the chosen order of approximation affects the ability of the model to forecast the real temporal evolution of an epidemics. In this paper we provide a systematic analysis of the reliability (under different hypotheses on the quantity and quality of available data) of the predictions obtained by truncating the hierarchy either at the level of individuals or at the level of pairs. We find that pair-based models are reliable tools both for estimating the epidemiological parameters and for forecasting the temporal evolution of the epidemics, under all conditions taken into account in our work. However, a pair-based approach provides a much better prediction of an individual-based one, only if better data, namely information on the state of node pairs, are available. Overall, our results suggest that more refined mathematical models need to be informed by improved contact tracing techniques to better support decision on policies and containment measures to adopt.","Malizia, Federico; Gallo, Luca; Frasca, Mattia; Latora, Vito; Russo, Giovanni",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03657v1.pdf,434

OBJECTIVE: To attempt to establish incidence of AIS in COVID-19 patients in an international cohort. METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective, multicenter study of consecutive patients admitted with AIS and COVID-19 was undertaken from March 1 to May 1, 2020 at 12 stroke centers from 4 countries. Out of those 12 centers, 9 centers admitted all types of strokes and data from those were used to calculate the incidence rate of AIS. Three centers exclusively transferred LVO stroke (LVOs) patients and were excluded only for the purposes of calculating the incidence of AIS. Detailed data were collected on consecutive LVOs in hospitalized patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy (MT) across all 12 centers. RESULTS: Out of 6698 COVID-19 patients admitted to 9 stroke centers, the incidence of stroke was found to be 1.3% (interquartile range [IQR] 0.75%-1.7%). The median age of LVOs patients was 51 yr (IQR 50-75 yr), and in the US centers, African Americans comprised 28% of patients. Out of 66 LVOs, 10 patients (16%) were less than 50 yr of age. Among the LVOs eligible for MT, the average time from symptom onset to presentation was 558 min (IQR 82-695 min). A total of 21 (50%) patients were either discharged to home or discharged to acute rehabilitation facilities. CONCLUSION: LVO was predominant in patients with AIS and COVID-19 across 2 continents, occurring at a significantly younger age and affecting African Americans disproportionately in the USA.","Khandelwal, Priyank; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Tiwari, Ambooj; Singla, Amit; Dmytriw, Adam A; Piano, Mariangela; Quilici, Luca; Pero, Guglielmo; Renieri, Leonardo; Limbucci, Nicola; Martínez-Galdámez, Mario; Schüller-Arteaga, Miguel; Galván, Jorge; Arenillas-Lara, Juan Francisco; Hashim, Zafar; Nayak, Sanjeev; Desousa, Keith; Sun, Hai; Agarwalla, Pankaj K; Nanda, Anil; Roychowdhury, J Sudipta; Nourollahzadeh, Emad; Prakash, Tannavi; Gandhi, Chirag D; Xavier, Andrew R; Lozano, J Diego; Gupta, Gaurav; Yavagal, Dileep R",Neurosurgery,,434

PURPOSE: to provide an updated view regarding the early experience obtained from the management of KTRs with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed database to identify relevant articles written in English/Spanish, and published through May 15, 2020. Search terms included: ""coronavirus"", ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""COVID"", ""renal transplantation"", and ""kidney transplantation"". Case series were considered eligible, and case reports excluded. Thirty-four articles were included in the review. RESULTS: KTRs should be considered immunocompromised hosts: potential risk for infection, non-negligible comorbidity, and exposure to long-term immunosuppression. Only single center small retrospective experiences are still available regarding KTRs with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in KTRs are similar to that observed for the general population, being fever and cough the most frequently observed. Mild-to-moderate symptomatic KTRs can be managed in an outpatient setting, while patients exhibiting severe symptoms must be addmited to hospital. More rapid clinical progression, and higher complication and death rates have been observed for hospitalized KTRs, requiring hemodyalisis or ventilatory support. Lymphopenia, elevated serum markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, IL-6, D-dimer), and chest-X-ray findings consistent with pneumonia are linked to worse prognosis. A number of antiviral therapies have been used. However, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding their efficacy at this point. Baseline immunosupression regimen should be adjusted in a case-by-case manner. However, it poses a significant challenge.","González, Javier; Ciancio, Gaetano",Int Braz J Urol,,434

Finding symmetric nodes in large complex networks, however, has relied on automorphism groups in algebraic group theory, which are solvable in quasipolynomial time. We articulate a conceptually appealing and computationally extremely efficient approach to finding and characterizing all symmetric nodes by introducing a structural position vector (SPV) for each and every node in the network. We prove mathematically that nodes with the identical SPV are symmetrical to each other. Utilizing six representative complex networks from the real world, we demonstrate that all symmetric nodes can be found in linear time, and the SPVs can not only characterize the similarity of nodes but also quantify the nodal influences in spreading dynamics on the network. Our SPV-based framework, in additional to being rigorously justified, provides a physically intuitive way to uncover, understand and exploit symmetric structures in complex networks.","Long, Yong-Shang; Zhai, Zheng-Meng; Tang, Ming; Liu, Ying; Lai, Ying-Cheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02597v1.pdf,434

This study analyses the personnel and environmental protection status of the East-West Lake Fangcang Shelter Hospital. The HCWs were mostly composed of national medical rescue teams, from different provinces in China. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, 82.64% of the HCWs had already known the proper procedure of wearing masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE). For the total of 634 participants entering the inpatient areas, 99.8% of them took occupational protection trainings via various methods. By carefully training and supervision, most of them were competent to work in the inpatient areas six hours/d, three-four times/week. Besides, 7.8% experienced different types of occupational exposure, which mainly caused by the damage of PPE. Once exposed, the HCWs would disinfect skin or mucous in time. No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 48 air and environmental samples after regular disinfection and cleaning. To conclude, the bundle including intensive training, strengthened personal protection, strict environmental disinfection and timely remedial measures for occupational exposure had ensured the safety of the East-West Lake Fangcang Shelter Hospital.","Zhang, Min; Wang, Lili; Yu, Siyuan; Sun, Guixin; Lei, Han; Wu, Wenjuan",Emerg Microbes Infect,,434

This study investigated possible relationships between anti-hypertensive medications use and COVID-19 infection risk in the ambulatory hypertensive population. This is a population-based retrospective cohort study involving 34 936 hypertensive adults >50 years in Tarragona (Southern Catalonia, Spain) who were retrospectively followed through pandemic period (from 01/03/2020 to 30/04/2020). Two data sets including demographic/clinical characteristics (comorbidities and cardiovascular medications use) and laboratory PCR codes for COVID-19 were linked to construct an anonymized research database. Cox regression was used to calculate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and estimate the risk of suffering COVID-19 infection. Across study period, 205 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases were observed, which means an overall incidence of 586.8 cases per 100 000 persons-period. In multivariable analyses, only age (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.02-1.05; P < .001) and nursing home residence (HR: 19.60; 95% CI: 13.80-27.84; P < .001) appeared significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Considering anti-hypertensive drugs, receiving diuretics (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.90-1.67; P = .205), calcium channel blockers (HR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.91-1.82; P = .148), beta-blockers (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.68-1.37; P = .844), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.61-1.13; P = .238) did not significantly alter the risk of PCR-confirmed COVID-19, whereas receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers was associated with an almost statistically significant reduction risk (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.44-1.01; P = .054). In conclusion, our data support that receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors does not predispose for suffering COVID-19 infection in ambulatory hypertensive people. Conversely, receiving angiotensin II receptor blockers could be related with a reduced risk.","Vila-Corcoles, Angel; Satue-Gracia, Eva; Ochoa-Gondar, Olga; Torrente-Fraga, Cristina; Gomez-Bertomeu, Frederic; Vila-Rovira, Angel; Hospital-Guardiola, Imma; de Diego-Cabanes, Cinta; Bejarano-Romero, Ferran; Rovira-Veciana, Dolors; Basora-Gallisa, Josep",J. clin. hypertens.

The 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced ccRCC is less than 30%. Lack of potential biomarkers for treatment and prognosis is a limitation for early diagnosis and treatment of ccRCC. Methods: We collected microarray profiles of 39 ccRCC and matched normal samples to identify differential expression genes (DEGs). Then, a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was constructed to identify gene modules associated with the metastasis in ccRCC. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA, https://www.proteinatlas.org/) database were used for verification set. Finally, we used biological experiments to preliminary investigate the impact of LTF on the tumor biological behavior of ccRCC, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis. Results: A total of 15 genetic modules were identified, and the light-green module is considered the most relevant to tumor metastasis. (P = 0.02, R2 = -0.4). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was performed to identify the hub nodes in the light-green module. Finally, combining the results of PPI, WGCNA and DEGs, lactotransferrin (LTF) gene was regarded as ""real"" hub genes for cancer metastasis risk. LTF was subsequently validated using the TCGA database. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the expression of LTF in ccRCC tumor tissue was significantly lower than that in normal tissue based on the HPA database. Intriguingly, patients with low expression of LTF had lower survival rates (HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.89, P = 0.0067), the expression level of the sample was negatively correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.0385), and patients with low expression of LTF gene were more likely to have distant metastasis (P = 0.038). Overexpression of LTF inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis of human ccRCC cells in vitro. Conclusion: LTF might be a novel prognostic biomarker for ccRCC.","Ni, Lihua; Yuan, Cheng; Zhang, Changjiang; Xiang, Yuandi; Wu, Juan; Wang, Xiaolong; Wu, Xiaoyan",Onco Targets Ther,,434
475550,The Impact of COVID-19 on Marginalized Communities,2021,"INTRODUCTION: To explore the prevalence of dysphonia in European patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and the clinical features of dysphonic patients. METHODS: The clinical and epidemiological data of 702 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were collected from 19 European Hospitals. The following data were extracted: age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco consumption, comorbidities, general, and otolaryngological symptoms. Dysphonia and otolaryngological symptoms were self-assessed through a 4-point scale. The prevalence of dysphonia, as part of the COVID-19 symptoms, was assessed. The outcomes were compared between dysphonic and nondysphonic patients. The association between dysphonia severity and outcomes was studied through Bayesian analysis. RESULTS: A total of 188 patients were dysphonic, accounting for 26.8% of cases. Females developed more frequently dysphonia than males (P = 0.022). The proportion of smokers was significantly higher in the dysphonic group (P = 0.042). The prevalence of the following symptoms was higher in dysphonic patients compared with nondysphonic patients: cough, chest pain, sticky sputum, arthralgia, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. The severity of dyspnea, dysphagia, ear pain, face pain, throat pain, and nasal obstruction was higher in dysphonic group compared with nondysphonic group. There were significant associations between the severity of dysphonia, dysphagia, and cough. CONCLUSION: Dysphonia may be encountered in a quarter of patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and should be considered as a symptom list of the infection. Dysphonic COVID-19 patients are more symptomatic than nondysphonic individuals. Future studies are needed to investigate the relevance of dysphonia in the COVID-19 clinical presentation.","Lechien, Jerome R; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Cabaraux, Pierre; Mat, Quentin; Huet, Kathy; Harmegnies, Bernard; Horoi, Mihaela; Le Bon, Serge Daniel; Rodriguez, Alexandra; Dequanter, Didier; Hans, Stéphane; Crevier-Buchman, Lise; Hochet, Baptiste; Distinguin, Lea; Chekkoury-Idrissi, Younes; Circiu, Marta; El Afia, Fahd; Barillari, Maria Rosaria; Cammaroto, Giovanni; Fakhry, Nicolas; Michel, Justin; Radulesco, Thomas; Martiny, Delphine; Lavigne, Philippe; Jouffe, Lionel; Descamps, Géraldine; Journe, Fabrice; Trecca, Eleonora M C; Hsieh, Julien; Delgado, Irene Lopez; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Vergez, Sebastien; Khalife, Mohamad; Molteni, Gabriele; Mannelli, Giuditta; Cantarella, Giovanna; Tucciarone, Manuel; Souchay, Christel; Leich, Pierre; Ayad, Tareck; Saussez, Sven",J. voice,,434

In this study, chemiluminescence detection of IgM antibody showed a positive conversion earlier (about 1-2 days earlier), positive conversion rates higher in different stages of disease, and a trend of declining positive rate later than colloidal gold method. For IgG antibody, the chemiluminescence method showed a positive conversion earlier and the positive rate climbing more quickly than the colloidal gold method. No obvious negative-converting tendency of IgG detection was observed within 35 days after the onset of disease. Although colloidal gold method is generally less sensitive than chemiluminescence method, it shows advantages of shorter turn-around time, more simple procedure, and no special equipment required. The two methodologies can be chosen according to different laboratory conditions. A reasonable understanding of the performance of reagents with different methodologies can help in clinical disease diagnosis effectively and assist in the diagnosis of the progression of COVID-19, for which the dynamic changes of antibody will provide reliable evidence.","He, Jingyun; Hu, Peng; Gao, Yu; Zheng, Shengwei; Xu, Chao; Liu, Rongzhi; Fang, Li; Li, Ran; Han, Congyin; An, Juanjuan; Dong, Jinchun; Deng, Gang; Sun, Lei; Lv, Yunfeng",J. med. virol,,434

Standard compartment models fail when they are implemented in the Argentina case. We extended a previous successful model to describe the geographical spread of the AH1N1 influenza epidemic of 2009 in two essential ways: we added a stochastic local mobility mechanism, and we introduced a new compartment in order to take into account the isolation of infected asymptomatic detected people. Two fundamental parameters drive the dynamics: the time elapsed between contagious and isolation of infected individuals ([Formula: see text]) and the ratio of people isolated over the total infected ones (p). The evolution is more sensitive to the [Formula: see text]parameter. The model not only reproduces the real data but also predicts the second wave before the former vanishes. This effect is intrinsic of extensive countries with heterogeneous population density and interconnection.The model presented has proven to be a reliable predictor of the effects of public policies as, for instance, the unavoidable vaccination campaigns starting at present in the world an particularly in Argentina.","Barreiro, N L; Govezensky, T; Bolcatto, P G; Barrio, R A",Sci Rep,,434

This longitudinal study investigated the social participation, social inclusion and psychological well-being in adults with and without mental disorders before the beginning of the pandemic, as well as during and after strict lockdown restrictions in Germany. METHODS: The sample (n = 106) consisted of three groups: participants with a chronic mental disorder, with an acute mental disorder, and without a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey. Parameters of interest were assessed using the Measure of Participation and Social Inclusion for Use in People with a Chronic Mental Disorder (F-INK), the Index for the Assessment of Health Impairments (IMET) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18). RESULTS: The perceived impairments in social participation and the associated changes in behaviour varied depending on the presence of a mental disorder at the time of the initial survey and were largely temporary, i.e. limited to the period of strict lockdown restrictions. We found no further detrimental effects on mental health 4 weeks after lockdown or later, when a policy of physical distancing was in place. CONCLUSION: Overall, our findings suggest a general resilience to the official restrictions and measures as well as the pandemic itself.

Reflection on Epidemiological Surveillance in Health,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions to daily life resulting in wide-spread unemployment and psychological distress. Recent studies have reported high rates of alcohol use during this time; however, longitudinal data remain scarce and factors associated with increases in high-risk drinking observed over time are unknown. AIMS: The current study examined changes in high-risk drinking patterns across four 7-day observation periods, prior to and following a university wide campus closure. Additionally, factors associated with changes in alcohol use patterns were examined including financial distress, psychological distress, impact of racial tensions and virus-related fears. METHOD: Students (N = 1001) in the Midwestern USA completed repeated assessments between March and June 2020. Each survey included a timeline follow-back measure of alcohol use. Pandemic-related distress spanning several factors was assessed at the final follow-up. RESULTS: Risky drinking patterns increased significantly over time. Overall, psychological distress and impact of racial tensions were associated with higher rates of risky drinking, whereas COVID-19-related fears were associated with lower rates. However, only financial-related distress was associated with an increase in risky drinking patterns over time. CONCLUSIONS: Increased risky drinking patterns observed in the current study may signal problems that are likely to persist even after the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life ends. Individuals experiencing financial distress may represent a particularly high-risk group. Interventions targeting the cross-section of job loss, financial stress and problematic alcohol use will be important to identify.","Lechner, William V; Sidhu, Natasha K; Jin, Jackson T; Kittaneh, Ahmad A; Laurene, Kimberly R; Kenne, Deric R",Alcohol alcohol,,434

Moreover, the limit of detection for ""AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real Time RT-PCR kit"" was estimated to be higher than 40,000 viral RNA copies/mL of sample. CONCLUSIONS: Proper clinical performance evaluation studies from government agencies at developing countries should be mandatory prior to clinical use authorization of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis kits, particularly when those kits lack of either FDA or its country of origin clinical use authorization, to prevent the distribution of low quality products that may have a negative impact of COVID19 surveillance at developing countries.","Freire-Paspuel, Byron; Garcia-Bereguiain, Miguel Angel",Virol J,,434
478424,New Parents Experienced Lower Parenting Self-Efficacy during the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown,2021,"BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) accounts for a substantial proportion of sudden cardiac events globally, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported annually in the United States. The mortality rate of patients who suffer OHCA remains high despite extensive utilization of resources. OBJECTIVES: We aim to describe the current landscape of OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide an overview of the logistical challenges and resuscitation protocols amongst emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. DISCUSSION: Recent studies in Italy, New York City, and France characterized a significant increase in OHCA incidence in conjunction with the arrival of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The presence of the pandemic challenged existing protocols for field resuscitation of cardiac arrest patients as the pandemic necessitated prioritization of EMS personnel and other healthcare providers' safety through stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements. Studies also characterized difficulties encountered by the first responder system during COVID-19, such as dispatcher overload, increased response times, and adherence to PPE requirements, superimposed on PPE shortages. The lack of guidance by governmental agencies and specialty organizations to provide unified safety protocols for resuscitation led to the development of different resuscitative protocols globally. CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic modified the approach of first responders to OHCA. With the rise in OCHA during the pandemic in several geographic regions and the risks of disease transmission with superimposed equipment shortages, novel noninvasive, adjunct tools, such as point of care ultrasound, warrant consideration. Further prehospital studies should be considered to optimize OHCA and resource management while minimizing risk to personnel.","Ong, Justin; O039,; Connell, Francis; Mazer-Amirshahi, Maryann; Pourmand, Ali",Am J Emerg Med,,434

480060,Preliminary findings of the impact of COVID-19 on drugs crypto markets,2020,"March 11, 2020 WHO has declared the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. The European Society for Cystic Fibrosis (ECFS) has developed the ECFSCOVID-19 surveillance program to collect information on the characteristics of COVID-19 in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF centers in the Russian Federation also joined the ECFS study. The ECFS collected information only through national Registers. In our country, the national register of CF patients has existed since 2011, its data is included in the European Register. Тo analyze the prevalence and course of COVID-19 in adult CF patients in Saint-Petersburg and the Leningrad region. Methods. From 11.03.20 to 24.12.20, 10 cases of adult CF patients (4 women, 6 men) with COVID-19 were analyzed in Saint-Petersburg and the Leningrad region. At the beginning of the study, 56 adult CF patients lived in Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad Region. All patients were monitored remotely by telephone, in case of ARVI symptoms, disease exacerbation, a PCR smear was performed on SARS-CoV-2, therapy was prescribed remotely, and inpatient treatment was prescribed if indicated. Results. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 10 adult CF patients aged 21 to 43 years. Two patients (32-year-old male and 31-year-old female with severe mixed cystic fibrosis form) were hospitalized with polysegmental pneumonia. 8 people were treated on an outpatient basis. Only 1 outpatient patient aged 43 years had pronounced clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the condition was regarded as moderate, the remaining outpatient patients suffered from a mild ARI disease. All patients were treated with positive dynamics. During the period of this follow – up, 3 CF patients (2 men, 1 woman) died, the death cause was the respiratory failure progression. Clinical and radiological, repeated laboratory data for COVID-19 were not obtained. At the point of December 24, 2020 53 adult CF patients are alive. Conclusion. According to our data, the incidence of COVID-19 among adult CF patients in Saint-Petersburg and the Leningrad Region was 17.85%, which is a lower indicator than in the general population. The disease was rarely severe, and effective treatment was noted in outpatient settings. There were no deaths from COVID-19.","Makhmutova, V. R.; Gembitskaya, T. E.; Chermenskiy, A. G.; Titova, O.

480129,The COVID-19 pandemic: Stay Home policy and exposure to risks of infection among Nigerians,2021,"In December 2019, a new virus (initially called 'Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV' and later renamed to SARS-CoV-2) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and rapidly spread to other parts of China and other countries around the world, despite China's massive efforts to contain the disease within Hubei. As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past. We also discuss additional ways GIS can support the fight against infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics.","Kamel Boulos, Maged N; Geraghty, Estella M",Int J Health Geogr,,434

480233,A Statistical Analysis of Death Rates in Italy for the Years 2015-2020 and a Comparison with the Casualties Reported from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many patients falling ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome eventually require prone positioning for gas exchange. Traditionally, central venous catheters are inserted with patient in the supine or Trendelenburg position. However, when a patient cannot tolerate supine position and the need for central venous access is urgent, catheter placement may be considered with the patient in the prone position. CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old male with rapidly declining respiratory status secondary to COVID pneumonia quickly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, was rapidly intubated, and then placed in the prone position. Patient could not tolerate the supine position even briefly and required a central venous catheter insertion for continuous renal replacement therapy. We kept the patient in the prone position and successfully inserted a central venous catheter in such position with real-time ultrasound guidance and using micropuncture technique. CONCLUSION: In the setting of the COVID pandemic, many cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome require patients to be prone in order to improve gas exchange. In the most severe situations, these patients would not be able to tolerate rotating back to the supine position but would still require central venous catheter insertion urgently. We demonstrated feasibility of central venous catheter insertion in the prone position in these severely ill patients.","Yang, Michael X; Ng, Philip K",J Intensive Care Med,,434
480235,A Statistical Analysis of Death Rates in Italy for the Years 2015-2020 and a Comparison with the Casualties Reported from the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"We search for signatures of gravitational lensing in the gravitational-wave signals from compact binary coalescences detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo during O3a, the first half of their third observing run. We study: 1) the expected rate of lensing at current detector sensitivity and the implications of a non-observation of strong lensing or a stochastic gravitational-wave background on the merger-rate density at high redshift; 2) how the interpretation of individual high-mass events would change if they were found to be lensed; 3) the possibility of multiple images due to strong lensing by galaxies or galaxy clusters; and 4) possible wave-optics effects due to point-mass microlenses. Several pairs of signals in the multiple-image analysis show similar parameters and, in this sense, are nominally consistent with the strong lensing hypothesis. However, taking into account population priors, selection effects, and the prior odds against lensing, these events do not provide sufficient evidence for lensing. Overall, we find no compelling evidence for lensing in the observed gravitational-wave signals from any of these analyses.","Collaboration, The LIGO Scientific; Abbott, the Virgo Collaboration R.; Abbott, T.

The present study examines the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on psychological and physical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among university students in Turkey. A cross-sectional survey design was used for data collection. From May 11th to May 15th 2020, the study utilized snowball sampling techniques to gather data through an online survey. The pandemic's psychological effects on participants were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 and the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey assess related HRQOL were used to make mental health assessments. 1120 university students were contacted to complete the survey. Of these, a total of 1095 completed the survey, translating to a participation rate of 97.7%. Overall, 64.6%, 48.6% and 45.2%, and 34.5% of all participants self-reported symptomatic signs of depression, anxiety, stress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), respectively. Female gender and poor family relationships were identified as risk factors for probably PTSD, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress as well. The mean scores of Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Component Summary (MCS-12) were 66.99 ± 2.14 and 40.76 ± 2.31, respectively. Students suspected of a history with PTSD had considerably lower total scores for PCS-12 and MCS-12, when cross checked for similarity to those without such a history. The findings of this research suggest that evidence of PTSD, depression, anxiety, and stress is commonly apparent among university students during the period of the COVID-19 crisis. Prevention and intervention approaches to attenuate the psychosocial impact should be an integral component of crisis response during pandemic conditions.","Cam, Hasan Huseyin; Ustuner Top, Fadime; Kuzlu Ayyildiz, Tülay",Curr Psychol,,434
481796,Gender Analysis of COVID-19 Outbreak in South Korea: A Common Challenge and Call for Action,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Smoking causes inflammation of the lung epithelium by releasing cytokines and impairing mucociliary clearance. Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020. RESULTS: 1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, p<0.001), HIV infection (11% vs 5%,p<0.001), cancer (11% vs 6%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15% vs 8%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (15% vs 9%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11% vs 8%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005). Univariate Cox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed that among smokers only current smokers had higher risk of death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p<0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox model for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum lactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were associated with overall improved survival. CONCLUSION: In our large single-centre retrospective database of patients hospitalised with COVID-19, smoking was associated with development of critical illness and higher likelihood of death.","Adrish, Muhammad; Chilimuri, Sridhar; Mantri, Nikhitha; Sun, Haozhe; Zahid, Maleeha; Gongati, Sudharsan; Fortuzi, Ked; Jog, Abhishrut Pramod; Purmessur, Pravish; Singhal, Ravish",,,434
481839,"ASE Membership in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Hanging out, Hanging on, Together",2020,"In the present study, we compared the real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and total IgM-IgG antibody tests for diagnosis SARS-CoV-2 patients. SARS-CoV-2 patients were divided into four additional subgroups according to clinical examination, and Computed Tomography (CT) for SARS-CoV-2. Groups were included 60 mild cases, 111 moderate cases, 53 severe cases, and 105 normal cases. In a mild group, 52.5% of 60 cases were found to be male, 45.9% female, and the average age was found as 38.4 ±2.011. The positive ratio was found as 80.3% in the RT-PCR test, while 39.3% in total IgM/IgG. In a moderate group, 49.1% of 111 cases were found to be male, 50% female, and the average age was 45.05 ±1.519. The positive ratio was found as 85.7% in the RT-PCR test while 54.5% in total IgM/IgG. In a severe group, 53.7%of 53 cases were found to be male, 44.4% female, and the average age was 55.5±2.122. The positive ratio was found as 75.9% both in RT-PCR and total IgM/IgG tests. In a normal group with no involvement according to Computed Tomography (CT), 49.1%of 105 cases were found to be male, 50% female, and the average age was found as 34.8±1.391. The positive ratio was found as 95.3% in the RT-PCR test while 5.7% in total IgM/IgG. Chronic diseases were detected more in severe cases, suggesting that persons who have chronic diseases or decreased immunity, such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and lung disease, are at a higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. According to our results, we can suggest a higher detection sensibility in RT-PCR than in total IgM/IgG antibody test for mild, moderate and normal group, while the detection sensibility of IgM/IgG antibody increases in a severe group with bilateral diffuse involvement according to CT.","Acer, Ömer; Özüdoğru, Osman",Jurnal Teknologi Laboratorium,,434

483032,Inequity and the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color in the United States: The need for a trauma-informed social justice response,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) represents the gold standard for diagnostic assays even if it cannot precisely quantify viral RNA copies. Thus, we decided to compare qRT-PCR with digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR), which is able to give an accurate number of RNA copies that can be found in a specimen. However, the aforementioned methods are not capable to discriminate if the detected RNA is infectious or not. For this purpose, it is necessary to perform an endpoint titration on cell cultures, which is largely used in the research field and provides a tissue culture infecting dose per mL (TCID50/mL) value. Both research and diagnostics call for a model that allows the comparison between the results obtained employing different analytical methods. The aim of this study is to define a comparison among two qRT-PCR protocols (one with preliminary RNA extraction and purification and an extraction-free qRT-PCR), a dPCR and a titration on cell cultures. The resulting correlations yield a faithful estimation of the total number of RNA copies and of the infectious viral burden from a Ct value obtained with diagnostic routine tests. All these estimations take into consideration methodological errors linked to the qRT-PCR, dPCR and titration assays.","Brandolini, Martina; Taddei, Francesca; Marino, Maria Michela; Grumiro, Laura; Scalcione, Agata; Turba, Maria Elena; Gentilini, Fabio; Fantini, Michela; Zannoli, Silvia; Dirani, Giorgio; Sambri, Vittorio",Viruses,,434

483442,Changes to medication abortion clinical practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The relationship between epidemiology, mathematical modeling and computational tools allows to build and test theories on the development and battling of a disease. This PhD thesis is motivated by the study of epidemiological models applied to infectious diseases in an Optimal Control perspective, giving particular relevance to Dengue. Dengue is a subtropical and tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that affects about 100 million people per year and is considered by the World Health Organization a major concern for public health. The mathematical models developed and tested in this work, are based on ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics underlying the disease, including the interaction between humans and mosquitoes. An analytical study is made related to equilibrium points, their stability and basic reproduction number. The spreading of Dengue can be attenuated through measures to control the transmission vector, such as the use of specific insecticides and educational campaigns. Since the development of a potential vaccine has been a recent global bet, models based on the simulation of a hypothetical vaccination process in a population are proposed. Based on Optimal Control theory, we have analyzed the optimal strategies for using these controls, and respective impact on the reduction/eradication of the disease during an outbreak in the population, considering a bioeconomic approach. The formulated problems are numerically solved using direct and indirect methods. The first discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization problem. Indirect methods use the Pontryagin Maximum Principle as a necessary condition to find the optimal curve for the respective control. In these two strategies several numerical software packages are used.","Rodrigues, Helena Sofia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.7390v1.pdf,434

METHOD: A total of 192 participants aged 8-16 years who met the diagnostic criteria for ADHD were included in the study. Children scoring higher than predetermined cut-off point in self-rating questionnaires for problematic mobile phone use (SQPMPU) or Young's internet addiction test (IAT), were defined as ADHD with problematic digital media use (PDMU), otherwise were defined as ADHD without PDMU. The differences between the two groups in ADHD symptoms, EF, anxiety and depression, stress from life events, learning motivation and family environment were compared respectively. RESULTS: When compared with ADHD group without PDMU, the group with PDMU showed significant worse symptoms of inattention, oppositional defiant, behavior and emotional problems by Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP), more self-reported anxiety by screening child anxiety-related emotional disorders (SCARED) and depression by depression self-rating scale for children (DSRSC), more severe EF deficits by behavior rating scale of executive function (BRIEF), more stress from life events by adolescent self-rating life events checklist (ASLEC), lower learning motivation by students learning motivation scale (SLMS), and more impairment on cohesion by Chinese version of family environment scale (FES-CV). The ADHD with PDMU group spent significantly more time on both video game and social media with significantly less time spend on physical exercise as compared to the ADHD without PDMU group. CONCLUSION: The ADHD children with PDMU suffered from more severe core symptoms, negative emotions, EF deficits, damage on family environment, pressure from life events, and a lower motivation to learn. Supervision of digital media usage, especially video game and social media, along with increased physical exercise, is essential to the management of core symptoms and associated problems encountered with ADHD.","Shuai, Lan; He, Shan; Zheng, Hong; Wang, Zhouye; Qiu, Meihui; Xia, Weiping; Cao, Xuan; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Jinsong",Global Health,,434

The Macmillan Move More Northern Ireland (MMNI) programme provides access to physical activity and behavioural change support before, during and after cancer treatment. This evaluation details the impact of the pandemic on the MMNI participants and identifies methods to adapt service delivery. METHODS: A multiple-choice and short answer online survey was sent to 730 MMNI participants, to investigate the impact of the initial, national COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, the survey examined physical activity patterns, the physical/emotional/social impact of restrictions and attitudes towards digitally supported exercise. Free text responses were analysed thematically with findings verified within the research team. RESULTS: 377 participants completed the survey (52% response rate). 50% of respondents had breast cancer, with 36 other diagnoses registered (82% were female). Participants reported physical activity levels decreased during restrictions, citing isolation; declining health/fitness; lack of access and motivation. The dataset trended towards women and those diagnosed with breast cancer. 71% reported the pandemic impacted their physical (n=119) and/or psychosocial (n=231) wellbeing. Many respondents were availing of digitally supported exercise, whilst half of males did not engage (46%). Finally, 80% of respondents were interested in using a MMNI smart application. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected participant physical activity levels. Supervised classes were the most popular (pre-pandemic), with enforced leisure centre closures prompting this reduction. The pandemic has negatively affected the psychosocial wellbeing (mental health) of participants, compounded by the restrictions imposed on the traditional delivery of MMNI. This impact is felt equally across cancer types. Participants with breast cancer are the most engaged in using digital technology to access exercise. Although underrepresented, men require greater targeting to ensure equality in access to online services.","Brown, Malcolm; O039,; Connor, Dominic; Murphy, Claire; McClean, Maura; McMeekin, Alexandra; Prue, Gillian",Support. care cancer,,434

486105,Examining the Left‐Right Divide Through the Lens of a Global Crisis: Ideological Differences and Their Implications for Responses to the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2021,"On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) office in China received a report of 29 pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology in Wuhan city in Hubei province, central China Within 1 week it became clear that the initial cases were associated with a seafood market where live poultry and wild animals were also sold The virus was quickly identified as a novel beta-coronavirus and the genetic sequence was shared on 12 January 2020 The infection is now officially termed COVID-19 and the virus SARS-CoV-2 News of this outbreak gave many public health officials an involuntary shudder as they recalled the parallels with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that arose in China in November 2002 That outbreak was also caused by a novel coronavirus spilling over from an animal reservoir and transmitted by respiratory droplets SARS spread to many parts of the world through international air travel, caused more than 8000 cases and 774 deaths and cost in the region US$20 billion to control Within less than a month COVID-19 had spread throughout China and to neighbouring countries, even to the USA and Europe It became clear that the new virus was highly transmissible from person to person but was considerably less virulent, with less than 20% of cases being classified as severe It has the clinical features of an atypical pneumonia with fever, dry cough, fatigue, dyspnoea and myalgia and is more often severe in those with comorbidities and the elderly Since there are no specific therapies or vaccines available, standard public health measures appropriate for a virus spread by droplets, close contact and on environmental surfaces were instituted The Chinese authorities conducted active case finding and testing, contact tracing and quarantining of cases and contacts The public was advised to stay at home if sick, in an effort to control the spread of the virus On 30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, their highest level of severity, at a time when there were almost 10 000 confirmed cases, more than 200 deaths and it had spread to 20 countries The Chinese authorities had by then instituted highly stringent control measures, including stopping flights and public transport in Wuhan and other major cities, closing animal wet markets, extending the New Year holiday period in an effort to prevent mass travel, reducing movements within cities, minimizing mass gatherings, keeping schools closed, staggering office and factory working hours and restricting movement on the streets The wearing of face masks became compulsory and, in effect, the population of Hubei province, more than 50 million people, were in quarantine The authorities also built two new hospitals with more than 2500 beds within 2 weeks to cope with the surge in demand for medical care By the middle of March, less than 3 months into the epidemic, there had been more than 200 000 cases confirmed worldwide with more than 8000 deaths, vastly surpassing the SARS epidemic The number of cases reported has been highest in China, although cases have now been reported in 159 countries and territories on six continents Over 70 countries have instituted travel restrictions The main initial battle to control this epidemic has been in China, where heroic public health measures have bought the rest of the world time and may have reduced the effective reproduction number to close to 1, thereby bringing the epidemic under control However, the rest of the world needs to maintain high vigilance, as this virus is highly transmissible and can cause severe disease and death, as has been seen in countries such as South Korea, Iran and Italy Indeed, the number of new cases is now highest in Europe Containment through case finding and isolation and contact tracing and social distancing remain the key public health approaches to controlling the epidemic in all parts of the world This is particularly important for countries in sub-Saharan Africa and also those parts of South and Central America and Asia that are not well-prepared for outbreaks Global solidarity and support are essential, as infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and as John Nkengasong, from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has said, ‘The global health chain is only as strong as its weakest link, so a disease threat anywhere can quickly become a threat everywhere’ Preparedness to respond to outbreaks is weak in many countries Of the 45 low-income countries that have undertaken a national preparedness assessment, none have been deemed ready to respond, making them particularly vulnerable to outbreaks There are many reasons for this, including poor health and nutrition, exacerbated by high rates of concomitant human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis, and low influenza vaccination rates;poor quality of healthcare and resource constraints, as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) spend on average only $267 annually per person on health;and vulnerable supply chains and weak medicine procurement, and up to 30% of medicines are substandard or falsified In response to the outbreak, the African Union Commission is strengthening partnerships and coordination across the continent, including a common approach for monitoring and movement restriction of people at risk for COVID-19 and for information sharing The WHO has found the regional readiness level to be only 66%, with critical gaps and a need to strengthen the capacities for countries to investigate alerts, treat patients in isolation facilities and improve infection, prevention and control (IPC) in health facilities and communities More than 40 experts have deployed to 10 countries to support preparedness activities and the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 has been strengthened, with 17 countries now having at least some capacity for laboratory testing [Truncated]","Jimmy,

486186,COVID-19-related healthcare closures negatively affect patient health and postoperative recovery,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a period of educational disruption on an unprecedented scale. During this time of crisis, education will not be business as usual, and EdTech alone cannot close the learning gap. It will be dedicated teachers and resilient educators who will ensure learning doesn't stop - but they could be helped by the right EdTech tools. However, the digital divide means that internet and mobile network access varies greatly in middle and low-income countries. In this discussion paper, we explore some of the key constraints of using EdTech at scale to support education in low-income countries at a time of crisis, and highlight the opportunities that have so far emerged, in a rapidly-changing context. We draw upon evidence and examples to inform policy and programming decisions, moving from the initial emergency response to building resilience in the longer term, and planning to diagnose and treat the learning gaps that have emerged during the crisis.","Jordan, K.; David, R.; Phillips, T.; Pellini, A.",Red-Revista De Educacion a Distancia,,434

489318,Shaping of the professionalism of medical students amid COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background: The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods: Genome-wide screening was used to establish intraviral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings: We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and >350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19-derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals a significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as a downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-&#954;B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Our study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks but it also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms, representing a powerful resource in the pursuit of therapeutic interventions.

We examined the possible complementary role of laboratory-developed class-specific clinical serology in assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. Serological tests for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated using samples from real-time reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)-confirmed inpatient coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific COVID-19 serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients than for IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve [AUC] of 0.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.89 to 0.93] versus IgA AUC of 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98] versus IgM AUC of 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97]). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA, and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.","Verkerke, Hans; Horwath, Michael; Saeedi, Bejan; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W; Owens, Joshua; Arthur, Connie M; Nakahara, Hirotomo; Rha, Jennifer; Patel, Kashyap; Wu, Shang-Chuen; Paul, Anu; Yasin, Nini; Wang, Jianmei; Shin, Sooncheon; Brown, DeAndre; Normile, Katherine; Cole, Lisa; Meyers, Mark; Lin, Heather; Woods, Emily; Isaac, Jennifer; Broder, Kari; Wade, Jenna; Kauffman, Robert C; Patel, Ravi; Josephson, Cassandra D; Reynolds, Stacian; Sherman, Melanie; Wrammert, Jens; Alter, David; Guarner, Jeannette; Roback, John D; Neish, Andrew; Stowell, Sean R",J. clin. microbiol,,434

DESIGN: Nationwide, cross-sectional Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices survey. SETTING: 56 randomly selected communities in all 14 districts in Sierra Leone. PARTICIPANTS: 1253 adults aged 18 years and older of which 52% were men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We calculated proportions of core indicators (awareness, knowledge, risk perception, practices). A composite variable for knowledge (based on seven variables) was created, and categorised into low (0-2 correct), medium (3-4) and high (5-7). Predictors of knowledge were analysed with multilevel ordinal regression models. Associations between information sources, knowledge and two practices (washing hands with soap and avoiding crowds) were analysed using multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS: We found that 75% of the respondents felt at moderate or great risk of contracting coronavirus. A majority (70%) of women did not know you can survive COVID-19, compared with 61% of men. 60% of men and 54% of women had already taken action to avoid infection with the coronavirus, mostly washing hands with soap and water (87%). Radio (73%) was the most used source for COVID-19 information, followed by social media (39%). Having a medium or high level of knowledge was associated with higher odds of washing hands with soap (medium knowledge: adjusted OR (AOR) 2.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.4; high knowledge: AOR 4.6, 95% CI 2.1 to 10.2) and avoiding crowds (medium knowledge: AOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.6; high knowledge: AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that in the context of COVID-19 in Sierra Leone, there is a strong association between knowledge and practices. Because the knowledge gap differs between genders, regions, educational levels and age, it is important that messages are specifically targeted to these core audiences.","Sengeh, Paul; Jalloh, Mohammad B; Webber, Nance; Ngobeh, Ibrahim; Samba, Thomas; Thomas, Harold; Nordenstedt, Helena; Winters, Maike",BMJ Open,,434
491781,When Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Became Medicine-Life in the Time of Coronavirus Disease of 2019,2020,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is one of the most serious problems that has caused stopping the wheel of life all over the world. It is widely spread to the extent that hospital places are not available for all patients. Therefore, most hospitals accept patients whose recovery rate is high. Machine learning techniques and artificial intelligence have been deployed for computing infection risks, performing survival analysis and classification. Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in many areas such as engineering and medicine. This paper presents two systems, Cox_COVID_19 and Deep_ Cox_COVID_19 that are based on Cox regression to study the survival analysis for COVID-19 and help hospitals to choose patients with better chances of survival and predict the most important symptoms (features) affecting survival probability. Cox_COVID_19 is based on Cox regression and Deep_Cox_COVID_19 is a combination of autoencoder deep neural network and Cox regression to enhance prediction accuracy. A clinical dataset for COVID-19 patients is used. This dataset consists of 1085 patients. The results show that applying an autoencoder on the data to reconstruct features, before applying Cox regression algorithm, would improve the results by increasing concordance, accuracy and precision. For Deep_ Cox_COVID_19 system, it has a concordance of 0.983 for training and 0.999 for testing, but for Cox_COVID_19 system, it has a concordance of 0.923 for training and 0.896 for testing. The most important features affecting mortality are, age, muscle pain, pneumonia and throat pain. Both Cox_COVID_19 and Deep_ Cox_COVID_19 prediction systems can predict the survival probability and present significant symptoms (features) that differentiate severe cases and death cases. But the accuracy of Deep_Cox_Covid_19 outperforms that of Cox_Covid_19. Both systems can provide definite information for doctors about detection and intervention to be taken, which can reduce mortality.","Atlam, Mostafa; Torkey, Hanaa; El-Fishawy, Nawal; Salem, Hanaa",Pattern Anal Appl,,434

Increased waiting lists for DXA from the pandemic mean potential long and uncertain delays in treatment for osteoporosis. To address these increased waiting lists, we propose a rapid, simple, one-stop algorithm incorporating medication use (aromatase inhibitor, corticosteroid) and clinical risk stratification supplementing a standard FRAX assessment. Our pragmatic algorithm produces a recommendation to treat empirically, image with DXA, or observe. If applied, we model a significant reduction in DXA scan requirements with a corresponding reduction in treatment delays for those awaiting DXA. We estimate this will reduce DXA scan numbers by about 50%, whilst pragmatically ensuring those with the highest clinical need correctly receive treatment without delay. This algorithm will help many clinicians including general practitioners/family physicians prioritise DXA when they may not always have the expertise to make this judgement based on clinical information alone. Although we have used UK guidelines as an example, this approach is flexible enough for adaptation by other countries based on their local guidelines, licensing, prescribing requirements, and DXA waiting list times. There are some limitations to our proposal. However, it represents one way of managing the uncertainty of the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Sapkota, H R; Nune, A; Bateman, J; Venkatachalam, S",Osteoporosis int,,434

This study estimated the total number of adult elective operations that would be cancelled worldwide during the 12 weeks of peak disruption due to COVID-19. METHODS: A global expert response study was conducted to elicit projections for the proportion of elective surgery that would be cancelled or postponed during the 12 weeks of peak disruption. A Bayesian ß-regression model was used to estimate 12-week cancellation rates for 190 countries. Elective surgical case-mix data, stratified by specialty and indication (surgery for cancer versus benign disease), were determined. This case mix was applied to country-level surgical volumes. The 12-week cancellation rates were then applied to these figures to calculate the total number of cancelled operations. RESULTS: The best estimate was that 28 404 603 operations would be cancelled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of disruption due to COVID-19 (2 367 050 operations per week). Most would be operations for benign disease (90·2 per cent, 25 638 922 of 28 404 603). The overall 12-week cancellation rate would be 72·3 per cent. Globally, 81·7 per cent of operations for benign conditions (25 638 922 of 31 378 062), 37·7 per cent of cancer operations (2 324 070 of 6 162 311) and 25·4 per cent of elective caesarean sections (441 611 of 1 735 483) would be cancelled or postponed. If countries increased their normal surgical volume by 20 per cent after the pandemic, it would take a median of 45 weeks to clear the backlog of operations resulting from COVID-19 disruption. CONCLUSION: A very large number of operations will be cancelled or postponed owing to disruption caused by COVID-19. Governments should mitigate against this major burden on patients by developing recovery plans and implementing strategies to restore surgical activity safely.",,Br. j. surg,,434
492726,Psychological Predictors of Precautionary Behaviors in Response to COVID-19: A Structural Model,2021,"The high dependence on imported fuels and the potential for both climate change mitigation and economic diversification make Barbados' energy system particularly interesting for detailed transformation analysis. An open source energy system model is presented here for the analysis of a future Barbadian energy system. The model was applied in a scenario analysis to investigate cost-optimal and 100% renewable energy system configurations. Within the scenarios, the electrification of private passenger vehicles and cruise ships through shore-to-ship power supply was modelled to assess its impact on the energy system and the necessary investment in storage. Results show that for most scenarios of a system in 2030, a renewable energy share of over 80% is achieved in cost-optimal cases, even with a growing demand. The system's levelised costs of electricity range from 0.17 to 0.36 BBD/kWh in the cost-optimal scenarios and increase only moderately for 100% renewable systems. Under the reasonable assumption of decreasing photovoltaic investment costs, system costs of a 100% system may be lower than the current costs. The results show that pumped hydro-storage is a no-regret option for the Barbadian power system design. Overall, the results highlight the great economic potential of renewable energy as well as the technical and economic feasibility of a 100% renewable energy system for Barbados.","Harewood, Andr'e; Dettner, Franziska; Hilpert, Simon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10083v2.pdf,434

Simulation is frequently used to evaluate and train code teams with the goal of improving outcomes. All participants engaged in training on donning and doffing of personal protective equipment for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. Thereafter, simulations of in-hospital cardiac arrest of patients with COVID-19, so-called protected code blue, were conducted at a quaternary academic centre. The primary endpoint was the mean time-to-defibrillation. A total of 114 patients participated in 33 ""protected code blue"" simulations over 8 weeks: 10 were senior residents, 17 were attending physicians, 86 were nurses, and 5 were respiratory therapists. Mean time-to-defibrillation was 4.38 minutes. Mean time-to-room entry, time-to-intubation, time-to-first-chest compression and time-to-epinephrine were 2.77, 5.74, 6.31, and 6.20 minutes, respectively; 92.84% of the 16 criteria evaluating the proper management of patients with COVID-19 and cardiac arrest were met. Mean time-to-defibrillation was longer than guidelines-expected time during protected code blue simulations. Although adherence to the modified advanced cardiovascular life-support protocol was high, breaches that carry additional infectious risk and reduce the efficacy of the resuscitation team were observed.","Boivin-Proulx, Laurie-Anne; Doherty, Amélie; Rousseau-Saine, Nicolas; Doucet, Serge; Ly, Hung Q; Lavoie, Patrick; Thibodeau-Jarry, Nicolas",Can. j. cardiol,,434

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations and complications are hugely under-recognized. The presence of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors in the intestinal enterocytes, the receptors primarily involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia, maybe the key factor contributing to the pathogenesis of GI manifestations. Ischemic colitis, although the most common ischemic pathology of the GI tract, is relatively rare, occurring as a result of colonic hypoperfusion. The innumerable causes of colonic ischemia are categorized into occlusive and nonocclusive pathologies. Here, we have discussed a case of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, developing ischemic colitis, as a rare GI complication. The cause of ischemia in COVID-19 pneumonia is multifactorial, including hypercoagulable state, coagulopathy leading to thromboembolic complications, and use of vasopressors in severely ill patients with hemodynamic compromise.","Paul, Theresa; Joy, Antony Raphel; Alsoub, Hussam Abdel Rahman S; Parambil, Jessiya Veliyankodan",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,434

METHODS: Fifteen patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from four hospitals were prospectively enrolled and matched samples of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected at Day 1 of admission and every other day till consequently negative for two times. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was performed to detect the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) genes. RESULTS: The cycle threshold values of saliva were comparable to those of NP/OP swabs overall (P = 0.720, Mann-Whitney U test). However, the overall sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was 64% (34/53), which is lower than the 77% (41/53) using NP/OP swabs. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR using saliva was especially lower in early stage of symptom onset (1-5 days; 8/15; 53%) and in patients who did not have sputum (12/22; 55%). CONCLUSION: Saliva sample itself is not appropriate for initial diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to replace NP/OP swabs, especially for the person who does not produce sputum. COVID-19 cannot be excluded when the test using saliva is negative, and it is necessary to retest using NP/OP swabs.","Kim, Seong Eun; Lee, Ji Yeon; Lee, Ahrang; Kim, Soosung; Park, Kyung Hwa; Jung, Sook In; Kang, Seung Ji; Oh, Tae Hoon; Kim, Uh Jin; Lee, Seung Yeob; Kee, Seung Jung; Jang, Hee Chang",J Korean Med Sci,,434

METHODS: We examined the association between dexamethasone use and mortality at AP-HP Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was time to death. We compared this endpoint between patients who received dexamethasone and those who did not in time-to-event analyses adjusted for patient characteristics (such as age, sex and comorbidity) and clinical and biological markers of clinical severity of COVID-19, and stratified by the need for respiratory support, i.e. mechanical ventilation or oxygen. The primary analysis was a multivariable Cox regression model. RESULTS: Of 12 217 adult patients hospitalized with a positive COVID-19 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test, 171 (1.4%) received dexamethasone orally or by intravenous perfusion during the visit. Among patients who required respiratory support, the end-point occurred in 10/63 (15.9%) patients who received dexamethasone and 298/1129 (26.4%) patients who did not. In this group, there was a significant association between dexamethasone use and reduced mortality in the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.96, P = .039). Among patients who did not require respiratory support, there was no significant association between dexamethasone use and the endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicentre observational study, dexamethasone use administered either orally or by intravenous injection at a cumulative dose between 60 mg and 150 mg was associated with reduced mortality among patients with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support.","Hoertel, Nicolas; Sánchez-Rico, Marina; Vernet, Raphaël; Beeker, Nathanaël; Neuraz, Antoine; Alvarado, Jesús M; Daniel, Christel; Paris, Nicolas; Gramfort, Alexandre; Lemaitre, Guillaume; Salamanca, Elisa; Bernaux, Mélodie; Bellamine, Ali; Burgun, Anita; Limosin, Frédéric",,,434

We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without deep vein thrombosis, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in &#8776;20%.","Szekely, Yishay; Lichter, Yael; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Hochstadt, Aviram; Merdler, Ilan; Gal Oz, Amir; Rothschild, Ehud; Baruch, Guy; Peri, Yogev; Arbel, Yaron; Topilsky, Yan",Circulation,,434

One of the most prone individuals, even in normal situations is patients with HIV. Currently, the evidence regarding the link between HIV and COVID-19 is still limited and conflicting. This study aims to analyze the relationship between HIV and poor outcomes of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We systematically searched the PubMed and Europe PMC database using specific keywords related to our aims until January 12th, 2021. All articles published on COVID-19 and HIV were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) tool for observational studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 software. RESULTS: A total of 38 studies with 18,271,025 COVID-19 patients were included in this meta-analysis. This meta-analysis showed that HIV was not associated with composite poor outcome [OR 1.08 (95% CI 0.95 - 1.23), p = 0.26, I2 = 68%, random-effect modelling]. Meta-regression showed that the association with composite poor outcome was influenced by hypertension (p < 0.00001) and diabetes (p = 0.0007).

Methods: The clinical data of 16 patients with peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures who met the inclusion criteria between April 2014 and November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 7 males and 9 females with an average age of 78.4 years (range, 65-93 years). The 14 cases of initial intertrochanteric fractures were classified according to the classification of AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA): 5 cases of type A1, 7 cases of type A2, and 2 cases of type A3; the other 2 cases were intertrochanteric combined with subtrochanteric fractures (Seinsheimer type â ¤). According to the classification of peri-implant refracture which was proposed by Chan et al., there were 10 cases of type 1 (6 cases of type 1A, 3 cases of type 1B, 1 case of type 1C) and 6 cases of type 2 (4 cases of type 2A and 2 cases of type 2B). The average interval between refracture and initial surgery was 14.6 months (range, 1-52 months). The incidence of peri-implant refracture in short nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery&#8804;240 mm) was 1.92% (11/573), while the incidence of long nail group (the length of intramedullary nail used in initial surgery&#8805;340 mm) was 1.66% (5/301), showing no significant difference between the two groups ( &#967; 2=0.073, P=0.786). The peri-implant refractures were revised with extended intramedullary nail (5 cases) or fixed with additional limited invasive stabilization system (11 cases). Results: The average operation time was 115.8 minutes (range, 78-168 minutes) and the average intraoperative blood loss was 283.1 mL (range, 120-500 mL). One patient died of myocardial infarction at 3 months after operation, and the other 15 patients were followed up 9-46 months (mean, 16.8 months). The peri-implant refractures healed at 14-20 weeks (mean, 16.4 weeks) after operation. There was no complications such as incision infection, nonunion, internal fixator loosening and rupture, screw cutting-out, and the second refracture during the follow-up. At last follow-up, all injured limbs regained walking function, and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score was 56-92 (mean, 80.2). The results were classified as excellent in 2 cases, good in 10, fair in 2, and poor in 1, with the excellent and good rate of 80%. Conclusion: Stress concentration at the tip of initial intramedullary nail and distal interlocking screw aera is the main cause of peri-implant refracture after intramedullary nail fixation for intertrochanteric fractures. Revision with extended intramedullary nail or fixation with limited invasive stabilization system according to the length of initial intramedullary nail and the type of refracture can get satisfactory effectiveness.","Teng, Lin; Xiao, Yongchuan; Zhong, Gang",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,,434

COVID-19 can provoke an acute inflammatory process and uncontrolled oxidative stress, which predisposes one to respiratory syndrome, and in the worst case, death. Recent evidence suggests the mechanistic role of mitochondria and vitamin D in the development of COVID-19. Indeed, mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and its uncoupling involves pathological situations. SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with altered mitochondrial dynamics with consequent oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory state, cytokine production, and cell death. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency seems to be associated with increased COVID-19 risk. In contrast, vitamin D can normalize mitochondrial dynamics, which would improve oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory state, and cytokine production. Furthermore, vitamin D reduces renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation and, consequently, decreases ROS generation and improves the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, the purpose of this review is to deepen the knowledge about the role of mitochondria and vitamin D directly involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and the inflammatory state in SARS-CoV-2 infection. As future prospects, evidence suggests enhancing the vitamin D levels of the world population, especially of those individuals with additional risk factors that predispose to the lethal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","de Las Heras, Natalia; Martín Giménez, Virna Margarita; Ferder, León; Manucha, Walter; Lahera, Vicente",,,434

We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 98 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Yeungnam University Medical Center in Daegu, South Korea. Sixty patients were women (61.2%), and the mean age was 55.4±17.1 years. Thirteen patients (13.3%) were treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). The mean interval from symptom onset to hospitalization was 7.7±4.5 days. Patients who received ICU care were significantly older and were more likely to have diabetes mellitus. The National Early Warning Score on the day of admission was significantly higher in patients requiring ICU care. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (13/13 patients; 100%), septic shock (9/13; 69.2%), acute cardiac injury (9/13; 69.2%), and acute kidney injury (8/13; 61.5%) were more common in patients who received ICU care. All patients received antibiotic therapy, and most (97/98 patients; 99.0%) received antiviral therapy (lopinavir/ritonavir). Hydroxychloroquine was used in 79 patients (80.6%), and glucocorticoid therapy was used in 18 patients (18.4%). In complete blood counts, lymphopenia was the most common finding (40/98 patients; 40.8%). Levels of all proinflammatory cytokines were significantly higher in ICU patients.

METHODS: The data comprised sociodemographic and clinical variables, results of serological tests (IgM and IgG), and real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results of IgM-positive individuals. The statistical analysis was performed with a 5% significance level. RESULTS: Among 423 children, 107 (25.3%) exhibited seroprevalence with IgG, IgM or IgG/IgM; among 854 adolescents, 250 (29.2%) had positive serology; and among 282 adults, 59 (20.9%) were positive. The frequency of positivity on RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was 3.5%, 3.6% and 6.0% in children, adolescents and adults, respectively. Children had a lower incidence of symptoms than adolescents (p = 0.001) and adults (p = 0.003); the most frequent were fever, ageusia, anosmia, headache, dry cough, sore throat, muscle pain, runny nose, dyspnoea, and diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rate for all groups was 26.7% in serology and 4.04% in RT-PCR. Children had lower rates of IgM and fewer symptoms compared with adolescents and adults. The data suggest the potential for transmissibility in all age groups.","Cavalcante Pinto Júnior, Valdester; Moura, Luiz Francisco Wemmenson Gonçalves; Cavalcante, Rodrigo Cardoso; Lima, José Rubens Costa; Bezerra, Arnaldo Solheiro; de Sousa Dantas, Daylana Régia; Amaral, Cícero Matheus Lima; Lima, Daniel Freire; Júnior, Antonio Brazil Viana; Florindo Guedes, Maria Izabel",Int J Infect Dis,,434
502431,"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on microbial and metals contaminations in a part of Thirumanimuthar River, South India: A comparative health hazard perspective",2021,"The physiology of critical care patients is more complex than normally appreciated. Patients arrive at the intensive care unit (ICU) or the pediatric ICU (PICU) with a variety of infections, trauma, organ damage, and dysfunctional immune systems. This population is the prime target for testing and applying new precision medicine tools to decipher the unique biology occurring within each patient. This is particularly important as COVID-19 has made such an impact on the United States healthcare system. Thus, there is a need to develop strategies to find multiple levels of information while minimizing the number of tests performed, shifting the balance of testing to more proactive than reactive. With the collection of ~2mL of blood (about half a teaspoon), our collaboration between Spectrum Health and Michigan State University has shown the ability to use PAXgene tubes and RNAseq to simultaneously map human gene/transcript signatures, score panels of corresponding risk genes, deconvolute immune cells, detect markers of organ/cell damage, detect RNA from bacteria/viruses/plants/fungi, profile the immune repertoire, address how patients are unique from other samples, and address common/rare genetic mutations. These tools have been applied to three cohorts of patients (and age matched controls) for critical care medicine physiology understanding for nearly all ages: 1) Infants with Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV);2) Kids with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome;and 3) Adults with hospitalized or lethal COVID-19. Our findings from these tools shows the complexity of immune system activation, secondary infections, and under appreciated interactions of the environment with genetics. This is highlighted by our discovery of Viral Induced Genetics in a patient with Epstein Barr virus, a process where viruses suppress nonsense mediated decay (NMD) to survive, resulting in activation of dominant negative genetics that give rise to immune cell disorder overlapping COVID-19 pathology. The promise of blood-based transcriptomics to reveal cellular and cell free signatures opens a door for building more detailed physiological mechanisms from precision medicine.","Prokop, Jeremy Leimanis Mara Chesla Dave Bupp Caleb Hartog Nicholas Rajasekaran Surender",The FASEB Journal,,434

Critically ill COVID patients are at increased risk of serious thrombotic events and hence increased mortality. On the other side, COVID-19 patients are also showing major life-threatening bleeds, especially when systemic anticoagulation is used. Pro-coagulant propensity in critically ill COVID-19 patients have been published, but very few have described the incidence of major bleeding and its characteristics. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively observed the incidence of major bleed in 25 critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit at the American University of Beirut Medical Center. Six cases were identified and described together with their outcome. RESULTS: Major bleeding occurred in six of the 25 studied patients. Four patients were on therapeutic anticoagulation at the onset of the bleed, two required embolization for bleeding control and one died from hemorrhagic shock. Half of the described cases had unusual sites of bleeding including gluteal and abdominal wall muscles. CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of major bleeding was witnessed in our sample of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection, with the majority being on therapeutic anticoagulation. This rate may be higher than previously reported, necessitating additional attention from the treating physician when considering empiric therapeutic anticoagulation. Moreover, the uncommon sites of bleeding shed the light on the need for additional studies in our population to identify the predisposing risk factors and mechanisms behind it.","Koubaissi, Salwa A; Daou, Michella Abi Zeid; Mohamad, Rayan; Husari, Ahmad",J. thromb. thrombolysis,,434

However, there is wide variation in transport education among fellowship programs. Using the flipped classroom methodology, we developed a video and case-based transport education curriculum. Methods: A national needs assessment identified safety, communication skills, and physiology as the most important aspects of transport management. Three 10-minute video modules and two 20-minute case-based discussions were developed to address this content. Using the flipped classroom format, seven NPM fellows from all three postgraduate years of training took part in the curriculum by individually viewing each video followed by participation in group case-based discussions. Cognitive and affective outcomes were assessed using a knowledge and attitude pretest, individual video module posttests, and a postcurriculum follow-up survey. Results: NPM fellows showed significant improvements in transport knowledge and reported increased confidence in their ability to perform important transport roles. Case discussions were adaptable to learners who had different levels of training and had variable transport experience. Case discussions were successfully executed both in person and by video telecommunications during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: This transport curriculum addressed a national education gap in NPM fellowship training. Using the flipped classroom methodology, cognitive and affective objectives were achieved by improving knowledge and confidence in transport skills among NPM learners. The video and case-based formats were easily implemented, applicable to multiple types of learners, and adaptable to different environments.","Gisondo, Carly M; Weiner, Gary; Stanley, Kate",MedEdPORTAL,,434

505988,Evaluation of Dental Practices Changes During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Brazil,2021,"Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, represents the greatest global health threat. Most people infected by the virus present mild to moderate respiratory symptoms and recover with supportive treatments. However, certain susceptible hosts develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), associated with an inflammatory ""cytokine storm"", leading to lung damage. Despite the current availability of different COVID-19 vaccines, the new emerging SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants represent a major concern worldwide, due to their increased transmissibility and rapid spread. Indeed, it seems that some mutations or combinations of mutations might confer selective advantages to the virus, such as the ability to evade the host immune responses elicited by COVID-19 vaccines. Several therapeutic approaches have been investigated but, to date, a unique and fully effective therapeutic protocol has not yet been achieved. In addition, steroid-based therapies, aimed to reduce inflammation in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, increasing the hospitalization time and mortality rate of these patients. Hence, there is an unmet need to develop more effective therapeutic options. Here, we discuss the potential use of natural immunomodulators such as Thymosin &#945;1 (T&#945;1), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), and lactoferrin (LF), as adjunctive or preventive treatment of severe COVID-19 disease. These agents are considered to be multifunctional molecules because of their ability to enhance antiviral host immunity and restore the immune balance, depending on the host immune status. Furthermore, they are able to exert a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by means of direct interactions with cellular or molecular targets of pathogens or indirectly by increasing the host immune response. Thus, due to the aforementioned properties, these agents might have a great potential in a clinical setting, not only to counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also to prevent opportunistic infections in critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Gaziano, R; Pistoia, E S; Campione, E; Fontana, C; Marino, D; Favaro, M; Pica, F; Di Francesco, P",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,434

Little is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of human coronaviruses infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses. METHODS: From February 2017 to December 2019, 3660 respiratory samples submitted to Zhejiang Children Hospital with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for four human coronaviruses RNA by a novel two-tube multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Samples were also screened for the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RESULTS: Coronavirus RNAs were detected in 144 (3.93%) specimens: HCoV-HKU1 in 38 specimens, HCoV-NL63 in 62 specimens, HCoV-OC43 in 38 specimens and HCoV-229E in 8 specimens. Genomes for SARS-CoV-2 were absent in all specimens by RT-PCR analysis during the study period. The majority of HCoV infections occurred during fall months. No significant differences in gender, sample type, year were seen across species. 37.5 to 52.6% of coronaviruses detected were in specimens testing positive for other respiratory viruses. Phylogenic analysis identified that Zhejiang coronaviruses belong to multiple lineages of the coronaviruses circulating in other countries and areas. CONCLUSION: Common HCoVs may have annual peaks of circulation in fall months in the Zhejiang province, China. Genetic relatedness to the coronaviruses in other regions suggests further surveillance on human coronaviruses in clinical samples are clearly needed to understand their patterns of activity and role in the emergence of novel coronaviruses.","Zhang, Yanjun; Su, Lingxuan; Chen, Yin; Yu, Sicong; Zhang, Dan; Mao, Haiyan; Fang, Lei",Virol J,,434

506437,Estimating severe and critical illness in children with COVID-19,2020,"The coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt education in unprecedented ways. The first school closures in Ireland took place in March 2020, affecting many students, but especially those who were preparing for their end-of-school Leaving Certificate (LC) examinations. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which COVID-19 had impacted the health and wellbeing of the ‘class of 2020’. Some comparisons were also made with a 2015 health and wellbeing survey undertaken in Ireland. A total of 959 LC students completed an online survey. The findings demonstrated substantial negative impacts of COVID-19 on overall health and wellbeing. The comparison with the ‘pre-COVID’ (2015) sample of LC students also showed that the current cohort was faring statistically significantly worse across several domains. This is the only study to investigate the health and wellbeing of this cohort in the context of COVID-19. The findings provide important insights into impacts on student mental health and wellbeing;they also raise questions about how those who went on to Third Level, are faring, in light of continuing disruption to their studies and in the context of the already large numbers of Third Level students presenting with mental health problems in Ireland (and elsewhere).

506620,Understanding Grief During the First-Wave of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom—A Hypothetical Approach to Challenges and Support,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is a novel human coronavirus strain (HCoV) was initially reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. This acute infection caused pneumonia-like symptoms and other respiratory tract illness. Its higher transmission and infection rate has successfully enabled it to have a global spread over a matter of small time. One of the major concerns involving the SARS-COV-2 is the mutation rate, which enhances the virus evolution and genome variability, thereby making the design of therapeutics difficult. In this study, we identified the most common haplotypes from the haplotype network. The conserved genes and population level variants were analysed. Non-Structural Protein 10 (NSP10), Nucleoprotein, Papain-like protease (Plpro or NSP3) and 3-Chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro or NSP5), which were conserved at the highest threshold, were used as drug targets for molecular dynamics simulations. Darifenacin, Nebivolol, Bictegravir, Alvimopan and Irbesartan are among the potential drugs, which are suggested for further pre-clinical and clinical trials. This particular study provides a comprehensive targeting of the conserved genes. We also identified the mutation frequencies across the viral genome.","Anand, Nithishwer Mouroug; Liya, Devang Haresh; Pradhan, Arpit Kumar; Tayal, Nitish; Bansal, Abhinav; Donakonda, Sainitin; Jainarayanan, Ashwin Kumar",PLoS One,,434

The results indicate that the most effective individuals factors on active travel are bicycle and car ownership, and built environment characteristics are walkability, bikeability, security, aesthetics, traffic calming, intersections safety, land uses diversity and density, destination accessibility, street pattern, and bike-sharing infrastructures. Also, the average walking and cycling time of the CBD residents before and after the outbreak is more than that of the non-CBD residents, which is due to the quality of built environment factors in the CBD. A built environment with mixed, diverse, dense and accessible land uses, as well as safe and secure cycling and walking routes have major effects on active travel in the crisis. Hence, it is suggested that policymakers take action to make the environment more people-friendly to maintain citizens' mobility in the critical situation, when many travel modes have lost their efficiency.","Shaer, Amin Rezaei Meysam Moghani Rahimi Behnam Shaer Fatemeh",Cities,,434

That means that we have one day extra and, if the Olympic games had survived the corona crisis, we would all be watching television and ask the eternal question whether Olympic records will for ever be broken and broken again, or that there are limits to human biology1 . In this article we ask the same question, but rather than discussing aspects of Citius, Altius, and Fortius of athletes we will discuss them for macromolecules. It is remarkable how many parallels can be found between Olympic records in these two seemingly different worlds. People involved in structure validation and re-refinement try to make us believe that most aspects of macromolecular structures can be caught by a number that has some constant value with little variation around it. We will show here that the PDB2 databank proves this idea to be wrong. In the protein structure world, it holds for many that ""participating is more important than winning"", but some, fortunately, still go for the record books.","Lange, J; Vriend, G",Proteins,,434

In this perspective piece, we demonstrate the broader societal impacts of COVID-19 on other sectors outside the health sector and the growing importance of capturing these in health economic analyses. These broader impacts include, for instance, the effects on the labor market and productivity, education, criminal justice, housing, consumption, and environment. The current pandemic highlights the importance of adopting a societal perspective to consider these broader impacts of public health issues and interventions and only omit these where it can be clearly justified as appropriate to do so. Furthermore, we explain how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing deep-rooted structural inequalities that contribute to the wider societal impacts of the pandemic.","Schnitzler, Lena; Janssen, Luca M M; Evers, Silvia M A A; Jackson, Louise J; Paulus, Aggie T G; Roberts, Tracy E; Pokhilenko, Irina",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,,434

However, data in the pediatric kidney transplant population (PKT) are lacking. METHODS: Using two commercial immunoassays that measured IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and IgG against the nucleocapsid (N) protein, we screened 72 PKT recipients who attended the outpatient clinic for routine blood work. The majority of patients with positive serology underwent an additional serology test at least once during subsequent clinical follow-up. Patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection if they had two positive tests. RESULTS: Eight patients out of the 72 screened (11.1%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in both serological tests. Of those who tested positive, 4 had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results before screening. All patients were asymptomatic or had a history of mild symptoms. All tested patients had persistently positive antibodies at a median follow-up time of 75 days (IQR, 44.5, 86.5 days). One patient had a positive PCR test at 75 days and a positive serology test at 120 days post infection. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was relatively high (11.1%) in our population. Although all patients were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, they mounted a strong humoral immune response that persisted for a few months despite being on triple immunosuppressants. These findings have positive implications regarding vaccination efficacy in this group.","Alshami, Alanoud; Al Attas, Rabab; Azzam, Ahmad; Mohammed, Amani; Al-Quhaidan, Norah",BMC Nephrol,,434
509415,Measuring Cumulative Stressfulness: Psychometric Properties of the COVID-19 Stressors Scale,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected various aspects of life, at different levels and in different countries on almost every continent. In response, many countries have closed their borders and imposed lockdown policies, possibly bringing benefits to people's health with significantly less emission from air pollutants. Currently, most studies or reports are based on local observations at the city or country level. There remains a lack of systematic understanding of the impacts of different lockdown policies on the air quality from a global perspective. This study investigates the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic towards global air quality through examining global nitrogen dioxide (NO2) dynamics from satellite observations between 1 January and 30 April 2020. We used the Apriori algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, to investigate the association among confirmed cases of COVID-19, NO2 column density, and the lockdown policies in 187 countries. The findings based on weekly data revealed that countries with new cases adopted various lockdown policies to stop or prevent the virus from spreading whereas those without tended to adopt a wait-and-see attitude without enforcing lockdown policies. Interestingly, decreasing NO2 concentration due to lockdown was associated with international travel controls but not with public transport closure. Increasing NO2 concentration was associated with the ""business as usual"" strategy as evident from North America and Europe during the early days of COVID-19 outbreak (late January to early February 2020), as well as in recent days (in late April) after many countries have started to resume economic activities. This study enriches our understanding of the heterogeneous patterns of global associations among the COVID-19 spreading, lockdown policies and their environmental impacts on NO2 dynamics.","Zhang, Hongsheng; Lin, Yinyi; Wei, Shan; Loo, Becky P Y; Lai, P C; Lam, Yun Fat; Wan, Luoma; Li, Yu",Sci Total Environ,,434

Little is known about the kinetics, tissue distribution, cross-reactivity, and neutralization antibody response in patients with COVID-19. Two groups of patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this study: 12 severely ill patients in intensive care units who needed mechanical ventilation and 11 mildly ill patients in isolation wards. Serial clinical samples were collected for laboratory detection. Results showed that most of the severely ill patients had viral shedding in a variety of tissues for 20-40 days after onset of disease (8/12, 66.7%), while the majority of mildly ill patients had viral shedding restricted to the respiratory tract and had no detectable virus RNA 10 days after onset (9/11, 81.8%). Mildly ill patients showed significantly lower IgM response compared with that of the severe group. IgG responses were detected in most patients in both the severe and mild groups at 9 days after onset, and remained at a high level throughout the study. Antibodies cross-reactive to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected in patients with COVID-19 but not in patients with MERS. High levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced after about 10 days after onset in both severely and mildly ill patients which were higher in the severe group. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization test and focus reduction neutralization test with authentic virus showed consistent results. Sera from patients with COVID-19 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry. Sera from convalescent patients with SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) did not. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and N IgG levels exhibited a moderate correlation with neutralization titers in patients' plasma.

Bangladesh is also a victim of this critical situation. To investigate the genomic features of the pathogen from Bangladesh, the first complete genome of the virus has very recently been published. Therefore, long-awaited questions regarding the possible origin and typing of the strain(s) can now be answered. Here, we endeavor to mainly discuss the published reports or online-accessed data (results) regarding those issues and present a comprehensive picture of the typing of the virus alongside the probable origin of the subclade containing the Bangladeshi strain. Our observation suggested that this strain might have originated from the United Kingdom or the other European countries epidemiologically linked to the United Kingdom. According to different genotyping classification schemes, this strain belongs to the A2a clade under the G major clade, is of B and/or L type, and is a SARS-CoV-2a substrain. In the future, randomized genomic data will certainly increase in Bangladesh, however because of globalization and immigrant movement, we urgently need a mass regional sequencing approach targeting the partial or complete genome that can link the epidemiological data and may help in further clinical intervention.","Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Islam, M Rafiul; Rahman, M Shaminur; Islam, Ovinu Kibria; Hossain, M Anwar",J Med Virol,,434

This study aims to identify clinical and behavioral factors associated with poor life functioning in this population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at an ambulatory clinic of a public hospital in Hong Kong. Licensed occupational therapists administered the Life Functioning Assessment Inventory on survivors diagnosed with cancer <19 years old and &#8805;5 years post-diagnosis. Survivors' career development self-efficacy, subjective happiness, and motivation were evaluated using structured questionnaires. Clinical information was obtained from medical records. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate factors associated with life functioning outcomes, adjusting for clinically relevant variables. Results: Eighty survivors were recruited (58.7% male; age at diagnosis: 6.7 [standard deviation (SD) = 4.8] years; age at evaluation: 24.4 [SD = 6.5] years). Compared to survivors of leukemia, survivors of brain tumor performed worse in social functioning (ß = -0.79, standard error [SE] = 0.36; p = 0.034). Survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation also had lower worker life functioning than those who had not (ß = -0.91, SE = 0.031; p = 0.021). Higher activity motivation was significantly associated with better leisure functioning (ß = 0.086, SE = 0.03; p = 0.008), social functioning (ß = 0.036, SE = 0.02; p = 0.036), and career development self-efficacy (ß = 1.04, SE = 0.26; p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Survivors of brain tumors and survivors who were treated with radiation have poorer life functioning, particularly in social and work domains. Future work includes validating the study findings in a larger cohort of survivors in Hong Kong. Addressing modifiable behavioral factors include motivating survivors to engage in meaningful activities that contribute to self-care and participation in society, as well as providing at-risk survivors with ongoing support from community vocational services.","Yang, Hellen; Fong, Sanne; Chan, Phoebe; Cheung, Alice; Peng, Liwen; Yan, Jiaqi; Cheung, Yin Ting; Li, Chi-Kong",Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology (Online),,434

The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus reinforces the importance of developing efficient barrier methods to be adopted in videolaryngoscopy procedures. Although dental intraoral camera covers are a barrier method authorized by Brazilian health organs, it has not yet been used in videolaryngoscopy examinations. The aim of the current longitudinal, individualized, single-blind, prospective, self-controlled, and accurate study is to evaluate the quality of images generated through, and confidence level of, diagnosis based on videolaryngoscopy performed with intraoral dental camera equipped with disposable protection cap and connected to 70° rigid laryngoscope in vocally healthy individuals. Videolaryngoscopy examinations based on 70° rigid optics were performed in 13 euphonic and asymptomatic volunteers at an otorhinolaryngology specialist clinic; only 1 patient was excluded from the study. Images were taken with, and without, disposable intraoral dental camera protection cap; high-grade disinfection protocol was applied between examinations. Recorded videos were randomly distributed in a single-blind manner in order to be evaluated by four otorhinolaryngologists, who answered a questionnaire comprising three questions. Statistical analysis was used to compare groups - which were defined by the use, or not, of protection cap - based on Wilcoxon nonparametric test. Statistical significance was set at 5% with 95% confidence interval. There was no statistically significant difference in image quality between examinations performed with, and without, protection cap (P= 0.646) or in the diagnosis confidence level of examinations performed with, or without, the barrier method. The use of disposable protection cap on intraoral dental camera did not significantly change the quality of images taken through videolaryngoscopy performed with 70° rigid optics in vocally healthy patients.","Nagata Cavalheiro, Mariana; Fonseca, Vinicius Ribas; Zeigelboim, Bianca Simone; Costa, Diego F; de Lima, Lucas Viomar; Bozzo, Marlon Kleber; Tonochi, Rita de Cássia; Hartmann, Bruno Ceron",J. voice,,434

The aim of the current study was to examine the association in Guatemala, a region with elevated prevalences of both H pylori and NAFLD. Associations between H pylori and other metabolic conditions were also examined, as were associations between H hepaticus and H bilis and the metabolic conditions. MATERIALS & METHODS: The analysis included 424 participants from a cross-sectional study in Guatemala. H pylori seropositivity was defined as positivity for &#8805; 4 antigens. Seropositivities for H bilis and H hepaticus were defined as positivity for &#8805; 2 antigens. NAFLD was estimated using the Fatty Liver Index and the Hepatic Steatosis Index. Other conditions examined were obesity, central obesity, hypercholesterolemia, low HDL, diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: No overall associations between H pylori, H hepaticus, or H bilis and NAFLD or related metabolic conditions were found. Seropositivity for H pylori antigens CagA and VacA and H hepaticus antigen HH0713 was each significantly associated with NAFLD, however. In addition, associations were observed between the H pylori antigens HyuA, HP1564, and UreA and specified metabolic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: While no overall associations between H pylori or Helicobacter species with NAFLD or related conditions were observed, some selected Helicobacter spp. antigens were associated with NAFLD. Further research is warranted to examine whether H. species are associated with any metabolic condition.","Alvarez, Christian S; Florio, Andrea A; Butt, Julia; Rivera-Andrade, Alvaro; Kroker-Lobos, María F; Waterboer, Tim; Camargo, Maria Constanza; Freedman, Neal D; Graubard, Barry I; Lazo, Mariana; Guallar, Eliseo; Groopman, John D; Ramírez-Zea, Manuel; McGlynn, Katherine A",Helicobacter,,434

The highest mortality rate is observed among the older adult population. During the first wave of the pandemic (March-June 2020), following a national health decree demanding that no visitors or family members be allowed in health institutions, our geriatric rehabilitation center closed gates to all visitors from the outside. We aimed to assess the rehabilitation outcomes of older patients with hip fractures in the first pandemic wave, who underwent rehabilitation under complete social isolation from primary care givers and family members. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. It took place at a university-affiliated, major postacute geriatric rehabilitation center. Rehabilitation outcomes measured were discharge functional independence measure (FIM) score and motor FIM score, FIM score change, motor FIM score change, favorable motor FIM effectiveness, length of stay, discharge destination, and home aid at discharge. RESULTS: The study group included 36 patients who were admitted during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to June 30, 2020). The control group comprises 106 individuals with hip fractures who were admitted in the respective time periods during the previous 2 years, that is, March 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, and March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2019. The facility's occupancy rates were much lower during the first wave of the pandemic in comparison with previous years (78 and 99%, respectively). Patients showed similar demographics and comorbidities, but the social isolation group was more severely deconditioned upon admission. All rehabilitation outcomes were similar between groups. CONCLUSION: According to the findings of this retrospective study, social isolation from family and caregivers did not have a detrimental effect on the rehabilitation outcomes of these patients. More evidence must be gathered and presented on the matter.","Leibovici-Weissman, Yaara; Levy, Yochai; Michaelis, Michal; Hershkovitz, Avital",Gerontology,,434

However, there remains a need to provide urgent and emergency cardiac and thoracic surgery as well as to continue time-critical thoracic cancer surgery. This study describes our early experience of implementing a protocol to safely deliver major cardiac and thoracic surgery in the midst of the pandemic. Methods: Data on all patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery at a single tertiary referral center in London were prospectively collated during the first 7 weeks of lockdown in the United Kingdom. A comprehensive protocol was implemented to maintain a COVID-19-free environment including the preoperative screening of all patients, the use of full personal protective equipment in areas with aerosol-generating procedures, and separate treatment pathways for patients with and without the virus. Results: A total of 156 patients underwent major cardiac and thoracic surgery over the study period. Operative mortality was 9% in the cardiac patients and 1.4% in thoracic patients. The preoperative COVID-19 protocol implemented resulted in 18 patients testing positive for COVID-19 infection and 13 patients having their surgery delayed. No patients who were negative for COVID-19 infection on preoperative screening tested positive postoperatively. However, 1 thoracic patient tested positive on intraoperative bronchoalveolar lavage. Conclusions: Our early experience demonstrates that it is possible to perform major cardiac and thoracic surgery with low operative mortality and zero development of postoperative COVID-19 infection.","Balmforth, Damian; Yates, Martin T; Lau, Kelvin; Hussain, Azhar; Lopez-Marco, Ana; Edmondson, Stephen; Oo, Aung; Uppal, Rakesh",JTCVS Open,,434

515030,Ghost trains: Australian rail in the early stages of the global COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Despite enormous strides in our field with respect to patient care, there has been surprisingly limited dialogue on how to train and educate the next generation of congenital cardiologists. This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot toward a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists; a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as 'technology enhanced learning' may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in The Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.","McMahon, Colin J; Tretter, Justin T; Redington, Andrew N; Bu039,; Lock, Frances; Zühlke, Liesl; Heying, Ruth; Mattos, Sandra; Kumar, R Krishna; Jacobs, Jeffrey P; Windram, Jonathan D",Cardiol Young,,434

With arising concerns of sustainability, alternative sources of vegetal lecithin are urgently needed, and their metabolic effects must be characterized. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact of increasing doses of rapeseed lecithin (RL), rich in essential &#945;-linolenic acid (ALA), on postprandial lipid metabolism and ALA bioavailability in lymph-cannulated rats. METHODS: Male Wistar rats (8 weeks old) undergoing a mesenteric lymph duct cannulation were intragastrically administered 1 g of an oil mixture containing 4% ALA and 0, 1, 3, 10, or 30% RL (5 groups). Lymph fractions were collected for 6 h. Lymph lipids and chylomicrons (CMs) were characterized. The expression of genes implicated in intestinal lipid metabolism was determined in the duodenum at 6 h. Data was analyzed using either sigmoidal or linear mixed-effects models, or one-way ANOVA, where appropriate. RESULTS: RL dose-dependently increased the lymphatic recovery (AUC) of total lipids (1100 µg/mL·h per additional RL%; P = 0.010) and ALA (50 µg/mL·h per additional RL%; P = 0.0076). RL induced a faster appearance of ALA in lymph, as evidenced by the exponential decrease of the rate of appearance of ALA with RL (R2 = 0.26; P = 0.0064). Although the number of CMs was unaffected by RL, CM diameter was increased in the 30%-RL group, compared to the control group (0% RL), by 86% at 3-4 h (P = 0.065) and by 81% at 4-6 h (P = 0.0002) following administration. This increase was positively correlated with the duodenal mRNA expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (Mttp; &#961;= 0.63; P = 0.0052). The expression of Mttp and secretion-associated, ras-related GTPase 1 gene homolog B (Sar1b, CM secretion), carnitine palmitoyltransferase IA (Cpt1a) and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (Acox1, beta-oxidation), and fatty acid desaturase 2 (Fads2, bioconversion of ALA into long-chain n-3 PUFAs) were, respectively, 49%, 29%, 74%, 48%, and 55% higher in the 30%-RL group vs. the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In rats, RL enhanced lymphatic lipid output, as well as the rate of appearance of ALA, which may promote its subsequent bioavailability and metabolic fate.","Robert, Chloé; Couëdelo, Leslie; Knibbe, Carole; Fonseca, Laurence; Buisson, Charline; Errazuriz-Cerda, Elisabeth; Meugnier, Emmanuelle; Loizon, Emmanuelle; Vaysse, Carole; Michalski, Marie-Caroline",J. nutr,,434

The implementation of a usability engineering process is now mandatory for MD manufacturers seeking to obtain the European Union's CE Mark. Here, we describe the European Union's HFE regulation and highlight the challenges faced by (i) manufacturers implementing this regulation and (ii) regulatory bodies charged with assessing the compliance of usability files. In Europe, 95% of MD manufacturers are small and medium-sized enterprises; compliance with the CE Mark regulations is a real challenge to their competitiveness. Levels of knowledge about HFE vary greatly from one regulatory organization to another, which can sometimes lead to very different expectations. We also present the specific use-related risk management approach required by the HFE regulation. Lastly, we focus on the limitations of the HFE regulation for MDs and on future HFE challenges in further reducing and/or eliminating MD use errors. The main challenge is the need to go beyond technology design and the pre-market assessment and to look at the post-production stage; the coupling between an MD and a sociotechnical system can led to consequences that were not predicted during the design process. This implies the need to consider the emerging properties of technologies in use by involving all the stakeholders.","Pelayo, Sylvia; Marcilly, Romaric; Bellandi, Tommaso",Int. j. qual. health care,,434

There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements. Low-fidelity surgical simulation appears to be an alternative for surgical training. The educational benefits of repeating ossiculoplasty simulations under a microscope have never been evaluated. With this study we aimed to evaluate the differences in performance scores and on a global rating scale before and after training on an ossiculoplasty simulator. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental, prospective, single-centre, before-after study with blinded rater evaluation, residents performed five microscopic ossiculoplasty tasks with a difficulty gradient (sliding beads onto rods, the insertion of a partial prosthesis, the insertion of a total prosthesis, and the insertion of a stapedotomy piston under microscopic or endoscopic surgery) before and after training on the same simulator. Performance scores were defined for each task, and total performance scores (score/min) were calculated. All data were collected prospectively. RESULTS: Six out of seven intermediate residents and 8/9 novices strongly agreed that the simulator was an effective training device and should be included in the ENT residency program. The mean effect of training was a significant increase in the total performance score (+ 0.52 points/min, [95 % CI, 0.40-0.64], p < 0.001), without a significant difference between novice and intermediate residents. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that techniques for middle-ear surgery can be acquired using a simulator, avoiding any risk for patients, even under lockdown measures.","Fieux, Maxime; Gavoille, Antoine; Subtil, Fabien; Bartier, Sophie; Tringali, Stéphane",BMC Med Educ,,434

Controlling viral spread from asymptomatic carriers in cancer centers is paramount, and appropriate screening methods need to be established. Universal testing of asymptomatic cancer patients may be key to ensure safe continuation of treatment and appropriate hospitalized patients cohorting during the pandemic. Here we perform a comprehensive review of the available evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 testing in asymptomatic cancer patients, and describe the approach adopted at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto, Canada) as a core component of COVID-19 control.","Madariaga, Ainhoa; McMullen, Michelle; Sheikh, Semira; Kumar, Rajat; Liu, Fei-Fei; Zimmermann, Camilla; Husain, Shahid; Zadeh, Gelareh; Oza, Amit M",Clin Cancer Res,,434

Previous research about public risk perception among people in Pakistan has been a neglected area till the writing of the current paper. The study aims to determine the level of public risk perception among people in Pakistan about the Covid-19 pandemic. Why and how public risk perception among health professionals and literate is more than the illiterate people in Pakistan? Data were collected through questionnaires and interviews of populations sampling from five districts through visits in KPK and other provinces via phone calls and online through internet. Theory of Health Belief Model (HBM) was utilized to explain public health risk perception in Pakistan. The lack of public health risk perception has more in illiterate people than literate among people in Pakistan, which has caused the Coronavirus to multiply rapidly in Pakistan. The findings have indicated that both health professionals and other literate people have different health behaviors than those who are illiterate in Pakistan about the Covid-19 pandemic.","Gul, Azeem",J Public Aff,,434

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed glucose reading obtained by FGM or CGM in T1D subjects. Sensor data from 2 weeks before the lockdown (Period 0, P0), 2 weeks immediately after the lockdown (period 1, P1), in mid-lockdown (Period 2, P2) and immediately after end of lockdown (Period 3, P3) were analyzed. RESULTS: The study included 63 T1D patients, (FGM: 52, 82%; CGM:11, 18%). Sensor use (91%) were slightly reduced. Despite this reduction, Time in Range increased in P1 (62%), P2 (61%) and P3 (62%) as compared to P0 (58%, all p < 0.05 or less) with concomitant reduction in the Time Above Range (P0: 38%; P1: 34%, P2: 34%, P3: 32%, all p < 0.05 or less vs. P0). Average glucose and GMI improved achieving statistical difference in P3 (165 vs. 158 mg/dl, p = 0.040 and 7.2% (55 mmol/mol) vs. 7.0% (53 mmol/mol), p = 0.016) compared to P0. Time Below Range (TBR) and overall glucose variability remained unchanged. Bi-hourly analysis of glucose profile showed an improvement particularly in the early morning hours. CONCLUSIONS: In T1D subjects with good glycemic control on CGM or FGM, the lockdown had no negative impact. Rather a modest but significant improvement in glycemic control has been recorded, most likely reflecting more regular daily life activities and reduces work-related distress.","Aragona, Michele; Rodia, Cosimo; Bertolotto, Alessandra; Campi, Fabrizio; Coppelli, Alberto; Giannarelli, Rosa; Bianchi, Cristina; Dardano, Angela; Del Prato, Stefano",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,434

Data evaluating the occurrence of breakthrough infections and impact of vaccination in decreasing transmission in congregate settings are limited. Skilled nursing facility (SNF) residents and staff members have been disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (4,5), and were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination (6,7). Starting December 28, 2020, all 78 Chicago-based SNFs began COVID-19 vaccination clinics over several weeks through the federal Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program (PPP). In February 2021, through routine screening, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) identified a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a SNF resident >14 days after receipt of the second dose of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination series. SARS-CoV-2 cases, vaccination status, and possible vaccine breakthrough infections were identified by matching facility reports with state case and vaccination registries. Among 627 persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection across 75 SNFs since vaccination clinics began, 22 SARS-CoV-2 infections were identified among 12 residents and 10 staff members across 15 facilities &#8805;14 days after receiving their second vaccine dose (i.e., breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated persons). Nearly two thirds (14 of 22; 64%) of persons with breakthrough infections were asymptomatic; two residents were hospitalized because of COVID-19, and one died. No facility-associated secondary transmission occurred. Although few SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated persons were observed, these cases demonstrate the need for SNFs to follow recommended routine infection prevention and control practices and promote high vaccination coverage among SNF residents and staff members.","Teran, Richard A; Walblay, Kelly A; Shane, Elizabeth L; Xydis, Shannon; Gretsch, Stephanie; Gagner, Alexandra; Samala, Usha; Choi, Hyeree; Zelinski, Christy; Black, Stephanie R",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,434

A current pressing question among researchers in our field is whether we should return to the pre-pandemic conference model when travel is safe again. We present evidence suggesting that the answer is no. We surveyed 489 researchers studying human behavior and cognition about their pre-pandemic conference attendance, what they value in conferencing, and their attitudes toward solutions for making conferences more sustainable. We found that researchers’ average carbon footprints from conference travel are unsustainable in light of recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We also found that researchers are positively inclined towards a variety of changes that would make conferences more sustainable. Given these results, it will be essential for future conference organizers to provide more sustainable and accessible options, including a virtual option for participation at every conference. For attendees to choose virtual formats, it will be important for conference organizers to provide virtual experiences that are as fulfilling as possible, changes which can also be applied to in-person conferencing.

Rational and effective respiratory support is crucial in the management of COVID-19 patients. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been utilized widely due to its superiority over other non-invasive respiratory support techniques. To avoid HFNC failure and intubation delay, the key issues are proper patients, timely application and improving compliance. It should be noted that elder patients are vulnerable for failed HFNC. We applied HFNC for oxygen therapy in severe and critical COVID-19 patients and summarized the following experiences. Firstly, to select the proper size of nasal catheter, to locate it at suitable place, and to confirm the nose and the upper respiratory airway unobstructed. Secondly, an initial flow of 60 L/min and 37â should be given immediately for patients with obvious respiratory distress or weak cough ability; otherwise, low-level support should be given first and the level gradually increased. Thirdly, to avoid hypoxia or hypoxemia, the treatment goal of HFNC should be maintained the oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95% for patients without chronic pulmonary disease. Finally, patients should wear a surgical mask during HFNC treatment to reduce the risk of virus transmission through droplets or aerosols.","He, Guojun; Han, Yijiao; Fang, Qiang; Zhou, Jianying; Shen, Jifang; Li, Tong; Pu, Qibing; Chen, Aijun; Qi, Zhiyang; Sun, Lijun; Cai, Hongliu",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,434

We collected 27 melanotic Xp11 neoplasms, the largest series to date, for a comprehensive evaluation. Fourteen of the cases, along with 8 alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS), 9 conventional PEComas, and a control group of 7 normal tissues were submitted to RNA sequencing. Follow-up available in 22 patients showed 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 47.6 and 35.7% respectively, which were similar to ASPS and significantly worse than conventional PEComa. Univariate analysis of location (occurring in the kidney versus not kidney), infiltrative growth pattern, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity &#8805;2/50 HPF, necrosis, and lymphovascular invasion were found to be associated with OS and/or DFS. Multivariate analysis identified that location was the only factor found to independently correlate with DFS. More importantly, RNA sequencing-based clustering analysis segregated melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS, clearly from other tumors including conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and formed a compact cluster representative of the largely similar expression signature. In this study, we first clearly define the true biologic nature that melanotic Xp11 neoplasms are distinctive malignant mesenchymal tumors, rather than simply PEComa variants with occasionally unpredictable behavior. Meanwhile, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS more likely represent phenotypic variants of the same entity, which is distinct from conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation RCC. Based on these important findings, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm might be reclassified into a distinctive entity together with ASPS, independent from PEComa, in the future revisions of the current World Health Organization categories of tumors of soft tissue and bone for the improved reclassification.

The results of this analysis paint a highly variable picture. At least 10 percent of lower-level facilities in all three countries have inpatient care capacity, suggesting that these lower-level facilities could help absorb surges in patient flow. Less than half of the facilities in the three countries have a fixed or mobile phone and less than a third have internet access, suggesting a likely challenge in communication and timely sharing of essential information. Concerningly, less than half of the facilities have appropriate handwashing facilities for patients, with even lower rates in rural areas. Between 80 and 95 percent of the facilities have a thermometer to diagnose fever, but availability of a thermometer, stethoscope, and blood pressure cuff together is variable (ranging from almost 90 percent of the facilities in Tanzania to less than 65 percent in Sierra Leone). The paper concludes by highlighting key innovations for future surveys to improve measurement of pandemic preparedness.","Sharma, J.; Andrews, K.; Conner, R.; Gatti, R.",Policy Research Working Paper - World Bank|2020.

Although many efforts have already been put forward for developing potential vaccines, however, most of them are proved to possess negative consequences. Therefore, in this study, immunoinformatics methods were exploited to design a novel epitope-based subunit vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2, targeting four essential proteins of the virus i.e., spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and envelope protein. The highly antigenic, non-allergenic, non-toxic, non-human homolog, and 100% conserved (across other isolates from different regions of the world) epitopes were used for constructing the vaccine. In total, fourteen CTL epitopes and eighteen HTL epitopes were used to construct the vaccine. Thereafter, several in silico validations i.e., the molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (including the RMSF and RMSD studies), and immune simulation studies were also performed which predicted that the designed vaccine should be quite safe, effective, and stable within the biological environment. Finally, in silico cloning and codon adaptation studies were also conducted to design an effective mass production strategy of the vaccine. However, more in vitro and in vivo studies are required on the predicted vaccine to finally validate its safety and efficacy.","Sarkar, Bishajit; Ullah, Md Asad; Araf, Yusha; Rahman, Mohammad Shahedur",Inform Med Unlocked,,434

Here we reveal, that both EPO and EPOR are expressed in the developing rat somatosensory cortex during radial migration and laminar positioning of granular and supragranular neurons. Experimental deregulation of EPO signaling using genetic approaches results in aberrant migration as well as permanent neuronal misplacement leading to abnormal network activity and protracted sensory behavioral deficits. We identify ERK as the downstream effector of the EPO signaling pathway for neuronal migration. These findings reveal a critical role for endogenous EPO signaling in neuronal migration and offer important insights for understanding how temporary deregulation of EPO could results in migration defects leading to abnormal behavior in the adult.","Constanthin, Paul E; Contestabile, Alessandro; Petrenko, Volodymyr; Quairiaux, Charles; Salmon, Patrick; Hüppi, Petra S; Kiss, Jozsef Z",Development (Camb.),,434

590371,The effects of physical distancing on population mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK,2020-06-12,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant morbidity and mortality on a global scale. The etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initiates host cell entry when its spike protein (S) binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In airway epithelia, the spike protein is cleaved by the cell surface protease TMPRSS2, facilitating membrane fusion and entry at the cell surface. This dependence on TMPRSS2 and related proteases suggests that protease inhibitors might limit SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory tract. Here, we tested two serine protease inhibitors, camostat mesylate and nafamostat mesylate, for their ability to inhibit entry of SARS-CoV-2 and that of a second pathogenic coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Both camostat and nafamostat reduced infection in primary human airway epithelia and in the Calu-3 2B4 cell line, with nafamostat exhibiting greater potency. We then assessed whether nafamostat was protective against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo using two mouse models. In mice sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection by transduction with human ACE2, intranasal nafamostat treatment prior to or shortly after SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly reduced weight loss and lung tissue titers. Similarly, prophylactic intranasal treatment with nafamostat reduced weight loss, viral burden, and mortality in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. These findings establish nafamostat as a candidate for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease pathogenesis.","Li, Kun; Meyerholz, David K.; Bartlett, Jennifer A.; McCray, Paul B.",mBio,https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.00970-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34340553/,434
590385,Valuing the years of life lost due to COVID-19: the differences and pitfalls,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND: The global concern over antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is gathering pace. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are at the epicentre of this growing public health threat and governmental and healthcare organizations are at different stages of implementing action plans to tackle AMR. The South Indian state of Kerala was one of the first in India to implement strategies and prioritize activities to address this public health threat. STRATEGIES: Through a committed and collaborative effort from all healthcare related disciplines and its professional societies from both public and private sector, the Kerala Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been able to deliver a state-wide strategy to tackle AMR A multilevel strategic leadership model and a multilevel implementation approach that included developing state-wide antibiotic clinical guidelines, a revision of post-graduate and undergraduate medical curriculum, and a training program covering all general practitioners within the state the PPP proved to be a successful model for ensuring state-wide implementation of an AMR action plan. Collaborative work of multi-professional groups ensured co-design and development of disease based clinical treatment guidelines and state-wide infection prevention policy. Knowledge exchange though international and national platforms in the form of workshops for sharing of best practices is critical to success. Capacity building at both public and private institutions included addressing practical and local solutions to the barriers e.g. good antibiotic prescription practices from primary to tertiary care facility and infection prevention at all levels. CONCLUSION: Through 7 years of stakeholder engagement, lobbying with government, and driving change through co-development and implementation, the PPP successfully delivered an antimicrobial stewardship plan across the state. The roadmap for the implementation of the Kerala PPP strategic AMR plan can provide learning for other states and countries aiming to implement action plans for AMR.","Singh, Sanjeev; Charani, Esmita; Devi, Sarada; Sharma, Anuj; Edathadathil, Fabia; Kumar, Anil; Warrier, Anup; Shareek, P.

We revisit the in vitro technology platforms for COVID-19 testing and diagnostics—molecular tests and rapid antigen tests, serology or antibody tests, and tests for the management of COVID-19 patients. Within each category of tests, we review the commercialized testing platforms, their analyzing systems, specimen collection protocols, testing methodologies, supply chain logistics, and related attributes. Our discussion is essentially focused on test products that have been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA to detect and diagnose COVID-19 infections. Different strategies for scaled-up and faster screening are covered here, such as pooled testing, screening programs, and surveillance testing. The near-term challenges lie in detecting subtle infectivity profiles, mapping the transmission dynamics of new variants, lowering the cost for testing, training a large healthcare workforce, and providing test kits for the masses. Through this review, we try to understand the feasibility of universal access to COVID-19 testing and diagnostics in the near future while being cognizant of the implicit tradeoffs during the development and distribution cycles of new testing platforms.","Benda, Ashler; Zerajic, Lukas; Ankita, Ankita; Cleary, Erin; Park, Yunsoo; Pandey, Santosh",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34640901/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21196581,434

592572,Fighting COVID-19 in the West Africa after experiencing the Ebola epidemic,2021-02-07,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) occurs following infection with the potentially fatal, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus. Infection can be complicated by coagulopathy, at times featuring thrombocytopenia and thrombosis alongside other coagulation abnormalities, also termed COVID‐19‐associated coagulopathy (CAC). Data concerning CAC in pregnancy are limited. Better understanding of physician experiences is essential to identify current practice patterns and knowledge gaps. OBJECTIVES: To determine physician experiences and practice patterns regarding CAC in pregnancy. METHODS: Self‐administered survey using the RedCap online platform; supported by the ISTH Subcommittee on Women's Health Issues in Thrombosis and Hemostasis. RESULTS: Seventy‐five respondents fully or partially completed the survey. Of 1546 reported cases, disease severity was specified in 1298. Sixty‐four percent of COVID‐19 infections were mild, whereas 4% were severe. Of all cases, 1% developed CAC, with 65% classified as severe. The most frequent abnormalities included thrombocytopenia, elevated C‐reactive protein, D‐dimer, and lymphopenia. Low molecular weight heparin was the anticoagulant of choice in CAC and was provided by 77% of respondents, with 60% using standard prophylactic dosing. Thrombosis occurred in seven anticoagulated patients who were receiving standard prophylactic (four) or weight‐based (three) dosing. Disease severity and additional thrombosis risk factors dictated anticoagulation duration. CONCLUSION: In the select population reported by our survey, CAC appears to be uncommon in pregnancy. Anticoagulation practices vary and may not reflect current guidelines. Venous thromboembolism was observed in some CAC patients despite prophylactic anticoagulation (including standard and weight‐adjusted dosing). Urgent research is required to determine appropriate anticoagulant dosing and duration in pregnant women with COVID‐19 infection.","Jevtic, Stefan D.; Malinowski, Ann Kinga; Othman, Maha; Abdul Kadir, Rezan A.",J Thromb Haemost,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260818/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.15462,434

Pre-clinical and biochemical SARS-CoV-2 studies firstly rely on cell culture experiments where the importance of choosing an appropriate cell culture model is often underestimated. We here present a bottom-up approach to identify suitable permissive cancer cell lines for drug screening and virus research. Human cancer cell lines were screened for the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 based on RNA-seq data of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). However, experimentally testing permissiveness towards SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found limited correlation between receptor expression and permissiveness. This underlines that permissiveness of cells towards viral infection is determined not only by the presence of entry receptors but is defined by the availability of cellular resources, intrinsic immunity, and apoptosis. Aside from established cell culture infection models CACO-2 and CALU-3, three highly permissive human cell lines, colon cancer cell lines CL-14 and CL-40 and the breast cancer cell line CAL-51 and several low permissive cell lines were identified. Cell lines were characterised in more detail offering a broader choice of non-overexpression in vitro infection models to the scientific community. For some cell lines a truncated ACE2 mRNA and missense variants in TMPRSS2 might hint at disturbed host susceptibility towards viral entry.","Pommerenke, Claudia; Rand, Ulfert; Uphoff, Cord C.; Nagel, Stefan; Zaborski, Margarete; Hauer, Vivien; Kaufmann, Maren; Meyer, Corinna; Denkmann, Sabine A.; Riese, Peggy; Eschke, Kathrin; Kim, Yeonsu; Safranko, Zeljka Macak; Kurolt, Ivan-Christian; Markotic, Alemka; Cicin-Sain, Luka; Steenpass, Laura",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339474/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255622,434

However, the PN-based ceramics usually exhibit a low bulk density, which greatly limits their practical applications. In this work, CuO was used as the sintering aid to form a liquid-phase bridge, leading to an obvious increase of the bulk density of PN-based ceramics by 11% (from 5.25 to 5.85 g cm(−3)) and the improvement of the piezoelectric constant (d(33)) (from 168 to 190 pC/N) and the Curie temperature (T(C)) from 367 to 395 °C. The positive influence of CuO on densification has been proved by SEM and fracture toughness. The XRD patterns confirmed that there was no secondary phase introduced by CuO addition. The Raman spectra revealed that part of Cu(2+) ions has probably diffused into host lattice of the PN and preferred to occupy on A-sites. These results not only demonstrate the high potential of the CuO added PN-based ceramics for high-temperature piezoelectric applications, but also reveal the corresponding structure-properties relationship as well as provide a way to improve the sinterability, d(33), and T(C) simultaneously.","Fang, Renrui; Zhou, Zhiyong; Liang, Ruihong; Dong, Xianlin",Ceram Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834343/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.06.120; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S027288422031779X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027288422031779X?v=s5,434

Leptin is produced by adipocytes in proportion to adipose tissue mass and is therefore increased in obesity. Despite having a well-described role in regulating systemic metabolism and appetite, leptin displays pleiotropic actions, and it is now clear that leptin has a key role in influencing immune cell function. Indeed, many immune cells have been shown to respond to leptin directly via the leptin receptor, resulting in a largely pro-inflammatory phenotype. Understanding the role of adipose-tissue derived mediators in inflammation is critical to determining the pathophysiology of multiple obesity-associated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease, and infection. This review, therefore, focuses on the latest data regarding the role of leptin in modulating inflammation.","Kiernan, Kaitlin; MacIver, Nancie J.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.622468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584724/,434

However, conferences carry an ecological footprint due to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, traditional conference formats have recently not been possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we examine the carbon footprint associated with travel by presenting delegates to the fall SPU conferences from 2013 to 2019, and the 2015 ESPU conference. METHODS: Online programs for the targeted SPU Fall meetings and the 2015 ESPU Annual Meeting were retrospectively reviewed. Variables collected included meeting location and presenter home base. Distance traveled by the presenter, and likely CO(2)e of this return trip were estimated using online calculators. Analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-H test with pairwise comparisons to detect differences in round trip distances and CO(2)e between meeting locations. RESULTS: Six fall SPU conferences and one ESPU conference were reviewed. The majority of presenters were from the region (North America and Europe respectively), for both SPU and ESPU. The median round trip distance was 2596.34 miles (IQR 1420.96–4438.30), and the median CO(2)e 0.61 metric tons (IQR 0.36–1.02). We found that the distances traveled to conferences in the Western USA and Europe were slightly further than those to conferences in Central Canada and the Southern US. The difference in CO(2)e between these locations did not achieve statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Presenter travel to and from pediatric urological conferences generates an important carbon footprint and may not be possible in the medium-term future due to a global pandemic.

In this regard, the case of the Italian vaccination debate is particularly worrying given that Italy has been one of the European countries with the highest number of measles cases in the recent past. According to this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found no significant differences in responses’ percentage distribution (p = .097). Understanding the student’s perspective about the future COVID-19 vaccine and supporting their health engagement and consciousness may be useful in planning adequate response and multidisciplinary educational strategies—including the psychological perspective on vaccine hesitancy underlying factors - in the post-pandemic period.","Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Dellafiore, Federica; Graffigna, Guendalina; Caruso, Rosario",Eur J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-020-00670-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32761440/,434
596828,Passion and Persistence: Investigating the Relationship Between Adverse Childhood Experiences and Grit in College Students in China,2021-02-22,"One of the biggest challenges during the pandemic has been obtaining and maintaining critical material to conduct the increasing demand for molecular tests. Sometimes, the lack of suppliers and the global shortage of these reagents, a consequence of the high demand, make it difficult to detect and diagnose patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, negatively impacting the control of virus spread. Many alternatives have enabled the continuous processing of samples and have presented a decrease in time and cost. These measures thus allow broad testing of the population and should be ideal for controlling the disease. In this sense, we compared the SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection effectiveness by Real time RT-PCR using two different protocols for RNA extraction. The experiments were conducted in the National Institute of Health (INS) from Peru. We compared Ct values average (experimental triplicate) results from two different targets, a viral and internal control. All samples were extracted in parallel using a commercial kit and our alternative protocol–samples submitted to proteinase K treatment (3 μg/μL, 56°C for 10 minutes) followed by thermal shock (98°C for 5 minutes followed by 4°C for 2 minutes); the agreement between results was 100% in the samples tested. In addition, we compared the COVID-19 positivity between six epidemiological weeks: the initial two in that the Real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted using RNA extracted by commercial kit, followed by two other using RNA obtained by our kit-free method, and the last two using kit once again; they did not differ significantly. We concluded that our in-house method is an easy, fast, and cost-effective alternative method for extracting RNA and conducing molecular diagnosis of COVID-19.","Ñique, Adolfo Marcelo; Coronado-Marquina, Fiorella; Mendez Rico, Jairo Andrés; García Mendoza, María Paquita; Rojas-Serrano, Nancy; Simas, Paulo Vitor Marques; Cabezas Sanchez, Cesar; Drexler, Jan Felix",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760876/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0248885,434

End-stage lung disease from COVID-19 is a new and growing entity that may benefit from lung transplant, however there is limited data on the patient selection, perioperative management and expected outcomes of transplantation for this indication. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of MEDLINE and Web of Science databases as well the gray literature. All manuscripts, editorials, commentaries and gray literature reports of lung transplantation for COVID related respiratory failure were included. A case from the University of Virginia is described and included in the review. RESULTS A total of 27 studies were included; 11 manuscripts, 5 commentaries, and 11 gray literature reports. The total number of transplantations for COVID related lung disease was 21. The mean age was 55 ± 12 years, 16 (76%) were male, and the acuity was high with 85% on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation preoperatively. There was a 95% early survival rate, with one additional late death. There is growing histopathologic evidence for permanent structural damage with no replicating virus at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral lung transplantation is an effective treatment option with reasonable short-term outcomes for patients suffering from end-stage lung failure secondary to COVID-19. However, specific considerations in this new population require a multidisciplinary approach. As we move into the second wave of the COVID-19 global pandemic, lung transplantation will likely have a growing role in management of these complex patients.","Hawkins, Robert B; Mehaffey, J Hunter; Charles, Eric J; Mannem, Hannah C; Roeser, Mark",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33606480/,434

Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection. The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.","Ding, Xianting; Krutzik, Peter O.; Ghaffari, Amir Ali; Zhaozhi, Yixiu; Miranda, Daniel; Cheng, Genhong; Ho, Chih-Ming; Nolan, Garry P.; Sanchez, David Jesse",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354219300221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513822/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354219300221; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104598,434

598117,Key populations are the future of the African HIV/AIDS pandemic,2021-06-30,"A novel modified version of the Wells-Riley model was used to estimate the impact of relative humidity (RH) on the removal of respiratory droplets containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus by deposition through gravitational settling and its inactivation by biological decay; the effect of RH on susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 was not considered. These effects were compared with the removal achieved by increased ventilation rate with outdoor air. Modeling was performed assuming that the infected person talked continuously for 60 and 120 min. The results of modeling showed that the relative impact of RH on the infection risk depended on the ventilation rate and the size range of virus-laden droplets. A ventilation rate of 0.5 ACH, the change of RH between 20% and 53% was predicted to have a small effect on the infection risk, while at a ventilation rate of 6 ACH this change had nearly no effect. On the contrary, increasing the ventilation rate from 0.5 ACH to 6 ACH was predicted to decrease the infection risk by half which is remarkably larger effect compared with that predicted for RH. It is thus concluded that increasing the ventilation rate is more beneficial for reducing the airborne levels of SARS-CoV-2 than changing indoor RH. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The present results show that humidification to moderate levels of 40%–60% RH should not be expected to provide a significant reduction in infection risk caused by SARS-CoV-2, hence installing and running humidifiers may not be an efficient solution to reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease in indoor spaces. The results do however confirm that ventilation has a key role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration in the air providing considerably higher benefits. The modified model developed in the present work can be used by public health experts, engineers, and epidemiologists when selecting different measures to reduce the infection risk from SARS-CoV-2 indoors allowing informed decisions concerning indoor environmental control.","Aganovic, Amar; Bi, Yang; Cao, Guangyu; Drangsholt, Finn; Kurnitski, Jarek; Wargocki, Pawel",Build Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456454/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2021.108278; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132321006788?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132321006788,434

598365,Estimating transportation role in pandemic diffusion in Nigeria: A consideration of 1918-19 influenza and COVID-19 pandemics,2020-07-28,"Inflammation is the body’s response to danger. One of the first immune cell types to encounter danger is the macrophage. Macrophages sense danger signals such as extracellular ATP or bacterial toxins, derived from tissue damage or infection, and initiate the activation of an intracellular molecular complex called the inflammasome. The inflammasome consists of a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, an adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD) and the protease caspase‐1. Assembly of the complex leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase‐1 that triggers processing and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)‐1β and IL‐18, and ultimately cell death via the process of pyroptosis. The ability to sense and respond to danger appropriately is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of inflammasomes contributes to the progression of chronic diseases prevalent in the ageing population, such as Alzheimer’s disease, COPD and metabolic disease; hence, it is critical that activation of the inflammatory response and inflammasome activation are tightly regulated. Post‐translational modifications (PTMs) such as ubiquitination have recently emerged as important regulators of inflammasome assembly. However, the mechanisms by which PTMs regulate the inflammasome are still not understood. This review aims to summarize our knowledge to date on how the ubiquitin system controls inflammasome activation and where this area of research is heading.","Lopez‐Castejon, Gloria",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679183/; https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15118,434

RESULTS: A total of 50 adult patients; median age 58.5 years (range: 29–92 years) received CP with infusion titers; median 1:320 U/mL (Interquartile range 1:80–1:320) between April 4 to May 5, 2020. The median time from onset of symptoms to enrollment in trial was 3 to 7 days with shortness of breath and lung infiltration as severity criterion. In 35 (70%) recipients, oxygen saturation improved from 80 to 95% within 72h, with resolution of lung infiltrates. Primary endpoint was achieved in 44 (88%) recipients whereas secondary endpoint was achieved in 42 (84%). No patient experienced severe adverse events. A high SOFA score (> 7) correlated with deaths in severe and critical patients. Eight (16%) patients expired due to comorbidities; cardiac arrest in 2 (4%), multiorgan failure secondary to cytokine storm in 5 (10%) and ventilator associated complications in 1 (2%). CONCLUSION: CP transfusion can be used as a safe and useful treatment in moderately severe and severe patients.

Methods A 2-armed, single centre randomised trial was performed in a single-blinded fashion within the OMFS department at Addenbrookes hospital, Cambridge. Duty on-call OMFS SHO's were assigned to a “quiet group” and “Non-quiet group”. Former group actively told on-call period would be quiet whilst this word was refrained from use in all contexts in the latter. Results Data was collected from 8am to 7pm from a period spanning a total of 40 week-day on-calls. Total number of bleeps encountered was 491, average bleep count per day irrespective of treatment was 12.3 (SD 4.6). Bleep count for the control group and 13.1 (4.9) bleeps for the quiet (treatment) group. Welches independent-sample T test identified no significant difference in the mean number of bleeps encountered between treatment and control groups. Moreover, ANOVA identified no significant difference in mean number of bleeps between days (F(4,35)=0.086, p=0.986). Statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.2 Conclusion Our study refutes the central dogma of all of medicine that suggests saying the word quiet increases clinician workload during the working day. We identified no significant difference in bleep number between different days of the week.

METHODS: Three cross-sectional national surveys with non-overlapping random samples of the population in England undertaken between late June and September 2020 (REACT-2 study). 365,104 adults completed questionnaires and self-administered lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: Overall, 17,576 people had detectable antibodies, a prevalence of 4.9% (95% confidence intervals 4.9, 5.0) when adjusted for test characteristics and weighted to the adult population of England. The prevalence declined from 6.0% (5.8, 6.1), to 4.8% (4.7, 5.0) and 4.4% (4.3, 4.5), over the three rounds of the study a difference of -26.5% (-29.0, -23.8). The highest prevalence and smallest overall decline in positivity was in the youngest age group (18-24 years) at -14.9% (-21.6, -8.1), and lowest prevalence and largest decline in the oldest group (>74 years) at -39.0% (-50.8, -27.2). The decline from June to September 2020 was largest in those who did not report a history of COVID-19 at -64.0% (-75.6, -52.3), compared to -22.3% (-27.0, -17.7) in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed on PCR. INTERPRETATION: A large proportion of the population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in England based on naturally acquired immunity from the first wave. Widespread vaccination is needed to confer immunity and control the epidemic at population level.

599249,Never the same – A commentary on surgical trainee well-being in the COVID era,2021-08-28,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the gender distribution of clinical trial leadership in COVID-19 clinical trials. METHODS: We searched https://clinicaltrials.gov/and retrieved all clinical trials on COVID-19 from January 1, 2020 to June 26, 2020. As a comparator group, we have chosen two fields that are not related to emerging infections and infectious diseases: and considered not directly affected by the pandemic: breast cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and included studies within the aforementioned study period as well as those registered in the preceding year (pre-study period: January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019). Gender of the investigator was predicted using the genderize.io API (application programming interface). The repository of the datasets used to collect and analyse the data available at https://osf.io/k2r57/. RESULTS: Only 27.8% (430/1548) of principal investigators (PIs) among COVID-19-related studies were women, which is significantly different compared to 54.9% (156/284) and 42.1% (56/133) for breast cancer (p<0.005) and T2DM (p<0.005) trials over the same period, respectively. During this “pre-study” period, the proportion of PIs who were predicted to be women were 49.7% (245/493) and 44.4% (148/333) for breast cancer and T2DM trials, respectively and the difference was not statistically significant when compared to results from the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that less than one-third of COVID-19-related clinical trials are led by women PIs, half the proportion observed in non-COVID-19 trials over the same period which remained similar to the pre-study period. These gender disparities during the pandemic may indicate not only a lack of women's leadership in international clinical trials and involvement in new projects but also may reveal imbalances in women's access to research activities and funding during health emergencies.","Cevik, Muge; Haque, Syed Arefinul; Manne-Goehler, Jennifer; Kuppalli, Krutika; Sax, Paul E.; Majumder, Maimuna S.; Orkin, Chloe",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20307850; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20307850?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.12.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33418021/,434
599359,"The Link Between COVID-19, Anxiety, and Religious Beliefs in the United States and the United Kingdom",2021-05-29,"Flexible endoscopy involves the insertion of a long narrow flexible tube into the body for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, flexible endoscopy plays a major role in cancer screening, surveillance, and treatment programs. As a result of gas insufflation during the procedure, both upper and lower GI endoscopy procedures have been classified as aerosol generating by the guidelines issued by the respective societies during the COVID-19 pandemic—although no quantifiable data on aerosol generation currently exists. Due to the risk of COVID-19 transmission to healthcare workers, most societies halted non-emergency and diagnostic procedures during the lockdown. The long-term implications of stoppage in cancer diagnoses and treatment is predicted to lead to a large increase in preventable deaths. Robotics may play a major role in this field by allowing healthcare operators to control the flexible endoscope from a safe distance and pave a path for protecting healthcare workers through minimizing the risk of virus transmission without reducing diagnostic and therapeutic capacities. This review focuses on the needs and challenges associated with the design of robotic flexible endoscopes for use during a pandemic. The authors propose that a few minor changes to existing platforms or considerations for platforms in development could lead to significant benefits for use during infection control scenarios.","Onaizah, Onaizah; Koszowska, Zaneta; Winters, Conchubhair; Subramanian, Venkatamaran; Jayne, David; Arezzo, Alberto; Obstein, Keith L.; Valdastri, Pietro",Front Robot AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718439/; https://doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2021.612852,434

This chapter explains the evolution of the wastewater origin and the treatment processes along with the developments in microbiology and pathology that led to the present-day scenario of research and advance facilities. Pharmaceuticals can easily enter the environment due to their incomplete degradation in the treatment processes and because of their adverse effects on organisms and environment they are becoming a matter of great concern.

DESIGN: Observational study. SETTING: A single ward of a tertiary-care public hospital in Melbourne, Australia. INTERVENTION: Glycerin-based aerosol was used as a surrogate for respiratory aerosols. The transmission of aerosols from a single patient room into corridors and a nurses’ station in the ward was measured. The rate of clearance of aerosols was measured over time from the patient room, nurses’ station and ward corridors with and without air cleaners [ie, portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters]. RESULTS: Aerosols rapidly travelled from the patient room into other parts of the ward. Air cleaners were effective in increasing the clearance of aerosols from the air in clinical spaces and reducing their spread to other areas. With 2 small domestic air cleaners in a single patient room of a hospital ward, 99% of aerosols could be cleared within 5.5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Air cleaners may be useful in clinical spaces to help reduce the risk of acquisition of respiratory viruses that are transmitted via aerosols. They are easy to deploy and are likely to be cost-effective in a variety of healthcare settings.","Buising, Kristy L.; Schofield, Robyn; Irving, Louis; Keywood, Melita; Stevens, Ashley; Keogh, Nick; Skidmore, Grant; Wadlow, Imogen; Kevin, Kevin; Rismanchi, Behzad; Wheeler, Amanda J.; Humphries, Ruhi S.; Kainer, Marion; Monty, Jason; McGain, Forbes; Marshall, Caroline",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2021.284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266516/,434

We describe practices observed by mobile SARS containment teams (mobile teams) during outbreak investigations. METHODS: We retrospectively summarized infection control practices observed in hospitals visited by mobile teams in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Taiwan, and Thailand, during March and April 2003. RESULTS: Mobile teams investigated 22 reports of SARS in 20 hospitals (1, 5, and 14 hospitals in Lao PDR, Taiwan, and Thailand, respectively). Facilities ranged from urban hospitals with negative-pressure isolation rooms and high-efficiency particulate air filtration to rural hospitals with patient rooms open to outside air circulation and intermittent running water. At the time of mobile team visits, 5 (25%) hospitals implemented infection control practices consistent with World Health Organization recommendations on visitor policies, private negative-pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Early in the SARS epidemic, mobile teams found wide variations in infection control practices and resources among Asian hospitals evaluating patients for SARS, indicating the importance of ongoing assessment during SARS preparedness. Mobile teams are one mechanism to assess practices and promote implementation of recommended infection control measures.","Lee, Nolan E.; Siriarayapon, Potjaman; Tappero, Jordan; Chen, Kow-Tong; Shuey, Dean; Limpakarnjanarat, Khanchit; Chavavanich, Achara; Dowell, Scott F.; SARS Mobile Response Team Investigators",Am J Infect Control,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196655304004493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15525911/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655304004493,434

The epidemiology data and the impact on prognosis of secondary infection in severe and critical COVID-19 patients in China remained largely unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to ICUs from January 18th 2020 to April 26th 2020 at two hospitals in Wuhan, China and one hospital in Guangzhou, China. We measured the frequency of bacteria and fungi cultured from respiratory tract, blood and other body fluid specimens. The risk factors for and impact of secondary infection on clinical outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Secondary infections were very common (86.6%) when patients were admitted to ICU for >72 hours. The majority of infections were respiratory, with the most common organisms being Klebsiella pneumoniae (24.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (21.8%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (9.9%), Candida albicans (6.8%), and Pseudomonas spp. (4.8%). Furthermore, the proportions of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were high. We also found that age ≥60 years and mechanical ventilation ≥13 days independently increased the likelihood of secondary infection. Finally, patients with positive cultures had reduced ventilator free days in 28 days and patients with CRE and/or MDR bacteria positivity showed lower 28-day survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: In a retrospective cohort of severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs in China, the prevalence of secondary infection was high, especially with CRE and MDR bacteria, resulting in poor clinical outcomes.","Sang, Ling; Xi, Yin; Lin, Zhimin; Pan, Ying; Song, Bin; Li, Chang-An; Zheng, Xia; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Pan, Chun; Zhang, Wei; Lv, Zheng; Xia, Jiaan; Chen, Nanshan; Wu, Wenjuan; Xu, Yonghao; Chen, Sibei; Liu, Dongdong; Liang, Weibo; Liu, Xuesong; Liu, Xiaoqing; Li, Shiyue; Zhong, Nanshan; Ye, Dan; Xu, Yuanda; Zhang, Nuofu; Zhang, Dingyu; Li, Yimin",Ann Palliat Med,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-833; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34379989/,434

In contrast, the nucleocapsid (N) gene of TW IBV presents phylogenetic incongruence. RNA recombination at the 5′ end of the N gene between TW and US IBV is shown to be responsible for this discordance. Surprisingly, the recombinant N gene is found in all of tested TW IBV isolates, suggesting that a recombination event gave origin to a founder lineage.

The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction with the telemedicine done during temporary hospital closing when in-person visits were not allowed due to in-hospital COVID-19 transmission. Methods: Survey questionnaires partially taken from a telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ) were sent to 6,840 patients who used telephone-based telemedicine from February 24 to March 7, 2020. Questionnaires sent to patients and additionally created questionnaires to evaluate telemedicine were sent to medical staff (182 doctors and 138 nurses). Results: Response rates of patients and medical staff were 13.2% and 17.2%, respectively. Patients' satisfaction with telemedicine was significantly greater than medical staff's satisfaction for all five components taken from TUQ (all p = 0.000). In addition, created questionnaires showed good reliability, obtaining similar results between doctors and nurses (all p > 0.05). More than 85% of medical staff replied that telemedicine was needed in COVID-19, whereas more than 80% of them worried about incomplete assessment and communication of medical condition. Overall satisfaction with telemedicine by medical staff was 49.7%. The strength of telephone-based telemedicine was patients' convenience (53.4%). However, incomplete assessment of patients' condition (55.0%) was its weakness. Conclusion: Satisfaction with telephone-based telemedicine by patients was significantly greater than that by medical staff (doctors and nurses). Negative views for safety and inconvenience resulted in a greater proportion of dissatisfaction among medical staff. For safe application of telemedicine, medical staff insisted that developing a platform and creating guidelines should be needed.","Park, Hyung-Youl; Kwon, Young-Mi; Jun, Ha-Rin; Jung, Seung-Eun; Kwon, Soon-Yong",Telemed J E Health,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0369; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33216710/,434

Patient remote monitoring strategies are on the raise and may be an additional aid in identifying patients who are at risk of falling. The aim of the study was to evaluate if balance and timed-up-and-go data obtained by a smartphone application during COVID-19 lockdown were able to predict falls in PD patients. METHODS: A cohort of PD patients were monitored for 4 weeks during the COVID-19 lockdown with an application measuring static balance and timed-up-and-go test. The main outcome was the occurrence of falls (UPDRS-II item 13) during the observation period. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients completed the study, and 4 (12%) reported falls in the observation period. The rate of falls was reduced with respect to patient previous falls history (24%). The stand-up time and the mediolateral sway, acquired through the application, differed between “fallers” and “non-fallers” and related to the occurrence of new falls (OR 1.7 and 1.6 respectively, p < 0.05), together with previous falling (OR 7.5, p < 0.01). In a multivariate model, the stand-up time and the history of falling independently related to the outcome (p < 0.01).

The reduction of falling events and the relationship with the stand-up time might suggest that a different quality of falls occurs when patient is forced to stay home — hence, clinicians should point their attention also on monitoring patients’ sit-to-stand body transition other than more acknowledged features based on step quality.","Marano, Massimo; Motolese, Francesco; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Yekutieli, Ziv; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Neurol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05351-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046795/,434

603996,The macroecology of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Anthropocene,2020-07-30,"OBJECTIVES: In Africa, the overall death toll from COVID-19 is reported to be low but there is few individual-level evidence on the severity of the disease. We report the clinical spectrum and outcome of patients monitored in COVID-19 care centers (CCC) in two West-African countries. METHODS: Burkina Faso and Guinea set up referral CCCs to hospitalize all symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers, regardless of the severity of their symptoms. We report the data collected from hospitalized patients by November 2020. RESULT: 1805 patients (64% men, median age 41) were admitted with COVID-19. Symptoms lasted for a median of 7 days (IQR 4-11). During hospitalization, 443 (25%) had at least once a SpO2 < 94%, 237 (13%) received oxygen and 266 (15%) corticosteroids. Mortality was 5% overall, and 1%, 5% and 14% in patients aged <40, 40-59 and ≥60. In multivariable analysis, the risk of death was higher in men (aOR 2.0, 95%CI 1.1;3.6), people aged ≥60 (aOR 2.9, 95%CI 1.7;4.8) and those with chronic hypertension (aOR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2;3.4). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is as severe in Africa as elsewhere and common risk factors such as greater age and hypertension should make us vigilant.","Jaspard, Marie; Sow, Mamadou Saliou; Juchet, Sylvain; Dienderé, Eric; Serra, Beatrice; Kojan, Richard; Sivahera, Billy; Martin, Caroline; Kinda, Moumouni; Lang, Hans-Joerg; Sako, Fodé Bangaly; Traoré, Fodé Amara; Koumbem, Eudoxie; Tinto, Halidou; Sanou, Adama; Sondo, Apoline; Kaboré, Flavien; Donamou, Joseph; Guilavogui, Jean-Paul-Yassa; Velardo, Fanny; Bicaba, Brice; Marcy, Olivier; Augier, Augustin; Sayadi, Sani; Poda, Armel; Keita, Sakoba; Anglaret, Xavier; Malvy, Denis",Int J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221004252?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221004252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34000419/,434

Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new type of coronavirus, which has high contagion and mainly causes respiratory symptoms. With the increase in confirmed cases, however, the infection symptoms turn to be diverse with secondary or first clinical symptoms relating to damage of the cardiovascular system and changes of myocardial enzyme spectrum, cardiac troponin I, electrocardiogram, cardiac function. The occurrence of extra-pulmonary manifestations, including immediately and long-term damage, means that the overall health burden caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be under-estimated because COVID-19 patients developed cardiovascular system injury are more likely to become serious. The factors such as directly pathogen-mediated damage to cardiomyocytes, down-regulated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, excessive inflammatory response, hypoxia and adverse drug reaction, are closely related to the occurrence and development of the course of COVID-19. In combination with recently published medical data of patients having SARS-CoV-2 infection and the latest studies, the manifestations of damage to cardiovascular system by COVID-19, possible pathogenic mechanisms and advances of the treatment are proposed in this article.","Peng, Wenyi; Wu, Hao; Tan, Yan; Li, Mei; Yang, Dachun; Li, Shuang",Life Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987060/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520312492?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520312492; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118496,434

The use of the smartwatch is becoming consolidated, not only as a novelty but also as a very useful tool for daily use. In addition, other devices, such as helmets or belts, are beneficial for monitoring workers and the early detection of any anomaly. They can provide valuable information, especially in work environments, where they help reduce the rate of accidents and occupational diseases, which makes them powerful Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The constant monitoring of the worker’s health can be done in real-time, through temperature, falls, noise, impacts, or heart rate meters, activating an audible and vibrating alarm when an anomaly is detected. The gathered information is transmitted to a server in charge of collecting and processing it. In the first place, this paper provides an exhaustive review of the state of the art on works related to electronics for human activity behavior. After that, a smart multisensory bracelet, combined with other devices, developed a control platform that can improve operators’ security in the working environment. Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (AIoT) bring together the information to improve safety on construction sites, power stations, power lines, etc. Real-time and historic data is used to monitor operators’ health and a hybrid system between Gaussian Mixture Model and Human Activity Classification.

This method was used for assay of the antibody against adult rotavirus in 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China, of which 141 showed a positive result with a total positive rate of 10.2%. The infection rate varied in different regions. In order to confirm the accuracy of these results a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive specimens, and the results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. Seventeen of these 25 positive serum specimens were obtained from rural areas of Qian'an County, Hebei Province where epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred two years ago.

607126,Food Insecurity is Associated with Reducing Fruit and Vegetable Intake During COVID-19,2021-09-30,"Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has become a well-known disease not only in Japan but also in the rest of the world. Early reports suggested that TTS is a self-limiting disease with better prognosis than acute coronary syndrome. However, recent data showed that TTS is not a benign disease as compared with acute coronary syndrome. In addition to the apical ballooning, several other types of wall motion abnormalities have been classified as variants of TTS. In particular, right ventricular involvement, or biventricular TTS, is not uncommon and is associated with poor in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes. With respect to the pathophysiology, modulation (desensitization) of the beta-adrenergic receptor is suspected as a possible mechanism for transiently depressed myocardial contraction. Although specific treatments to improve prognosis of TTS are still uncertain, observational data suggest favorable impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Finally, in the era of COVID-19, we should pay attention to a variety of cardiovascular conditions related to COVID-19. TTS is one of these conditions that can be triggered by both emotional and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Okura, Hiroyuki",J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0914508720303312?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148469/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0914508720303312,434

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the human coronavirus family, and since this infection shows a pandemic trend it will involve many pregnant women. AIMS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) on maternal and neonatal outcomes. SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched up to 8th May 2020. Articles focusing on pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19 were eligible. Participants were pregnant women with COVID-19. CONTENT: The meta-analysis was conducted following the PRISMA and MOOSE reporting guidelines. Bias risk was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42042020184752). Twenty-four articles, including 1100 pregnancies, were selected. The pooled prevalence of pneumonia was 89% (95%CI 70–100), while the prevalence of women admitted to the intensive care unit was 8% (95%CI 1–20). Three stillbirths and five maternal deaths were reported. A pooled prevalence of 85% (95%CI 72–94) was observed for caesarean deliveries. There were three neonatal deaths. The prevalence of COVID-19-related admission to the neonatal intensive care unit was 2% (95%CI 0–6). Nineteen out of 444 neonates had a positive nasopharyngeal swab; one out of five neonates had elevated concentrations of serum IgM and IgG, but a negative swab. IMPLICATIONS: Although adverse outcomes such as ICU admission or patient death can occur, the clinical course of COVID-19 in most women is not severe, and the infection does not significantly influence the pregnancy. A high caesarean delivery rate is reported, but there is no clinical evidence supporting this mode of delivery. Indeed, in most cases the disease does not threaten the mother, and vertical transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Therefore, COVID-19 should not be considered as an indication for elective caesarean section.","Di Toro, Francesca; Gjoka, Mattheus; Di Lorenzo, Giovanni; De Seta, Francesco; Maso, Gianpaolo; Risso, Francesco Maria; Romano, Federico; Wiesenfeld, Uri; Levi-D'Ancona, Roberto; Ronfani, Luca; Ricci, Giuseppe",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33148440/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2020.10.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X20306182; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X20306182,434

Advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) can provide more precise prognoses for cancer patients and help guide clinical treatment. However, the genetic variants that predict high sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy remain unclear, especially in patients with CLM. The aim of this study was to identify the relevant genetic variants in a single CLM patient and to summarize the current evidence on mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that objectively predict sensitivity to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CASE SUMMARY: A 76-year-old male patient, who was diagnosed as stage IV colon cancer with liver metastases, was found to have APC/TP53/KRAS mutations. He showed a good therapeutic response to 12 courses of oxaliplatin regimens combined with Bevacizumab. Genetic analysis of the patient identified 5 genes with 7 detected SNPs that may be related to a better response to chemotherapy drugs. In addition, a critical literature review was performed based on a standardized appraisal form after selecting the articles. Ultimately, 21 eligible studies were appraised to assess the association between gene mutations and good prognosis. Mutations in KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and APC were identified as being associated with a poor response to chemotherapy drugs, whereas mutations of CREBBP and POLD1 were associated with longer overall survival. CONCLUSION: NGS can identify precise predictors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, leading to improved outcomes for CRC patients.","Zhao, Long; Wang, Quan; Zhao, Shi-Dong; Zhou, Jing; Jiang, Ke-Wei; Ye, Ying-Jiang; Wang, Shan; Shen, Zhan-Long",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i24.7099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540965/,434

It is essential that guidance be presented in an accessible and usable format to facilitate its translation into evidence‐based best practice. In this article, we propose the Haddon matrix as a tool well‐suited to this task. The Haddon matrix is a conceptual model that organizes influencing factors into pre‐event, event, and post‐event phases, and into host, agent, and environment domains akin to the components of the epidemiologic triad. The Haddon matrix has previously been applied to topics relevant to the care of older persons, such as fall prevention, as well as to pandemic planning and response. Presented here is a novel application of the Haddon matrix to pandemic response in nursing homes, with practical applications for nursing home decision‐makers in their efforts to prevent and contain COVID‐19.","Fritch, William M.; Agnew, Jacqueline; Rosman, Lori; Cadorette, Maureen A.; Barnett, Daniel J.",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235743/,434

To mitigate the negative responses from environmentally conscious consumer groups, fashion merchandisers have sought to partner with non-governmental organizations (NGOs). While there is a growing body of literature on sustainability and social responsibility (SSR), the increasingly popular practice of fast-fashion industry partnering with NGOs has been neglected, and so far, remained under the radar. Such partnerships may be of success, but at the same time while promising on the surface, they can actually go awry, resulting in adverse outcomes for both parties. We build upon the loose-coupling theory to explain the relationships between fast-fashion multinational enterprises (MNEs) and NGOs. We discuss three causes (casual indeterminacy; fragmented external environment; discrete internal environment) and four key benefits (adaptability to environmental changes, flexibility, innovation, and firewalls for separate identity) for loosely-coupled partnerships. We then explore the dark side of such partnerships, identifying three challenges (power imbalance, mistrust and opportunism, and misaligning goals). Finally, we offer a set of propositions as a way of advancing our knowledge of partnerships in fashion merchandising industry.","Liu, Steven Y.H.; Napier, Elizabeth; Runfola, Andrea; Cavusgil, S.

611197,A lattice gas model for infection spreading: Application to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area,2020-12-25,"Antimicrobial resistance continues to outpace the development of new chemotherapeutics. Novel pathogens continue to evolve and emerge. Public health innovation has the potential to open a new front in the war of “our wits against their genes” (Joshua Lederberg). Dense sampling coupled to next generation sequencing can increase the spatial and temporal resolution of microbial characterization while sensor technologies precisely map physical parameters relevant to microbial survival and spread. Microbial, physical, and epidemiological big data could be combined to improve prospective risk identification. However, applied in the wrong way, these approaches may not realize their maximum potential benefits and could even do harm. Minimizing microbial-human interactions would be a mistake. There is evidence that microbes previously thought of at best “benign” may actually enhance human health. Benign and health-promoting microbiomes may, or may not, spread via mechanisms similar to pathogens. Infectious vaccines are approaching readiness to make enhanced contributions to herd immunity. The rigorously defined nature of infectious vaccines contrasts with indigenous “benign or health-promoting microbiomes” but they may converge. A “microbial Neolithic revolution” is a possible future in which human microbial-associations are understood and managed analogously to the macro-agriculture of plants and animals. Tradeoffs need to be framed in order to understand health-promoting potentials of benign, and/or health-promoting microbiomes and infectious vaccines while also discouraging pathogens. Super-spreaders are currently defined as individuals who play an outsized role in the contagion of infectious disease. A key unanswered question is whether the super-spreader concept may apply similarly to health-promoting microbes. The complex interactions of individual rights, community health, pathogen contagion, the spread of benign, and of health-promoting microbiomes including infectious vaccines require study.

ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. To predict the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed the key residues of ACE2 for recognizing S protein. We found that most of the selected mammals including pets (dog and cat), pangolin and Circetidae mammals remained the most of key residues for association with S protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interface between cat/dog/pangolin/Chinese hamster ACE2 and SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 S protein was simulated through homology modeling. We identified that N82 in ACE2 showed a closer contact with SARS-CoV-2 S protein than M82 in human ACE2. Our finding will provide important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and a new strategy to design an optimized ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Luan, Junwen; Lu, Yue; Jin, Xiaolu; Zhang, Leiliang",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.03.047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32201080/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006291X2030526X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2030526X,434
611455,Correction to: Factors Contributing to Psychological Ill#Effects and Resilience of Caregivers of Children with Developmental Disabilities During a Nation#wide Lockdown During the COVID#19 Pandemic,2021-07-26,"INTRODUCTION: Introduction/Background: A new protocol and standard of care was created amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic that began in 2020. Traditional split night studies fell out of favor and were replaced by solely diagnostic studies with placement on Auto-PAP therapy if treatment of sleep disordered breathing was required. Some patients, however, required a more tailored approach if diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) was particularly concerning. Our case report describes the treatment of a patient with severe Mixed Apnea Predominant Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) with accompanying Central Sleep Apnea (CSA) using COVID-19 Precautions. REPORT OF CASE(S): Case Description: A 48 year old AAM patient with a PMH of HTN, pre-diabetes, GERD, obesity and tobacco abuse initially presented to Sleep Medicine in late January 2020 with complaints of snoring, witnessed apneas, waking up gasping, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and non-restorative sleep for many years with ESS 24 and FSS 48 on initial evaluation. Diagnostic PSG showed AHI 76.9 with O2 desaturation to 59% and demonstrated the presence of severe Mixed Apnea predominant OSA and CSA with worsening during REM sleep. Because of the severity, he underwent a PAP titration in August 2020 using the AASM COVID-19 sleep study precautions which included use of a negative pressure room. Optimal control of snoring, apneic respiratory events and oxygen desaturations was achieved at 14 cm H2O in the supine body position during REM sleep. Follow up with Sleep Medicine in October and December 2020 showed objective compliance over a 30 day period not completely at goal due to issues with mask desensitization and sleep hygiene, however the patient subjectively reported that he noticed great improvement in snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue. CONCLUSION: DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: With a diagnosis of Severe Mixed Apnea Predominant OSA as well as CSA noted during the study, the differential diagnosis included CHF, Chiari malformation, opioid abuse and idiopathic CSA as the cause. Despite a dangerous pandemic, appropriate therapy for certain patients must still be attained. Special protocols developed during the COVID-19 Pandemic allowed for our patient to receive adequate treatment, while ensuring the safety of all involved.

These chronic conditions are modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Social determinants of health (SDoHs) have contributed to persistent chronic condition disparities in the United States. This study identified SDoHs associated with the use of screening services for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia by analyzing data from the 2019 United States National Health Interview Survey. Examined SDoHs consisted of demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and health care utilization. Age, gender, education, annual income, health coverage, and usual care source were positively associated with the odds of receiving secondary preventive services. There was a marginal significance among race/ethnicity and employment status in association with the odds of receiving secondary preventive services. This study’s findings inform health educators and providers, public health professionals, and policymakers to fund, plan, and coordinate services and interventions accordingly to improve the population’s quality of life and lengthen lifespan by promptly diagnosing and treating these diseases.","Nguyen, Tran; Barefield, Amanda; Nguyen, Gia-Thien",Med Sci (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33806794/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medsci9010019,434

Although generally well-received in Australia, community frustration regarding these restrictions appeared to diverge across political lines. Therefore, we examined the unique effects of the ideological subfactors of Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA; Aggression, Submission and Conventionalism) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO; Dominance and Anti-egalitarianism) in predicting perceived personal threat of COVID-19, and support for and reactance to government restrictions, in Australian residents across two separate samples (S1 N = 451, S2 N = 838). COVID-19 threat was positively predicted by Submission, and negatively by Conventionalism, and Anti-egalitarianism. Support for restrictions was also positively predicted by Submission, and negatively by Conventionalism, Dominance, and Anti-egalitarianism. Reactance to government restrictions was negatively predicted by Submission, and positively by Conventionalism, Dominance, and Anti-egalitarianism. These findings suggest that right-wing ideological subfactors contribute to the one's perception of COVID-19 threat and government restrictions differentially.","Clarke, Edward J.R.; Klas, Anna; Dyos, Emily",Pers Individ Dif,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110734; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886921001094?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0191886921001094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33583988/,434

An interdisciplinary approach informed the selection and use of multiple NPIs, combining quantitative modeling of the health/economic impacts of interventions with qualitative assessments of other important considerations (e.g., cost, ease of implementation, equity). This paper provides further details of our model, describes extensions, presents sensitivity analyses, and analyzes strategies that periodically switch between a base NPI level and a higher NPI level. We find that a periodic strategy, if implemented with perfect compliance, could have produced similar health outcomes as static strategies but might have produced better outcomes when considering other measures of social welfare. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to shape the tradeoffs between economic and health outcomes by carefully evaluating a more comprehensive range of reopening policies.","Vardavas, Raffaele; de Lima, Pedro Nascimento; Baker, Lawrence",medRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.28.21252642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688672/; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.28.21252642v1?rss=1,434

We scoped the existing literature on the abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Google scholar and World Health Organization COVID-19 database. RESULTS: 35 studies were included in the final descriptive synthesis. Among the studies reporting positive abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, majority described imaging abnormalities of the GI tract (16 studies), of which bowel wall thickening was most frequently reported. Other findings noted were abdominal imaging manifestations of bowel ischemia with thrombosis of the splanchnic vasculature, and imaging features suggestive of pancreatitis. Imaging findings suggestive of solid organ infarction were reported in nine studies. An association between imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis and COVID-19 was noted in three studies. Incidental lung base findings on abdominal imaging were noted in 18 studies, where patients presented with predominant GI symptoms. The most common finding was bilateral ground glass opacities (90.7%) with predominant multilobar (91.1%) and peripheral (64.4%) distribution. CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides insight into the abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these imaging manifestations will not only help in further research but also will aid in curtailing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Further prospective studies are needed to gain better insight into the pathophysiology of these imaging manifestations.

613962,Metamorphosis of COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-20,"BACKGROUND: Many health care facilities in low- and middle-income countries are inadequately resourced. COVID-19 has the potential to decimate surgical health care services unless health systems take stringent measures to protect health care workers from viral exposure and ensure the continuity of specialized care for patients. Among these measures, the timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is paramount to ensure the use of protective measures and isolation of patients to prevent transmission to health care personnel caring for patients with an unknown COVID-19 status or contact during the pandemic. Besides molecular and antibody tests, chest computed tomography (CT) has been assessed as a potential tool to aid in the screening or diagnosis of COVID-19 and could be valuable in the emergency care setting. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the protocol for an umbrella review that aims to identify and summarize the available literature on the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT for COVID-19 in trauma surgery patients requiring urgent care. The objective is to inform future recommendations on emergency care for this category of patients. METHODS: We will conduct several searches in the L·OVE (Living Overview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19, a system that performs automated regular searches in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and over 30 other sources. The search results will be presented according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis). This review will preferentially consider systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, as well as individual studies of such design, if not included in the systematic reviews, that assessed the sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in emergency trauma surgery patients. Critical appraisal of the included studies for risk of bias will be conducted. Data will be extracted using a standardized data extraction tool. Findings will be summarized narratively, and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to grade the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Ethics approval is not required for this systematic review, as there will be no patient involvement. The search for this systematic review commenced in October 2020, and we expect to publish the findings in early 2021. The plan for dissemination is to publish the findings in a peer-reviewed journal and present our results at conferences that engage the most pertinent stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting health care workers from infection is essential. Up-to-date information on the efficacy of diagnostic tests for detecting COVID-19 is essential. This review will serve an important role as a thorough summary to inform evidence-based recommendations on establishing effective policy and clinical guideline recommendations.

Individuals with elevated tendencies to develop internet addiction represent the transition between healthy and clinical conditions and may progress to behavioral addictive disorders. In this network neuroscience study, we used resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs‐fMRI) to examine how and whether individual variations in the tendency of developing internet addiction rewire functional connectivity and diminish the amplitude of spontaneous low‐frequency fluctuations in healthy brains. The influence of neurocognitive aging (aged over 60 years) on executive‐cerebellar networks responsible for internet addictive behavior was also investigated. Our results revealed that individuals with an elevated tendency of developing internet addiction had disrupted executive‐cerebellar networks but increased occipital‐putamen connectivity, probably resulting from addiction‐sensitive cognitive control processes and bottom‐up sensory plasticity. Neurocognitive aging alleviated the effects of reduced mechanisms of prefrontal and cerebellar connectivity, suggesting age‐related modulation of addiction‐associated brain networks in response to compulsive internet use. Our findings highlight age‐related and individual differences in altered functional connectivity and the brain networks of individuals at a high risk of developing internet addictive disorders. These results offer novel network‐based preclinical markers of internet addictive behaviors for individuals of different ages.","Patil, Abhishek Uday; Madathil, Deepa; Huang, Chih‐Mao",Hum Brain Mapp,https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34170056/,434
615269,Social media and smartphone app use predicts maintenance of physical activity during Covid-19 enforced isolation in psychiatric outpatients,2020-06-28,"BACKGROUND: An Informatics Consult has been proposed in which clinicians request novel evidence from large scale health data resources, tailored to the treatment of a specific patient. However, the availability of such consultations is lacking. We seek to provide an Informatics Consult for a situation where a treatment indication and contraindication coexist in the same patient, i.e., anti-coagulation use for stroke prevention in a patient with both atrial fibrillation (AF) and liver cirrhosis. METHODS: We examined four sources of evidence for the effect of warfarin on stroke risk or all-cause mortality from: (1) randomised controlled trials (RCTs), (2) meta-analysis of prior observational studies, (3) trial emulation (using population electronic health records (N = 3,854,710) and (4) genetic evidence (Mendelian randomisation). We developed prototype forms to request an Informatics Consult and return of results in electronic health record systems. RESULTS: We found 0 RCT reports and 0 trials recruiting for patients with AF and cirrhosis. We found broad concordance across the three new sources of evidence we generated. Meta-analysis of prior observational studies showed that warfarin use was associated with lower stroke risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, CI 0.39–1.29). In a target trial emulation, warfarin was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR = 0.61, CI 0.49–0.76) and ischaemic stroke (HR = 0.27, CI 0.08–0.91). Mendelian randomisation served as a drug target validation where we found that lower levels of vitamin K1 (warfarin is a vitamin K1 antagonist) are associated with lower stroke risk. A pilot survey with an independent sample of 34 clinicians revealed that 85% of clinicians found information on prognosis useful and that 79% thought that they should have access to the Informatics Consult as a service within their healthcare systems. We identified candidate steps for automation to scale evidence generation and to accelerate the return of results. CONCLUSION: We performed a proof-of-concept Informatics Consult for evidence generation, which may inform treatment decisions in situations where there is dearth of randomised trials. Patients are surprised to know that their clinicians are currently not able to learn in clinic from data on ‘patients like me’. We identify the key challenges in offering such an Informatics Consult as a service.

The Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) declared two of the three WPV types, type 2 (WPV2) and type 3 (WPV3), eradicated globally in 2015 and 2019, respectively (1). Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (1). Containment under strict biorisk management measures is vital to prevent reintroduction of eradicated polioviruses into communities from poliovirus facilities. In 2015, Member States committed to contain type 2 polioviruses (PV2) in poliovirus-essential facilities (PEFs) certified in accordance with a global standard (2). Member states agreed to report national PV2 inventories annually, destroy unneeded PV2 materials, and, if retaining PV2 materials, establish national authorities for containment (NACs) and a PEF auditing process. Since declaration of WPV3 eradication in October 2019, these activities are also required with WPV3 materials. Despite challenges faced during 2019-2020, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the global poliovirus containment program continues to work toward important milestones.

With government-imposed restrictions as well as a general burden on healthcare systems, the pandemic has the potential to disrupt the access to, and delivery of, mental healthcare. METHODS: Electronic healthcare records from primary care psychological therapy services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapy) in England were used to examine changes in access to mental health services and service delivery during early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive time series was conducted using data from five NHS trusts to examine patterns in referrals to services (1st January 2019 to 24th May 2020) and appointments (1st January 2020 to 24th May 2020) taking place. FINDINGS: The number of patients accessing mental health services dropped by an average of 55% in the early weeks after the March 2020 lockdown was announced, reaching a maximum reduction of 74% in the initial 3 weeks after lockdown in the UK, which gradually recovered to a 28% reduction by May. We found some evidence suggesting changes in the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of referrals. Despite a reduction in access, the impact on appointments appeared limited with service providers shifting to remote delivery of care. INTERPRETATION: Services appeared to adapt to provide continuity of care in mental healthcare. However, patients accessing services reduced, potentially placing a future burden on service. Despite the observational nature of the data, the present study can inform the planning of service provision and policy. FUNDING: AD and TS were funded by Innovate UK (KTP #11,105).","Bauer-Staeb, Clarissa; Davis, Alice; Smith, Theresa; Wilsher, Wendy; Betts, David; Eldridge, Chris; Griffith, Emma; Faraway, Julian; Button, Katherine S.",EClinicalMedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386738/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100939,434

We use a mathematical framework to model within-host viral dynamics and test different criteria for ending isolation. By considering a fixed time of 10 days since symptom onset as the criterion for ending isolation, we estimated that the risk of releasing an individual who is still infectious is low (0–6.6%). However, this policy entails lengthy unnecessary isolations (4.8–8.3 days). In contrast, by using a personalized strategy, similar low risks can be reached with shorter prolonged isolations. The obtained findings provide a scientific rationale for policies on ending the isolation of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.","Jeong, Yong Dam; Ejima, Keisuke; Kim, Kwang Su; Iwanami, Shoya; Bento, Ana I; Fujita, Yasuhisa; Jung, Il Hyo; Aihara, Kazuyuki; Watashi, Koichi; Miyazaki, Taiga; Wakita, Takaji; Iwami, Shingo; Ajelli, Marco",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.69340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34311842/,434

Methods We used a time-series analysis to discover how patterns of five indicators of mobility data relate to changes in Rt of 125 countries distributed over three groups based on Rt-mobility correlation. Group 1 included 71 countries in which Rt correlates negatively with residential and positively with other mobility indicators. Group 2 included 25 countries showing an opposite correlation pattern to Group 1. Group 3 included the 29 remaining countries. We chose the best-fit TL based on forecast and linear regression models. We used linear mixed models to evaluate how mobility indicators and the stringency index (SI) relate with Rt. SI reflects the strictness of governmental responses to COVID-19. Results With a median of 14 days, TLs varied across countries as well as across groups of countries. There was a strong negative correlation between SI and Rt in most countries belonging to Group 1 as opposed to Group 2. SI (units of 10%) associated with decreasing Rt in Group 1 [{beta} -0.15, 95% CI -0.15 - (-0.14)] and Group 3 [-0.05, -0.07 - (-0.03)], whereas, in Group 2, SI associated with increasing Rt (0.13, 0.11 - 0.16).

618248,How Sex Workers Understand Their Experiences of Working in the Republic of Ireland,2021-08-03,"BACKGROUND: Child maltreatment and consequently child protection are highly relevant and current issues in our society. Medical institutions are widely regarded as places of healing, care and support. But they also hold risk factors to promote child maltreatment. Efforts have to be taken in order to offer help to victims by medical institutions and to reduce risk factors for child maltreatment. Therefore, health professionals in the field of child protection must be trained and sensitized for these two purposes. The Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry / Psychotherapy at the University Hospital of Ulm in Germany is developing E-Learning courses directed to health professionals in order to create flexible advanced training courses for dealing with child abuse, and to increase competences in child protection. Due to their specific role in (institutional) child protection, three courses and their evaluation will be presented in this article. The aim of the studies is to examine if those online-courses are increasing knowledge and skills in child protection and how satisfied participants are with course quality. METHODS: Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT) were conducted with one wait-list control group and one group participating in the course (= intervention group). The RCTs took place from October 2016 to March 2017 for two courses, and from May 2017 to September 2017 for the other course. Data were analysed with mixed design ANOVA. For evaluation of user satisfaction, descriptive statistics are reported. RESULTS: For all three courses, knowledge and practical capacities on the topic of the intervention group raised significantly in comparison to the values of the control group. Furthermore, participants of the course for managers felt better prepared to meet their responsibilities in regard to institutional child protection and came up with ideas on how to implement safeguarding standards in their institution. Overall, participants were very satisfied with the structure and the content of the courses. CONCLUSIONS: The article shows that the online-courses are an effective and well-accepted approach to train professionals in topics regarding (institutional) child protection by contributing to the participants´ abilities to create medical facilities into a place of competence and protection.","König, Elisa; Maier, Anna; Fegert, Jörg Michael; Hoffmann, Ulrike",Arch Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292622/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00465-4,434

Prehabilitation seems to attenuate the loss of lean mass in the early postoperative period. However, its long-term role has not been studied. Lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced to carry out the prehabilitation program at home. This study aimed to assess the effect of home prehabilitation on body composition, complications, and hospital stay in patients undergoing oncological colorectal surgery. METHODS: A prospective and randomized clinical study was conducted in 20 patients operated of colorectal cancer during COVID-19 lockdown (13 March to 21 June 2020) in a single university clinical hospital. Patients were randomized into two study groups (10 per group): prehabilitation vs standard care. Changes in lean mass and fat mass at 45 and 90 days after surgery were measured using multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: Prehabilitation managed to reduce hospital stay (4.8 vs 7.2 days, p = 0.052) and postoperative complications (20% vs 50%, p = 0.16). Forty-five days after surgery, the loss of lean mass decreased (1.7% vs 7.1%, p = 0.17). These differences in lean mass were attenuated at 90 days; however, the standard care group increased considerably their fat mass compared to the prehabilitation group (+ 8.72% vs − 8.16%). CONCLUSIONS: Home prehabilitation has proven its effectiveness, achieving an attenuation of lean mass loss in the early postoperative period and a lower gain in fat mass in the late postoperative period. In addition, it has managed to reduce hospital stays and postoperative complications.

Non-responders to vaccinations are not uncommonly encountered in clinical medicine (e.g. in the field of hepatitis B). Whereas vaccine-induced humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is compromised by emerging Variants of Concern (VOCs), cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is emerging as resilient against VOCs. Thus commercially available test kits for diagnostic laboratories designed to evaluate cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed. Here we evaluated the novel QuantiFERON SARS-CoV-2 assay (Qiagen) measuring INF-ɣ release induced by two spike-derived peptide pools (Ag1 and Ag2) in a cohort of health care workers vaccinated with the mRNA-1273 vaccine and confirmed humoral response. Our study indicates the usefulness of this novel assay for routine laboratories to evaluate cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in response to mRNA-1273 vaccination.","Krüttgen, Alexander; Klingel, Hanna; Haase, Gerhard; Haefner, Helga; Imöhl, Matthias; Kleines, Michael",J Virol Methods,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093421002342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34555429/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114295; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093421002342?v=s5,434
619489,Reopening America's Schools During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protecting Asian Students From Stigma and Discrimination,2020-11-30,"A popular model for global scientific repositories is the data commons, which pools or connects many datasets alongside supporting infrastructure. A data commons must establish legally interoperability between datasets to ensure researchers can aggregate and re-use them. This is usually achieved by establishing a shared governance structure. Unfortunately, governance often takes years to negotiate, and involves a trade-off between data inclusion and data availability. It can also be difficult for repositories to modify governance structures in response to changing scientific priorities, data sharing practices, or legal frameworks. This problem has been laid bare by the sudden shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a rapid and flexible strategy for scientific repositories to achieve legal interoperability: the policy-aware data lake. This strategy draws on technical concepts of modularity, metadata, and data lakes. Datasets are treated as independent modules, which can be subject to distinctive legal requirements. Each module must, however, be described using standard legal metadata. This allows legally compatible datasets to be rapidly combined and made available on a just-in-time basis to certain researchers for certain purposes. Global scientific repositories increasingly need such flexibility to manage scientific, organizational, and legal complexity, and to improve their responsiveness to global pandemics.","Thorogood, Adrian",J Law Biosci,https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33005429/,434

Besides particular circumstances in healthcare, an unknown virus, social distancing, and homeschooling, the capital was hit with the earthquake during the lockdown. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the influence of demographic characteristics, professional differences, medical history, and specific stressors on the psychological outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with the online questionnaire containing the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was conducted from 1st to 15 May 2020 in FM. RESULTS: HCPs (534, 35% response rate), predominantly female (84.5%), participated in the research. High prevalence of stress (30.9%), anxiety (33.1%), depression (30.7%), and PTSD (33.0%) were found. Female participants had higher results in the anxiety subscale of DASS-21 and IES-R scores. Pre-existing conditions were associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. The IES-R score for PTSD showed borderline correlation (p = 0.053) with working in regions with the highest incidence of COVID-19. Having schoolchildren made a difference on a stress subscale in DASS-21 (p < 0.043), but the earthquake did not have an impact. CONCLUSION: Family physicians and nurses in FM in Croatia are under a great mental load during the COVID-19 outbreak. Results suggest that HCPs of the female sex, with pre-existing chronic conditions, work in regions with a high incidence of SARS-CoV-2 or have schoolchildren at greater risk of the poor psychological outcome.","Vlah Tomičević, Sunčana; Lang, Valerija Bralić",The European journal of general practice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34328376/; https://doi.org/10.1080/13814788.2021.1954154,434
620121,COVID-19 - Opportunity for online education: Do not forget the ethical considerations in teaching learners,2021-05-20,"In three-dimensional domain swapping, two protein monomers exchange a part of their structures to form an intertwined homodimer, whose subunits resemble the monomer. Several viral proteins domain swap to increase their structural complexity or functional avidity. The main protease (M(pro)) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus proteolyzes viral polyproteins and has been a target for anti-SARS drug design. Domain swapping in the α-helical C-terminal domain of M(pro) (M(pro)C) locks M(pro) into a hyperactive octameric form that is hypothesized to promote the early stages of viral replication. However, in the absence of a complete molecular understanding of the mechanism of domain swapping, investigations into the biological relevance of this octameric M(pro) have stalled. Isolated M(pro)C can exist as a monomer or a domain-swapped dimer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of M(pro)C using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of M(pro)C folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the M(pro)C domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric M(pro) in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.","Terse, Vishram L.; Gosavi, Shachi",Biophys J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33359834/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349520332240; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349520332240; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.11.2277,434

The serial mediation roles of existential anxiety and conspiracy beliefs,2021-08-11,"OBJECTIVE: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly impacted healthcare delivery and strained medical training. This study explores resident and faculty perceptions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on technical skill decay of surgical and anesthesia residents. We hypothesized that many residents perceived that their technical abilities diminished due to a short period of interruption in their training. DESIGN: An IRB-exempt, web-based cross-sectional survey distributed to residents and faculty SETTING: Two large academic tertiary medical centers, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, of the Northwell Health System in New York. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery, anesthesiology, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, oral maxillofacial surgery, urology, podiatry residents and faculty. RESULTS: All residents reported a significant impact on their training. Residents (82%) and faculty (94%) reported a significant reduction in case volumes due to the COVID pandemic (p<0.05). 64% of residents reported a reduction in technical skills, and 75% of faculty perceived a decrease in resident technical skills. Residents were concerned about fulfilling ACGME case requirements, however faculty were more optimistic that residents would achieve level-appropriate proficiency by the conclusion of their training. Both residents and faculty felt that resident critical care skills improved as a result of redeployment to COVID-19 intensive care units (66% and 94%). Additionally, residents reported increased confidence in their ability to care for critically ill patients and positive impact on professional competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training are multi-dimensional. The majority of surgical and anesthesia residents perceived that their technical ability diminished as a result of skill decay, whereas other skillsets improved. Longitudinal surveillance of trainees is warranted to evaluate the effect of reduced operative volume and redeployment on professional competency.","Roberts, Bailey; Demyan, Lyudmyla; Sodhi, Nipun; DePeralta, Danielle; Zimmern, Andrea; Arohnson, Judith; Molmenti, Ernesto; Patel, Vihas; Nofi, Colleen",J Surg Educ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931720421002518; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2021.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625397/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931720421002518?v=s5,434

The result showed that the combination of certain chloroquine analogs and Akt inhibitors are highly effective. In particular, the chloroquine analog N′-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine (compound 5) was highly effective in sensitizing cancer cell killing when combined with either Akt inhibitor 8 (1-{1-[4-(7-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-6-yl)-benzyl]-piperidin-4-yl}-1,3-dihydro-benzoimidazol-2-one) or 9 ([4-(2-chloro-4a,10a-dihydro-phenoxazin-10-yl)-butyl]-diethyl-amine hydrochloride). Importantly, the enhancement of chloroquine analogs 5 on cell killing by Akt inhibitors 8 and 9 was cancer-specific. Thus, this combinational approach is highly promising in controlling tumors with a minimum side effect. Structural analysis of effective and ineffective chloroquine analogs suggests that the 4-aminoquinoline scaffold and lateral side chain of dimethylamino functionality play an important role for the enhancement of cell killing by Akt inhibitors.","Hu, Changkun; Raja Solomon, V.; Cano, Pablo; Lee, Hoyun",Eur J Med Chem,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S022352340900587X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19945197/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S022352340900587X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2009.11.017,434

A significant number of infectious diseases and chronic disorders are still not preventable by existing vaccination schemes; therefore, new-generation vaccines are needed. Novel technologies such as nanoparticulate systems and adjuvants can enable safe and effective vaccines for difficult target populations such as newborns, elderly, and the immune-compromised. More recently, polymer-based particles have found application as vaccine platforms and vaccine adjuvants due to their ability to prevent antigen degradation and clearance, coupled with enhanced uptake by professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Polymeric nanoparticles have been applied in vaccine delivery, showing significant adjuvant effects as they can easily be taken up by APCs. In other words, polymer-based systems offer a lot of advantages, including versatility and flexibility in the design process, the ability to incorporate a range of immunomodulators/antigens, mimicking infection in different ways, and acting as a depot, thereby persisting long enough to generate adaptive immune responses.

Psychological Safety and Organizational Embeddedness as Mediators,2021-07-19,"Infection by the new corona virus strain SARS-CoV-2 and its related syndrome COVID-19 has caused several hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Patients of higher age and with preexisting chronic health conditions are at an increased risk of fatal disease outcome. However, detailed information on causes of death and the contribution of comorbidities to death yet is missing. Here, we report autopsy findings on causes of death and comorbidities of 26 decedents that had clinically presented with severe COVID-19. We found that septic shock and multi organ failure was the most common immediate cause of death, often due to suppurative pulmonary infection. Respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar damage presented as the most immediate cause of death in fewer cases. Several comorbidities, such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and obesity were present in the vast majority of patients. Our findings reveal that causes of death were directly related to COVID-19 in the majority of decedents, while they appear not to be an immediate result of preexisting health conditions and comorbidities. We therefore suggest that the majority of patients had died of COVID-19 with only contributory implications of preexisting health conditions to the mechanism of death.","Elezkurtaj, S.; Greuel, S.; Ihlow, J.; Michaelis, E.; Bischoff, P.; Kunze, C.

Objectively testing the effectiveness of social media advertising remains difficult due to a lack of guiding frameworks and applicable behavioral measures. This study examines advertising appeals’ effectiveness in driving engagement and actions on and beyond social media platforms. Method: In an experiment, positive, negative and coactive ads were shared on social media and promoted for a week. The three ads were controlled in an A/B testing experiment to ensure applicable comparison. Measures used included impressions, likes, shares and clicks following the multi-actor social media engagement framework. Data were extracted using Facebook ads manager and website data. Significance was tested through a series of chi-square tests. Results: The promoted ads reached over 21,000 users. Significant effect was found for appeal type on engagement and behavioral actions. The findings support the use of negative advertising appeals over positive and coactive appeals. Conclusion: Practically, in the charity and environment context, advertisers aiming to drive engagement on social media as well as behavioral actions beyond social media should consider negative advertising appeals. Theoretically, this study demonstrates the value of using the multi-actor social media engagement framework to test advertising appeal effectiveness. Further, this study proposes an extension to evaluate behavioral outcomes.","Yousef, Murooj; Dietrich, Timo; Rundle-Thiele, Sharyn",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18115954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206119/,434

There has been a failure to develop effective treatment for this tumor. Using a combined RNAi and chemical screen targeting epigenomic regulators, we identify the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) component BMI1 as a critical factor for DIPG tumor maintenance in vivo. BMI1 chromatin occupancy is enriched at genes associated with differentiation and tumor suppressors in DIPG cells. Inhibition of BMI1 decreases cell self-renewal and attenuates tumor growth due to induction of senescence. Prolonged BMI1 inhibition induces a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which promotes tumor recurrence. Clearance of senescent cells using BH3 protein mimetics co-operates with BMI1 inhibition to enhance tumor cell killing in vivo.","Balakrishnan, Ilango; Danis, Etienne; Pierce, Angela; Madhavan, Krishna; Wang, Dong; Dahl, Nathan; Sanford, Bridget; Birks, Diane K.; Davidson, Nate; Metselaar, Dennis S.; Meel, Michaël Hananja; Lemma, Rakeb; Donson, Andrew; Vijmasi, Trinka; Katagi, Hiroaki; Sola, Ismail; Fosmire, Susan; Alimova, Irina; Steiner, Jenna; Gilani, Ahmed; Hulleman, Esther; Serkova, Natalie J.; Hashizume, Rintaro; Hawkins, Cynthia; Carcaboso, Angel M.; Gupta, Nalin; Monje, Michelle; Jabado, Nada; Jones, Kenneth; Foreman, Nicholas; Green, Adam; Vibhakar, Rajeev; Venkataraman, Sujatha",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33086074/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124720312754; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720312754; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.108286,434

METHODS: The study was carried out on a selected group of 50 healthy subjects. Voice samples were recorded directly in Praat. All subjects were trained to voice a vocal sample of a sustained /a/, at a conversational voice intensity, with no intensity or frequency variation, for the Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), wearing the surgical mask and then without wearing the surgical mask. RESULTS: None of the variations in acoustic voice analysis detected wearing a surgical mask and not wearing a surgical mask were statistically significant.

This manifests in an increased incidence of respiratory diseases and skin conditions. To prevent high morbidity, a plant protein product was included in the diet of first-year university students. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of this food intervention in preventing the most common diseases among Kaliningrad students. Two groups of university students took part in the food trial. In the control group, catabolic processes prevailed in nutrient metabolism. Disadaptation manifested itself in the metabolism of proteins, vitamins, minerals, hematopoiesis and humoral immunity. Inflammation was indicated by α1- and α2-globulins, a weak immune response, and IgM and IgG. High oxidative stress and low antioxidative ability of blood serum were observed. The plant-based protein product (FP) helped preserve testosterone level and prevent an increase in catabolic reactions. Moreover, it had a positive effect on both red blood cell hematopoiesis (a smaller increase in the average volume of erythrocytes, the same average concentration and content of hemoglobin, an increased relative red cell distribution width (RDW) and white blood cell hematopoiesis (a beneficial effect for the immune system: lymphocytes, the relative content of neutrophils, monocytes, basophils and eosinophils). The stimulation of humoral immunity was evidenced by beta- and gamma-globulins, an active immune response, the level of IgM and IgG, antioxidant protection, reduction of peroxides and an increase in antioxidant activity of blood serum. The 34-week observation showed a 1.7-fold decrease in the incidence of respiratory illnesses and a 5.7-fold decrease in skin and subcutaneous tissue diseases. Acute respiratory infections were reduced 1.8-fold. There were no cases of community-acquired pneumonia in the treatment group, compared with 55.1‰ in the control group. The incidence of respiratory diseases was 3.3–10.6 times lower in the treatment group than in the control group in weeks 6–19.

AHNE usually involves the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter. This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment. She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure. Blood tests were non-informative. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytosis with normal protein and normal glucose but an elevated IgG index. After testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, she was administered steroids. Treatment was ineffective, and the patient died. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a potential central nervous system (CNS) pathogen, which may manifest as AHNE. These patients may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and frontal dysexecutive syndrome, with cognitive impairment being the presenting feature of neuro-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The patient described in this report is unique for acute-onset and isolated cognitive impairments due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of clinical or radiological respiratory manifestations. These findings may help in the early detection and diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19, especially among clinicians and neurologists working in areas of endemic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Finsterer, Josef; Chatterjee, Subham; Ray, Biman Kanti",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.925641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32799213/,434
627294,Dynamically adjusted strategy in response to developments in the COVID-19 pandemic as a new normal,2021-08-09,"Abstract While SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions and claimed more than 250,000 lives, experts are warning that the impact of other diseases neglected due to the pandemic may be just as significant in the months and years to come. Specifically, when health systems are overwhelmed, and people refrain from visiting health facilities due to movement restrictions or fears about illness exposure, both direct mortality and indirect mortality from preventable and treatable conditions increase.1-3 Female genital mutilation (FGM), also named female genital cutting, is acknowledged as a violation of human rights of women.4 The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals called for the elimination of the practice by 2030.5 FGM is referred to as any procedure involving the alteration or excision of external female genitalia without medical indication,6 and 3 million women in the world are estimated to be at risk of undergoing this procedure annually.6 It is a major public health problem in several countries in Africa and Middle East,6,7 being almost universal in seven African countries (prevalence >85%).6 A report from UNICEF highlighted how this practice is still being widely carried out in 29 countries in Africa and in Middle East, despite the fact that at least 24 of these countries have legislation or some form of decrees against FGM.8 However, some evident progress is ongoing: under the new FGM amendment to the criminal law in Sudan that was approved very recently (22 April 2020), anyone who performs FGM either inside a medical establishment or elsewhere faces three years' imprisonment and fine. 9 Studies conducted in different settings have clearly showed an adverse effect of FGM on psychological, sexual and reproductive health unfavourable outcomes. 10 This includes posttraumatic stress disorder,11 dyspareunia and genitourinary complications. Adverse obstetric outcomes, such as increased risk for caesarean delivery, episiotomy and postpartum haemorrhage, are also more frequent.12 Scar tissue, especially in women with FGM type III (infibulation) can result in obstructed labour or obstetric trauma.13 It is known that in situations of conflicts and disaster, gender inequality, gender-based violence and violation of human rights are likely to increase, as protection and health system are disrupted, leaving acts of violence unpunished and condoned by the societies. This applies to health emergencies as well, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. FGM, early marriage and violence against women and girls are life-threatening, health and human rights challenge, due to the inequal relations, and patriarchal rules.14 Survivors are left no choice or right of determination over their bodies, physical, and sexual and reproductive health. Estimates provided by Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Victoria University (Australia) predict that significant levels of lockdown-related disruption over 6 months may cause significant delays in programmes to end female genital mutilation, potentially leading to around 2 million more cases of FGM over the next decade than would otherwise have occurred.15 These striking figures become even more daunting when compounded with the expected additional 31 million cases of gender-based violence and the 13 million more child marriages over the next 10 years.15 Support to continued access to reproductive health care services and protection of the rights and dignity of all women and girls remains even more critical in contexts such as the current pandemic. To do so, preparedness and response plans must incorporate and integrate Female Genital Mutilation in Gender-Based Violence, and Sexual and Reproductive Health Programmes, including in community awareness initiatives and activities, thus ensuring risk mitigation as well as remote and mobile case management.","Bellizzi, S.; Nivoli, A.; Lorettu, L.; Ronzoni, A.

The study evaluated selected human parasitoses with similar symptoms to COVID-19 and examined their potential influence on SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion. The available data suggest that at least several human parasitoses could result in misdiagnosis of COVID-19. Some disorders, such as malaria, schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths, can increase the risk of severe infection with COVID-19. It is also suggested that recovery from parasitic disease can enhance the immune system and protect from COVID-19 infection.

Cell and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to transcriptional and serum profiling of COVID-19 patients, consistently revealed a unique and inappropriate inflammatory response.

However, there are no reports of changes in the microbial diversity of fecal microbiome after treatment with FMT in canine IBD cases. Moreover, little is known about the long-term efficacy and safety of FMT treatment for dogs. Herein, we present a case of canine intractable IBD treated with repeated, long-term FMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The patient was a 10-year-old, neutered, male, 4-kg Toy Poodle with a prolonged history of vomiting and diarrhea. Fecal examination for pathogens was negative. Despite treatment with multiple antibacterial and antidiarrheal agents, the patient showed no improvement. Endoscopic mucus sampling diagnosed a case of lymphocytic-plasmacytic duodenitis, ie, idiopathic IBD. Eventually, we performed periodic, long-term fecal microbiota transplantation of fresh donor feces collected from a 4-year-old, 32.8-kg, neutered male Golden Retriever by rectal enema. Additionally, we performed 16S rRNA sequence analysis, before and after FMT, to evaluate the microbiome diversity. RESULTS: Fecal microbiome diversity after FMT resembled that of the healthy donor dog’s fecal microbiome, before FMT, which led us to conclude that the fecal microbiome in our patient normalized with FMT. Moreover, the clinical symptoms improved remarkably with regard to the changes in the fecal microbiome. Additionally, we noted no observable side effects during FMT treatment. CONCLUSION: This report indicates the efficacy and safety of long-term, periodic FMT for a case of canine IBD based on attenuation of clinical symptoms and changes in fecal microbiome diversity. Therefore, FMT could be chosen as a treatment option for IBD in canines in the future.","Niina, Ayaka; Kibe, Ryoko; Suzuki, Ryohei; Yuchi, Yunosuke; Teshima, Takahiro; Matsumoto, Hirotaka; Kataoka, Yasushi; Koyama, Hidekazu",Vet Med (Auckl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31819862/; https://doi.org/10.2147/vmrr.s230862,434

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic healthcare systems have at times restricted in-person visits to those deemed urgent. Professional societies provided some guidance to clinicians regarding ways in which traditional cervical cancer screening might be modified, but many gaps remained. To address these gaps, leaders of screening programs at an academic medical center and an urban safety net hospital in California formed a rapid-action committee to provide guidance to its practitioners. Patients were divided into 6 categories corresponding to various stages in the screening process and ranked by risk of underlying high-grade cervical precancer and cancer. Tiers corresponding to the intensity of the local pandemic were constructed, and clinical delays were lengthened for the lowest-risk patients as tiers escalated. The final product was a management grid designed to escalate and de-escalate with changes in the local epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effort resulted in substantial delays in clinical screening services as mandated by the healthcare systems, the population effects of delaying on both cervical cancer outcomes as well as the beneficial effects related to decreasing transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 have yet to be elucidated.","Sawaya, George F.; Holt, Hunter K.; Lamar, Robyn; Perron-Burdick, Misa; Smith-McCune, Karen",Prev Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743521001535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34217411/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106569; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091743521001535,434

The said study is carried out by the consideration of a fractional-order epidemic model describing the dynamics of COVID-19 under a non-singular kernel type of derivative. The concerned model examine via non-singular fractional-order derivative known as Atangana-Baleanu derivative in Caputo sense (ABC). The problem analyzes for qualitative analysis and determines at least one solution by applying the approach of fixed point theory. The uniqueness of the solution is derived by the Banach contraction theorem. For iterative solution, the technique of iterative fractional-order Adams–Bashforth scheme is applied. Numerical simulation for the proposed scheme is performed at various fractional-order lying between 0, 1 and for integer-order 1. We also compare the compartmental quantities of the said model at two different effective contact rates of [Formula: see text]. All the compartments show convergence and stability with growing time. The simulation of the iterative techniques is also compared with the Laplace Adomian decomposition method (LADM).

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID‐19 patients between June and August 2020 were included. Two‐dimensional echocardiography and biventricular global longitudinal strain measurement were performed. The outcome measure was defined as mortality, ICU admission, and need for intubation. Appropriate statistical tests were used to compare different groups. RESULTS: In this study 207 patients (88 females) were enrolled. During 64 ± 4 days of follow‐up, 22 (10.6%) patients died. Mortality, ICU admission, and intubation were significantly associated with LVGLS and RVGLS tertiles. LVGLS tertiles could predict poor outcome with significant odds ratios in the total population (OR = 0.203, 95% CI: 0.088–0.465; OR = 0.350, 95% CI: 0.210–0.585; OR = 0.354, 95% CI: 0.170–0.736 for mortality, ICU admission, and intubation). Although odds ratios of LVGLS for the prediction of outcome were statistically significant among hypertensive patients, these odds ratios did not reach significance among non‐hypertensive patients. RVGLS tertiles revealed significant odds ratios for the prediction of mortality (OR = 0.322, 95% CI: 0.162–0.640), ICU admission (OR = 0.287, 95% CI: 0.166–0.495), and need for intubation (OR = 0.360, 95% CI: 0.174–0.744). Odds ratios of RVGLS remained significant even after adjusting for hypertension when considering mortality and ICU admission. CONCLUSION: RVGLS and LVGLS can be acceptable prognostic factors to predict mortality, ICU admission, and intubation in hospitalized COVID‐19 patients. However, RVGLS seems more reliable, as it is not confounded by hypertension.","Khani, Mohammad; Tavana, Sasan; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Naseri Kivi, Zahra; Khaheshi, Isa",Clin Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355809/; https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.23708,434
630423,The role of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a narrative review,2021-04-08,"BACKGROUND: The urgent need for telemedicine has become clear in the COVID-19 pandemic. To facilitate telemedicine, the development and improvement of remote examination systems are required. A system combining an electronic stethoscope and Bluetooth connectivity is a promising option for remote auscultation in clinics and hospitals. However, the utility of such systems remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the utility of real-time auscultation using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope compared to that of classical auscultation, using lung and cardiology patient simulators. METHODS: This was an open-label, randomized controlled trial including senior residents and faculty in the department of general internal medicine of a university hospital. The only exclusion criterion was a refusal to participate. This study consisted of 2 parts: lung auscultation and cardiac auscultation. Each part contained a tutorial session and a test session. All participants attended a tutorial session, in which they listened to 15 sounds on the simulator using a classic stethoscope and were told the correct classification. Thereafter, participants were randomly assigned to either the real-time remote auscultation group (intervention group) or the classical auscultation group (control group) for test sessions. In the test sessions, participants had to classify a series of 10 lung sounds and 10 cardiac sounds, depending on the study part. The intervention group listened to the sounds remotely using the electronic stethoscope, a Bluetooth transmitter, and a wireless, noise-canceling, stereo headset. The control group listened to the sounds directly using a traditional stethoscope. The primary outcome was the test score, and the secondary outcomes were the rates of correct answers for each sound. RESULTS: In total, 20 participants were included. There were no differences in age, sex, and years from graduation between the 2 groups in each part. The overall test score of lung auscultation in the intervention group (80/110, 72.7%) was not different from that in the control group (71/90, 78.9%; P=.32). The only lung sound for which the correct answer rate differed between groups was that of pleural friction rubs (P=.03); it was lower in the intervention group (3/11, 27%) than in the control group (7/9, 78%). The overall test score for cardiac auscultation in the intervention group (50/60, 83.3%) was not different from that in the control group (119/140, 85.0%; P=.77). There was no cardiac sound for which the correct answer rate differed between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of a real-time remote auscultation system using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope was comparable to that of direct auscultation using a classic stethoscope, except for classification of pleural friction rubs. This means that most of the real world’s essential cardiopulmonary sounds could be classified by a real-time remote auscultation system using a Bluetooth-connected electronic stethoscope.

We have developed an ultra-portable, self-contained, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection, based on the principle of loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP assay is 100% sensitive and specific to detect a minimum of 300 RNA copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2. All of the required sample transportation, lysing and amplification steps are performed in a standalone disposable cartridge, which is controlled by a battery operated, pocket size (6x9x4cm(3)) unit. The test is easy to operate and does not require skilled personnel. The total time from sample to answer is approximately 35 min; a colorimetric readout indicates positive or negative results. This portable diagnostic platform has significant potential for rapid and effective testing in community settings.

In May 2020, all SECT members were invited to complete a 40-item, multiple choice questionnaire by e-mail. The response rate was 19.0%. Surgical activity decreased by 95.7%, with 41.5% of centers performing surgery only in oncologic cases and 11.7% only in emergencies. More than half (56%) of multidisciplinary tumour board meetings (56%) were cancelled or conducted online. Standard protocols for early-stage disease were modified in 62.9% of centers. The results of this survey show that the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited thoracic oncology surgery activity. Here we describe and discuss the impact of the pandemic on thoracic surgery in Spain. ABSTRACT: After the first wave of COVID-19, the Spanish Society of Thoracic Surgeons (SECT) surveyed its members to assess the impact of the pandemic on thoracic oncology surgery in Spain. In May 2020, all SECT members were invited to complete an online, 40-item, multiple choice questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed by the SECT Scientific Committee and sent via email. The overall response rate was 19.2%. The respondents answered at least 91.5% of the items, with only one exception (a question about residents). Most respondents (89.3%) worked in public hospitals. The reported impact of the pandemic on routine clinical activity was considered extreme or severe by 75.5% of respondents (25.5% and 50%, respectively). Multidisciplinary tumour boards were held either with fewer members attending or through electronic platforms (44.6% and 35.9%, respectively). Surgical activity decreased by 95.7%, with 41.5% of centers performing surgery only on oncological patients and 11.7% only in emergencies. Nearly 60% of respondents reported modifying standard protocols for early-stage cancer and in the preoperative workup. Most centers (≈80%) reported using full personal protective equipment when operating on COVID-19 positive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic severely affected thoracic oncology surgery in Spain. The lack of common protocols led to a variable care delivery to lung cancer patients.","Martínez-Hernández, Néstor J.; Caballero Silva, Usue; Cabañero Sánchez, Alberto; Campo-Cañaveral de la Cruz, José Luis; Obeso Carillo, Andrés; Jarabo Sarceda, José Ramón; Sevilla López, Sebastián; Cilleruelo Ramos, Ángel; Recuero Díaz, José Luis; Call, Sergi; Couñago, Felipe; Hernando Trancho, Florentino",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13122897; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34207878/,434

However, no previous study has explored the activity of Peperomia sui against influenza virus infections. This study was carried out to evaluate the anti-influenza virus activity and the potential virucidal effect of the ethanolic extract of Peperomia sui (PSE). METHODS: The anti-H6N1 avian influenza viral activity of PSE against the influenza virus A/Chicken/TW/0518/2011 (H6N1) in chicken fibroblast DF-1 cells was evaluated by cell viability assay, hemagglutination assay, neuraminidase activity assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay and quantitative RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: PSE significantly increased the viability of cells that were infected by the H6N1 virus. PSE also suppressed the synthesis of viral nucleoprotein (NP), and inhibited the growth of the virus in DF-1 cells. Further, PSE inhibited the neuraminidase activity of H6N1 virus.

632719,Anatomy of the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Epidemiologists View Point,2020-09-10,"Background Coagulopathy and inflammation are hallmarks of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are associated with increased mortality. Clinical and experimental data have revealed a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 disease. The mechanisms that drive thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Methods We performed proteomic analysis and immunostaining of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients and patients with other lung pathologies. We further compared coagulation factor XII (FXII) and DNase activities in plasma samples from COVID-19 patients and healthy control donors and determined NET-induced Factor XIII (FXII) activation using a chromogenic substrate assay. Findings FXII expression and activity were increased in the lung parenchyma, within the pulmonary vasculature and in fibrin-rich alveolar spaces of postmortem lung tissues from COVID-19 patients. In agreement with this, plasma FXII activation (FXIIa) was increased in samples from COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, FXIIa colocalized with NETs in COVID-19 lung tissue indicating that NETs accumulation leads to FXII contact activation in COVID-19. We further showed that an accumulation of NETs is partially due to impaired NET clearance by extracellular DNases as DNase substitution improved NET dissolution and reduced FXII activation in vitro. Interpretation Collectively, our study supports that the NETs/FXII axis contributes to the pathogenic chain of procoagulant and proinflammatory responses in COVID-19. Targeting both, NETs and FXIIa, could provide a strategy to mitigate COVID-19-induced thrombo-inflammation. Funding This study was supported by the European Union (840189), the Werner Otto Medical Foundation Hamburg (8/95) and the German Research Foundation (FR4239/1-1, A11/SFB877, B08/SFB841 and P06/KFO306).","Englert, Hanna; Rangaswamy, Chandini; Deppermann, Carsten; Sperhake, Jan-Peter; Krisp, Christoph; Schreier, Danny; Gordon, Emma; Konrath, Sandra; Haddad, Munif; Pula, Giordano; Mailer, Reiner K.; Schlüter, Hartmut; Kluge, Stefan; Langer, Florian; Püschel, Klaus; Panousis, Kosta; Stavrou, Evi X.; Maas, Coen; Renné, Thomas; Frye, Maike",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.29.424644,434
632992,Emotional Well-being During the First Four Months of COVID-19 in the United States,2020-10-23,"Several enveloped viruses, including herpesviruses attach to host cells by initially interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans followed by specific coreceptor engagement which culminates in virus-host membrane fusion and virus entry. Interfering with HS-herpesvirus interactions has long been known to result in significant reduction in virus infectivity indicating that HS play important roles in initiating virus entry. In this study, we provide a series of evidence to prove that specific sulfations as well as the degree of polymerization (dp) of HS govern human cytomegalovirus (CMV) binding and infection. First, purified CMV extracellular virions preferentially bind to sulfated longer chain HS on a glycoarray compared to a variety of unsulfated glycosaminoglycans including unsulfated shorter chain HS. Second, the fraction of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) displaying higher dp and sulfation has a larger impact on CMV titers compared to other fractions. Third, cell lines deficient in specific glucosaminyl sulfotransferases produce significantly reduced CMV titers compared to wild-type cells and virus entry is compromised in these mutant cells. Finally, purified glycoprotein B shows strong binding to heparin, and desulfated heparin analogs compete poorly with heparin for gB binding. Taken together, these results highlight the significance of HS chain length and sulfation patterns in CMV attachment and infectivity.","Mitra, Dipanwita; Hasan, Mohammad H.; Bates, John T.; Bierdeman, Michael A.; Ederer, Dallas R.; Parmar, Rinkuben C.; Fassero, Lauren A.; Liang, Quntao; Qiu, Hong; Tiwari, Vaibhav; Zhang, Fuming; Linhardt, Robert J.; Sharp, Joshua S.; Wang, Lianchun; Tandon, Ritesh",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352038/,434

Indeed, according to the first Biomedicine Agency recommendations, ART centers suspended their activities in March 2020 during the first wave of Covid-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 direct and indirect effects on gametes, fertility, pregnancy and neonatal health is still debated. The aim of this review is to assess the available data on this subject, to inform patients in care and adapt daily practice. Most recent studies are based on the effects of the infectious syndrome, on hormonal factors as well as on the expression of viral entry proteins (ACE2 and TMPRSS2) in cells involved in gametogenesis, to assess the impact of COVID -19. So far, no effect on female gametes was highlighted. More studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Mother to children transmission couldn’t be proven, yet neonatal infection remains possible. However, men are more susceptible to be infected by SARS-CoV-2, to be symptomatic, and spermatogenesis is likely to be affected.

Emerging evidences have shown the utility of saliva, although conflicting results have been reported regarding viral loads between NPS and saliva. We conducted a study to compare the viral loads in 42 patients with COVID-19. Both NPS and saliva specimens were simultaneously obtained at a median of 6 days (range, 1-12) after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 34 (81%) using NPS (median Ct value [IQR]=27.4 [21.3, 35.6]) and 38 (90%) using saliva (median Ct value [IQR]= 28.9 [23.1, 33.6]). There was no significance difference between them (Wilcoxon signed rank test: P=0.79) and Kendall's W was 0.82, showing a high degree of agreement, indicating equivalent viral loads in NPS and saliva. After symptom onset, the Ct values of both NPS and saliva continued to increase over time, with no substantial difference. Self-collected saliva has a detection sensitivity comparable to that of NPS and is a useful diagnostic tool with mitigating uncomfortable process and the risk of aerosol transmission to healthcare workers.","Yokota, I.; Hattori, T.; Shane, P.

633859,Correlation between academic self-efficacy and burnout originating from distance learning among nursing students in Indonesia during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic,2021-05-11,"BACKGROUND: The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been in use for 99 years, and is regarded as one of the oldest human vaccines known today. It is recommended primarily due to its effect in preventing the most severe forms of tuberculosis, including disseminated tuberculosis and meningeal tuberculosis in children; however, its efficacy in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis and TB reactivation in adults has been questioned. Several studies however have found that asides from its role in tuberculosis prevention, the BCG vaccine also has protective effects against a host of other viral infections in humans, an effect which has been termed: heterologous, non-specific or off-target. OBJECTIVES: As we approach 100 years since the discovery of the BCG vaccine, we review the evidence of the non-specific protection offered by the vaccine against viral infections, discuss the possible mechanisms of action of these effects, highlight the implications these effects could have on vaccinology and summarize the recent epidemiological correlation between the vaccine and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Several epidemiological studies have established that BCG does reduce all-cause mortality in infants, and also the time of vaccination influences this effect significantly. This effect has been attributed to the protective effect of the vaccine in preventing unrelated viral infections during the neonatal period. Some of such viral infections that have been investigated include: herpes simplex virus (HSV), human Papilloma virus (HPV), yellow fever virus (YFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus type A (H1N1). These effects are thought to be mediated via induction of innate immune memory as well as heterologous lymphocytic activation. While epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation, the potential protection of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates is currently unclear. Ongoing clinical trials and further research may shed more light on the subject in the future. CONCLUSION: BCG is a multifaceted vaccine, with many numerous potential applications to vaccination strategies being employed for current and future viral infections. There however is a need for further studies into the immunologic mechanisms behind these non-specific effects, for these potentials to become reality, as we usher in the beginning of the second century since the vaccine's discovery.","Adesanya, Oluwafolajimi A.; Uche-Orji, Christabel I.; Adedeji, Yeshua A.; Joshua, John I.; Adesola, Adeniyi A.; Chukwudike, Chibuike J.",AIMS Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659771/; https://doi.org/10.3934/microbiol.2021007,434

RNA viruses pose an interesting case study given their mutation rates are orders of magnitude higher than any other pathogen – as reflected by the recent emergence of SARS and Influenza for example. Here, we show how feature selection techniques can be used to reliably classify viral sequences by host species, and to identify the crucial minority of host-specific sites in pathogen genomic data.

We illustrate the power of these methods by: 1) identifying the sites explaining SARS coronavirus differences between human, bat and palm civet samples; 2) showing how cross species jumps of rabies virus among bat populations can be readily identified; and 3) de novo identification of likely functional influenza host discriminant markers.","Aguas, Ricardo; Ferguson, Neil M.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24130470/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003254,434

634864,Individuals’ conceptions of COVID-19 pandemic through metaphor analysis,2021-03-23,"Pneumonia-induced lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome can develop because of an inappropriate inflammatory response to acute infections, leading to a compromised alveolar barrier. Recent work suggests that hospitalized patients with allergies/asthma are less likely to die of pulmonary infections and that there is a correlation between survival from acute respiratory distress syndrome and higher eosinophil counts; thus, we hypothesized that eosinophils associated with a type 2 immune response may protect against pneumonia-induced acute lung injury. To test this hypothesis, mice were treated with the type 2–initiating cytokine IL-33 intratracheally 3 days before induction of pneumonia with airway administration of a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Interestingly, IL-33 pretreatment promoted survival by inhibiting acute lung injury: amount of BAL fluid proinflammatory cytokines and pulmonary edema were both reduced, with an associated increase in oxygen saturation. Pulmonary neutrophilia was also reduced, whereas eosinophilia was strongly increased. This eosinophilia was key to protection; eosinophil reduction eliminated both IL-33–mediated protection against mortality and inhibition of neutrophilia and pulmonary edema. Together, these data reveal a novel role for eosinophils in protection against lung injury and suggest that modulation of pulmonary type 2 immunity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy.","Krishack, Paulette A.; Hollinger, Maile K.; Kuzel, Timothy G.; Decker, Trevor S.; Louviere, Tyler J.; Hrusch, Cara L.; Sperling, Anne I.; Verhoef, Philip A.",Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2020-0166oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33571420/,434

To evaluate the particular impact on neurological services a rapid review was conducted. METHODS: Studies reporting the provision of neurological services during the pandemic and/or adopted mitigation strategies were included in this review. PubMed and World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVID-19 database were searched. Data extraction followed categories used by WHO COVID-19 pulse surveys and operational guidelines on maintaining essential health services during COVID-19. FINDINGS: The search yielded 1101 articles, of which 369 fulfilled eligibility criteria, describing data from 210,419 participants, being adults (81%), children (11.4%) or both (7.3%). Included articles reported data from 105 countries and territories covering all WHO regions and World Bank income levels (low income: 1.9%, lower middle: 24.7%, upper middle: 29.5% and high income; 44.8%). Cross-sectoral services for neurological disorders were most frequently disrupted (62.9%), followed by emergency/acute care (47.1%). The degree of disruption was at least moderate for 75% of studies. Travel restrictions due to lockdowns (81.7%) and regulatory closure of services (65.4%) were the most commonly reported causes of disruption. Authors most frequently described telemedicine (82.1%) and novel dispensing approaches for medicines (51.8%) as mitigation strategies. Evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is largely missing. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of neurological care. Given the worldwide prevalence of neurological disorders and the potential long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19, service disruptions are devastating. Different strategies such as telemedicine might mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic, but their efficacy and acceptability remain to be seen.

Pneumonia remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst South African children. More comprehensive immunisation regimens, strengthening of HIV programmes, improvement in socioeconomic conditions and new preventive strategies have impacted on the epidemiology of pneumonia. Furthermore, sensitive diagnostic tests and better sampling methods in young children improve aetiological diagnosis. Objective. To produce revised guidelines for pneumonia in South African children under 5 years of age. Methods. The Paediatric Assembly of the South African Thoracic Society and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases established seven expert subgroups to revise existing South African guidelines focusing on: (i) epidemiology; (ii) aetiology; (iii) diagnosis; (iv) antibiotic management and supportive therapy; (v) management in intensive care; (vi) prevention; and (vii) considerations in HIV-infected or HIVexposed, uninfected (HEU) children. Each subgroup reviewed the published evidence in their area; in the absence of evidence, expert opinion was accepted. Evidence was graded using the British Thoracic Society (BTS) grading system. Sections were synthesized into an overall guideline which underwent peer review and revision. Recommendations. Recommendations include a diagnostic approach, investigations, management and preventive strategies. Specific recommendations for HIV infected and HEU children are provided. Validation. The guideline is based on available published evidence supplemented by the consensus opinion of SA paediatric experts. Recommendations are consistent with those in published international guidelines.","Zar, H; Moore, D P; Andronikou, S; Argent, A C; Avenant, T; Cohen, C; Green, R J; Itzikowitz, G; Jeena, P; Masekela, R; Nicol, M P; Pillay, A; Reubenson, G; Madhi, S A",African journal of thoracic and critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.7196/ajtccm.2020.v26i3.104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471872/,434

RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab samples is the reference method for the diagnosis and screening of Sars-CoV-2 infection, but the tests developed are highly variable in terms of sensitivity and turnaround time. Antigenic tests generally have lower sensitivity but have the advantage of simpler and faster implementation. In front of Covid-19 symptoms with negative RT-PCR results, serology can be recommended with IgM and IgG assays. Serology is also a relevant tool for epidemiological studies. However, it is important to remember that the level of anti-Sars-Cov-2 antibodies decreases over time and can therefore impact the results of sero-epidemiological studies. Despite the need to respond rapidly to an urgent diagnostic need, it remains essential to validate the methods chosen on a well-characterized panel of samples, as the performance of certain tests is sometimes unsatisfactory to ensure a reliable diagnosis.","Hantz, Sébastien",Rev Francoph Lab,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163104/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1773035X20303130; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1773035X20303130; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1773-035x(20)30313-0,434

During the rise of the COVID-19 epidemic, we tested a comprehensive structural equation model of risk perception to explain adherence to protective behaviors in a crisis context using a survey of 572 Italian citizens. We identified two categories of protective behaviors, labeled promoting hygiene and cleaning, and avoiding social closeness. Social norms and risk perceptions were the more proximal antecedents of both categories. Cultural worldviews, affect, and experience of COVID-19 were the more distal predictors. Promoting hygiene and cleaning was triggered by the negative affective attitude toward coronavirus and mediated by an affective appraisal of risk. The deliberate dimension of risk perception (perceived likelihood) predicted only avoiding social closeness. Social norms predicted both types of behaviors and mediated the relations of cultural worldviews. Individualism (vs. communitarianism), more than hierarchy (vs. egalitarianism), shaped the affective evaluation of coronavirus. The model was an acceptable fit to the data and accounted for 20% and 29% of the variance in promoting hygiene and cleaning, and avoiding social closeness, respectively. The findings were robust to the effect of sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, socioeconomic status, and zone of the country). Taken together, our findings confirmed the empirical distinction between affective and deliberate processes in risk perception, supported the validity of the affect heuristic, and highlighted the role of social norms as an account for why individualistic people were less likely to follow the prescribed health-protective behaviors. Implications for risk communication are discussed.","Savadori, Lucia; Lauriola, Marco",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.577331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519593/,434

Methods: The data regarding orthodontic queries were investigated in a real-time surveillance using Google Trends. Search terms “braces”, “invisalign”, “get braces”, “get braces off”, “braces pain” and the phrase “social distancing” were analyzed regarding the year preceding the pandemic outbreak and the time of the pandemic. Moreover, the five-year trend for queries “braces” vs. “invisalign”, as an example of different types of orthodontic appliances, was compared. Results: There was a significant decrease in orthodontics phrase queries in the spring of 2020, connected with the worldwide restrictions and lockdowns announced all over the world. There was a lower interest in the “braces pain” query during the first lockdown in 2020. The number of searches for “invisalign” increased steadily over time, while the number of searches for “braces” was relatively stable across the investigated time period. Conclusions: The course of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the orthodontic-related search queries.

However, there have been few simple clinical risk scores available for prompt risk stratification. The objective is to develop a simple risk score for predicting severe COVID-19 disease using territory-wide data based on simple clinical and laboratory variables. Consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong’s public hospitals between 1 January and 22 August 2020 and diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by RT-PCR, were included. The primary outcome was composite intensive care unit admission, need for intubation or death with follow-up until 8 September 2020. An external independent cohort from Wuhan was used for model validation. COVID-19 testing was performed in 237,493 patients and 4442 patients (median age 44.8 years old, 95% confidence interval (CI): [28.9, 60.8]); 50% males) were tested positive. Of these, 209 patients (4.8%) met the primary outcome. A risk score including the following components was derived from Cox regression: gender, age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, dementia, liver diseases, gastrointestinal bleeding, cancer, increases in neutrophil count, potassium, urea, creatinine, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, bilirubin, D-dimer, high sensitive troponin-I, lactate dehydrogenase, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, and C-reactive protein, as well as decreases in lymphocyte count, platelet, hematocrit, albumin, sodium, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, glucose, and base excess. The model based on test results taken on the day of admission demonstrated an excellent predictive value. Incorporation of test results on successive time points did not further improve risk prediction. The derived score system was evaluated with out-of-sample five-cross-validation (AUC: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82–0.91) and external validation (N = 202, AUC: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.85–0.93).

Dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCB) are the most popular class of antihypertensive drugs used in clinical settings and can be metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). Voriconazole is a commonly used antifungal treatment and a CYP3A4-inhibitor. Insufficient attention to drug interactions from the concomitant use of CCB and voriconazole may result in serious adverse reactions. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a patient with acute kidney injury on stable anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis who developed hyperkalemia resulting in sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm attributed to drug interactions of CCB with voriconazole. This is a very rarely reported case and may be an under-recognized complication. After continuous renal replacement therapy and changing the anti-hypertensive drugs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities of the patient fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: This case warns us of severe consequences of drug interactions.

In spite of this, investigations of the molecular pathogenesis for many HCPs have been limited to gross pathological changes in animal models or global analysis of gene expression. Further, questions remain regarding the ability of animal models of disease to recapitulate human molecular pathogenesis or act as predictors of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, it is likely that medical countermeasure development for HCPs will rely on identifying therapeutic targets that are uniquely modulated during HCP infection. It is also appreciated that many cellular processes can be regulated independently of changes in transcription or translation through phosphorylation events. Cellular kinases, individually or collectively (the kinome), play critical roles in regulating complex biology, underlie various malignancies, and represent high-priority drug targets. The growing interest in kinases in both basic and translational research has driven efforts to develop technologies that enable characterization of phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction. To this end, enhanced technical capabilities at the IRF-Frederick provide the unique capability for characterizing host responses to HCP insult during the course of infection and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","Kindrachuk, Jason; Falcinelli, Shane; Wada, Jiro; Kuhn, Jens H.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Jahrling, Peter B.",Pathogens and Disease,https://doi.org/10.1111/2049-632x.12163; https://academic.oup.com/femspd/article-pdf/71/2/190/17943182/71-2-190.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24585711/,434

During this time, even if physical health is theoretically unaffected, keeping calm and sane can be challenging. The aim of this research was to evaluate whether exposure to COVID‐19 information available in the digital space has a different impact on the mental condition of Romanian medical staff, compared with the general population, particularly searching for depression and anxiety symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted from April 6 to 16, 2020 within the Romanian users of Social Media platforms. The questionnaire assessed depression with the WHO‐Five Well‐Being Index, anxiety with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale and Social Media exposure by asking how often the respondents saw COVID‐19 related information on the most popular Social Media channels in Romania. Information about: gender, age, educational level, occupation, area of living and risk category was also collected. The risk categories were defined as no risk, medium risk and medical staff. RESULTS: Almost 90% of the 402 participants received daily through at least one Social Media channel information related to the COVID‐19 outbreak. Social Media Exposure significantly associated with the risk group only for Facebook and LinkedIn. However, exposure to information regarding COVID‐19 was neither associated with anxiety nor depression. No significant association was identified neither between age class and self‐assessed anxiety nor self‐assessed depression. The self‐assessment of depression was significantly more frequent as compared with the self‐assessment of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The results of this research are opposite to most of the already published literature. Depression and anxiety could not be correlated with the context of lockdown and excessive COVID‐19‐related information.","Cordoș, Ariana‐Anamaria; Bolboacă, Sorana D.",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33314469/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13933,434

METHODS: We searched Pubmed, from January to April 2020, for the following search terms: “COVID-19”, “children”, “SARS-COV2”, “complications”, “epidemiology”, “clinical features”, focusing our attention mostly on epidemiology and symptoms of COVID-19 in children. RESULTS: Usually, infants and children present milder symptoms of the disease with a better outcome than adults. Consequently, children may be considered an infection reservoir that may play a role as spreader of the infection in community.

639937,Brazilian dental students and COVID-19: a survey on knowledge and perceptions,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge, attitudes, perception, and preventative practices regarding coronavirus- 2019 (COVID-19) are crucial in its prevention and control. Several studies have noted that the majority of people in sub-Saharan African are noncompliant with proposed health and safety measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective country health departments. In most sub-Saharan African countries, noncompliance is attributable to ignorance and misinformation, thereby raising questions about people’s knowledge, attitudes, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 in these settings. This situation is particularly of concern for governments and public health experts. Thus, this scoping review is aimed at mapping evidence on the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and preventive practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: Systematic searches of relevant articles were performed using databases such as the EBSCOhost, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, the WHO library and grey literature. Arksey and O’Malley’s framework guided the study. The risk of bias for included primary studies was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). NVIVO version 10 was used to analyse the data and a thematic content analysis was used to present the review’s narrative account. RESULTS: A total of 3037 eligible studies were identified after the database search. Only 28 studies met the inclusion criteria after full article screening and were included for data extraction. Studies included populations from the following SSA countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Sierra Leone. All the included studies showed evidence of knowledge related to COVID-19. Eleven studies showed that participants had a positive attitude towards COVID-19, and fifteen studies showed that participants had good practices towards COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had adequate knowledge related to COVID-19. Despite adequate knowledge, the attitude was not always positive, thereby necessitating further education to convey the importance of forming a positive attitude and continuous preventive practice towards reducing contraction and transmission of COVID‐19.","Nwagbara, Ugochinyere Ijeoma; Osual, Emmanuella Chinonso; Chireshe, Rumbidzai; Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi; Saeed, Balsam Qubais; Khuzwayo, Nelisiwe; Hlongwana, Khumbulani W.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33872330/,434

Patient monitoring helps identify symptoms associated with diseases or disease-driven disorders, which makes it an essential element of medical diagnoses, clinical interventions, and rehabilitation treatments for severe medical conditions. This monitoring can be expensive and time-consuming and provide an incomplete picture of the state of the patient. In the last decade, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of mobile and wearable devices, along with the introduction of smart textile solutions that offer the possibility of continuous monitoring. These alternatives fuel a technology shift in healthcare, one that involves the continuous tracking and monitoring of individuals. This scoping review examines how mobile, wearable, and textile sensing technology have been permeating healthcare by offering alternate solutions to challenging issues, such as personalised prescriptions or home-based secondary prevention. To do so, we have selected 222 healthcare literature articles published from 2007 to 2019 and reviewed them following the PRISMA process under the schema of a scoping review framework. Overall, our findings show a recent increase in research on mobile sensing technology to address patient monitoring, reflected by 128 articles published in journals and 19 articles in conference proceedings between 2014 and 2019, which represents 57.65% and 8.55% respectively of all included articles.","Hernandez, N.; Castro, L.; Medina-Quero, J.; Favela, J.; Michan, L.; Mortenson, W.

Initially, mostly laboratory developed molecular tests were available but shortly thereafter different commercial assays started to appear and are still increasing in number. Although independent performance evaluations are ongoing, available data is still scarce. Here we provide a direct comparison of key performance characteristics of 13 commercial RT-PCR assays. Thirteen RT-PCR assays were selected based on the criteria that they can be used following generic RNA extraction protocols, on common PCR platforms and availability. Using a 10-fold and 2-fold dilution series of a quantified SARS-CoV-2 cell-cultured virus stock, performance was assessed compared to our in house validated assay. Specificity was tested by using RNA extracted from cultured common human coronaviruses. All RT-PCR kits included in this study exhibited PCR efficiencies > 90%, except for the Sentinel Diagnostics B E-gene RUO assay (80%). Analytical sensitivity varied between 3.3 RNA copies to 330 RNA copies. Only one assay cross reacted with another human coronavirus (MERS).

647253,Reconstructing and forecasting the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States using a 5-parameter logistic growth model,2020-05-15,"Bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) is a crucial causative agent of respiratory disease in young and adult cattle. No specific therapies are available for BPIV3 infection. Understanding the internalization pathway of the virus will provide a new strategy for the development of antiviral therapy. Here, the mechanism of BPIV3 entry into HeLa cells was analyzed using RNA silencing and pharmacological inhibitors. Treatment of HeLa cells with hypertonic medium prevented BPIV3 internalization. These results indicated that BPIV3 entered HeLa cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, removing cell membrane cholesterol through MβCD treatment hampered viral penetration but not viral replication. In addition, BPIV3 infection was inhibited by pretreatment with dynasore or chlorpromazine (CPZ) or knockdown of dynamin II or clathrin heavy chain. However, virus entry was unaffected by nystatin, EIPA, wortmannin, or cytochalasin D treatment or caveolin-1 knockdown. These data demonstrated that the entry of BPIV3 into HeLa cells was dependent on clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not on caveolae-mediated endocytosis or the macropinocytosis pathway. Many viruses are transported to endosomes, which provide an acidic environment and release their genome upon separation from primary endocytic vesicles. However, we found that BPIV3 infection required endosomal cathepsins, but not a low pH. In summary, we show, for the first time, that BPIV3 enters HeLa cells through the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, presenting novel insights into the invasion mechanism of Paramyxoviridae.","Pan, Wei; Nie, Hui; Wang, Hongmei; He, Hongbin",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13061035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34072688/,434
648980,"Perceived social support, loneliness, and hope during the COVID‐19 Pandemic: Testing a mediating model in the UK, USA, and Israel",2021-02-23,"SARS-CoV-2 infection is a new threat to global public health in the 21(st) century (2020), which has now rapidly spread around the globe causing severe pneumonia often linked to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and hyperinflammatory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious through saliva droplets. The structural analysis suggests that the virus enters human cells through the ligation of the spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE(2)). The progression of Covid-19 has been divided into three main stages: stage I—viral response, stage II—pulmonary phase, and stage III—hyperinflammation phase. Once the patients enter stage III, it will likely need ventilation and it becomes difficult to manage. Thus, it will be of paramount importance to find therapies to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease toward stage III. The key event leading to hyperinflammation seems to be the activation of Th-17 immunity response and Cytokine storm. B(2)-adrenergic receptors (B(2)ARs) are expressed on airways and on all the immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B and T lymphocytes. Blocking (B(2)AR) has been proven, also in clinical settings, to reduce Th-17 response and negatively modulate inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 while increasing IFNγ. Non-selective beta-blockers are currently used to treat several diseases and have been proven to reduce stress-induced inflammation and reduce anxiety. For these reasons, we speculate that targeting B(2)AR in the early phase of Covid-19 might be beneficial to prevent hyperinflammation.","Barbieri, Antonio; Robinson, Nirmal; Palma, Giuseppe; Maurea, Nicola; Desiderio, Vincenzo; Botti, Gerardo",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.588724; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33117402/,434

However, the humoral factors that contribute to efficacy are poorly understood. This study functionally and phenotypically profiled plasma from eligible convalescent donors. In addition to viral neutralization, convalescent plasma contained antibodies capable of mediating such Fc-dependent functions as complement activation, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against SARS-CoV-2. These activities expand the antiviral functions associated with convalescent plasma and together with neutralization efficacy, could be accurately and robustly from antibody phenotypes. These results suggest that high-throughput profiling could be used to screen donors and plasma may provide benefits beyond neutralization.","Natarajan, Harini; Crowley, Andrew R.; Butler, Savannah E.; Xu, Shiwei; Weiner, Joshua A.; Bloch, Evan M.; Littlefield, Kirsten; Wieland-Alter, Wendy; Connor, Ruth I.; Wright, Peter F.; Benner, Sarah E.; Bonny, Tania S.; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C.; Larman, H.

Although susceptible to confounding, the test-negative case-control study design is the most efficient method to assess VE post-licensure. Control of confounding is often needed during the analyses, which is most efficiently done through multivariable modeling. When a large number of potential confounders are being considered, it can be challenging to know which variables need to be included in the final model. This paper highlights the importance of considering model uncertainty by re-analyzing a Lyme VE study using several confounder selection methods. We propose an intuitive Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) framework for this task and compare the performance of BMA to that of traditional single-best-model-selection methods. We demonstrate how BMA can be advantageous in situations when there is uncertainty about model selection by systematically considering alternative models and increasing transparency.","Oliveira, C.

Recognizing the significance of community participation in overcoming the EVD outbreak, strengthening community systems emerged as one of the most important strategies for bridging the gap in accessing primary health care (PHC) services. This study reviewed the community health policy development process in order to draw lessons from the health system strengthening efforts in Liberia post-EVD crisis. METHODS: A government-led health system analysis approach was applied to assess, review and revise the community health program in Liberia. The mixed method approach combines the use of an adapted tool to assess bottlenecks and solutions during workshops, a qualitative survey (key informant interviews and focus group discussions) to assess perceptions of challenges and perspectives from different stakeholders, and an inter-agency framework – a benchmarks matrix – to jointly review program implementation gaps using the evidence compiled, and identify priorities to scale up of the community program. RESULTS: Stakeholders identified key health system challenges and proposed policy and programmatic shifts to institutionalize a standardized community health program with fit for purpose and incentivized community health assistants to provide PHC services to the targeted populations. The community health program in Liberia is currently at the phase of implementation and requires strengthened leadership, local capacities, and resources for sustainability. Lessons learned from this review included the importance of: establishing a coordination mechanism and leveraging partnership support; using a systems approach to better inform policy shifts; strengthening community engagement; and conducting evidence-based planning to inform policy-makers. CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes toward the existing body of knowledge about policy development processes and reforms on community health in Liberia, and most likely other African settings with weak health systems. Community-based systems will play an even bigger role as we move toward building resilience for future shocks and strengthening PHC, which will require that communities be viewed as actors in the health system rather than just clients of health services.","Simen-Kapeu, Aline; Lewycka, Sonia; Ibe, Ochiawunma; Yeakpalah, Anthony; Horace, Jannie M; Ehounou, Geneviève; Boima, Tamba; Wesseh, Chea Sanford",Journal of global health,https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.11.07002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763217/,434

However, traditional Chinese medicine equipment is relatively deficient, with insufficient functions and low degree of digitalization. For example, existing auscultation equipment can obtain few human characteristic indicators, which is difficult to meet the needs of reference in traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis. Based on this, this paper designed a human body characteristic index detection system based on the principle of traditional Chinese medicine, which includes respiratory and heartbeat signal acquisition device, meridian and acupoint signal acquisition device, temperature signal acquisition device, pulse and blood pressure acquisition device, processing module, keyword module, and output module. The respiratory and heartbeat signal acquisition device is used to collect the respiratory and heartbeat signal of human body. Meridian acupoint signal acquisition device is used to collect human meridian acupoint radio signals. The temperature signal acquisition device is used to collect the infrared temperature light wave signal of human body. Pulse and blood pressure acquisition devices are used to collect pulse and blood pressure signals. The processing module is used to obtain one or more human body characteristic indicators according to one or more of the respiration and heartbeat signals, meridians and acupoints signals, temperature signals, pulse, and blood pressure, including Qi and blood characteristic indicators, viscera and six meridian characteristic indicators, and temperature characteristic indicators.

METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from July 10 to July 20, 2020, involving 1,415 Bangladeshi residents ages 18 years or older. Data was collected via an anonymous online questionnaire. The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised was used to assess suicide risk. The depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses and Pearson's correlation were performed to examine the association of variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of suicide ideation and planning among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively. Having suicidal risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 33.5% participants. Suicide risk was associated higher with females, divorced or widowed marital statuses and low educational attainment (i.e., secondary or below and higher secondary/diploma). Additionally, living in high COVID-19 prevalent areas, having economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, relatives or acquaintances die from COVID-19, direct contact with COVID-19 patient(s), and fear of COVID-19 infection were associated with suicide risk.

We undertook a systematic ‘review of reviews’ to investigate the effects of interventions for this population on substance use, housing, and related outcomes, as well as on treatment engagement, retention and successful completion. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched ten electronic databases from inception to October 2020 for reviews and syntheses, conducted a grey literature search, and hand searched reference lists of included studies. We selected reviews that synthesised evidence on any type of treatment or intervention that reported substance use outcomes for people who reported being homeless. We appraised the quality of included reviews using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses and the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles. Our search identified 843 citations, and 25 reviews met the inclusion criteria. Regarding substance use outcomes, there was evidence that harm reduction approaches lead to decreases in drug-related risk behaviour and fatal overdoses, and reduce mortality, morbidity, and substance use. Case management interventions were significantly better than treatment as usual in reducing substance use among people who are homeless. The evidence indicates that Housing First does not lead to significant changes in substance use. Evidence regarding housing and other outcomes is mixed. CONCLUSIONS: People who are homeless and use drugs experience many barriers to accessing healthcare and treatment. Evidence regarding interventions designed specifically for this population is limited, but harm reduction and case management approaches can lead to improvements in substance use outcomes, whilst some housing interventions improve housing outcomes and may provide more stability. More research is needed regarding optimal treatment length as well as qualitative insights from people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.","Miler, Joanna Astrid; Carver, Hannah; Masterton, Wendy; Parkes, Tessa; Maden, Michelle; Jones, Lisa; Sumnall, Harry",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260656/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254729,434

Here, we performed a bioinformatic analysis of published and purported SARS-CoV-2 antivirals including imatinib mesylate that we found to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication on Vero E6 cells and that, according to the published literature on other coronaviruses is likely to act on-target, as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We identified a cluster of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals with characteristics of lysosomotropic agents, meaning that they are lipophilic weak bases capable of penetrating into cells. These agents include cepharentine, chloroquine, chlorpromazine, clemastine, cloperastine, emetine, hydroxychloroquine, haloperidol, ML240, PB28, ponatinib, siramesine, and zotatifin (eFT226) all of which are likely to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by non-specific (off-target) effects, meaning that they probably do not act on their ‘official’ pharmacological targets, but rather interfere with viral replication through non-specific effects on acidophilic organelles including autophagosomes, endosomes, and lysosomes. Imatinib mesylate did not fall into this cluster. In conclusion, we propose a tentative classification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals into specific (on-target) versus non-specific (off-target) agents based on their physicochemical characteristics.","Sauvat, Allan; Ciccosanti, Fabiola; Colavita, Francesca; Di Rienzo, Martina; Castilletti, Concetta; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Kepp, Oliver; Zitvogel, Laurence; Fimia, Gian Maria; Piacentini, Mauro; Kroemer, Guido",Cell Death Dis,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-02842-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814759/,434

The aim of this study was to detect and characterize infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) from clinical outbreaks and surveillance samples. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect IBV in pooled lung and tracheal tissue samples (n = 78), oropharyngeal swabs (n = 19), and pooled fecal samples (n = 13) from live-bird markets. Both respiratory and nephropathogenic forms of IB were suspected at necropsy (n = 7) from clinical outbreaks. Sequencing of hypervariable regions (HVR1-2 and HVR3) of the region of the spike gene (S) encoding the S1 subunit of five isolates revealed circulation of the Mass-like, QX-like, and 4/91-like genotypes of IBV in Bangladesh. Each genotype was extremely variable, as shown by separate clustering of the viruses in a phylogenetic tree and high nucleotide (nt) sequence divergence (38.8–41.2% and 25.7–37.4% in the HVR1-2 and HVR3 sequence, respectively). The unique mutation G65E was observed in each Mass-like isolate, and Y328S was observed in each 4/91-like Bangladeshi isolate. Three neutralizing epitope sites were predicted within the HVRs that differed significantly among the three genotypes. In addition, one Bangladeshi isolate carried fixed mutations at 294F and 306Y, like other pathogenic QX-like IBVs, which could affect epitopes involved in neutralization, facilitating virus circulation among vaccinated flocks. Therefore, continuous screening and genotype characterization will be necessary to track the epidemiology of IBV and control IB infection in Bangladesh.

Two specific risk factors are most prominent, old age and the presence of co-morbidity. Recent studies have shown that patients with compromised renal function, especially those treated with renal replacement therapy or having received a kidney transplant are at a much higher risk for severe COVID infection and increased mortality. This may be in part due to the increased prevalence of co-morbid conditions in these patients but specific alterations in their immune system, reflecting premature immunological aging, may be equally important. In this review the different aspects, in particular thymus function and memory T cell expansion, of uremia-associated immunological aging are reviewed with respect to COVID 19 infection. In essence, the decreased generation of naïve T cells may be instrumental in suboptimal anti-viral immune responses while the relatively uncontrolled expansion of effector T cells may facilitate the feared phase of the COVID-19 infection with excessive and live-threatening inflammation of the lung parenchyma.","Betjes, Michiel G.

The classical signs and symptoms of infections are often not present in this patient population, which makes the diagnosis more challenging. Host factors play a major role in the development and prognosis of infections in cancer patients; these can be related to the underlying type of malignancy (solid organ versus hematological), tumor burden, anatomic obstruction, altered integrity of barriers (skin or mucosa), treatment-related factors (from chemotherapy, radiation treatment, surgery, interventional procedures, and/or medical device placement) and the degree of immunosuppression.

When the hosts are humans, emerging viruses can present major public health issues, as exemplified by the AIDS pandemic. Therefore, heuristic approaches to identify nascent diseases before they become pandemic would be valuable. Unfortunately, the current patient-based and epidemiological approaches are ill-suited in this regard because they are largely responsive and not predictive. Alternative approaches based on virus evolutionary ecology might have greater potential to predict virus emergence. However, given the difficulties encountered when studying metazoan viruses in this context, the development of new model systems is greatly desirable. Here, I highlight studies that show that bacteriophages are appropriate model organisms for virus emergence research because of the ease in which important population parameters can be manipulated. Ideally this research will permit identifying major factors determining the persistence or extinction of emerging viruses. If such viruses could be recognized in advance, patient-based and epidemiological strategies could be better mobilized to deal with them.","Dennehy, John J.",Trends Microbiol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X09001619; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2009.07.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19765997/,434

COVID-19 pandemic and government-imposed lockdown as a preventive measure might increase psychological symptoms in caregivers. We performed a study to measure the change of psychological symptoms during quarantine/self-isolation for COVID-19 in a sample of Italian caregivers of pwD, and to investigate if the resilience is associated with psychological changes in the sample. METHODS: Eighty-four caregivers of pwD completed an online survey including questionnaires assessing depressive symptomatology and anxiety before and during the lockdown, caregiver burden and levels of resilience. RESULTS: The MANOVA revealed an effect of time (before and during the lockdown) in the whole group on depression scores; a significant interaction between time and resilience was found on anxiety scores, revealing that caregivers with high resilience showed a more significant increase of anxiety levels during lockdown than caregivers with low resilience. Moreover, the regression analysis revealed that caregiver burden was associated negatively with resilience scores, and positively with higher functional dependence. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown produced psychological consequences in caregivers of pwD, with an increase of levels of depression. Moreover, high resilience had a negative effect on anxiety levels and no effect on depressive symptomatology during the lockdown; moreover, it was associated with lower levels of caregiver burden. All caregivers, even those with high resilience levels, should be addressed to psychological interventions to reduce levels of depression, anxiety and caregiver burden.","Altieri, Manuela; Santangelo, Gabriella",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.10.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153872/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1064748120305297; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1064748120305297?v=s5,434

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous cross‐sectional online survey was conducted between June 17 and July 13, 2020, addressed to families of people with DS. RESULTS: A total of 116 responses were collected, from families of children (n = 86; 74%) and adults (30; 26%) with DS. The majority (106; 91%) were shielded at the family home during lockdown. Symptoms compatible with COVID‐19 were reported in 22 (19%) individuals. Only four individuals with symptoms had a PCR swab test, none of which was positive. Only one symptomatic person had antibody testing (but not swab testing), which was positive. One person had repeatedly positive swab tests whilst in hospital for renal failure, but had no typical symptoms of COVID‐19. In 50% of people with DS who developed possible or probable COVID‐19 symptoms, seizure worsening was reported, in terms of increased seizure frequency or duration or both. Medical attention was required in 9/22 (41%), all of whom were children. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of people with DS, we observed an infection rate, determined by compatible symptoms, of 19%, with no deaths and benign outcome in most cases despite the underlying complex epilepsy although children often required medical attention.

Inpatient access to dermatologists is limited, illustrating an opportunity to utilize teledermatology. Little is known about the ability of dermatologists to accurately diagnose and manage inpatients using teledermatology, particularly utilizing non-dermatologist generated clinical data. Methods This prospective study assessed the ability of teledermatology to diagnose and manage 41 dermatology consults from a large urban tertiary care center utilizing internal medicine referral documentation and photos. Twenty-seven dermatology hospitalists were surveyed. Interrater agreement was assessed by the kappa statistic. Results There was substantial agreement between in-person and teledermatology assessment of the diagnosis with differential diagnosis (median kappa = 0.83), substantial agreement in laboratory work-up decisions (median kappa = 0.67), almost perfect agreement in imaging decisions (median kappa = 1.0), and moderate agreement in biopsy decisions (median kappa = 0.43). There was almost perfect agreement in treatment (median kappa = 1.0), but no agreement in follow-up planning (median kappa = 0.0). There was no association between raw photo quality and the primary plus differential diagnosis or primary diagnosis alone. Limitations Selection bias and single-center nature. Conclusions Teledermatology may be effective in the inpatient setting, with concordant diagnosis, evaluation, and management decisions.","Gabel, Colleen K.; Nguyen, Emily; Karmouta, Ryan; Liu, Kristina Jing; Zhou, Guohai; Alloo, Allireza; Arakaki, Ryan; Balagula, Yevgeniy; Bridges, Alina G.; Cowen, Edward W.; Davis, Mark Denis P.; Femia, Alisa; Harp, Joanna; Kaffenberger, Benjamin; Keller, Jesse J.; Kwong, Bernice Y.; Markova, Alina; Mauskar, Melissa; Micheletti, Robert; Mostaghimi, Arash; Pierson, Joseph; Rosenbach, Misha; Schwager, Zachary; Seminario-Vidal, Lucia; Sharon, Victoria R.; Song, Philip I.; Strowd, Lindsay C.; Walls, Andrew C.; Wanat, Karolyn A.; Wetter, David A.; Worswick, Scott; Ziemer, Carolyn; Kvedar, Joseph; Mikailov, Anar; Kroshinsky, Daniela",J Am Acad Dermatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0190962220308318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32389716/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962220308318?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2020.04.171,434

However, the impact of vitamin D on the severity and outcome of COVID-19 is still not fully known. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of serum vitamin D concentration on the extent of lung involvement and final outcome in patients with COVID-19. METHOD: Seventy-three subjects with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were investigated in this study. The patients had been admitted to our academic hospital from February 28, 2020 to April 19, 2020. Demographic and clinical data, serum 25(OH)D levels, and findings of initial chest computed tomography were recorded. Linear and binary logistic regression, cox regression and ROC curve tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 55.18 Å} 14.98 years old; 46.4% were male. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration was significantly lower in the deceased (13.83 Å} 12.53 ng/ mL compared with discharged patients (38.41 Å} 18.51 ng/mL) (P < 0.001). Higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with significantly less extent of total lung involvement (β = − 0.10, P = 0.004). In addition, vitamin D deficiency [25(OH) D < 25 ng/mL] was associated with a significant increase in the risk of mortality (hazard ratio = 4.15, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that serum vitamin D status might provide useful information regarding the clinical course, extent of lung involvement and outcome of patients with COVID-19. However, further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.","Abrishami, Alireza; Dalili, Nooshin",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab092.0095,434

However, the role of TMPRSS2 in prostatic adenocarcinoma (PRAD) remains largely unclear. To better explore its function in PRAD, we examined the expression level of TMPRSS2 in the GEO, tumor immune assessment resource (TIMER), as well as Oncomine databases and studied the association between TMPRSS2 and overall survival (OS) rates in the UALCAN and gene expression profiling interactive analysis (GEPIA) databases. In addition, we studied the correlation of the level of immune infiltration and markers of immune cell type in the TIMER database, analyzed the prognosis based on the expression level of TMPRSS2 in the related immune cell subsets, and determined the methylation profile of TMPRSS2 promoter by UALCAN database. Subsequently, we conducted a survival analysis and gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis in the TISID database and detected the expression of TMPRSS2 in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. We also studied the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of TMPRSS2 in the GENEMANIA database. Additionally, we used the microarray GSE56677 and GSE52920 to illustrate changes in TMPRSS2 expression in vivo and in vitro after severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-COV) infection, finding that expression of TMPRSS2 decreased after SARS-COV infection in vitro. The function of TMPRSS2 in the dataset was further verified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In conclusion, the expression of TMPRSS2 is significantly increased in PRAD, elevated TMPRSS2 is associated with immune infiltration, and prognosis is positively correlated. In addition, tumor tissue from COVID-19 patients with PRAD may be more susceptible to infection with SARS-COV-2, which may render the prognosis gets worse.","Luo, Lianxiang; Zheng, Yushi; Li, Mingyue; Lin, Xinjie; Li, Xiaodi; Li, Xiaoling; Cui, Liao; Luo, Hui",Front Genet,https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.575770; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193689/,434

COVID-19 spread swiftly around the world over with an alert of an emergency for an adequate drug. Therefore, in this research, we repurposed the FDA-approved medicines to find the prominent drug used to cure the COVID infected patients. We performed homology modeling of the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), responsible for the viral entry. The prediction of the transmembrane region and the Conserved Domain in TMPRSS2 protein was made for docking. 4182 FDA-approved compounds from the ZINC database were downloaded and used for the calculation of physicochemical properties. Two thousand eight hundred fifteen screened compounds were used for molecular docking against the modelled protein structure. From which top hit compounds based on binding energy were extracted. At 1(st) site pose, ZINC3830554 showed the highest binding energy -12.91kcal/mol by forming Salt Bridge at LYS143, Hydrogen bond at ALA8, VAL45, HIS47, SER142, ASN277, ASN359, and TRP363. The hydrophobic Interactions at PHE3, LEU4, ALA7, ALA8, ALA139, PRO197, and PHE266. In the 2(nd) site pose, ZINC203686879 shows the highest binding energy (-12.56 kcal/mol) and forms a hydrophobic interaction with VAL187, VAL189, HIS205, LYS301, GLN347, TRP370 and hydrogen bond was at GLY300, THR302, GLN347, SER350 residues. These hit compounds were subjected to stability checks between the protein-ligand complex through the dynamics simulation (MD), and binding free energy was calculated through the Molecular Mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) method. We hope that hit compounds would be an efficient inhibitor that can block the TMPRSS2 activity and resist the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into targeted human cells by reducing the virus's infectivity and transmissibility.","Barge, Sagar; Jade, Dhananjay; Gosavi, Gokul; Talukdar, Narayan Chandra; Borah, Jagat",Eur J Pharm Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0928098721001226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775827/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejps.2021.105820; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928098721001226?v=s5,434

As COVID-19 containment measures were relaxed, the first non-COVID respiratory viruses to return to prepandemic levels were members of the rhinovirus/enterovirus, followed by the rapid return of seasonal coronaviruses, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus after the complete removal of COVID-19 precautions at the state level, including an end to mask mandates. Inasmuch as COVID-19 has dominated the landscape of respiratory infections since early 2020, it is important for clinicians to recognize the return of non-COVID respiratory pathogens may be rapid and significant when COVID-19 containment measures are removed.","Hodjat, P.; Christensen, P.; Subedi, S.; Olsen, R.

As obligate intracellular pathogens, viruses exploit and manipulate different host cell processes, including cellular trafficking, metabolism and immunity-related functions, for their own survival. In this article, we review evidence for how autophagy, a highly conserved cellular degradative pathway, serves either as an antiviral defense mechanism or, alternatively, as a pro-viral process during virus infection. Furthermore, we highlight recent reports concerning the role of selective autophagy in virus infection and how viruses manipulate autophagy to evade lysosomal capture and degradation.","Chiramel, Abhilash I.; Brady, Nathan R.; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells2010083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24709646/,434

662484,Malnutrition and Food Insecurity Might Pose a Double Burden for Older Adults,2020-08-11,"BACKGROUND: The majority of postmenopausal breast cancer (PMBC) survivors do not adhere to lifestyle recommendations and have excess body weight. In this group, this is associated with poorer health-related quality of life and an increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, second primary cancers, cancer recurrences, and mortality. Gaining and maintaining a healthy lifestyle and body composition is therefore important. It is unknown when and how sustained adherence to these recommendations can be promoted optimally in PMBC survivors. Therefore, the OPTIMUM study aims to identify the optimal timing and method for promoting sustained adherence to lifestyle and body weight recommendations in PMBC survivors. METHODS: The OPTIMUM-study has a mixed-methods design. To assess optimal timing, a longitudinal observational study will be conducted among approximately 1000 PMBC survivors. The primary outcomes are adherence to lifestyle and body weight recommendations, readiness for change, and need for support. Questionnaires will be administered at 4–6 months after cancer diagnosis (wave 1: during treatment and retrospectively before diagnosis), 1 year after diagnosis (wave 2: after completion of initial treatment), and 1.5 years after diagnosis (wave 3: during follow-up). Wave 2 and 3 include blood sampling, and either wearing an accelerometer for 7 days or completing a 3-day online food diary (randomly assigned at hospital level). To assess the optimal method, behavioural determinants of the primary outcomes will be matched with Behavior Change Techniques using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy. Qualitative research methods will be used to explore perceptions, needs and preferences of PMBC survivors (semi-structured interviews, focus groups) and health care providers (Delphi study). Topics include perceptions on optimal timing to promote adherence; facilitators and motivators of, and barriers towards (sustained) adherence to recommendations; and acceptability of the selected methods. DISCUSSION: The OPTIMUM study aims to gain scientific knowledge on when and how to promote sustained adherence to lifestyle and body weight recommendations among PBMC survivors. This knowledge can be incorporated into guidelines for tailored promotion in clinical practice to improve health outcomes.","van Cappellen-van Maldegem, Sandra J.

The angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE1), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), angiotensinogen (AGT) and receptors angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1) are key factors for SARS-CoV-2 entering in the cells, sodium and water retention with an increase blood pressure, promotion of fibrotic and inflammatory phenomena resulting in a cytokine storm. METHODS: In this pilot study, the frequencies of six polymorphisms in the ACE1, ACE2, AGT and AGTR1 genes were analysed in symptomatic patients affected by COVID-19 and compared with the results obtained from asymptomatic subjects. RESULTS: Thus, we have identified that rs2074192 (ACE2), rs1799752 (ACE1) and rs699 (AGT) SNPs could potentially be a valuable tool for predicting the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. A genetic predisposition may be prospected for severe internal organ damages and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 disease, as observed in symptomatic vs asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that analysis of RAAS polymorphisms could be considered the key point in understanding and predicting the SARS-CoV-2 course infection.","Cafiero, Concetta; Rosapepe, Felice; Palmirotta, Raffaele; Re, Agnese; Ottaiano, Maria Pia; Benincasa, Giulio; Perone, Romina; Varriale, Elisa; D’Amato, Gerardo; Cacciamani, Andrea; Micera, Alessandra; Pisconti, Salvatore",Pharmgenomics Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079337/; https://doi.org/10.2147/pgpm.s303666,434

Their long-term impact is difficult to assess because there are few relevant prospective studies. The risk of infection is influenced in part by the structure of the day-care center, and it is more important in the early months of attending and linked to later recurrent infectious episodes. Causal links between viral infection and asthma are complex. Viral infections increase the risk of asthma exacerbation but the presence of asthma also increases the risk of severe responses to a viral infection. While infections acquired in this environment are mainly viral, their recurrence can lead to excessive use of antibiotics which promote antimicrobial resistance with an impact on the digestive or respiratory microbiota.","Brouard, J.; Vabret, A.; Dina, J.; Lemercier, H.",Rev Fr Allergol (2009),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.reval.2014.01.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288889/,434

In pathological conditions, HSP60 can be translocated from the mitochondria and excreted from the cell. In turn, the extracellular HSP60 has a strong ability to trigger and enhance inflammatory response with marked proinflammatory cytokine induction, which is mainly mediated by Toll-like receptor binding. Previous studies have found increased circulating levels of HSP60 in hypertensive patients, as well as enhanced HSP60 expression and membrane translocation in the hypertrophic myocardium. These observations are of particular interest, since they could provide a possible pathophysiological explanation of the severe course and worse outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in hypertensive patients, repeatedly reported during the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related to hyperinflammatory response and cytokine storm development during the third phase of the disease. In this regard, pharmacological inhibition of HSP60 could attract attention to potentially ameliorate inappropriate inflammatory reaction in severe COVID-19 patients. Among HSP60 antagonizing drugs, mizoribine is the most intriguing, since it is clinically approved and exerts antiviral activity.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hospitals around the nation are enacting systems to limit CPR in caring for COVID+ patients for a variety of legitimate reasons and based on concepts of medical futility and allocation of scarce resources. No ethical framework, however, has been proposed as a standard to guide care in this crucial matter. METHODS: Our analysis begins with definitions of ethically relevant terms. We then cycle an illustrative clinical vignette through the mathematically permissible possibilities to account for all conceivable scenarios. Scenarios with ethical tension are examined. RESULTS: Patients have the negative right to refuse care including CPR, but they do not have the positive right to demand it. Our detailed ethical analysis and recommendations support CPR if and only if 1) CPR is judged medically beneficial, and in line with the patient's and values and goals, 2) allocations or scarce resources follow a just and transparent triage system, and 3) providers are protected from contracting the disease. CONCLUSIONS: CPR is an intervention like any other, with attendant risks and benefits and with responsibility for the utilization of limited resources. Our ethical analysis advocates for a systematic approach to codes that respects the important ethical considerations in caring for the critically ill and facilitates patient-centered, evidence-based, and fair treatment to all.","Kopar, Piroska K.; Brown, Douglas E.; Turnbull, Isaiah R.",Ann Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074890/; https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004318,434

International Health Regulations (IHR) aim to prevent, detect and respond to such threats, through increase in national public health core capacities, but whether IHR core capacity implementation is necessary and sufficient has been contested. With a longitudinal study we relate changes in national IHR core capacities to changes in cross‐border infectious disease threat events (IDTE) between 2010 and 2016, collected through epidemic intelligence at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). By combining all IHR core capacities into one composite measure we found that a 10% increase in the mean of this composite IHR core capacity to be associated with a 19% decrease (p = 0.017) in the incidence of cross‐border IDTE in the EU. With respect to specific IHR core capacities, an individual increase in national legislation, policy & financing; coordination and communication with relevant sectors; surveillance; response; preparedness; risk communication; human resource capacity; or laboratory capacity was associated with a significant decrease in cross‐border IDTE incidence. In contrast, our analysis showed that IHR core capacities relating to point‐of‐entry, zoonotic events or food safety were not associated with IDTE in the EU. Due to high internal correlations between core capacities, we conducted a principal component analysis which confirmed a 20% decrease in risk of IDTE for every 10% increase in the core capacity score (95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Globally (EU excluded), a 10% increase in the mean of all IHR core capacities combined was associated with a 14% decrease (p = 0.077) in cross‐border IDTE incidence. We provide quantitative evidence that improvements in IHR core capacities at country‐level are associated with fewer cross‐border IDTE in the EU, which may also hold true for other parts of the world.","Semenza, Jan C.; Sewe, Maquines Odhiambo; Lindgren, Elisabet; Brusin, Sergio; Aaslav, Kaja Kaasik; Mollet, Thomas; Rocklöv, Joacim",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022321/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13211,434

To date, there is limited knowledge on the composition of the T and B cell immune receptor repertoires [T cell receptors (TCRs) and B cell receptors (BCRs)] and transcriptomes in convalescent COVID-19 patients of different age groups. Here, we utilize single-cell sequencing (scSeq) of lymphocyte immune repertoires and transcriptomes to quantitatively profile the adaptive immune response in COVID-19 patients of varying age. We discovered highly expanded T and B cells in multiple patients, with the most expanded clonotypes coming from the effector CD8+ T cell population. Highly expanded CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clones show elevated markers of cytotoxicity (CD8: PRF1, GZMH, GNLY; CD4: GZMA), whereas clonally expanded B cells show markers of transition into the plasma cell state and activation across patients. By comparing young and old convalescent COVID-19 patients (mean ages = 31 and 66.8 years, respectively), we found that clonally expanded B cells in young patients were predominantly of the IgA isotype and their BCRs had incurred higher levels of somatic hypermutation than elderly patients.

This study conducted a two-step scoping review to map and describe the effect of restaurant menu labeling policies on menu reformulation. First, we identified national, state, and municipal menu labeling policies in countries from global databases. Second, we searched four databases (i.e., PubMed, CINHAL/EBSCO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) for peer-reviewed studies and gray-literature sources in English and Spanish (2000–2020). Step 1 identified three voluntary and eight mandatory menu labeling policies primarily for energy disclosures for 11 upper-middle and high-income countries, but none for low- or middle-income countries. Step 2 identified 15 of 577 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The analysis showed reductions in energy for newly introduced menu items only in the United States.

669934,Influence of nutritional status on eating habits and food choice determinants among Brazilian women during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Despite the many benefits of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in the treatment of degenerative arthritis, infection of the total knee prosthesis presents a dangerous post-operative complication affecting 0.5-1.9% of all cases. Infection after the first three post-operative weeks is treated with either one or two-stage revision operations involving the removal of all prosthetic components. Two-stage revision operations are more commonly used and involve the removal of prosthetic components followed by the implantation of a cement mold infused with antibiotics (antibiotic spacer) as well as systemic antibiotic treatment for four to six weeks before prosthetic reimplantation. This case report details a TKA revision in a patient with osteoarthritis of the knee. The patient presented with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and white blood cell count nearly two years after the primary operation and was found to have an infected total knee prosthetic. A two-stage revision was planned but due to scheduling disruption by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the second stage of the operation was delayed until 12 months after the stage one operation. The patient ambulated without pain on an antibiotic spacer for 12 months, providing information about the long-term use of spacers. This case also offers a look at a potential benefit to one-stage operations, which have been shown in the literature to have similar outcomes as two-stage operations. The patient had a medical history of psoriasis and immunosuppressive treatment with methotrexate, two risk factors for prosthetic joint infection, and may have benefited from prophylactic antibiotic therapy extending beyond the perioperative period. The goal of this case report is to detail the prolonged use of an antibiotic spacer, examine the risks and benefits of one and two-stage total knee revisions, and discuss prophylactic antibiotic use in high-risk patients following TKA.","Welsh, Clayton R; Baumann, Patricia A",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104596/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14854,434

With the public health effort to flatten the curve, many clinics have moved to virtual care for select populations of patients while triaging and postponing others. As genetic services are asked to gradually resume, a roadmap is needed to ensure clinical care decisions for at-risk patients are transparent and equitable, that postponed care is resumed and that patients with or waiting for a genetic diagnosis are not disproportionately affected or abandoned. The purpose of this document is to highlight the guiding ethical principles and stakeholder considerations in resuming genetic services to help guide the competing needs going forward of both limiting exposures while maintaining high-quality care. Considerations highlighted are (1) environment of practice, (2) nature of consult, (3) patient factors, (4) provider factors, and (5) laboratory factors. The intended users are those providing genetic care in a Canadian context with the recognition that there are clinic-specific and regional variations that will influence decision-making. While specific to the Canadian context, the ethical principles used to guide these decisions would be relevant for consideration in other jurisdictions.","Chad, Lauren; Dawson, Angelika J; Goh, Elaine Suk-Ying",J Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199447/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107394,434

It is compared with the corresponding historic all-cause mortality per year depending on age and sex observed in these countries. Some common features exist although substantial differences in age and sex dependency of COVID-19 mortality were noted between countries. An exponential increase with age is a good model to describe and analyze both COVID-19 and all-cause mortality above 40 years old, where almost all COVID-19 deaths occur. Moreover, age dependency is stronger for COVID-19 mortality than for all-cause mortality, and males have an excess risk compared with women, which is less pronounced in the higher age groups. Additionally, concerning calendar time, differences in the age and sex dependency between countries were noted with the common tendency that male excess risk for COVID-19 mortality was smaller in the second half of the year.","Bauer, Peter; Brugger, Jonas; König, Franz; Posch, Martin",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580322/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97711-8,434

Current treatment of COVID-19 patients relies mainly on antiviral drugs lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and remdesivir, the anti-malarial drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, and traditional Chinese medicine. There are over 2118 on-going clinical trials underway, but to date none of these drugs have consistently proven effective. Cathepsin L (CatL) is an endosomal cysteine protease. It mediates the cleavage of the S1 subunit of the coronavirus surface spike glycoprotein. This cleavage is necessary for coronavirus entry into human host cells, virus and host cell endosome membrane fusion, and viral RNA release for next round of replication. Here we summarize data regarding seven CatL-selective inhibitors that block coronavirus entry into cultured host cells and provide a mechanism to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Given the rapid growth of the SARS-CoV-2-positive population worldwide, ready-to-use CatL inhibitors should be explored as a treatment option. We identify ten US FDA-approved drugs that have CatL inhibitory activity. We provide evidence that supports the combined use of serine protease and CatL inhibitors as a possibly safer and more effective therapy than other available therapeutics to block coronavirus host cell entry and intracellular replication, without compromising the immune system.","Liu, Tianxiao; Luo, Songyuan; Libby, Peter; Shi, Guo-Ping",Pharmacol Ther,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725820301157?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32470470/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0163725820301157,434

The FIMA questionnaire assesses the use of medical and non-medical services by the elderly. The authors compared the demand for these services during the ongoing pandemic with similar months in 2017. It was confirmed that in the group of 61 surveyed elderly people, the number of individuals who had a medical visit decreased significantly in the three-month period. In the analyzed pandemic period, patients had significantly fewer visits to their general practitioner only. The pandemic had no significant impact on the use of other medical and non-medical services analyzed by FIMA. The limitations may include the small number of respondents, the relatively short period from the beginning of the pandemic covered by the survey, and the nature of the studied patients’ diseases. Further observation of elderly patients’ access to the abovementioned services can improve the efforts of governments and caregivers in this field, which is of particular importance in the group of chronically ill elderly patients.","Mazurek, Justyna; Biernat, Karolina; Kuciel, Natalia; Hap, Katarzyna; Sutkowska, Edyta",Healthcare (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9010008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374828/,434

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is transmitted via air droplets. In medical environments that use traditional hermetic ventilation systems, medical personnel who come in contact with patients are more susceptible to infection compared to regular staff; therefore, the air flow and air quality of hermetic negative pressure isolation wards are highly critical. For this purpose, the study proposes a full-outer-air-intake natural air-conditioning system for negative pressure isolation wards. This innovative system draws in large amounts of fresh external air to greatly improve the air exchange rate in wards; negative pressure environments can be implemented depending on requirements to solve the issue of nosocomial infections in traditional negative pressure isolation wards that draw air from within the hospital. This greatly reduces the probability of nosocomial infection and infection via air droplets; furthermore, the system's intake and exhaust paths are completely isolated, solving the issue of air cross-contamination. Based on the results from the experiment site, this innovative system was designed and implemented based on the guidelines of hospital facilities and achieved air exchange per hour in excess of 12 times/hour, reaching a maximum of 54.5 times/hour. Indoor CO(2) concentration was 576 ppm, negative pressure was −14 Pa, indoor temperature was 23.3°C, indoor humidity was 54.1%, and sensible heat exchange efficiency (ηs) was 105.88% which effectively reduced ventilation load. Therefore, this innovative full-outer-air-intake natural air-conditioning system can provide medical staff and patients with a safe and healthy environment that prevents cross-infection.","Weng, Chien-Lun; Kau, Lih-Jen",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833861/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8872167,434

By means of the electrospinning technology we developed filter media based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers doped with AgNPs combining three main performance requirements: high air filtration efficiency to capture nanometer‐size particles, low airflow resistance essential to ensure breathability and antimicrobial activity to inactivate aerosolized microorganisms. PVA/AgNPs electrospun nanofibers were produced by electrospinning the dispersion of colloidal silver into the PVA water solution. A widespread physicochemical characterization was addressed to the Ag colloidal suspension. The key functional performances of the electrospun nanofibers were proven by water stability, antibacterial activity, and filtration efficiency and pressure drop measurements performed under conditions representative of facemasks. We assessed a total bacterial depletion associated to a filtering efficiency towards nano‐aerosolized particles of 97.7% higher than required by the EN149 standard and a pressure drop in line with FFP1 and FFP2 masks, even at the highest filtration velocity. Such results pave the way to the application of PVA/AgNPs electrospun nanofibers in facemasks as advanced filtering media for protecting against airborne microorganisms.","Blosi, Magda; Costa, Anna Luisa; Ortelli, Simona; Belosi, Franco; Ravegnani, Fabrizio; Varesano, Alessio; Tonetti, Cinzia; Zanoni, Ilaria; Vineis, Claudia",J Appl Polym Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511635/; https://doi.org/10.1002/app.51380,434

Now that the vaccine is available to priority populations, it is critical to convince those that are hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health communication about the vaccine as well as misinformation on the vaccine occurs through a variety of different information channels. Some channels of information are more commonly found to spread misinformation. Given the expansive information environment, we sought to characterize the use of different media channels for COVID-19 vaccine information and determine the relationship between information channel and vaccine acceptance. We used quota sampling of vaccine priority groups [N = 2,650] between December 13 and 23, 2020 and conducted bivariate chi-squared tests and multivariable multinomial logistic regression analyses to determine the relative impact of channels of information on vaccine acceptance. We found traditional channels of information, especially National TV, National newspapers, and local newspapers increased the likelihood of vaccine acceptance. Individuals who received information from traditional media compared to social media or both traditional and social media were most likely to accept the vaccine. The implications of this study suggest social media channels have a role to play in educating the hesitant to accept the vaccine, while traditional media channels should continue to promote data-driven and informed vaccine content to their viewers.","Piltch-Loeb, Rachael; Savoia, Elena; Goldberg, Beth; Hughes, Brian; Verhey, Tanner; Kayyem, Juliette; Miller-Idriss, Cynthia; Testa, Marcia",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0251095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979370/,434

The causes of the irreducibility vary, with interposition of soft tissues or bony fragments within the glenohumeral joint being the usual culprits. We present the case of an irreducible anterior shoulder dislocation with concomitant greater and lesser tuberosity fractures, with interposition of the subscapularis and lesser tuberosity thereby preventing reduction. We present the case of a 54-year-old female presenting with a left shoulder fracture dislocation after a fall from a 1.8-meter ladder. Patient was taken to the operating room after undergoing a CT scan. Attempts of closed reduction after administration of general anesthesia were unsuccessful. Open reduction and internal fixation with plate and screws was done through a deltopectoral approach. Intra-operatively, the lesser tuberosity and the subscapularis were found to be the cause of the irreducibility of the dislocation. At the latest follow up at 6 months post-op, the patient had regained a normal ROM with a good function. The vast majority of shoulder fracture dislocations are easily reducible, with only a limited number of case reports discussing irreducible fracture-dislocations. The causes of the irreducibility comprise interposition of soft tissue or bony fragments within the glenohumeral joint such as avulsed labrum or tendons, glenoid or humeral bony fragments interposition, and tensioning of nerves or tendons such as the biceps or subscapularis around the humeral head. CT scans are in our opinion very important for proper surgical planning when needed and for possible identification of an irreducible dislocation. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware that difficult closed reductions of the glenohumeral joint, whenever encountered, should raise the possibility of interposition of bony fragments or soft tissues where surgical treatment might be mandatory.","Ayoubi, Rami; Najm, Talal; Maalouly, Joseph; Aouad, Dany; Kanj, Vladimir; El Rassi, Georges",Trauma Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665321/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcr.2021.100429,434

The long-term psychological impact, of both the spread of the virus and the restrictive policies adopted to counteract it, remains uncertain. However, recent studies reported a high level of psychological distress and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms. The purpose of this study is to assess the psychometric properties of a new questionnaire, to evaluate PTSD risk related to the COVID-19 emergency. A total of Italian people completed a web-based cross-sectional survey broadcasted through different social-media. Demographic data and some psychological dimensions, such as general distress and sleep disturbance, were collected. A new self-report questionnaire (COVID-19-PTSD), consisting of 19 items, was developed starting from the PTSD Check List for DSM-5 (PCL-5) questionnaire, and it was administered in order to analyze its psychometric properties. The results highlighted the adequate psychometric properties of the COVID-19-PTSD questionnaire. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a seven-factor model (Intrusion, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Dysphoric arousal, Anxious arousal and Externalizing behavior) best fits the data. Significant correlations were found among COVID-19-PTSD scores, general distress and sleep disturbance. A high percentage of PTSD symptomatology (29.5%) was found in the Italian population. COVID-19-PTSD appears to be effective in evaluating the specific stress symptoms related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Italian population. These results are relevant from a clinical point of view because they suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic could be considered as a traumatic event. Psychological interventions to counteract short- and long-term psychopathological effects, consequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, appear to be necessary.","Forte, Giuseppe; Favieri, Francesca; Tambelli, Renata; Casagrande, Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32532077/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17114151,434

The hepato-biliary system and the pancreas may also be involved, usually with a mild elevation of transaminases and, rarely, pancreatitis. In contrast, a late hyper-inflammatory phenomenon, termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), is characterized by more frequent gastrointestinal manifestations with greater severity, sometimes presenting as peritonitis. Gastrointestinal and hepato-biliary manifestations are probably related to a loss in enterocyte absorption capability and microscopic mucosal damage caused by a viral infection of intestinal epithelial cells, hepatocytes and other cells through the angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 receptor resulting in immune cells activation with subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. Specific conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and liver transplantation may pose a risk for the more severe presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) but as adult data accumulate, paediatric data is still limited.

679011,The myth of masks: a tale of risk selection in the COVID‐19 pandemic,2020-05-19,"A virus that can cause a global pandemic must be highly adaptive to human conditions. Such adaptation is not likely to have emerged suddenly but, instead, may have evolved step by step with each step favored by natural selection. It is thus necessary to develop a theory about the origin in order to guide the search. Here, we propose such a model whereby evolution occurs in both the virus and the hosts (where the evolution is somatic; i.e., in the immune system). The hosts comprise three groups – the wild animal hosts, the nearby human population, and farther-away human populations. The theory suggests that the conditions under which the pandemic has initially evolved are: (i) an abundance of wild animals in the place of origin (PL(0)); (ii) a nearby human population of low density; (iii) frequent and long-term animal-human contacts to permit step-by-step evolution; and (iv) a level of herd immunity in the animal and human hosts. In this model, the evolving virus may have regularly spread out of PL(0) although such invasions often fail, leaving sporadic cases of early infections. The place of the first epidemic (PL(1)), where humans are immunologically naïve to the virus, is likely a distance away from PL(0). Finally, this current model is only a first attempt and more theoretical models can be expected to guide the search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2.","Ruan, Yongsen; Wen, Haijun; He, Xionglei; Wu, Chung-I",Sci Bull (Beijing),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2095927320307659; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095927320307659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520335/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2020.12.020,434

Previously, potent primer-dependent RdRp activity has been demonstrated for the homologous polymerase subunit (nsp12) of the distantly related coronaviruses. The only previous study focusing on the in vitro activity of nsp9 of an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus; EAV) reported weak de novo polymerase activity on homopolymeric RNA templates. However, this activity was not retained when Mn(2+) ions were omitted from the assay or when biologically relevant templates were supplied, which prompted us to revisit the biochemical properties of this polymerase.

679780,Impact of COVID-19 on routine malaria indicators in Uganda: An interrupted time series analysis,2021-08-18,"Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a life-threatening tick-borne viral infectious disease endemic to South Asia and has been taking so many lives every year in the past decade. But recently, this disease has been witnessed in other regions to a large extent and can become an epidemic very soon. In this paper, a new fog computing based e-Healthcare framework has been proposed to monitor the KFD infected patients in an early phase of infection and control the disease outbreak. For ensuring high prediction rate, a novel Extremal Optimization tuned Neural Network (EO-NN) classification algorithm has been developed using hybridization of the extremal optimization with the feed-forward neural network. Additionally, a location based alert system has also been suggested to provide the global positioning system (GPS)-based location information of each KFD infected user and the risk-prone zones as early as possible to prevent the outbreak. Furthermore, a comparative study of proposed EO-NN with state of art classification algorithms has been carried out and it can be concluded that EO-NN outperforms others with an average accuracy of 91.56%, a sensitivity of 91.53% and a specificity of 97.13% respectively in classification and accurate identification of risk-prone areas.","Majumdar, Abhishek; Debnath, Tapas; Sood, Sandeep K.; Baishnab, Krishna Lal",J Med Syst,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10916-018-1041-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30173290/,434
680005,The Effect of Extra Educational Elements on the Confidence of Undergraduate Dental Students Learning to Administer Local Anaesthesia,2021-07-01,"Transgender and gender nonbinary (TGNB) individuals often report higher levels of depression compared to cisgender individuals. Higher levels of depression in TGNB populations may be partially attributed to a lack of family support, which may be particularly salient for younger individuals. However, two possible protective factors that may mitigate depressive symptoms are self-compassion, defined as an attitude of kindness and understanding towards one’s own imperfections, and perceived support, especially from family. The present study aimed to explore whether self-compassion was negatively associated with self-reported depressive symptoms, and whether perceived family support moderated this association, especially for younger individuals. Participants who were (1) at least 18 years of age, (2) identified as TGNB, and (3) experienced gender dysphoria were eligible for this study. Cross-sectional data from 148 individuals were collected online during May 2020. In support of the hypotheses, self-compassion was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and perceived family support furthered this association. Additionally, results showed that younger participants (ages 18–24) with lower family support reported the highest levels of depressive symptoms. Taken together, these results suggest that self-compassion and perceived family support may be significant protective factors against depressive symptoms for TGNB individuals, although longitudinal research is needed. Taking a strengths-based perspective, mental health clinicians working with TGNB individuals may consider interventions geared toward increasing self-compassion in daily life and working with clients’ families to increase support.","Samrock, Steven; Kline, Kai; Randall, Ashley K.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360237/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157938,434

Social contact networks, which describe the contact relationships among individuals, always exhibit overlapping qualities of communities, hierarchical structure and spatial-correlated. We find that traditional global targeted immunization strategy would lose its superiority in controlling the epidemic propagation in the social contact networks with modular and hierarchical structure. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical targeted immunization strategy to settle this problem. In this novel strategy, importance of the hierarchical structure is considered. Transmission control experiments of influenza H1N1 are carried out based on a modular and hierarchical network model. Results obtained indicate that hierarchical structure of the network is more critical than the degrees of the immunized targets and the modular network layer is the most important for the epidemic propagation control.

The World Health Organisation has emphasized that mental health care should be considered as one of the core sectors within the overall COVID-19 health response. By March 2020, recommendations for the organization of mental health services across Europe have been developed by several national and international mental health professional associations. METHODS: The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) surveyed a large European sample of psychiatrists, namely the “EPA Ambassadors”, on their clinical experience of the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment of psychiatric patients during the month of April 2020 in order to: a) identify and report the views and experiences of European psychiatrists; and b) represent and share these results with mental health policy makers at European level. Based on the recommendations issued by national psychiatric associations and on the results of our survey, we identified important organisational aspects of mental health care during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19. RESULTS: While most of the recommendations followed the same principles, significant differences between countries emerged in service delivery, mainly relating to referrals to outpatients and for inpatient admission, assessments and treatment for people with mental disorders. Compared to previous months, the mean number of patients treated by psychiatrists in outpatient settings halved in April 2020. In the same period, the number of mentally ill patients tested for, or developing, COVID-19 was low. In most of countries, traditional face-to-face visits were replaced by online remote consultations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings we recommend: 1) to implement professional guidelines into practice and harmonize psychiatric clinical practice across Europe; 2) to monitor the treatment outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing mental disorders; 3) to keep psychiatric services active by using all available options (for example telepsychiatry); 4) to increase communication and cooperation between different health care providers.","Rojnic Kuzman, Martina; Vahip, Simavi; Fiorillo, Andrea; Beezhold, Julian; Pinto da Costa, Mariana; Skugarevsky, Oleg; Dom, Geert; Pajevic, Izet; Peles, Alma Mihaljevic; Mohr, Pavel; Kleinberg, Anne; Chkonia, Eka; Balazs, Judit; Flannery, William; Mazaliauskiene, Ramune; Chihai, Jana; Samochowiec, Jerzy; Cozman, Doina; Mihajlovic, Goran; Izakova, Lubomira; Arango, Celso; Goorwod, Philip",Eur Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103102/; https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.2215,434

Moreover, clinicians have little information to identify patients at high risk of intubation despite awake PP. We sought to assess the intubation rate among patients treated with awake PP in our Emergency Department (ED) and identify predictors of need for intubation. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted for known or suspected COVID-19 who were treated with awake PP in the ED. We excluded patients intubated in the ED. Our primary outcome was prevalence of intubation during initial hospitalization. Other outcomes were intubation within 48 h of admission and mortality. We performed classification and regression tree analysis to identify the variables most likely to predict the need for intubation. RESULTS: We included 97 patients; 44% required intubation and 21% were intubated within 48 h of admission. Respiratory oxygenation (ROX) index and P/F (partial pressure of oxygen / fraction of inspired oxygen) ratio measured 24 h after admission were the variables most likely to predict need for intubation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Among COVID-19 patients treated with awake PP in the ED prior to admission, ROX index and P/F ratio, particularly 24 h after admission, may be useful tools in identifying patients at high risk of intubation.","Downing, Jessica; Cardona, Stephanie; Alfalasi, Reem; Shadman, Shahrad; Dhahri, Amina; Paudel, Riddhi; Buchongo, Portia; Schwartz, Bradford; Tran, Quincy K.",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675721004939; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675721004939?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2021.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34175731/,434

683227,Management of skin damage of health workers’ face: the role of plastic surgery in the time of Pandemic,2021-05-12,"The events of the last year have highlighted the complexity of implementing large-scale molecular diagnostic testing for novel pathogens. The purpose of this study was to determine the chemical influences of sample collection media and storage on the stability and detection of viral nucleic acids by qRT-PCR. We studied the mechanism(s) through which viral transport media (VTM) and number of freeze-thaw cycles influenced the analytical sensitivity of qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our goal is to reinforce testing capabilities and identify weaknesses that could arise in resource-limited environments that do not have well-controlled cold chains. The sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis was studied in four VTM for synthetic single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) simulants of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The sensitivity and reproducibility of qRT-PCR for the synthetic ssRNA and dsDNA were found to be highly sensitive to VTM with the best results observed for ssRNA in HBSS and PBS-G. Surprisingly, the presence of epithelial cellular material with the ssRNA increased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR assay. Repeated freeze-thaw cycling decreased the sensitivity of the qRT-PCR with two noted exceptions. The choice of VTM is critically important to defining the sensitivity of COVID-19 molecular diagnostics assays and this study suggests they can impact upon the stability of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. This becomes increasingly important if the virus structure is destabilised before analysis, which can occur due to poor storage conditions. This study suggests that COVID-19 testing performed with glycerol-containing PBS will produce a high level of stability and sensitivity. These results are in agreement with clinical studies reported for patient-derived samples.","Holohan, Cian; Hanarahan, Sophia; Feely, Nathan; Li, Peng; O’Connell, John; Moss, Catherine; Carr, Michael; Tagit, Oya; Lee, Gil U",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.448982,434

As there is no effective vaccine yet, the development of the vaccine is urgently in progress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoinformatics methods were applied to predict epitopes from the Spike protein through mining literature associated with B- and T-cell epitopes prediction published or preprinted since the outbreak of the virus till June 1, 2020. 3D structure of the Spike protein were obtained (PDB ID: 6VSB) for prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes and localization of epitopes in the hotspot regions. RESULTS: Methods provided by the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) server were the most frequently used to predict epitopes. Sequence alignment of the epitopes extracted from literature with the Spike protein demonstrated that the epitopes in different studies converged to multiple short hotspot regions. There were three hotspot regions found in RBD of the Spike protein harboring B-cell linear epitopes (‘RQIAPGQTGKIADYNYKLPD’, ‘SYGFQPTNGVGYQ’ and ‘YAWNRKRISNCVA’) predicted to have high antigenicity score. Two T-cell epitopes (‘KPFERDISTEIYQ’ and ‘NYNYLYRLFR’) predicted to be highly antigenic in the original studies were discovered in the hotspot region. Toxicity and allergenicity analysis confirmed all the five epitopes are of non-toxin, and four of them are of non-allergen. The five epitopes identified in hotspot regions of RBD were found fully exposed based on the 3D structure of the Spike protein.

This study was conducted to investigate whether proximity to railway stations, a proxy for utilization, was associated with higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection across small-areas of Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Portugal). Methods: The number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infections from March 2 until July 5, 2020 at parish-level was obtained from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System. We used a Geographic Information System to estimate proximity to railway stations from the six railway lines operating in the area. Then, we fitted a quasi-Poisson generalized linear regression model to estimate the relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI). Results: Between May 2 and July 5, 2020, there were a total of 17,168 SARS-CoV-2 infections in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, with wide disparities between parishes. Globally, parishes near one of the railway lines (Sintra) presented significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 infection rates (RR=1.42, 95%CI 1.16, 1.75) compared to those parishes located far away from railway stations, while the opposite happened for parishes near other railway lines (Sado/Fertagus), whose infection rates were significantly lower than those observed in parishes located far away from railway stations (RR=0.66, 95%CI 0.50, 0.87). However, the associations varied according to the stage of the epidemic and according to mitigation measures in place. Regression results also revealed an increasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation on SARS-CoV-2 infections. Conclusions: We found no consistent association between proximity to railway stations and SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in the most affected metropolitan area of the country, suggesting that other factors (e.g. socioeconomic deprivation) might play a more prominent role in the epidemic dynamics.","Severo, M.; Ribeiro, A.

It is our hypothesis that through a qualitative study via national focus groups with general surgery residents, common themes emerge surrounding their personal, clinical, and educational experiences that could be used to inform practice and policy for future pandemics and disasters. DESIGN: Six 90-minute focus groups were conducted by a trained qualitative researcher who elicited responses on six predetermined topics. De-identified transcripts and audio recordings were later analyzed by two independent researchers who organized responses to each topic into themes. SETTING: Focus groups were conducted virtually and anonymously. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents were recruited from across the country. Demographic information of potential participants was coded, and subjects were randomly selected to ensure a diverse group of participants. RESULTS: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on residents’ clinical, educational, and personal experiences varied depending on the institutional response of the program and the burden of COVID-19 cases geographically. Many successes were identified: the use of telehealth and virtual didactics, an increased sense of camaraderie amongst residents, and flexibility in scheduling. Many challenges were also identified: uncertainty at work regarding personal protective equipment and scheduling, decreased case volume and educational opportunities, and emotional trauma and burnout associated with the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: These data gathered from our qualitative study highlight a clear, urgent need for thoughtful institutional planning and policies for the remainder of this and future pandemics. Residency programs must ensure a balanced training program for surgical residents as they attempt to master the skills of their craft while also serving as employed health care providers in a pandemic.

Although the structure revealed here shares similar overall structure with other published structures, there are several key differences which highlight potential features that could be exploited. The catalytic dyad His41-Cys145 undergoes dramatic conformational changes, and the structure reveals an unusual arrangement of oxyanion loop stabilized by the substrate. Binding to shikonin and binding of covalent inhibitors show different binding modes, suggesting a diversity in inhibitor binding.

685399,Helicobacter pylori infection and positive Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia in Romanian medical students,2021,"BACKGROUND: Antibody production is one of the primary mechanisms for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is speculated that massive clonal expansion of B cells, which can produce clinically meaningful neutralizing antibodies, occurs in patients who recover on the timing of acquiring adaptive immunity. METHODS: To evaluate fluctuations in clonal B cells and the size of the clones, we chronologically assessed the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire in three patients with COVID-19 who recovered around 10 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: We focused on the three dominant clonotypes (top 3) in each individual. The percentage frequencies of the top 3 clonotypes increased rapidly and accounted for 27.8 % on day 9 in patient 1, 10.4 % on day 12 in patient 2, and 10.8 % on day 11 in patient 3, respectively. The frequencies of these top 3 clonotypes rapidly decreased as the patients’ clinical symptoms improved. Furthermore, BCR network analysis revealed that accumulation of clusters composed of similar complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences were rapidly formed, grew, and reached their maximum size around 10 days after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: BCR repertoire analysis revealed that a massive surge of some unique BCRs occurs during the acquisition of adaptive immunity and recovery. The peaks were more prominent than expected. These results provide insight into the important role of BCRs in the recovery from COVID-19 and raise the possibility of developing neutralizing antibodies as COVID-19 immunotherapy.","Funakoshi, Yohei; Ohji, Goh; Yakushijin, Kimikazu; Ebisawa, Kei; Arakawa, Yu; Saegusa, Jun; Matsumoto, Hisayuki; Imanishi, Takamitsu; Fukuda, Eriko; Matsutani, Takaji; Mori, Yasuko; Iwata, Kentaro; Minami, Hironobu",Heliyon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S240584402101851X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e07748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395931/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240584402101851X?v=s5,434
685577,Behavioural responses to Covid-19 health certification: A rapid review,2021-04-09,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on routine medical care may result in altered healthcare resource use in patients with immune-mediated conditions. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of treatment interruptions in patients with and without COVID-19 infections who were treated with targeted immunomodulators (TIMs) in the USA. METHODS: Data from the IBM(®) MarketScan(®) Research Databases were analyzed in patients with immune-mediated conditions from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020. Healthcare resource use (HCRU) including hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, in-person outpatient visits, and respiratory outcomes was assessed in a cohort of patients without COVID-19 who had uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use. The impact of treatment interruption on HCRU and respiratory outcomes was also evaluated in a cohort of patients with COVID-19. Results from adjusted logistic regression were reported as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Approximately 25% of patients in both the COVID-19 (N = 787) and non-COVID-19 cohorts (N = 77,178) experienced interruptions in TIM therapy. In the non-COVID-19 cohort, the likelihood of being hospitalized was 20% less in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use (aOR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.90). Patients with uninterrupted TIM use had a similar likelihood of an ED visit (aOR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.91–1.08) and respiratory outcome (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.71–1.31) versus patients with interrupted TIM use. The likelihood of having an in-person outpatient visit was 87% greater in patients with uninterrupted versus interrupted TIM use (aOR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.81–1.94). Similar findings were observed in the COVID-19 cohort. CONCLUSION: This analysis of real-world claims data showed that uninterrupted TIM use was not associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalizations, ED visits, or negative respiratory outcomes compared to interrupted TIM use among patients with immune-mediated conditions, regardless of COVID-19 diagnosis.

Using data from the UK Biobank, we assessed whether frailty and comorbidity predict COVID-19 mortality in the overall community population (n=437,555) and in a selected COVID-19 positive sample (n=2,059). Frailty was assessed using the Rockwood Frailty Index (FI) and the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), whereas comorbidity was assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Overall, 408 individuals died of COVID-19, as ascertained from the death register data. In the full sample, HFRS (odds ratio [OR] 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-1.07) and CCI (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.08-1.20) were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, while FI was not statistically significantly different from null in the multivariable logistic regression model. Adding HFRS or CCI to a model with only age and sex resulted in significantly larger areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves. Nevertheless, when restricting the analyses to COVID-19 positive cases, which is a sample with over-representation of frail individuals, neither of the frailty measures or CCI added meaningful predictive accuracy on top of age and sex. Besides, we observed stronger associations between HFRS categories and COVID-19 mortality in relatively younger (<75 years) than older individuals ([≥]75 years). Our results suggest that HFRS and CCI, which could be readily derived from medical records, may be useful for COVID-19 mortality risk stratification in the community.","Mak, J. K.

Current efforts to mitigate this risk focus on Personal Protective Equipment, including high-efficiency filtration as well as other measures. Because the reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 shedding is in the nasopharynx and nasal and oral cavities, the application of viricidal agents to these surfaces may reduce virus burden. Numerous studies have confirmed that povidone-iodine inactivates many common respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Povidone-iodine also has good profile for mucosal tolerance. Thus, we propose a prophylactic treatment protocol for the application of topical povidone-iodine to the upper aerodigestive tract. CONCLUSION: Such an approach represents a low-cost, low-morbidity measure that may reduce the risks associated with aerosol-generating procedures performed commonly in otorhinolaryngology operating rooms.

NETosis, initially only considered a defensive/apoptotic mechanism, is now considered an extreme defensive solution, which in particular situations induces strong negative effects on tissue physiology, causing or exacerbating pathologies as recently shown in NETs-mediated organ damage in COVID-19 patients. The positive effects of NETs on wound healing have been linked to their antimicrobial activity, while the negative effects appear to be more common in a plethora of pathological conditions (such as diabetes) and linked to a NETosis upregulation. Recent evidence suggests there are other positive physiological NETs effects on wound healing that are worthy of a broader research effort.","Sabbatini, Maurizio; Magnelli, Valeria; Renò, Filippo",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells10030494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33668924/,434

Its course in many features resembles that of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). Therefore, it is interesting that the experiences with ARF can be used in the management of patients with PIMS-TS. The aim of the article is to analyse the current data on PIMS-TS in relation to ARF. PIMS-TS and ARF are associated with an abnormal immune response to specific pathogens (SARS-CoV-2 and group A streptococcus, respectively). The main symptoms of both diseases are fever and cardiac involvement. Current therapy for PIMS-TS is based on anti-inflammatory treatment: intravenous immunoglobulin (first-line), intravenous glucocorticoids (second-line), or biological therapy (third-line; including interleukin [IL]-1 antagonists, IL-6 receptor blockers, and anti-tumour necrosis factor agents). Vaccination might be good prophylaxis, but the efficacy and safety of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been established in children. Interesting insights may be gained by considering PIMS-TS in light of what is known of ARF due to their similar courses, but there are still many unanswered questions surrounding this disease and its pathogenesis.","Opoka-Winiarska, Violetta; Grywalska, Ewelina; Roliński, Jacek",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22094488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925779/,434

In this work we analyze the effect of current social distancing measures in the United States. We quantify the reduction in doubling rate, by state, that is associated with social distancing. We find that social distancing is associated with a statistically-significant reduction in the doubling rate for all but three states. At the same time, we do not find significant evidence that social distancing has resulted in a reduction in the number of daily confirmed cases. Instead, social distancing has merely stabilized the spread of the disease. We provide an illustration of our findings for each state, including point estimates of the effective reproduction number, R, both with and without social distancing.

689094,Post-COVID-19 Epidemic: Allostatic Load among Medical and Nonmedical Workers in China,2020-11-05,"Tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been shown to play a role in many inflammatory conditions. Currently anti-TNF-α drugs (e.g. etanercept) are used in humans for treatment of autoimmune diseases. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of TNF-α in the development of virus-endotoxin-induced respiratory disease. Twenty-two caesarean derived colostrum deprived pigs were used. Initially, the availability in the lungs and circulation, and possible clinical and inflammatory effects of etanercept alone were assessed in 4 pigs after intratracheal and intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 mg/per route/per pig. High anti-TNF-α activity was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, peritoneal lavage fluids and serum of all animals for at least 8 hours post inoculation (HPI). No clinical symptoms, lung lesions, lung cell infiltration or induction of IFN-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and TNF-α in BAL were detected. Subsequently, the ability of etanercept to block porcine TNF-α and its effect on the above mentioned parameters and on lung virus titres were assessed in 8 pigs. They were inoculated intratracheally with porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hours later. Etanercept was administered at the time of LPS inoculation via the same routes and dose as in the initial experiment. The parameters were compared with a control group (n=8), receiving only PRCV-LPS. Half of the animals from each group were euthanized at 4 and the rest at 8 hours after LPS inoculation. TNF-α was completely neutralized in 3 of the 4 animals euthanized at 4 HPI and significantly lower than in the PRCV-LPS group at all times. No significant differences in disease severity, lung lesions, virus replication, lung cell infiltration or levels of IFN-α, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-12/IL-23 were observed between the two groups. Blocking of TNF-α alone was not sufficient to ameliorate disease in the PRCV-LPS model of respiratory disease, possibly due to the redundancy in the proinflammatory cytokine cascade, or the involvement of other unidentified disease mediators.","Atanasova, Kalina; Van Gucht, Steven; Van Reeth, Kristien",Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc2922464?pdf=render; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20466438/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.04.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242710001182; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242710001182,434

690160,Estimating weekly excess mortality at subnational level in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Several technological innovations have been introduced in healthcare over the years, and their implementation proved crucial in addressing challenges of modern health. Healthcare workers have frequently been called upon to become familiar with technological innovations that pervade every aspect of their profession, changing their working schedule, habits, and daily actions. PURPOSE: An in-depth analysis of the paths towards the acceptance and use of technology may facilitate the crafting and adoption of specific personnel policies taking into consideration definite levers, which appear to be different in relation to the age of nurses. APPROACH: The strength of this study is the application of UTAUT model to analyse the acceptance of innovations by nurses in technology-intensive healthcare contexts. Multidimensional Item Response Theory is applied to identify the main dimensions characterizing the UTAUT model. Paths are tested through two stage regression models and validated using a SEM covariance analysis. RESULTS: The age is a moderator for the social influence: social influence, or peer opinion, matters more for young nurse. CONCLUSION: The use of MIRT to identify the most important items for each construct of UTAUT model and an in-depth path analysis helps to identify which factors should be considered a leverage to foster nurses’ acceptance and intention to use new technologies (o technology-intensive devices). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Young nurses may benefit from the structuring of shifts with the most passionate colleagues (thus exploiting the social influence), the participation in ad hoc training courses (thus exploiting the facilitating conditions), while other nurses could benefit from policies that rely on the stressing of the perception of their expectations or the downsizing of their expectancy of the effort in using new technologies.
