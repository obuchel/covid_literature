Method: This research project is part two of a multi-institutional cross-sectional observational study conducted among medical students from six medical colleges in Saudi Arabia between September and December 2019. Results: 675 medical students were enrolled electively into the lifestyle study. About half of this number were male students and the majority were aged 18–24 years. Most students (87.6%) slept between 4–8 h a day and over 44% were dissatisfied with their sleep. Only 28.1% had three meals a day; about 40% of them usually or always skipped breakfast. A total of 44% usually or always ate fast food and 44.7% drank 2 L of water per day. Moreover, male students were significantly consuming more fast food than females, p < 0.001. The majority (63.3%) revealed they usually or always drink black coffee daily. Females were significantly more inclined to regular coffee consumption than males, p < 0.001. Only 4.3% exercised for 30 min or more daily. The majority (65%) of the students were introverted; they had few close friends. Yet, 81% were somewhat satisfied or satisfied with their social life. Male students were significantly more satisfied with their social life than females, p = 0.001. Only 4.6% smoked cigarettes daily whereas 7.1% smoked e-cigarettes daily. In contrast, only 0.3% used shisha (hookah) daily. Male medical students were substantially more inclined to e-cigarette use than females (p < 0.001). The top five leisure activities of a medical student were surfing social media (75.9%), watching movies (61.3%), hanging out with friends (58.1%), spending time with their family (55.4%), and browsing the Internet (53.6%). Female medical students were significantly more inclined to surf social media than male medical students, p = 0.022; also, watching movies was preferred for females compared to males, p = 0.006. Conclusion: This study revealed that the majority of these medical students in Saudi Arabia exhibited healthy lifestyles to some extent, and these health-promoting behaviors differed based on sex, especially concerning physical activity and eating patterns. The findings of this study provide relevant information for future actions that will be geared towards effectively decreasing the occurrence of chronic illnesses and improving future doctors’ well-being.","Bin Abdulrahman, Khalid A.; Khalaf, Ahmad M.; Bin Abbas, Fahad B.; Alanezi, Omran T.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,700,1

However, very little is known about the reasons why individuals with different perfectionistic tendencies engage or not in physical activity. This study aims, from a person-oriented approach, to analyze if participation motives and barriers may differ among four perfectionistic profiles: Non-Perfectionists (low perfectionistic strivings, PS, and perfectionistic concerns, PC), Adaptive Perfectionists (high PS and low PC), Maladaptive Perfectionists (high PS and PC), and Moderate Perfectionists (moderate PS and PC). A sample composed of 597 (M(age) = 22.08, SD = 3.33) undergraduates enrolled in a sport science degree from Ecuador participated in this study. Non-Perfectionists reported lower levels of motives, whereas Adaptive and Maladaptive Perfectionists reported higher scores on all participation motives. Significant and positive correlations were found between PS and both autonomous and controlled motives, whereas PC was positively correlated with controlled reasons and only significantly correlated with some autonomous reasons by the effect of PS. In terms of barriers, Maladaptive Perfectionists reported significantly higher scores on all barriers analyzed in comparison with the other three profiles, with moderate and large effect sizes. The results of the bivariate and partial correlations suggest that these inter-profile differences were explained by PC. Considering the results, it is advised to develop strategies to identify Maladaptive Perfectionists in order to increase their intrinsic reasons for practicing physical exercise, and to minimize their perceived barriers.","Vicent, María; Sanmartín, Ricardo; Gonzálvez, Carolina; Vásconez-Rubio, Oswaldo; García-Fernández, José Manuel",Int J Environ Res Public Health,700,1

BACKGROUND Nurse turnover is a current global problem in healthcare system, especially given the severe nurse shortages. Retention of nurses requires an understanding of the characteristics of the resigning nurses, their attitudes and their reasons for leaving. METHODS A matching case-control study conducted among 100 resigning nurses and 200 matched remaining nurses. Questionnaires were used to survey the professional characteristics and attitudes of the participating nurses. In addition, exit interviews were used to assess the reasons to leave of resigning nurses. RESULTS Resigning nurses had higher education, less seniority, and fewer managerial positions compared to remaining nurses. In addition, resigning nurses had lower professional autonomy and higher aspirations for professional advancement. The reasons to leave cited by the resigning nurses were distance of the workplace from home and working conditions as well as aspiring for professional advancement. CONCLUSIONS The interface between high education and having few opportunities for advanced positions may lead to resignation. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT We recommend organizational interventions for training new hospital nurses through professional career path development, such as mentoring program.","Kerzman, Hana; Van Dijk, Dina; Siman-Tov, Maya; Friedman, Shoshy; Goldberg, Shoshy",Journal of nursing management,700,20

Long robotic trocars were used. A 5-mm assistant port was added and the number of robotic instrument use was minimized. The average total operation time was 136 min, average docking time was 14.7 min and the average console time was 108.7 min. Blood loss was minimal and there were no complications. In patients with prior history of extensive abdominal procedures, RPRA is safe and effective when performed by surgeons with PRA and robotic experience. Long robotic trocars effectively minimized external robotic arm collisions. Adding a 5-mm assistant trocar maximized the first assistant and console surgeon abilities.

OBJECTIVE To assess patient interpretation of and preferences for verbal probability information in health contexts. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of literature published through September 2020. Original studies conducted in English with samples representative of lay populations were included if they assessed health-related information and elicited either (a) numerical estimates of verbal probability terms or (b) preferences for verbal vs. quantitative risk information. RESULTS We identified 33 original studies that referenced 145 verbal probability terms, 45 of which were included in at least two studies and 19 in three or more. Numerical interpretations of each verbal term were extremely variable. For example, average interpretations of the term ""rare"" ranged from 7 to 21%, and for ""common,"" the range was 34 to 71%. In a subset of 9 studies, lay estimates of verbal probability terms were far higher than the standard interpretations established by the European Commission for drug labels. In 10 of 12 samples where preferences were elicited, most participants preferred numerical information, alone or in combination with verbal labels. CONCLUSION Numerical interpretation of verbal probabilities is extremely variable and does not correspond well to the numerical probabilities established by expert panels. Most patients appear to prefer quantitative risk information, alone or in combination with verbal labels. Health professionals should be aware that avoiding numeric information to describe risks may not match patient preferences, and that patients interpret verbal risk terms in a highly variable way.","Andreadis, Katerina; Chan, Ethan; Park, Minha; Benda, Natalie C; Sharma, Mohit M; Demetres, Michelle; Delgado, Diana; Sigworth, Elizabeth; Chen, Qingxia; Liu, Andrew; Grossman Liu, Lisa; Sharko, Marianne; Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J; Ancker, Jessica S",Journal of general internal medicine,700,1

They possess varied promising properties for medical use. Quercetin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) and apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) are two representative flavonoids, both of which have been reported to possess antibacterial activity by acting on multiple targets. Here, we determined that d-alanine:d-alanine ligase (Ddl) is another new target for quercetin and apigenin. Kinetic analysis indicated that these two flavonoids function as reversible inhibitors that are competitive with the substrate ATP of Ddl, whereas they are non-competitive with the other substrate d-Ala. The fact that quercetin showed lower 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) and inhibitor binding constant (K(i)) values than apigenin against both the Helicobacter pylori Ddl and the Escherichia coli DdlB implies that the two additional hydroxyls on the flavone skeleton of quercetin in structure might facilitate its inhibitory activity and binding affinity to Ddl. This work is expected to help shed more light on the potential antibacterial mechanism of flavonoids.","Wu, Dalei; Kong, Yunhua; Han, Cong; Chen, Jing; Hu, Lihong; Jiang, Hualiang; Shen, Xu",International journal of antimicrobial agents,700,29

Selon des études antérieures, les soins offerts dans les foyers de SLD à but lucratif sont de qualité inférieure pour toute une gamme d’indicateurs de résultats et de processus, ce qui soulève la question suivante: les conséquences de la COVID-19 ont-elles été pires dans les foyers à but lucratif que dans ceux à but non lucratif? MÉTHODES: Une étude de cohorte rétrospective basée sur l’ensemble des foyers de SLD en Ontario a été menée pour la période du 29 mars au 20 mai 2020 à partir de la base de données sur les éclosions de COVID-19 alimentée par le ministère des Soins de longue durée de l’Ontario. Des méthodes logistiques hiérarchiques et basées sur des données de comptage ont été utilisées pour modéliser les associations entre le statut financier des foyers de SLD (à but lucratif, à but non lucratif ou municipal) et les éclosions de COVID-19 dans ces derniers, l’ampleur des éclosions (nombre de résidents infectés) et le nombre de décès de résidents attribuables à la COVID-19. RÉSULTATS: L’analyse portait sur les 623 foyers de SLD de l’Ontario, qui comptent 75 676 résidents. Parmi ces foyers, 360 (57,7 %) sont à but lucratif; 162 (26,0 %) sont à but non lucratif; et 101 (16,2 %) sont des foyers municipaux. Au total, 190 (30,5 %) éclosions de COVID-19 ont été enregistrées dans des foyers de SLD. Elles ont touché 5218 résidents et entraîné 1452 décès, ce qui représente un taux de létalité général de 27,8 %. Les probabilités d’une éclosion dans un foyer ont été associées à l’incidence de la COVID-19 dans la circonscription sanitaire entourant celui-ci (rapport de cotes [RC] ajusté 1,91; intervalle de confiance [IC] à 95 % 1,19–3,05), au nombre de résidents dans l’établissement (RC ajusté 1,38; IC à 95 % 1,18–1,61) et à l’application des anciennes normes d’aménagement (RC ajusté 1,55; IC à 95 % 1,01–2,38), mais pas au statut financier d’un foyer. Comparativement au statut « à but non lucratif », le statut « à but lucratif » a été associé à l’ampleur d’une éclosion dans un foyer de SLD (risque relatif [RR] 1,96; IC à 95 % 1,26–3,05) ainsi qu’au nombre de décès de résidents (RR ajusté 1,78; IC à 95 % 1,03–3,07). Ces associations s’expliquent par une plus grande prévalence des anciennes normes d’aménagement dans les foyers de SLD à but lucratif ainsi qu’à l’appartenance à une chaîne de propriétés. INTERPRÉTATION: Le statut « à but lucratif » est associé à l’ampleur d’une éclosion de COVID-19 et au nombre de décès de résidents dans un foyer de SLD, mais pas au risque d’éclosion.

The objective of this retrospective study was to test a new, streamlined version of this assay, the RVP Fast assay, which requires considerably less run time and operator involvement. The study compared the performance of the RVP Fast assay with those of viral culture, a direct fluorescent assay (DFA), and a panel of single and multiplex real-time PCRs in the testing of 286 respiratory specimens submitted to the Edinburgh Specialist Virology Centre for routine diagnosis of viral infection between December 2007 and February 2009. At least one respiratory viral infection was detected in 13.6% of specimens by culture and DFA combined, in 49.7% by real-time PCR, and in 46.2% by the RVP Fast assay. The sensitivity and specificity of the RVP Fast assay compared to the results of real-time PCR as the gold standard were 78.8% and 99.6%, respectively. Real-time PCR-positive specimens missed by the RVP Fast assay generally had low viral loads or were positive for adenovirus. Additionally, a small number of specimens were positive by the RVP Fast assay but were not detected by real-time PCR. For some viral targets, only a small number of positive results were found in our sample set using either method; therefore, the sensitivity of detection of the RVP Fast assay for individual targets could be investigated further with a greater number of virus-positive specimens.","Gadsby, Naomi J; Hardie, Alison; Claas, Eric C J; Templeton, Kate E",Journal of clinical microbiology,700,19

The research exploited the set of theoretical methods: analyzing, summarizing, and interpreting scholarly sources on the issue under scrutiny;generalization and conceptualization of the authors' pedagogical experience. Applying those methods in coherence logic enabled the effective study and interpretation of the concepts of ""narrative"" and ""digital narrative"" in their interrelations. In the study, the narrative is viewed as a sociocultural tool that provides students with deeper self-understanding, and complements the communicative system of foreign language acquisition with metacognition and values of life meaning. The digital narrative as a form of expression, empowered and determined by digital technologies incorporates multimodal communication and narrative as a cognitive unity. The authors have stated that multimodality, grounded on information technologies, is introducing entirely new semiotic resources into the communicative environment of foreign language learning. It is also generating innovative ways and forms of oral and written interaction. Multimodal learning activities illustrating the specifics of creating digital narratives by learners of English as a foreign language, are highlighted.

Here, we evaluate the clinical performance of five automated immunoassays on a set of clinical samples. METHODS: Serum/plasma samples of 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients and 320 pre-pandemic serum samples of healthy blood donors were subjected to two IgG and three total antibody SARS-CoV-2-immunoassays. All test setups were automated workflows. RESULTS: Positivity of assays (onset of symptoms > 10 days) ranged between 68.4 % and 81.6 % (Diasorin 68.4 %, Euroimmun 70.3 %, Siemens 73.7 %, Roche 79.0 % and Wantai 81.6 %). All examined assays demonstrated high specificity of >99 % (Euroimmun, Diasorin: 99.1 %, Wantai: 99.4 %) but only two reached levels above 99.5 % (Roche: 99.7 %, Siemens 100 %). Interestingly, there was no overlap in false positive results between the assays. The strongest correlation of quantitative results was observed between the Diasorin and Euroimmun IgG tests (r2â¯=â¯0.76). Overall, we observed no difference in the distribution of test results between female and male patients (p-values: 0.18-0.87). A significant difference between severely versus critically ill patients was demonstrated for the Euroimmun, Diasorin, Wantai and Siemens assays (p-values:0.041). CONCLUSION: All assays showed good clinical performance. Our data confirm that orthogonal test strategies as recommended by the CDC can enhance clinical specificity. However, the suboptimal rates of test positivity found at time of hospitalization in this cohort underline the importance of molecular diagnostics to rule out/confirm active infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Pflüger, Lisa Sophie; Bannasch, Johannes H; Brehm, Thomas Theo; Pfefferle, Susanne; Hoffmann, Armin; Nörz, Dominik; van der Meirschen, Marc; Kluge, Stefan; Haddad, Munif; Pischke, Sven; Hiller, Jens; Addo, Marylyn M; Lohse, Ansgar W; Schulze Zur Wiesch, Julian; Peine, Sven; Aepfelbacher, Martin; Lütgehetmann, Marc",J Clin Virol,700,10

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.","Islam, Ariful; Sayeed, Md Abu; Rahman, Md Kaisar; Zamil, Shafayat; Abedin, Josefina; Saha, Otun; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul",Infect Genet Evol,700,20

This is the first study from a Croatian tertiary care hospital describing epidemiology, risk factors and species distribution in patients with candidemia. A three-year retrospective observational study, from 2018 to 2020, was performed at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia. A total of 160 patients with candidemia (n = 170 isolates) were enrolled. Candidemia incidence increased from 0.47 to 0.69 per 1000 admissions in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Ninety-five patients (58.38%) were in the intensive care unit. The main risk factors for candidemia were central venous catheter (CVC) (84.38%), previous surgical procedure (56.88%) and invasive mechanical ventilation (42.50%). Candida albicans was identified in 43.53% of isolates, followed by C. parapsilosis (31.76%) and C. glabrata (12.36%), C. krusei (5.29%), C. tropicalis (2.35%) and C. lusitaniae (2.35%). The study discovered a shift to non-albicansCandida species, particularly C. parapsilosis, and made it possible to determine the main tasks we should focus on to prevent candidemia in the hospital, these being mainly infection control measures directed towards prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, specifically comprising hand hygiene and CVC bundles of care. The potential benefit of fluconazole prophylaxis in certain populations of surgical patients could also be considered.","Marekovic, Ivana; Plesko, Sanja; Rezo Vranjes, Violeta; Herljevic, Zoran; Kulis, Tomislav; Jandrlic, Marija",,700,21

Several reports have investigated FDA-approved drugs as well as in silico virtual screening approaches such as molecular docking and modeling to find novel antiviral agents. Until now, antiparasitic drugs such as chloroquine have shown the most relevant results. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of this novel coronavirus, its transmission routes, surface survival and evolution in the environment.

Our aim was to examine differences in physiological response in rat colonies bred and housed in a conventional versus SPF facility, and implications for research. Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and catheterized for blood and pressure monitoring, and electrocardiogram (ECG) leads implanted. Hematology was assessed, and coagulation profile using rotational thromboelastometry. Health screening was outsourced to Cerberus Sciences. SPF rats had significantly lower pulse pressure (38% decrease), arrhythmias and prolonged QTc (27% increase) compared to conventional rats. No arrhythmias were found in conventional rats. SPF rats had significantly higher white cell, monocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and were hyperfibrinolytic, indicated by EXTEM maximum lysis >15%. Independent assessment revealed similar pathogen exclusion between colonies, with the exception of Proteus in SPF animals. Returning to a conventional facility restored normal host physiology. We conclude that SPF animals displayed an abnormal hemodynamic, hematological and hemostatic phenotype in response to anesthesia and surgery, and provide a number of recommendations to help standardize research outcomes and translation.","Letson, Hayley L.; Morris, Jodie; Biros, Erik; Dobson, Geoffrey P.",Sci Rep,700,26
