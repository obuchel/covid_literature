300,300,300,The infection of primary avian tracheal epithelial cells with infectious bronchitis virus,9.503124,7.0146084,2009-10-01,"Here we introduce a culture system for the isolation, passaging and amplification of avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cells. The ATE medium, which contains chicken embryo extract and fetal bovine serum, supports the growth of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells from chicken tracheas on fibronectin- or matrigel-coated dishes. Non-epithelial cells make up less than 10% of the total population. We further show that ATE cells support the replication and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary ATE cells provide a novel cell culture system for the amplification of IBV and the in vitro characterization of viral cytopathogenesis.","Shen, Ching-I; Wang, Ching-Ho; Liao, Jiunn-Wang; Hsu, Tien-Wang; Kuo, Shu-Ming; Su, Hong-Lin",Vet Res,412,28

Diagnostic performance of three indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (I-ELISA) was evaluated for the detection of IgG antibody to Ebola virus (EBOV) in human sera. One I-ELISA was based on a whole EBOV antigen (WAg) and two utilized recombinant nucleocapsid (NP) and glycoproteins (GP), respectively. Validation data sets derived from individual sera collected in South Africa (SA), representing an EBOV non-endemic country, and from sera collected during an Ebola disease (EBOD) outbreak in Sierra Leone (SL), were categorized according to the compounded results of the three I-ELISAs and real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the cut-off values selected at 95% accuracy level by the two-graph receiver operating characteristic analysis, specificity in the SA EBOV negative serum panel (n = 273) ranged from 98.17% (GP ELISA) to 99.27% (WAg ELISA). Diagnostic specificity in the SL EBOV negative panel (n = 676) was 100% by the three ELISAs. The diagnostic sensitivity in 423 RT-PCR confirmed EBOD patients was dependent on the time when the serum was collected after onset of disease. It significantly increased 2 weeks post-onset, reaching 100% sensitivity by WAg and NP and 98.1% by GP I-ELISA.","Paweska, Janusz T.; Moolla, Naazneen; Storm, Nadia; Msimang, Veerle; Conteh, Ousman; Weyer, Jacqueline; van Vuren, Petrus Jansen",Viruses,412,11

To determine the cellular mechanism of resistance and interferon (IFN)-γ-producing cell populations, mononuclear cells isolated from tissues of the brain were analyzed by the flow cytometry method. Antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, CD8, T cell receptor (TCR)-αβ, and Asialo GM1 were used to deplete the corresponding cell populations in Theiler's virus-infected mice. CD4(+) lymphocytes and CD8(+) lymphocytes infiltrated in the brains of infected mice from 5 days postinfection (p.i.). The number of CD3(+)/TCR-γδ(+) lymphocytes increased in the brains on Day 6 p.i. The elimination of CD3(+) lymphocytes or CD4(+) lymphocytes augmented viral replication and suppressed the production of IFN-γ. The suppression of IFN-γ production by anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) persisted, although the suppression by anti-CD4 mAb was observed only on Day 6 p.i. The depletion of CD8(+) lymphocytes as well as TCR-αβ(+) lymphocytes also augmented the viral replication; however, it did not alter the production of IFN-γ. Anti-Asialo GM1 antibody had no effect on viral replication and IFN-γ production. These results indicate that T lymphocytes are important for eliminating Theiler's virus from the brain, CD3(+)/CD4(+)/CD8(−) lymphocytes and CD3(+)/TCRαβ(−)/CD4(−)/CD8(−) lymphocytes would produce IFN-γ in brain. However, from the result on the experiment of the depletion of TCR-αβ(+) lymphocytes, the defence mechanisms by T lymphocytes against Theiler's virus would be independent of endogenous IFN-γ production.","Kohanawa, Masashi; Nakane, Akio; Asano, Misako; Minagawa, Tomonori",J Neuroimmunol,412,28

The present study found that GACAT1 was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues and was associated with poor outcomes in patients with NSCLC. Functional experiments revealed that GACAT1 downregulation inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of 2 NSCLC cell lines. GACAT1 was found to target microRNA(miR)-422a mechanically and negatively regulated miR-422a expression. Reduced expression of miR-422a in NSCLC tissues was inversely correlated with that of GACAT1. Furthermore, YY1 transcription factor (YY1) was identified as a downstream miR-422a target. Reduced expression of GACAT1 inactivated YY1 by sponging miR-422a in NSCLC cells. YY1 reintroduction reversed the reduced proliferation of NSCLC cells via GACAT1 knockdown. Taken together, these results revealed the novel role of the GACAT1/miR-422a pathway in the progression of NSCLC cell lines, providing a possible therapeutic strategy for NSCLC treatment.","Zhong, Youqing; Lin, Hui; Li, Qi; Liu, Chang; Zhong, Lei",Int J Mol Med,412,20

Traditionally, there is an information gap between the different phases and stakeholders, leading to information being exchanged, processed and stored in a variety of mostly human-readable documents. This paper shows how a knowledge graph can be established as integrated information model that can provide the required information for all phases in a machine-interpretable way. The knowledge graph describes and connects all relevant information, which allows combining and applying it in a holistic way. This makes the knowledge graph a key enabler for a variety of advanced, computerized engineering tasks, ranging from the planning and design phases over the commissioning and the operation of a building. The computerized engineering of building automation systems (BAS) with an advanced software tool chain is presented as such a use case in more detail. The knowledge graph is based on standard semantic web technologies and builds on existing ontologies, such as the Brick and QUDT ontologies, with various novel extensions presented in this paper. Special attention is given to the rich semantic definition of the entities, such as the equipment and the typically thousands of datapoints in a BAS, which can be achieved as a combination of contextual modeling and semantic tagging.","Dibowski, Henrik; Massa Gray, Francesco",The Semantic Web,412,20

As this polymer has been widely applied in ophthalmic applications, a specific consideration has been devoted to this field. Pure pHEMA does not possess antimicrobial properties and the site where the biomedical device is employed may be susceptible to microbial infections. Therefore, antimicrobial strategies such as the use of silver nanoparticles, antibiotics, and antimicrobial agents can be utilized to protect against infections. Therefore, the antimicrobial strategies besides the drug delivery applications of pHEMA were covered.

The type of plants in the geographical area, climatic conditions and production method have a significantly influence on the nutritional quality of honey. However, this variability can influence consumer liking by the sensory attributes of the product. The aim of this work was to compare the most popular honeys from Poland in terms of nutritional value, organoleptic properties and antioxidant activity. In the study, five varieties of honey (honeydew, forest, buckwheat, linden and dandelion) from conventional and organic production methods were tested. The nutritional characteristics of honey samples included acidity, content of water, sugars, vitamin C, HMF and phenolics (total and flavonoids), while honey color, taste, aroma and consistency were investigated in the organoleptic characteristics. The antioxidant activity was determined in water- and ethanol-soluble honey extracts using DPPH and ORAC tests. The results showed that organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of popular Polish honeys differ significantly in relation to plant source and production method. The significant effect of honey variety on the content of HMF, saccharose and phenolics, as well as acidity and antioxidant capacity were noted. The impact of variety and variety × production method interaction was significant in the case of the content of vitamin C, glucose and fructose. A visible difference of buckwheat and forest honeys from other samples was observed. The highest content of total phenolics with antioxidant activity based on the SET mechanism was found in buckwheat honeys, while forest honeys were richer in flavonoids.","Polak-Śliwińska, Magdalena; Tańska, Małgorzata",Molecules,412,16

Recent advancements in training load monitoring solutions have coincided with increases in the literature describing the physical demands of basketball, but there are currently no reviews that summarize all the available basketball research. Additionally, a thorough appraisal of the load monitoring methodologies and measures used in basketball is lacking in the current literature. This type of critical analysis would allow for consistent comparison between studies to better understand physical demands across the sport. OBJECTIVES The objective of this systematic review was to assess and critically evaluate the methods and technologies used for monitoring physical demands in competitive basketball athletes. We used the term 'training load' to encompass the physical demands of both training and game activities, with the latter assumed to provide a training stimulus as well. This review aimed to critique methodological inconsistencies, establish operational definitions specific to the sport, and make recommendations for basketball training load monitoring practice and reporting within the literature. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed using EBSCO, PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science to identify studies through March 2020. Electronic databases were searched using terms related to basketball and training load. Records were included if they used a competitive basketball population and incorporated a measure of training load. This systematic review was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO Registration # CRD42019123603), and approved under the National Basketball Association (NBA) Health Related Research Policy. RESULTS Electronic and manual searches identified 122 papers that met the inclusion criteria. These studies reported the physical demands of basketball during training (n = 56), competition (n = 36), and both training and competition (n = 30). Physical demands were quantified with a measure of internal training load (n = 52), external training load (n = 29), or both internal and external measures (n = 41). These studies examined males (n = 76), females (n = 34), both male and female (n = 9), and a combination of youth (i.e. under 18 years, n = 37), adults (i.e. 18 years or older, n = 77), and both adults and youth (n = 4). Inconsistencies related to the reporting of competition level, methodology for recording duration, participant inclusion criteria, and validity of measurement systems were identified as key factors relating to the reporting of physical demands in basketball and summarized for each study. CONCLUSIONS This review comprehensively evaluated the current body of literature related to training load monitoring in basketball. Within this literature, there is a clear lack of alignment in applied practices and methodological framework, and with only small data sets and short study periods available at this time, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about the true physical demands of basketball. A detailed understanding of modern technologies in basketball is also lacking, and we provide specific guidelines for defining and applying duration measurement methodologies, vetting the validity and reliability of measurement tools, and classifying competition level in basketball to address some of the identified knowledge gaps. Creating alignment in best-practice basketball research methodology, terminology and reporting may lead to a more robust understanding of the physical demands associated with the sport, thereby allowing for exploration of other research areas (e.g. injury, performance), and improved understanding and decision making in applying these methods directly with basketball athletes.","Russell, Jennifer L; McLean, Blake D; Impellizzeri, Franco M; Strack, Donnie S; Coutts, Aaron J",Sports medicine,412,24

As there is no randomized data, the purpose of this study was to systematically review the available literature on proton therapy in this setting, focusing on the toxicity endpoints. Materials and Methods A systematic search using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines was conducted in 5 databases: PubMed, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A total of 491 studies were found on the topic of NPC and proton therapy. Following independent study selection by 2 investigators, 9 studies were found to have sufficient focus and relevance to be incorporated into the systematic review. Results All 9 studies were retrospective and examined only NPC patients except for one that also included paranasal sinus cancer. One study was a reirradiation study. Four studies used 3D or double scatter technique, while all others used intensity-modulated proton therapy. Oncologic outcomes were similar to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) rates, with 2-year local and regional progression-free survival (LRFS) ranging from 84% to 100%, 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) ranging from 75% to 88.9%, and 2-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 88% to 95% in the up-front setting. Four comparison studies with IMRT found significantly lower feeding tube rates (20% versus 65%, P = .015; and 14% versus 85%, P < .001) with proton therapy as well as lower mucositis (G2 46% versus 70%, P = .019; and G3 11% versus 76%, P = .0002). All other acute and late effects were largely improved with proton therapy but not statistically significant. Conclusions NPC patients receiving proton therapy maintain good outcomes with improved toxicity profile, likely due to sparing of dose to normal structures. Prospective studies are ongoing to better quantify the magnitude.","Lee, Anna; Kitpanit, Sarin; Chilov, Marina; Langendijk, Johannes A; Lu, Jiade; Lee, Nancy Y",International journal of particle therapy,412,5

To date, various machine learning models have been proposed that combine multi-parametric imaging data for this purpose. However, most of these machine learning models were trained using voxel information extracted from the whole brain, without taking differences in susceptibility to ischemia into account that exist between brain regions. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a local tissue outcome prediction approach, which makes predictions using locally trained machine learning models and thus accounts for regional differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-parametric MRI data from 99 acute ischemic stroke patients were used for the development and evaluation of the local tissue outcome prediction approach. Diffusion (ADC) and perfusion parameter maps (CBF, CBV, MTT, Tmax) and corresponding follow-up lesion masks for each patient were registered to the MNI brain atlas. Logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models were trained employing a local approach, which makes predictions using models individually trained for each specific voxel position using the corresponding local data. A global approach, which uses a single model trained using all voxels of the brain, was used for comparison. Tissue outcome predictions resulting from the global and local RF and LR models, as well as a combined (hybrid) approach were quantitatively evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC), the Dice coefficient, and the sensitivity and specificity metrics. RESULTS Statistical analysis revealed the highest ROC AUC and Dice values for the hybrid approach. With 0.872 (ROC AUC; LR) and 0.353 (Dice; RF), these values were significantly higher (p < 0.01) than the values of the two other approaches. In addition, the local approach achieved the highest sensitivity of 0.448 (LR). Overall, the hybrid approach was only outperformed in sensitivity (LR) by the local approach and in specificity by both other approaches. However, in these cases the effect sizes were comparatively small. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that using locally trained machine learning models can lead to better lesion outcome prediction results compared to a single global machine learning model trained using all voxel information independent of the location in the brain.","Grosser, Malte; Gellißen, Susanne; Borchert, Patrick; Sedlacik, Jan; Nawabi, Jawed; Fiehler, Jens; Forkert, Nils D",PloS one,412,1

This between-groups experimental study, which was modified in light of COVID-19 concerns, evaluated how well 69 prelicensure nursing students understood a handoff communication report after viewing a virtual human patient and nurse interact during a triage assessment scenario. Results indicate student comprehension levels did not differ based on which of two metacognitive learning strategies was used. Participants in both study groups were able to accurately complete a situation-background-assessment-recommendation instrument based on the virtual experience. Further, they believed that watching a virtual nurse perform a triage assessment would help them perform one themselves in a similar virtual environment.

Mitochondrial-mediated placental oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of PE. However, the underlying mechanism remains to be revealed. Here, we identify Rnd3, a small Rho GTPase, regulating placental mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). We showed that Rnd3 is down-regulated in primary trophoblasts isolated from PE patients. Loss of Rnd3 in trophoblasts resulted in excessive ROS generation, cell apoptosis, mitochondrial injury, and proton leakage from the respiratory chain. Moreover, Rnd3 overexpression partially rescues the mitochondrial defects and oxidative stress in human PE primary trophoblasts. Rnd3 physically interacts with the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and promotes the PPARγ-mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) cascade. Forced expression of PPARγ rescues deficiency of Rnd3-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that Rnd3 acts as a novel protective factor in placental mitochondria through PPARγ-UCP2 signaling and highlight that downregulation of Rnd3 is a potential factor involved in PE pathogenesis.","Huang, Liping; Ma, Yanlin; Chen, Lu; Chang, Jiang; Zhong, Mei; Wang, Zhijian; Sun, Ying; Chen, Xia; Sun, Fei; Xiao, Lu; Chen, Jianing; Lai, Yingjun; Yan, Chuming; Yue, Xiaojing",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,412,10

DESIGN Health impact assessment (excess annual mortality and financial costs) based upon atmospheric PM2.5 measurements. SETTING Armidale, a regional Australian city (population, 24 504) with high levels of air pollution in winter caused by domestic wood heaters, 1 May 2018 - 30 April 2019. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Estimated population exposure to PM2.5 from wood heaters; estimated numbers of premature deaths and years of life lost. RESULTS Fourteen premature deaths (95% CI, 12-17 deaths) per year, corresponding to 210 (95% CI, 172-249) years of life lost, are attributable to long term exposure to wood heater PM2.5 pollution in Armidale. The estimated financial cost is $32.8 million (95% CI, $27.0-38.5 million), or $10 930 (95% CI, $9004-12 822) per wood heater per year. CONCLUSIONS The substantial mortality and financial cost attributable to wood heating in Armidale indicates that effective policies are needed to reduce wood heater pollution, including public education about the effects of wood smoke on health, subsidies that encourage residents to switch to less polluting home heating (perhaps as part of an economic recovery package), assistance for those affected by wood smoke from other people, and regulations that reduce wood heater use (eg, by not permitting new wood heaters and requiring existing units to be removed when houses are sold).","Robinson, Dorothy L; Horsley, Joshua A; Johnston, Fay H; Morgan, Geoffrey G",The Medical journal of Australia,412,30

Studies from three countries (China, Belgium and the United States) report the consequences on traumatic bone fractures. COMMENT The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a widespread change to a relative sedentary lifestyle and decreased exposure to light (vitamin D). A consequence of the stay-at-home policies is a negative change in bone-health and environmental surroundings that has led to age-related changes in the number of traumatic bone fractures. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION A consequence of stay-at-home policies has been a decline in bone fractures for young and middle-aged adults; but an increase for the elderly. The trends are predicted to reverse, and present new problems, when isolation restrictions are removed.","Umeda-Raffa, Sumiyo; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Raffa, Robert B",Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,412,31

Here, we investigated the role of the host cell's unfolded protein response (UPR) in infection of the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). In mammalian cells, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein GRP78/BiP functions as the principal sensor for the induction of the UPR and interacts with three mediators: kinase/endonuclease inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Acute infection with LCMV resulted in a selective induction of the ATF6-regulated branch of the UPR, whereas pathways controlled by PERK and IRE1 were neither activated nor blocked. Expression of individual LCMV proteins revealed that the viral glycoprotein precursor (GPC), but not that of other viral proteins, was responsible for the induction of ATF6. Rapid downregulation of the viral GPC during transition from acute to persistent LCMV infection restored basal levels of UPR signaling. To address a possible role of ATF6 signaling in LCMV infection, we used cells deficient in site 2 protease (S2P), a metalloprotease required for the activation of ATF6. Cells deficient in S2P showed significantly lower levels of production of infectious virus during acute but not persistent infection, indicating a requirement for ATF6-mediated signaling for optimal virus multiplication. In summary, acute LCMV infection seems to selectively induce the ATF6-regulated branch of the UPR that is likely beneficial for virus replication and cell viability, but it avoids induction of PERK and IRE1, whose activation may be detrimental for virus and the host cell.","Pasqual, Giulia; Burri, Dominique J; Pasquato, Antonella; de la Torre, Juan Carlos; Kunz, Stefan",Journal of virology,412,27

We sought to explore effective message strategies communicating about nicotine reduction in cigarettes across the different key audiences that the regulation is most likely to influence. METHODS We designed four types of messages: efficacy messages, risk messages, a message about alternative sources of nicotine and a compensation message. Sixteen virtual focus groups were conducted in Atlanta and San Francisco in April-May 2020. Data were analysed in NVivo 12.0 using a thematic analysis approach. FINDINGS Exclusive smokers were receptive to both efficacy messages and risk messages. Dual users were the only group that was open to resorting to alternative sources of nicotine. Former smokers were critical of these messages as promoting the new kinds of cigarettes and potentially encouraging initiation and relapse of smoking. Non-smokers felt that efficacy messages downplayed the risks of smoking and did not scare people away from smoking. Presenting information that very low nicotine cigarettes (VLNCs) still contain harmful chemicals made smokers question continued smoking in the absence of nicotine and view VLNCs as harmful. CONCLUSIONS Messages communicating about nicotine reduction in cigarettes might help to motivate smokers to quit and can correct the misperceptions that VLNCs are less harmful. The FDA should consider specific target audiences and use different messages that complement each other in communicating about this regulation.","Duong, Hue Trong; Loud, Emily E; Thrasher, James F; Henderson, Katherine C; Ashley, David L; Popova, Lucy",Tobacco control,412,10

Cognitive rehabilitation therapies are used with the goal of improving memory functioning; however, not all patients benefit. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for employing effective memory strategies. We hypothesized that memory improvement after a brief cognitive intervention would be associated with increases in PFC activation during a memory task. Methods The current study used behavioral analyses and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the effects of two days of intensive semantic encoding strategy training on memory performance and brain activation patterns in patients in the post-acute stage of TBI. fMRI data were collected before and after training while participants learned word lists. Results Post-training vs. pre-training changes in total recall and semantic clustering during recall were positively correlated with post-training vs. pre-training changes in neural activation in PFC. Conclusions These results suggest that variability in treatment response to cognitive training after TBI may be due in part to variability in PFC function, and that some survivors of TBIs may benefit from treatments specifically targeting the PFC.","Lepping, Rebecca J; Brooks, William M; Kirchhoff, Brenda A; Martin, Laura E; Kurylo, Monica; Ladesich, Linda; Lierman, Jo Ann; Varghese, George; Savage, Cary R",International journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,412,29

METHODS In this retrospective multicenter study, data on the number of hospital admissions due to acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack and numbers of reperfusion therapies performed in weeks 1 to 15 of 2020 and 2019 were collected in 4 German academic stroke centers. Poisson regression was used to test for a change in admission rates before and after the implementation of extensive social distancing measures in week 12 of 2020. The analysis of anonymized regional mobility data allowed for correlations between changes in public mobility as measured by the number and length of trips taken and hospital admission for stroke/transient ischemic attack. RESULTS Only little variation of admission rates was observed before and after week 11 in 2019 and between the weeks 1 and 11 of 2019 and 2020. However, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant decrease in the number of admissions for transient ischemic attack was observed (-85%, -46%, -42%) in 3 of 4 centers, while in 2 of 4 centers, stroke admission rates decreased significantly by 40% and 46% after week 12 in 2020. A relevant effect on reperfusion therapies was found for 1 center only (thrombolysis, -60%; thrombectomy, -61%). Positive correlations between number of ischemic events and mobility measures in the corresponding cities were identified for 3 of 4 centers. CONCLUSIONS These data demonstrate and quantify decreasing hospital admissions due to ischemic cerebrovascular events and suggest that this may be a consequence of social distancing measures, in particular because hospital resources for acute stroke care were not limited during this period. Hence, raising public awareness is necessary to avoid serious healthcare and economic consequences of undiagnosed and untreated strokes and transient ischemic attacks.","Hoyer, Carolin; Ebert, Anne; Huttner, Hagen B; Puetz, Volker; Kallmünzer, Bernd; Barlinn, Kristian; Haverkamp, Christian; Harloff, Andreas; Brich, Jochen; Platten, Michael; Szabo, Kristina",Stroke,412,6

The authors recently synthesized a series of GRPR-affine peptide analogs based on the 27-mer GRP and derivatized with the DOTA chelator at the N-terminus for (111)In-labeling. In this study, the authors evaluated the most promising from these series, DOTA-GRP(13-27), after radiolabeling with (177)Lu for future therapeutic applications. In addition, to improve in vivo stability of the peptide against in vivo degradation by the protease neutral endopeptidase (NEP), the authors coinjected [(177)Lu]DOTA-GRP(13-27) with the potent NEP inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA). The authors also aimed at reducing renal uptake by coadministration of lysine. METHODS In vivo stability studies were performed in Swiss albino mice. Biodistribution studies were conducted in NMRI nu/nu mice bearing prostate cancer (PC)-3 xenografts. Ex vivo autoradiography was performed using frozen sections from PC-3 xenografts and kidneys. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Coadministration of PA significantly increased the percentage of intact radiopeptide in the mouse circulation. From biodistribution and ex vivo autoradiography studies, coadministration of both lysine and PA with [(177)Lu]DOTA-GRP(13-27) appeared to induce a clear improvement of tumor uptake as well as lower levels of renal radioactivity, causing a promising ninefold increase in tumor/kidney ratios.","Marsouvanidis, Panteleimon J; Melis, Marleen; de Blois, Erik; Breeman, Wout A P; Krenning, Eric P; Maina, Theodosia; Nock, Berthold A; de Jong, Marion",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,412,16

However, a transanal platform has not yet been standardized, and diverse transanal endoluminal surgery access devices have been used, based on individual surgeon preferences. In the present study, we performed laparoscopy-assisted taTME in cadavers and compared the characteristics of four different platforms. METHODS Between January 2013 and April 2015, laparoscopy-assisted taTME was performed on six fresh cadavers. Flexible [SILS™ Port (Covidien), GelPOINT(®) Path Transanal Access Platform (Applied Medical)] and rigid [TEO(®) (Karl Storz Endoskope), TEM (Richard Wolf)] transanal access platforms were used on three cadavers each. RESULTS All cadavers were male, with a mean age of 69.2 (range 57-86) years. The mean operation time was 146.3 (range 140-155) min with flexible platforms and 206.7 (range 150-260) min with rigid platforms. The mean specimen length was 23 (range 18-26) cm. Complete or nearly complete mesorectal specimens were obtained in all cases, except for one case using the TEM platform. Flexible platforms (SILS and GelPOINT) provided a short set-up time, relatively atraumatic retraction, and easy application of familiar laparoscopic instruments; a narrow operative field was its limitation. The rigid platforms (TEO and TEM) enabled larger and more stable operative fields and space than did the SILS platform, but they were limited by a narrow view, prolonged set-up time, rigidity, and long channels relative to the short distance from the anus to the rectal closure site. CONCLUSION In this preliminary study, laparoscopy-assisted taTME was a feasible and safe procedure using both rigid and soft platforms, despite some limitations of each platform.","Kim, Min Jung; Park, Ji Won; Ha, Heon-Kyun; Jeon, Byeong Geon; Shin, Rumi; Ryoo, Seung-Bum; Choi, Sang-ji; Park, Byung Kwan; Park, Kyu Joo; Jeong, Seung-Yong",Surgical endoscopy,412,22

The search was performed by using the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, gender, sex, vaccine, adverse reaction. Clinical trials, retrospective and prospective studies were included. Studies written in languages other than English were excluded. Studies were included if gender differences in response to vaccination trials were reported. All selected studies were qualitatively analyzed. Innate recognition and response to viruses, as well as, adaptive immune responses during viral infections, differ between females and males. Unfortunately, a majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people, with ages between 18 to 65 years, excluding the elderly, pregnant women, post-menopausal female and children. In conclusion, it is apparent that the design of vaccines and vaccine strategies should be sex-specific, to reduce adverse reactions in females and increase immunogenicity in males.

This has led to claims that a 'smoker's paradox' may exist in COVID-19, wherein smokers are protected from infection and severe complications of COVID-19. We aimed to review and summarise existing literature in this context. Electronic databases were searched for articles that reported prevalence of smokers among patients with COVID-19 or studied any association of smoking with outcomes among patients with COVID-19. We identified several biases and knowledge gaps which may give the false impression that smoking is protective in COVID-19. As of now, the data supporting smoker's paradox claims are limited and questionable. Plausible biologic mechanisms by which smoking might be protective in COVID-19 include an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine, a blunted immune response in smokers (reducing the risk of a cytokine storm in COVID-19) and increased nitric oxide in the respiratory tract (which may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 and its entry into cells). On the other hand, smoking may worsen susceptibility and prognosis in COVID-19, in a manner similar to other respiratory infections. The claims of a protective effect must be viewed with extreme caution by both the general population as well as clinicians. Further investigations into the interaction between smoking and COVID-19 are warranted to accurately assess the risk of contracting COVID-19 among smokers, and progression to mechanical ventilation or death in patients suffering from it.","Usman, Muhammad Shariq; Siddiqi, Tariq Jamal; Khan, Muhammad Shahzeb; Patel, Urvish K; Shahid, Izza; Ahmed, Jawad; Kalra, Ankur; Michos, Erin D",BMJ evidence-based medicine,412,30

These challenges are especially relevant in competitive surgical specialties, where racial and gender diversity already lags behind other medical specialties. Inclusive excellence is a guiding philosophy in creating equitable resident selection processes. It focuses on the multilayered processes that form the foundation of inclusive institutional culture, while recognizing that excellence and inclusivity are mutually reinforcing and not mutually exclusive.A key tenant in inclusive excellence for resident recruiting involves applying an equity lens in all decision making. An equity lens allows programs to continuously evaluate resident selection policies and processes through an intentional equity-forward approach. In addition to using an equity lens, programs should emphasize the importance of equity-focused skill building, which ensures that all individuals engaged in the resident selection process have the tools and knowledge to recognize biases. Finally, institutions should implement specific programming for URiM applicants to provide them with information about key aspects of department culture and mechanisms of support for URiM trainees.Every residency program should adopt a sustained perspective of inclusive excellence, in this application cycle and beyond.

Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations are spread over the entire channel's structure and only 10 % of mutations have been characterized at the molecular level, with most of them being gain of function mutations. In this study, we analyzed three previously uncharacterized Nav1.6 epilepsy-causing mutations: G214D, N215D and V216D, located within a mutation hot-spot at the S3-S4 extracellular loop of Domain1. Voltage clamp experiments showed a 6-16 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the activation mid-point for all three mutants. V216D presented the largest shift along with decreased current amplitude, enhanced inactivation and a lack of persistent current. Recordings at hyperpolarized potentials indicated that all three mutants presented gating pore currents. Furthermore, trafficking experiments performed in cultured hippocampal neurons demonstrated that the mutants trafficked properly to the cell surface, with no significant differences regarding surface expression within the axon initial segment or soma compared to wild-type. These trafficking data suggest that the disease-causing consequences are due to only changes in the biophysical properties of the channel. Interestingly, the patient carrying the V216D mutation, which is the mutant with the greatest electrophysiological changes as compared to wild-type, exhibited the most severe phenotype. These results emphasize that these mutations will mandate unique treatment approaches, for normal sodium channel blockers may not work given that the studied mutations present gating pore currents. This study emphasizes the importance of molecular characterization of disease-causing mutations in order to improve the pharmacological treatment of patients.","Solé, Laura; Wagnon, Jacy L; Tamkun, Michael M",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Recommendations for the management of PV pregnancies are mainly based on studies with a small number of patients. A correlation between pregnancy outcome and postpartum course has been reported for essential thrombocythaemia, but corresponding data for PV are lacking so far. METHODS In 41 PV pregnancies, the pregnancy outcome, the use of PV-specific therapies (i.e. acetylsalicylic acid, low molecular weight heparin and/or interferon-alpha) and the postpartum PV course were investigated. RESULTS A live birth rate of 51.2 % (21/41 pregnancies) was observed. 43.9 % of pregnancies ended in spontaneous abortion and 4.9 % in stillbirth. A significantly increased live birth rate occurred in pregnancies with PV-specific therapies compared to standard antenatal care (69.0% vs. 8.3%; p<0.0019). The use of PV-specific therapy significantly increased the number of maternal hemorrhages (p=0.021) without increasing the risk of fetal complications. During the median postpartum follow-up period of 1.2 years (range 0.1-13.7), complicated postpartum PV occurred significantly more often after miscarriages (p=0.035). CONCLUSIONS According to our analysis, PV-specific therapy improved the live birth rate.

There is still great uncertainty whether these IMIDT patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 than controls, and/or should be advised to avoid taking their immunosuppressive treatment. Objectives: To evaluate whether patients with IMIDT are more at risk for CLS than controls. Methods: The IENIMINI study is a prospective cohort study in patients with IMIDT and controls (healthy or no IMIDT) who were identified based on the registration database of the Leiden University Medical Center. Over time, participants registered COVID-like symptoms (CLS) as they occurred, and filled in additional questionnaires. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were done to identify variables associated with having CLS. Results: Of the 8670 individuals approached, 2110 with IMIDT and 1067 controls agreed to participate. In March and April, 454 (22%) of IMIDT patients and 242 (23%) of controls recorded to have CLS, mostly mild with a median (IQR) duration of seven (3-14) days in the IMIDT group and six days (4-11) in the control group. Eleven (5%) of the IMIDT patients with immunosuppressive medication (imed), 6 (3%) of IMIDTs without imed and 2 (1%) of controls were hospitalized with CLS (p=0.04). In May and June, fewer episodes overall were recorded. Being female (OR 1.45 95%CI 1.15;1.82), having a lung disease (OR 1.50 95%CI 1.20;1.88) and wearing a face mask (OR 1.42 95%CI 1.13-1.77) were independently associated with a higher risk, while higher age (OR 0.96 95%CI 0.96;0.97) and having an IMIDT with immunosuppressive medication use (OR 0.68 95%CI 0.51;0.91) were independently associated with a lower risk (see Table 1). Similar results were found after data imputation. Conclusion: Between March and July 2020, IMIDT patients, whether or not taking imeds, did not show an increased risk of reported COVID-like symptoms compared to controls. Continuing immunosuppressant drugs as long as not ill, while following the Dutch COVID rules, appears to be safe.","Van Ouwerkerk, L.; Van Der Meulen, A.; Ninaber, M.; Teng, Y. K.

It changed the order of routine life and the business world. In this challenging condition, the survival of the small business was at high risk. Following experiential learning theory, the purpose of this paper is to explore women's entrepreneurial learning obtained during the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges experienced by them and strategies undertaken to transform businesses. Design/methodology/approach To explore Pakistani women entrepreneurs' lived experiences and learning during the COVID-19, researchers used a qualitative interview design. The interviewees reported their experiences about the effects of COVID-19 on their business and entrepreneurial learning from such a crisis. Findings The findings of the study indicate new fractions of knowledge from the novel learning of the female entrepreneurs throughout the experience of the COVID-19. The transformation from manual business dealings and financial transactions to virtual dealing and the online transaction was the addition of novel learning. Furthermore, the analysis provides insights into the challenges experienced by women entrepreneurs, strategies undertaken and lessons learned from COVID-19. The life lessons learned showed the importance of technical skills and their business operations during the crisis. Research limitations/implications This study is very specific in its context and limitations of this study offers new avenue for research to extend study in different perspectives. First, interviews were conducted from women entrepreneurs running businesses in sub-urban cities of Pakistan, where study can be extended to include both male and female in a comparative study which can expose new dimensions. Second, this study is conducted in the sub-urban areas of the Sindh province of Pakistan, which can be extended to other areas of the country because Pakistan is multicultural and multilingual, which offer different gender specific factors for entrepreneurial activities in general terms but in case of the Covid-19 situation, there exists great variations and social stratifications. Third, this study can be extended to other developing or developed countries or comparative study can provide a new flavor of knowledge. Practical implications The study's finding offers few implications for the entrepreneurs, societies and government at large. Although the pandemic crisis has had devastating effects on health and lifestyle activities, there is always a ray of coming to innovative approaches to fulfill the entrepreneurial desires and serve the community. Thus, entrepreneurs are encouraged to contribute to the economy as a part of society through their sustainable products and services for the greater good. There is also a need for some social policies to find entrepreneurial ways to deal with the COVID-19 crisis that integrates value co-creation for society (Ratten, 2020b). Government and society should also intervene and play their role to encourage women entrepreneurs to feel a sense of empowerment, contribute to family income, alleviate poverty, create jobs and help in economic growth. Originality/value This study's unique contribution and origin are to explore the COVID-19-related entrepreneurial learning experiences of women entrepreneurs in a developing country (Pakistan). Moreover, this study theoretically contributes to the development of experiential learning theory by expanding its insights during COVID-19.","Afshan, G.; Shahid, S.; Tunio, M.

Sudden changes in our living media may alter the way we perceive ourselves and our environment in various ways. Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is a great example of a sudden change. The outbreak influenced means of work, study, socialization, and communication in unprecedented ways. In our study, we investigate the topic dynamics of Twitter content sharing for the Republic of Turkey. We have analyzed 1.3 million tweets containing the keyword ``korona'' shared between February 24, 2020 and May 2, 2020. Our study has three key outcomes. The first one is, after the official announcement of first COVID-19 case in Turkey, rate of COVID-19-related content sharing decreases and hygiene-, lifestyle-, and anxiety-related tweets increase. Second, we see that a number of friends and followers influence content sharing dynamics where accounts sharing COVID-19 News-related content have more followers compared to accounts that share the remaining contents. Finally, motivated by the World Bank's Poverty Monitoring Technical Note, we inquired the effect of income on content sharing and found that GDP per capita of the author's city is more influential on COVID-19 News-related content sharing compared to the population and COVID-19 cases per 1,00,000 people. The lower the GDP per capita, the higher the COVID-19 News-related content sharing is. Also, our model indicates that lower income and population along with high rates of COVID-19 cases per 1,00,000 people are associated with increased COVID-19 News-related content sharing.

Lifestyle interventions are multidimensional because of the influence of resources, societal changes, scientific and technological advancement, and the environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has strained lifestyle on a global scale. Lifestyle surveys provide opportunities to reflect on the living experience and identify alternatives to enrich lifestyle. Method: A qualitative approach was used to explore existing generic, none-disease specific, and multidimensional lifestyle measures to identify if these have included smartphone use for self-management to determine the potential for use as a tool for self-reflection and lifelong learning. Results: A total of 15 multidimensional lifestyle measures were identified. All included diet/nutrition, physical activity/exercise. Stress or mental health was described in all 9 generic lifestyle measures;social support and relationship were included in 6 (67%), sleep and health responsibility were in 5 (56%), and spiritual or religious pursue was in 3 (33%). One lifestyle measure classified spirituality in the stress management dimension. None included smartphone use and technology-related chronic illness management. Conclusion: New dimensions need to be created to use a lifestyle measure as a self-reflection learning process, including those that incorporate the use of technology. The advancement in environmental neuroscience can also shed light on a healthy lifestyle in the area of connection to nature/environment. Lifelong learning to adopt these new activities as lifestyles should also be reflected in lifestyle measures for it to be a self-administered learning tool.","Fanchiang, Shanpin Morris Keiyana Bouchonville Matthew F.",Diabetes,412,10

Objective: This paper analyses recent trends in the mobility of health workers in Europe and focuses specifically on the patterns of mobility among medical doctors and nurses from Western Balkans and Croatia to Germany and Austria. It identifies the drivers of this mobility and shows how to predict further migration of this stuff. In the last 10 years, every fourth nurse has emigrated from the Croatian health system - to Germany, while according to projections Croatia will lose as much as 1/3 of all doctors in the next five years. Methods: A special problem in the analysis of the emigration of healthcare workers from the Western Balkans and Croatia is the fact that there is no system for monitoring this process. Official data up to three years late, and exist only for persons who have deregistered from the state system. The basic methodological concept of our approach is to monitor the digital trace of language searches with the Google Trends analytical tool (trends.google.com). Initially, keywords were chosen by brainstorming possible words that we believed to be predictive, specific, and common enough for use in the forecasting of migration of healthcare professionals. To standardize the data, we requested the data for the period from Dec. 2015 to Dec. 2020 and divided the keyword frequency for each word giving us a search frequency index. Then we have compared searches with official statistics to prove the significations of results and correlations. Results: In Croatia search activities using GT for terms such as Bewerbung (job application), Arbeit (work), Krankenschwester, Bewerbung (nurses, job application) correlate strongly with officially Germans data for emigrants from Croatia. The data collected by this method correlate with official data, which allows reliable forecasts for the future. Austria will soon become one of the most desirable emigration destinations for Croats, especially for healthcare workers. Simultaneously, the emigration of Croatian citizens to Germany will continue. Conclusion: Understanding why health care personnel emigrate from Western Balkans and Croatia and which are the consequences of this process are key to enable state agencies and government to develop optimal intervention strategies to retain medical staff. The benefit of this method is reliable estimates that can enable state agencies and the government to prepare and better respond to a possible shortage of healthcare workers and to protect the functioning of the health system.","Juric, T.",,412,33

In order to maximise the promise of e-learning, it is necessary for managers to understand, control and avoid barriers that impact learner continuance of e-learning systems. The technology, individual, pedagogy and enabling conditions (TIPEC) framework identified theoretical barriers to e-learning implementation, i.e. grouped into four theoretical concepts (7 technology, 26 individual, 28 pedagogy and 7 enabling conditions). This study validates the 26 theoretical individual barriers. Appreciating individual barriers will help the e-learning implementation team to better scope system requirements and help achieve better student engagement, continuation and ultimately success. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 344 e-learning students and corporate trainees, across a range of degree programs. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis was used to define and validate barrier themes. Comparison of results against the findings of Ali et al. (2018) allows comparison of theoretical and validated compound factors. Findings Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis combined several factors and defined 16 significant categories of barriers instead of the 26 mentioned in the TIPEC framework. Originality/value Individual learner barriers, unlike technology and pedagogy barriers which can be directly identified and managed, appear abstract and unmanageable. This paper, considering implementation from the learner perspective, not only suggests a more simplified ontology of individual barriers but presents empirically validated questionnaire items (see Appendix) that can be used by implementation managers and practitioners as an instrument to highlight the barriers that impact individuals using e-learning factors. Awareness of individual barriers can help the content provider to adapt system design and/or use conditions to maximize the benefits of e-learning users.","Basir, M.; Ali, S.; Gulliver, S.

Despite the utmost urgency of this problem, there yet exists no systematic analysis on linkages among COVID-19 clinical severity, air quality, and other atmospheric conditions, beyond relatively simplistic regression-based models. The goal of this project is to glean a deeper insight into sophisticated spatio-temporal dependencies among air quality, atmospheric conditions, and COVID-19 clinical severity using the machinery of Geometric Deep Learning (GDL), while providing quantitative uncertainty estimates. Our results based on the GDL model on a county level in three US states, California, Pennsylvania and Texas, indicate that AOD attributes to COVID-19 clinical severity in 39, 30, and 132 counties out of 58, 67, and 254 total counties, respectively. In turn, relative humidity is another important factor for understanding dynamics of clinical course and mortality risks due COVID-19, but predictive utility of temperature is noticeably lower. Our findings do not only contribute to understanding of latent factors behind COVID-19 progression but open new perspectives for innovative use of NASA's datasets for biosurveillance and social good. © 2021 ACM.","Segovia Dominguez, I.; Lee, H.; Chen, Y.; Garay, M.; Gorski, K.

During COVID-19 pandemic, the trends in the management of acute appendicitis have changed. Conservative management of appendicitis with antibiotics is being proposed as an alternative to conventional appendectomy. So, this study is conducted to compare the presentation and outcome of Appendicitis managed during pre and post pandemic period in our settings. Methodology: After approval of Ethical Review Committee, a total of 267 patients of age 1-12 years were selected for the study. It was a retrospective Cohort Study. Patients were divided into group A (n=145) which was pre pandemic group. Data was collected retrospectively from charts regarding demographics, presentation, duration of stay operative findings and complications from May-Oct 2019 and Group B (n=122) during covid-19 was collected from the patients presented with appendicitis over a period of six months from May-Oct 2020 . Similar months of the year were selected to remove seasonal variation in the presentation of Appendicitis. All information was collected on a predesigned Performa. Data was compared and analyzed on SPSS 20. Results: Out of 267 patients, 151 (56.56%) were male. Group A patients presented during pre-pandemic period (n=145) were undergone appendectomy for appendicitis in 129 patients (88.96%) with 59 patients (40.68%) having acutely inflamed appendix and 70 patients (48.27%) had complicated appendicitis such as gangrenous, perforated with generalized peritonitis. In Group A only 16 patients (11.03%) were managed conservatively for appendicular mass. In contrast to group B (n=122) presented during pandemic, only 43 patients (35.24%) were operated with findings of acutely inflamed appendicitis while gangrenous/perforated appendicitis with pelvic abscess and/or generalized peritonitis was found in most of the patients with a number of 69 (56.55%), only 10 (8.19%) patient presented as Appendicular mass hence managed conservatively. Conclusion: Delay in presentation and early conservative management during pandemic crisis has resulted in an increase in the complications of Appendicitis. Early referral to specialized centers with vigilant selection for conservative treatment can save patients from developing complications.","Zahra, M.; Kashif, M.; Ahmed, S.; Rasool, S.; Khan, I.",Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences,412,31

Objectives: Here we use a combination of the Nucleoprotein (NP), the Spike 1 (S1) and Spike 2 (S2) subunits, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the Spike antigens from the Syrius-CoViDiag multiplex IgG assay, to follow the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection over a long time period and depending on disease severity. Results: Using a panel of 209 sera collected from 61 patients up to eight months after infection, we observed that most patients develop an immune response against multiple viral epitope, but anti-S2 antibodies seemed to last longer. For all the tested IgGs, we have found higher titers for hospitalized patients than for non-hospitalized ones. Moreover the combination of the five different IgG titers increased the correlation to the neutralizing antibody titers than if considered individually. Conclusion: Multiplex immunoassays have the potential to improve diagnostic performances, especially for ancient infection or mild form of the disease presenting weaker antibody titers. Also the combined detection of anti-NP and anti-Spike-derived domains can be useful to differentiate vaccination from viral infection and accurately assess the antibody potential to neutralize the virus.","Brochot, E.; Souplet, V.; Follet, P.; Ponthieu, P.; Olivier, C.; Even, G.; Audebert, C.; Malbec, R.",,412,1

This disease can cause respiratory, physical and psychological dysfunction in patients. Therefore, restorative therapeutic treatment and rehabilitation are critical for both hospitalized and discharged patients with COVID-19. The author believes that many patients who have a history of a previous coronavirus infection note that they experience various unpleasant symptoms even six months after receiving negative tests. So, such patients may experience weakness, shortness of breath, tachycardia, instability of mental states, and so on. At the same time, against the background of an active fight against the spread of COVID-19, measures related to the rehabilitation of convalescents are receding into the background, which is fundamentally wrong. The paper analyzes the literature devoted to the problem of rehabilitation treatment after a coronavirus infection, and also applies comparative and comparative research methods. The author concludes that complications after COVID-19 can significantly worsen the quality of life of patients. For this reason, specialists need to identify the degree and level of complications and patients who have suffered a coronavirus infection as early as possible in order to prescribe appropriate medication or physiotherapy.","Gimbatova, A.

Our observations confirm the presence of a compact source of emission co-located with PDS70c, spatially separated from the circumstellar disk and less extended than $\sim$1.2au in radius, a value close to the expected truncation radius of the cicumplanetary disk at a third of the Hill radius. The emission around PDS70c has a peak intensity of $\sim$86$\pm$16 $\mu \mathrm{Jy}~\mathrm{beam}^{-1}$ which corresponds to a dust mass of $\sim$0.031M$_{\oplus}$ or $\sim$0.007M$_{\oplus}$, assuming that it is only constituted of 1 $\mu$m or 1 mm sized grains, respectively.

Losartan pharmacokinetics (PK) and RAAS components [Ang II, angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), ACE, ACE2] were measured in a subgroup of participants. Findings: From April 2020 - February 2021, 205 participants were randomized, 101 to losartan and 104 to placebo. Compared to placebo, losartan did not significantly affect PaO2/FiO2 ratio at 7 days [difference of -24.8 (95% -55.6 to 6.1; p=0.12)]. Losartan did not improve any secondary clinical outcome, but worsened vasopressor-free days. PK data were consistent with appropriate steady-state concentrations, but we observed no significant effect of losartan on RAAS components. Interpretation: Initiation of orally administered losartan to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and acute lung injury does not improve PaO2 / FiO2 ratio at 7 days. These data may have implications for ongoing clinical trials.","Puskarich, M. A.; Ingraham, N. E.; Merck, L. H.; Driver, B. E.; Wacker, D. A.; Black, L. P.; Jones, A. E.; Fletcher, C. V.; South, A.

However, this equipment is quite expensive which forces some institutions to seek other alternatives or forego them altogether. In addition, online courses tend to be light on hardware because of the practical and technical challenges associated with running remote hardware-based laboratories. Therefore, a system is needed that allows students who are enrolled in remote courses to experience hardware-intensive classes just as they would an in-person course (especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). In this work, use virtual and augmented reality to build and test a remote UR-10 robotics lab that allows students to work together on a hands-on robotics-based lab. In the future, we plan to demonstrate its technical and pedagogical suitability by running a user study in a real-world class whereby remote students enrolled in a course will participate in a series of experiments to control a UR-10 robot arm. It opens up avenues to explore the advantages and shortcomings of running coordinated group lab exercises between students from different institutions, time-zones, and continents by time-decoupling the schedules. The use of a Virtual Reality interface coupled with a digital twin of the UR10 robot will allow us to investigate the suitability of different user interfaces, and what VR tools would best facilitate remote group work and faculty instruction.","Rukangu, A.; Tuttle, A.; Johnsen, K.; Ieee,",2021 Ieee Conference on Virtual Reality and 3d User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops,412,1

Synthetic fluorescence tagged sprays with size and speed distributions comparable to human sneezes are observed with high-speed imaging. We show that while some larger droplets follow parabolic trajectories, smaller droplets stay aloft for several seconds and settle slowly with speeds consistent with a buoyant cloud dynamics model. The net deposition distribution is observed to become correspondingly broader as the source height $H$ is increased, ranging from sitting at a table to standing upright. We find that the deposited mucosaliva decays exponentially in front of the source, after peaking at distance $x = 0.71$\,m when $H = 0.5$\,m, and $x = 0.56$\,m when $H=1.5$\,m, with standard deviations $\approx 0.5$\,m.

The roles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy have become more defined, accompanied by improvements in preoperative staging and histopathological assessment. We analyse our ongoing results in the light of changing patterns of treatment over consecutive time periods. METHODS In total, 151 consecutive patients underwent potentially curative rectal excision for cancer in a single institution. Management and outcomes were compared between 1993-1999 and 2000-2007 which corresponded with the restructuring of the regional oncological services. RESULTS We found an increase in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy after 1999 (20/89 vs 1/62, p < 0.001). There was an increase in the mean number of lymph nodes examined (11.9 vs 9.4, p = 0.037). The locoregional recurrence rate was 5.3%. The rates were not significantly different between the two study periods [4/89 (4.5%) 1999-2007 vs 4/62 (6.5%) 1993-1999, p = 0.597]. There was no statistical difference in overall or disease-free survival in the time periods examined. CONCLUSIONS Increasing use of neoadjuvant therapy and concomitant improvement in lymph node assessment did not translate into a concurrent reduction in the local recurrence, disease-free and overall survival rates. Our results demonstrate the enduring benefit of specialist training in TME in the outcome of rectal cancer surgery. This observational study suggests that low local recurrence rates are surrogate markers for improved overall and disease-free survival. Multidisciplinary team practice should be examined and made cost effective according to the individual unit's local recurrence rate in the light of this and other reports.","Chang, Kah Hoong; Smith, Myles J; McAnena, Oliver J; Aprjanto, Arifin S; Dowdall, Joe F",International journal of colorectal disease,412,28

METHODS The serum of such population diagnosed as SARS convalescent patients, non-SARS patients, family consanguineous contraction persons, wild animal and vegetable salesman and community common people was collected. The lab detective method of ELISA was adopted for these serum samples. And the epidemic investigations for the SARS patients were also carried out. RESULTS Of these populations, the detective rate of Ab-IgG for the clinic diagnosed SARS patients, which was 53.7%; That for the wild animal salesman and community common people were 16.7% and 0.9%, respectively. Among the clinic diagnosed SARS patients, the positive antibody detective rate was 90.4% for those which had specific contact history or infectivity, which was higher than that for other population. Among the specific contact history or infectivity cases, the antibody positive rate for the young and the old was lower than that for the adult. Meanwhile the difference did not exist among other cases. The antibody positive rate was identical between the male and the female. And the antibody detective rate was decreased by the month. CONCLUSION As a whole SARS-CoV Ab-IgG detective rate for the clinic diagnosed SARS patients was 53.7% only. The reasons for that mainly lie in the wrong clinic diagnosis besides these factors such as age, hormone use and reagent and so on. The combination of lab detection results and epidemic investigation was propitious to the diagnosis veracity. It was impossible for the sub-clinic infection of SARS-CoV virus. The importance in the virus transmitting course need to be further studied.","Du, Lin; Qiu, Ji-chun; Wang, Ming; Zhou, Duan-hua; Liu, Xiao-ning; Gao, Yang; Liu, Yu-fei; DI, Biao; He, Li-juan; Tai, Peng-zhe; Liu, Wei-si; Zhou, Xiu-zhen; Pan, Bing-ying; Zou, Xiao-zhong; Xu, Hui-fang; Mo, Rong-sen",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,412,1

The unique long b' (ULB') region of HCMV contains at least 19 open reading frames (ORFs); however, little is known about the function of UL145 and UL136. We characterized UL145 and UL136 in low-passage clinical isolates from Chinese infants. MATERIAL/METHODS The clinical strains of HCMV were recovered from the urine from HCMV-infected infants. Human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELFs) were infected with clinical isolates of HCMV, and the viral DNA and mRNA for UL145 and UL136 were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing techniques. We also predicted the structure and function of UL145 and UL136 proteins. RESULTS Sixty-two Chinese infants infected with HCMV were recruited into this study and the clinical isolates were recovered from the urine. Two strains among the low-passage isolates, D2 and D3, were obtained. The UL145 and UL136 sequences were deposited with GenBank under accession numbers of DQ180367, DQ180381, DQ180377, and DQ180389. The mRNA expression of both UL145 and UL136 was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT-PCR) assays. UL145 was predicted to contain 1 protein kinase C phosphorylation site, 2 casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and a zinc finger structure. UL136 was predicted to contain a protein kinase C phosphorylation site, N-myristoylation site, cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site and tyrosine kinase II phosphorylation site. Both UL145 and UL136 are highly conserved. CONCLUSIONS UL145 may act as an intranuclear regulating factor by direct binding to DNA, while UL136 may be a membrane receptor involving signal transduction.","Wang, Bo; Hu, Jing-Jing; Yan, Cui-Fang; Su, Hai-Hao; Ding, Jun-Cai; Guo, Yuan-Yuan; Ye, Ning; Zhang, Shui-Qing; Zhang, Xiao-Zhuang; Zhou, Shu-Feng",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,412,30

Domestic dogs pose a significant risk as reservoirs for infectious diseases, especially for wild canids. As part of a multifaceted ecologic study of maned wolves and other canids in the large, remote Noël Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) in northeastern Bolivia, 40 domestic dogs in two villages and at two smaller settlements bordering the national park were sampled for exposure to canine diseases. High levels of exposure were found to canine distemper virus and canine parvovirus, both of which are known to cause mortality in maned wolves and other carnivores. Moderate to high levels of exposure were found to rabies virus, Ehrlichia canis, and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as significant levels of infection with Dirofilaria immitis. This study reports evidence of exposure to several diseases in the domestic dogs bordering the park. Contact between wild carnivores and dogs has been documented in the sampled villages, therefore dogs likely pose a substantial risk to the carnivores within and near NKMNP. Further measures should be undertaken to decrease the risk of spillover infection from domestic animals into the wild species of this region.","Bronson, Ellen; Emmons, Louise H; Murray, Suzan; Dubovi, Edward J; Deem, Sharon L",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,412,27

We are interested in the role of E in the intracellular targeting of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) membrane proteins. We generated a cDNA clone of IBV E and antibodies to the E protein to study its cell biological properties in the absence of virus infection. We show that IBV E is an integral membrane protein when expressed in cells from cDNA. Epitope-specific antibodies revealed that the C terminus of IBV E is cytoplasmic and the N terminus is translocated. The short luminal N terminus of IBV E contains a consensus site for N-linked glycosylation, but the site is not used. When expressed using recombinant vaccinia virus, the IBV E protein is released from cells at low levels in sedimentable particles that have a density similar to that of coronavirus virions. The IBV M protein is incorporated into these particles when present. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that E is localized to the Golgi complex in cells transiently expressing IBV E. When coexpressed with IBV M, both from cDNA and in IBV infection, the two proteins are colocalized in Golgi membranes, near the coronavirus budding site. Thus, even though IBV E is present at low levels in virions, it is apparently expressed at high levels in infected cells near the site of virus assembly.","Corse, E; Machamer, C E",Journal of virology,412,23

Clinical signs and bovine coronavirus (BCV) shedding from the respiratory and enteric tracts of calves were monitored through the 8-week period by direct immunofluorescence of nasal epithelial cells, protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy on feces, and ELISA on nasal secretions and feces. All samples were analyzed for antibody isotypes to BCV structural proteins by immunoblotting. All calves had BCV respiratory tract infections and 4 of 5 calves shed virus in feces. Several calves had multiple or prolonged periods of BCV respiratory tract or enteric tract shedding or both. All calves (except 1) had passive IgG1 antibodies to some BCV proteins (mainly the E2 and E3 proteins) in their serum when they were 1 week old. The presence of these passive serum antibodies (mainly to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins) was associated with decreased or delayed systemic and mucosal antibody responses in calves, in particular IgA responses in nasal secretions and tears to the E2 and E3 BCV proteins, but not to the N protein. Moderate amounts of maternal BCV E2- and E3-specific antibodies in serum did not prevent BCV enteric tract or respiratory tract infections in calves, but may have delayed the development of active antibody responses to these BCV proteins. However, calves with BCV respiratory tract or enteric tract infections had no detectable passive antibodies to any BCV proteins in nasal secretions or feces.","Heckert, R A; Saif, L J; Myers, G W",American journal of veterinary research,412,5

These children and adult patients with severe hyperinflammation present with a constellation of symptoms that strongly resemble toxic shock syndrome, an escalation of the cytotoxic adaptive immune response triggered upon the binding of pathogenic superantigens to T cell receptors (TCRs) and/or major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules. Here, using structure-based computational models, we demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein exhibits a high-affinity motif for binding TCRs, and may form a ternary complex with MHCII. The binding epitope on S harbors a sequence motif unique to SARS-CoV-2 (not present in other SARS-related coronaviruses), which is highly similar in both sequence and structure to the bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. This interaction between the virus and human T cells could be strengthened by a rare mutation (D839Y/N/E) from a European strain of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the interfacial region includes selected residues from an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-like motif shared between the SARS viruses from the 2003 and 2019 pandemics. A neurotoxin-like sequence motif on the receptor-binding domain also exhibits a high tendency to bind TCRs. Analysis of the TCR repertoire in adult COVID-19 patients demonstrates that those with severe hyperinflammatory disease exhibit TCR skewing consistent with superantigen activation. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S may act as a superantigen to trigger the development of MIS-C as well as cytokine storm in adult COVID-19 patients, with important implications for the development of therapeutic approaches.","Cheng, Mary Hongying; Zhang, She; Porritt, Rebecca A; Noval Rivas, Magali; Paschold, Lisa; Willscher, Edith; Binder, Mascha; Arditi, Moshe; Bahar, Ivet",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,412,16

We envisaged that the trend of COVID-19 deaths per day in Ghana portrays a general increase from the onset of the pandemic in the country to about day 160 after which there is a general decrease onward. We fitted a zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model and zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model to the data in the partial-likelihood framework. The zero-inflated negative binomial autoregressive model outperformed the zero-inflated Poisson autoregressive model.

Since SARS-CoV-2 has shown about 77.5% similarity to SARS-CoV, the transcriptome and immunological regulations of SARS-CoV-2 was expected to have high percentage of overlap with SARS-CoV. Results: In this study, we applied the single cell transcriptomics data of human bronchial epithelial cells (2B4 cell line) infected with SARS-CoV, which was annotated in the Expression Atlas database to expand this data to COVID-19. In addition, we employed system biology methods including gene ontology (GO) and Reactome pathway analyses to define functional genes and pathways in the infected cells with SARS-CoV. The transcriptomics analysis on the Expression Atlas database revealed that most genes from infected 2B4 cell line with SARS-CoV were downregulated leading to immune system hyperactivation, induction of signaling pathways, and consequently a cytokine storm. In addition, GO:0016192 (vesicle-mediated transport), GO:0006886 (intracellular protein transport), and GO:0006888 (ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport) were shown as top three GOs in the ontology network of infected cells with SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, R-HAS-6807070 (phosphatase and tensin homolog or PTEN regulation) showed the highest association with other Reactome pathways in the network of infected cells with SARS-CoV. PTEN plays a critical role in the activation of dendritic cells, B- and T-cells, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which cooperates with downregulated genes in the promotion of cytokine storm in the COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: Based on the high similarity percentage of the transcriptome of SARS-CoV with SARS-CoV-2, the data of immunological regulations, signaling pathways, and proinflammatory cytokines in SARS-CoV infection can be expanded to COVID-19 to have a valid platform for future pharmaceutical and vaccine studies.","Zolfaghari Emameh, Reza; Nosrati, Hassan; Eftekhari, Mahyar; Falak, Reza; Khoshmirsafa, Majid",Biol.

Methods: An interdisciplinary Task Force was constructed to develop innovative strategies for management of a novel disease. A single-institution prospective non-randomized cohort study was then conducted on patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure who underwent tracheostomy using an induced bedside apneic technique at a tertiary care academic institution between April 27th, 2020, and June 30th, 2020. Results: 28 patients underwent tracheostomy with induced apnea. The median lowest procedural oxygen saturation was 95%. The median number of ventilated days following tracheostomy was 11. There were 3 mortalities (11%) due to sepsis and multiorgan failure; of 25 surviving patients, 100% were successfully discharged from the hospital and 76% are decannulated, with a median time of 26 days from tracheostomy to decannulation (range 12 - 57). There was no symptomatic disease transmission to healthcare personnel on the COVID-19 Tracheostomy Team. Conclusions: Patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 disease may benefit from tracheostomy. This can be completed effectively and safely, without viral transmission to healthcare personnel. Performing tracheostomies earlier in the course of disease may expedite patient recovery and improve ICU resource utilization. Creation of a collaborative Task Force is an effective strategic approach for management of novel disease.","Weiss, Kathleen D; Coppolino, Antonio; Wiener, Daniel C; McNamee, Ciaran; Riviello, Robert; Ng, Ju-Mei; Jaklitsch, Michael T; Marshall, Margaret B; Rochefort, Matthew M",,412,16

Several recent reviews have brought to light a dramatic escalation in the use of long-term non-invasive ventilation in children over the last 30 years. This is due both to the growing number of children receiving care for complex and severe diseases necessitating respiratory support and to the availability of LT-NIV equipment that can be used at home. While significant gaps in availability persist for smaller children and especially infants, home LT-NIV for children with chronic respiratory insufficiency has improved their quality of life and decreased the overall cost of care. While long-term NIV is usually delivered during sleep, it can also be delivered 24 h a day in selected patients. Close collaboration between the hospital complex-care team, the home LT-NIV program, and family caregivers is of the utmost importance for successful home LT-NIV. Long-term NIV is indicated for respiratory disorders responsible for chronic alveolar hypoventilation, with the aim to increase life expectancy and maximize quality of life. LT-NIV is considered for conditions that affect respiratory-muscle performance (alterations in central respiratory drive or neuromuscular function) and/or impose an excessive respiratory load (airway obstruction, lung disease, or chest-wall anomalies). Relative contraindications for LT-NIV include the inability of the local medical infrastructure to support home LT-NIV and poor motivation or inability of the patient/caregivers to cooperate or understand recommendations. Anatomic abnormalities that interfere with interface fitting, inability to protect the lower airways due to excessive airway secretions and/or severely impaired swallowing, or failure of LT-NIV to support respiration can lead to considering invasive ventilation via tracheostomy. Of note, providing home LT-NIV during the COVID 19 pandemic has become more challenging. This is due both to the disruption of medical systems and the fear of contaminating care providers and family with aerosols generated by a patient positive for SARS-CoV-2 during NIV. Delay in initiating LT-NIV, decreased frequency of home visits by the home ventilation program, and decreased availability of polysomnography and oximetry/transcutaneous PCO2 monitoring are observed. Teleconsultations and telemonitoring are being developed to mitigate these challenges.","Praud, Jean-Paul",Front Pediatr,412,22

Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score &#8805; 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n = 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P = 0.025) and urban dwellers (P = 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%. Increase in HF symptoms was commonly reported (21.8%) and tended to be higher in women than in men (P = 0.074). Of the 23 patients who had a phone teleconsultation during the pandemic, 16 had initially planned an in-person consultation that they switched for teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, psychological distress and decreased well-being were common in CHF outpatients, and there was an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours. These changes may negatively impact short-term and long-term prognoses. Medication adherence was maintained, and limitations in access to care were partly counterbalanced by use of telehealth.","Chagué, Frédéric; Boulin, Mathieu; Eicher, Jean-Christophe; Bichat, Florence; Saint Jalmes, Maïlis; Cransac-Miet, Amélie; Soudry-Faure, Agnès; Danchin, Nicolas; Cottin, Yves; Zeller, Marianne",ESC Heart Fail,412,20

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of short-wave diathermy (SWD) treatment for moderate COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical study. SETTING: Inpatients unit of a COVID-19 specialized hospital. POPULATION: Forty-two patients with moderate COVID-19 were randomly allocated at a 2:1 ratio to two groups: the SWD group and the control group. METHODS: Participants of the SWD group received SWD treatment, and participants of the control group received placebo SWD treatment for one session per day, 10 minutes per session, for no more than 14 days. Both groups were given standard care treatment. Primary outcome was the rate of clinical improvement according to a sevencategory ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes included the rate of computed tomography (CT) improvement and the rate of potential adverse events. RESULTS: Clinical improvement occurred in 92.6% of patients in the SWD group by day 14 compared with 69.2% of patients in the control group (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated that the SWD group had a higher clinical improvement probability than the control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.045; 95% CI, 1.391-6.666; P = 0.005). Similarly, CT improvement occurred in 85.2 % of patients in the SWD group and 46.2 % of patients in the control group respectively by day 14 (P = 0.001). The Cox model indicated SWD group had a higher CT improvement probability than control group (Hazard Ratio, 3.720; 95% CI, 1.486-9.311; P = 0.005). There was no significant difference in adverse events between the SWD group and the control group (2 of 27 [7.4%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control, P = 1.000), the most frequent of which were headache (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 1 of 13 [7.7%] control patients) and dizziness (1 of 27 [3.7%] SWD vs. 0 of 13 [0%] control patients). CONCLUSIONS: SWD is a valid and reliable adjuvant therapy with a favorable safety profile for moderate COVID-19 patients.

On May 10, 2020, 707 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were hospitalized at the Geneva University Hospitals; 31 (4.4%) consecutive patients with an acute encephalopathy (64.6 ± 12.1 years; 6.5% female) were included in this series, after exclusion of comorbid neurological conditions, such as stroke or meningitis. The severity of the COVID-19 encephalopathy was divided into severe and mild based on the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS): severe cases (n = 14, 45.2%) were defined on a RASS < -3 at worst presentation. The severe form of this so-called COVID-19 encephalopathy presented more often a headache. The severity of the pneumonia was not associated with the severity of the COVID-19 encephalopathy: 28 of 31 (90%) patients did develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome, without any difference between groups (p = .665).

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the preprint server of medRxiv.org were searched from their inception to February 20, 2021. Only RCTs that compared the treatment efficacy and safety of tocilizumab with the placebo or the standard of care for adult patients with COVID-19 were included in this meta-analysis. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight RCTs which enrolled a total of 6314 patients for randomization, in which 3267 and 3047 patients were assigned to the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively. The mortality at day 28 was 24.4% and 29.9% in patients in the tocilizumab and control groups, respectively, meaning there was no significant difference observed between these two groups (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.66-1.28; I2 = 62). This finding did not change in the subgroup analysis according to the initial use of MV or steroid while enrollment. The patients receiving tocilizumab had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission at day 28 compared with the control group (MV use: OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.90; I2 = 11; ICU admission: OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92; I2 = 30). There were no significant differences between these two treatment groups in terms of the risk of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.71-1.49; I2 = 43), serious AEs (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.12; I2 = 0) or infection (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.63-1.20; I2 = 0). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab does not provide a survival benefit for patients with COVID-19, but it may help reduce the risk of MV and ICU admission. In addition, tocilizumab is a safe agent to use for the treatment of COVID-19.","Lin, Wei-Ting; Hung, Shun-Hsing; Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Cheng-Yi; Chen, Chao-Hsien",Int Immunopharmacol,412,16

The daily case rate is now declining in many states and there is a need for guidance about the resumption of elective clinical services for patients with lung disease or sleep conditions.Methods: Volunteers were solicited from the Association of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Division Directors and American Thoracic Society. Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane. This will impact an institution's mitigation needs. Operating procedures should be frequently reassessed and modified as needed.

The studies with and without face shield in both an infected and healthy person have been considered in indoor environment simulation. In addition to the influence of the face shield and the synchronization of the breathing process while using the device, we also simulated the effect of small air movements on the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate (outdoor environment simulation). The contact with infectious particles in the case without a face shield was 12-20 s (s), in the presence of at least one person who was positive for SARS-CoV-2. If the infected person wore a face shield, no contact with contaminated air was observed during the entire simulation time (80 s). The time of contact with contaminated air (infection time) decreases to about 11 s when the surrounding air is still and begins to move at a low speed. Qualitative differences between simulations performed on the patients with and without the face shield are clearly visible. The maximum prevention of contagion is probably a consequence of wearing a face shield by an infected person. Our results suggest that it is possible to determine contact with air contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 using the CFD method under realistic conditions for virtually any situation and configuration. The proposed method is probably the fastest and most reliable among those based on CFD-based techniques.","Tretiakow, Dmitry; Tesch, Krzysztof; Skorek, Andrzej",Environ Res,412,1

After excluding patients admitted before the policy but who died after implementation, we observed that ICU length of stay was 2.9 days longer post-policy (95% CI, 0.27-5.6; p = 0.03). A time-to-event analysis revealed that admission after policy implementation was associated with a significantly longer time to first do not resuscitate/do not intubate/comfort care order (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.1; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Policies restricting family presence may lead to longer ICU stays and delay decisions to limit treatment prior to death. Further policy evaluation and programs enabling access to family-centered care and palliative care during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic are imperative.","Azad, Tej D; Al-Kawaz, Mais N; Turnbull, Alison E; Rivera-Lara, Lucia",Crit. care med,412,26

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Chughtai Lab Lahore from 20th to 30th May 2020. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and fifty-four young policemen (mean age 27.1 ±3.8 years) were included in the study after written consent. Squad officers who had any sign of acute respiratory infection were excluded from the study. The participants were asked to fill a questionnaire regarding nature of exposure with the infected cases, kind of personal protective equipment they are provided with and living arrangements. Three ml of blood samples were collected from the participants and immediately sent to the lab for analysis. COVID-19 IgG antibodies were analysed using chemiluminescence immunoassay method on Architect Ci8200 (Abbott). SPSS 23.0 was used for data analysis. RESULTS: All participants were males and mean age was 27.1 ±3.8 years. Out of 154 squad members, 24 were reactive for COVID-19 IgG antibodies and performing duties at the areas of high virus exposure. None of COVID-19 IgG reactive cases exhibited symptoms and most of them performed duties at high risk areas with only masks provided as personal protective equipment. Only 10% of the participants who were exposed to confirmed cases of COVID-19 were found to have anti-COVID IgG. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 IgG antibody reactive cases may not show any symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this question, we report here the association between pre-infection Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services (LHSs), Israel, between 1 February and 30 April 2020. Using the LHS-integrated electronic medical records system, we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socio-economic status, weight, height, body mass index, HbA1c, prior diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, smoking, and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socio-economic background and had a higher baseline HbA1c. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was HbA1c &#8805; 9%. CONCLUSION: Using pre-infection glycaemic control data, we identify HbA1c as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources, and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.","Merzon, Eugene; Green, Ilan; Shpigelman, Miriam; Vinker, Shlomo; Raz, Itamar; Golan-Cohen, Avivit; Eldor, Roy",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,412,9

We aimed to design a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome in electronic health records of critically ill patients. DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. Using a near real-time copy of the electronic health record, we developed a computable phenotyping strategy to detect acute respiratory distress syndrome based on the Berlin definition. SETTING: Twenty multidisciplinary ICUs in Mayo Clinic Health System. SUBJECTS: The phenotyping strategy was applied to 196,487 consecutive admissions from year 2009 to 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort generated by this novel strategy was compared with the acute respiratory distress syndrome cohort documented by clinicians during the same period. The sensitivity and specificity of the phenotyping strategy were calculated in randomly selected patient cohort (50 patients) using the results from manual medical record review as gold standard. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the patients who did not have acute respiratory distress syndrome documented, the computable phenotyping strategy identified 3,169 adult patients who met the Berlin definition, 676 patients (21.3%) were classified to have severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio ≤ 100), 1,535 patients (48.4%) had moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (100 &lt; Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio ≤ 200), and 958 patients (30.2%) had mild acute respiratory distress syndrome (200 &lt; Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio ≤ 300). The phenotyping strategy achieved a sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 96.9%, positive predictive value of 94.4%, and negative predictive value of 96.9% in a randomly selected patient cohort. The clinicians documented acute respiratory distress syndrome in 1,257 adult patients during the study period. The clinician documentation rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome was 28.4%. Compared with the clinicians' documentation, the phenotyping strategy identified a cohort that had higher acuity and complexity of illness suggested by higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (9 vs 7;p &lt; 0.0001), higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score (76 vs 63;p &lt; 0.0001), higher rate of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (99.1% vs 71.8%;p &lt; 0.0001), higher ICU mortality (20.6% vs 16.8%;p &lt; 0.0001), and longer ICU length of stay (5.1 vs 4.2 d;p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our rule-based computable phenotyping strategy can accurately detect acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients in the setting of high clinical complexity. This strategy can be applied to enhance early recognition of acute respiratory distress syndrome and to facilitate best-care delivery and clinical research in acute respiratory distress syndrome.","Li, H.; Odeyemi, Y.

However, the accuracy of RT-PCR depends on several factors; variations in these factors might significantly lower the sensitivity of detection. METHODS: In this study, we developed a peptide-based luminescent immunoassay that detected immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM. The assay cutoff value was determined by evaluating the sera from healthy and infected patients for pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: To evaluate assay performance, we detected IgG and IgM in the sera from confirmed patients. The positive rate of IgG and IgM was 71.4% and 57.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, combining our immunoassay with real-time RT-PCR might enhance the diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19.","Cai, Xue-Fei; Chen, Juan; Li Hu, Jie-; Long, Quan-Xin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Liu, Ping; Fan, Kai; Liao, Pu; Liu, Bei-Zhong; Wu, Gui-Cheng; Chen, Yao-Kai; Li, Zhi-Jie; Wang, Kun; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Tian, Wen-Guang; Xiang, Jiang-Lin; Du, Hong-Xin; Wang, Jing; Hu, Yuan; Tang, Ni; Lin, Yong; Ren, Ji-Hua; Huang, Lu-Yi; Wei, Jie; Gan, Chun-Yang; Chen, Yan-Meng; Gao, Qing-Zhu; Chen, A-Mei; He, Chang-Long; Wang, Dao-Xin; Hu, Peng; Zhou, Fa-Chun; Huang, Ai-Long; Wang, De-Qiang",J Infect Dis,412,16

The approach identifies segments of the population as at-risk groups and outlines ways in which these remain shielded, while 'healthy' segments would be allowed to return to some kind of normality, gradually, over several weeks. This proposal highlights how narrowly conceived scientific responses may result in unintended consequences and repeat harmful public health practices. As an interdisciplinary group of researchers from the humanities and social sciences at the University of Edinburgh, we respond to this proposal and highlight how ethics, history, medical sociology and anthropology - as well as disability studies and decolonial approaches - offer critical engagement with such responses, and call for more creative and inclusive responses to public health crises.","Ganguli-Mitra, Agomoni; Young, Ingrid; Engelmann, Lukas; Harper, Ian; McCormack, Donna; Marsland, Rebecca; Buch Segal, Lotte; Sethi, Nayha; Stewart, Ellen; Tichenor, Marlee",Wellcome Open Res,412,20

Further imaging and pathological investigations confirm that the COVID-19 syndrome is explained by perfusion disturbances first in the lung, but consecutively in all organs of the body. Damage of the microvasculature by SARS 1 and SARS 2 (COVID-19) viruses causes microthrombotic changes in the pulmonary capillaries and organs leading to macrothrombosis and emboli.

The purpose of the current study was to describe the attitudes of workers towards COVID-19 vaccination prior to vaccination rollout, with a view to informing strategies to promote vaccine uptake within this high-risk sector. METHODS: An online survey was sent via email to workers supporting adults with ID in Ontario, Canada, between January 21 and February 3, 2021 by agency leadership and union representatives. RESULTS: Three thousand and three hundred and seventy-one workers, representing approximately 11.2% of Ontario workers supporting adults with ID completed an online survey. Most reported that they were very likely (62%) or likely (20%) to get a COVID-19 vaccine (vaccination intent) although 18% reported they were less likely to do so (vaccination nonintent). Workers with vaccination nonintent were younger and were more likely to endorse the beliefs that (1) it will not benefit them or those around them, (2) it was not part of their job, (3) rapid development confers uncertainties and risks, and (4) they were scared of potential vaccine side effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is need to address common misconceptions among workers supporting adults with ID to help activate them as vaccine advocates in the communities they serve.

The clinical features and subsequent medical treatment, combined with the impact of a global pandemic, require specific nutritional therapy in hospitalised adults. This document aims to provide Australian and New Zealand clinicians with guidance on managing critically and acutely unwell adult patients hospitalised with COVID-19. These recommendations were developed using expert consensus, incorporating the documented clinical signs and metabolic processes associated with COVID-19, the literature from other respiratory illnesses, in particular acute respiratory distress syndrome, and published guidelines for medical management of COVID-19 and general nutrition and intensive care. Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 are likely to have preexisting comorbidities, and the ensuing inflammatory response may result in increased metabolic demands, protein catabolism, and poor glycaemic control. Common medical interventions, including deep sedation, early mechanical ventilation, fluid restriction, and management in the prone position, may exacerbate gastrointestinal dysfunction and affect nutritional intake. Nutrition care should be tailored to pandemic capacity, with early gastric feeding commenced using an algorithm to provide nutrition for the first 5-7 days in lower-nutritional-risk patients and individualised care for high-nutritional-risk patients where capacity allows. Indirect calorimetry should be avoided owing to potential aerosol exposure and therefore infection risk to healthcare providers. Use of a volume-controlled, higher-protein enteral formula and gastric residual volume monitoring should be initiated. Careful monitoring, particularly after intensive care unit stay, is required to ensure appropriate nutrition delivery to prevent muscle deconditioning and aid recovery. The infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2 and the expected high volume of patient admissions will require contingency planning to optimise staffing resources including upskilling, ensure adequate nutrition supplies, facilitate remote consultations, and optimise food service management. These guidelines provide recommendations on how to manage the aforementioned aspects when providing nutrition support to patients during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Chapple, Lee-Anne S; Fetterplace, Kate; Asrani, Varsha; Burrell, Aidan; Cheng, Allen C; Collins, Peter; Doola, Ra039; eesa,; Ferrie, Suzie; Marshall, Andrea P; Ridley, Emma J",Nutr Diet,412,1

The global pandemic which began in early 2020 has created a number of challenges for the medical community to contain the rate of transmission, especially to health care workers. A minority of the infected population will progress toward severe respiratory distress ultimately requiring mechanical ventilator assistance. Although preliminary data suggest a poor prognosis for those requiring ventilation support, there is a subgroup who will eventually be weaned off. As the pandemic evolves, this cohort of infected, chronically intubated and ventilated individuals will become more prevalent and may require tracheostomy to aid in recovery. Unfortunately, tracheostomy is an aerosol-generating procedure which poses high risks to all members within the operating room, as described by previous authors. There is an urgent need to explore and develop methods to maximize the safety of tracheostomy and other aerosol-generating procedures in order to reduce intraoperative transmission. In the present article, we present a modified technique for negative pressure enclosure in patients with COVID-19 who underwent tracheostomy.","Levy, Dylan A; Boey, Howard P; Leff, Peter D",Ear Nose Throat J,412,21

The purpose of our study was to identify differences in the clinical characteristics and the in-hospital mortality of patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 internationally. METHODS: A comprehensive search of all published literature on adult patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 that reported on the clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality was performed. Groups were compared using a Chi-square test with Yates correction of continuity. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: After screening 516 studies across the globe, 43 studies from 12 countries were included in our final analysis. Patients with COVID-19 in America and Europe were older compared to their Asian counterparts. Europe had the highest percentage of male patients. American and European patients had a higher incidence of co-morbid conditions (p < 0.05 for all variables). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in America (22.23%) and Europe (22.9%) compared to Asia (12.65%) (p < 0.0001), but no difference was seen when compared with each other (p = 0.49). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant variation in the clinical characteristics in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 across the globe. In-hospital mortality is similar between America and Europe, but considerably higher than Asia.","Goel, Sunny; Jain, Tarun; Hooda, Amit; Malhotra, Rohit; Johal, Gurpreet; Masoomi, Reza; Kamran, Haroon; Krishnamoorthy, Parasuram Melarcode; Senguttuvan, Nagendra Boopathy; Sharma, Abhishek; Gidwani, Umesh",Cardiol Ther,412,25

To answer this, we first survey the existing conceptual and empirical study of the poverty-inequality-growth relationship through the analysis of various forms of economic growth with adjectives, i e kinds of growth specified through attached adjectives including pro-poor growth, inclusive growth, and shared growth We also revisit older discussions on redistribution with growth and growth with equity We present a typology of growth episodes based on the associated changes in poverty and inequality Second, we empirically re-examine all growth episodes in the developing world since 1980 and categorise them according to our typology Third, we discuss the implications for when global poverty would be ended and what levels of inequality could exist in 2030 if each type of growth episode was replicated The contribution of our paper is a typology of growth episodes based on poverty and inequality patterns;the application of said typology to the empirical relationship between poverty, inequality, and growth historically;and the provision of a new set of projections for the end of global poverty based on differing types of growth We conclude that in the aftermath of the pandemic, countries will need to pursue historically unprecedented growth paths in order to achieve the poverty and inequality Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 COVID-19 (Disease)","Hoy, Christopher Sumner Andy Center for Global Development https www cgdev org",,412,18

Current state-of-the-art models for this task assume that all documents are of the same type (e.g. news articles) or fall under the same theme. However, it is also desirable to perform CDCR across different domains (type or theme). A particular use case we focus on in this paper is the resolution of entities mentioned across scientific work and newspaper articles that discuss them. Identifying the same entities and corresponding concepts in both scientific articles and news can help scientists understand how their work is represented in mainstream media. We propose a new task and English language dataset for cross-document cross-domain co-reference resolution (CD$^2$CR). The task aims to identify links between entities across heterogeneous document types. We show that in this cross-domain, cross-document setting, existing CDCR models do not perform well and we provide a baseline model that outperforms current state-of-the-art CDCR models on CD$^2$CR.

These changes are particularly relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (OHNS) residents because reports suggest an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 for otolaryngologists. The objectives of this study were to evaluate OHNS residency program practice changes and characterize resident perceptions during the initial phase of the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey of U.S. OHNS residents at 81 programs was conducted between March 23, 2020, and March 29, 2020. RESULTS: Eighty-two residents from 51 institutions (63% of invited programs) responded. At the time of survey, 98% of programs had enacted policy changes to minimize COVID-19 spread. These included filtered respirator use for aerosol-generating procedures even in COVID-19-negative patients (85%), decreased resident staffing of surgeries (70%), and reduced frequency of tracheotomy care (61%). The majority of residents (66%) perceived that residents were at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to attendings. Residents were most concerned about protective equipment shortage (93%) and transmitting COVID-19 to patients (90%). The majority of residents (73%) were satisfied with their department's COVID-19 response. Resident satisfaction correlated with comfort level in discussing concerns with attendings (r = 0.72, P < .00001) and inversely correlated with perceptions of increased risk compared to attendings (r = -0.52, P < .00001). CONCLUSION: U.S. OHNS residency programs implemented policy changes quickly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources of resident anxieties demonstrate the importance of open communication and an integrated team approach to facilitate optimal patient and provider care during this unprecedented crisis.

METHODS: A multicentre-retrospective-case-series study of COVID-19 patients, aged &#8805;65 years, hospitalised between March 1 and June 15, 2020. Patients were classified at admission into 3 groups based on their Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score: 1-3 (group A), 4-6 (group B) and 7-9 (group C). RESULTS: Of the 206 patients in the study, 60 (29%) were assigned to group A, 60 (29%) to B and 86 (42%) to C. Significantly more frequent in group C than in B or A were: mental confusion (respectively 65%, 33%, 7%; P < 0.001), kidney failure (39%, 22%, 20%; P = 0.019), dehydration syndrome (55%, 27%, 13%; P < 0.001), electrolyte imbalance (54%, 32%, 25%; P = 0.001), and diabetic decompensation (22%, 12%, 7%; P = 0.026).

The total of 356 responders included 293 responders from clinical medicine and 63 respondents from nonclinical medicine majors (i.e., 21 from preventive medicine, 13 from stomatology, and 29 from traditional Chinese medicine). The survey results showed that several aspects of online anatomy education were quite similar in clinical and nonclinical majors' classes, including theoretical and practical sessions, active learning, assessments and evaluations. However, there were statistically significant differences in class size, implementation of active learning activities prior to the pandemic, and the evaluation of the effectiveness of online learning during the pandemic, between clinical and nonclinical medicine majors. These results indicated that, compared with teachers of anatomy courses in clinical medicine, teachers of nonclinical medicine majors using online learning in medical schools in China had relatively poor preparation for online learning in response to the unforeseen pandemic.","Yan, Yu; Cheng, Xin; Zhou, Changman; Yang, Xuesong; Li, Yun-Qing",Med Educ Online,412,14

Social distancing measures changed this. The Cleveland Clinic Internal Medicine Residency Programme (IMRP) is one of the largest programmes in the USA, which made the task of implementing a telemedicine curriculum more complex. Here we describe our experience implementing an effective, expedited telemedicine curriculum for our ambulatory resident clinics. This study was started in April 2020 when we implemented a resident-led curriculum and training programme for providing ambulatory telemedicine care. The curriculum was finalised in less than 5 weeks. It entailed introducing a formal training programme for residents, creating a resource guide for different video communication tools and training preceptors to safely supervise care in this new paradigm. Residents were surveyed before the curriculum to assess prior experience with telemedicine, and then afterward to assess the curriculum's effectiveness. We also created a mini-CEX assessment for residents to solicit feedback on their performance during virtual appointments. Over 2000 virtual visits were performed by residents in a span of 10 weeks. Of 148 residents, 38% responded to the pre-participation survey. A majority had no prior telemedicine experience and expressed only slight comfort with the modality. Through collaboration with experienced residents and faculty, we expeditiously deployed an enhancement to our ambulatory care curriculum to teach residents how to provide virtual care and help faculty with supervision. We share our insights on this experience for other residency programmes to use.","Savage, David J; Gutierrez, Omar; Montané, Bryce Edward; Singh, Achintya Dinesh; Yudelevich, Eric; Mahar, Jamal; Brateanu, Andrei; Khatri, Lakshmi; Fleisher, Catherine; Jolly, Stacey E",Postgrad. med. j,412,1

Standing stock surveys were conducted in 14 streets and 21 beaches while 157 transects were surveyed for floating litter. COVID-19 related items contributed up to 16.5% of the total litter encountered along the streets. The urban beaches (Mkomani and Nyali) had the highest quantities of COVID-19 related items (55.1% and 2.6% respectively) attributable to the ability to purchase single-use products and lifestyle. Most of the recreational beaches had no COVID-19 related products which could be attributed to the presidential directive on beach closure as a COVID-19 contingency measure. No COVID-19 related litter was found in the floating litter. Generally, beach closure and cessation of movement reduced the amount of litter that leaked to the marine environment.","Okuku, Eric; Kiteresi, Linet; Owato, Gilbert; Otieno, Kenneth; Mwalugha, Catherine; Mbuche, Mary; Gwada, Brenda; Nelson, Annette; Chepkemboi, Purity; Achieng, Quinter; Wanjeri, Veronica; Ndwiga, Joey; Mulupi, Lilian; Omire, Jill",Mar Pollut Bull,412,1

Since CPV-2 first emerged in the late 1970s, its rapid evolution has resulted in three antigenic variants: CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. Here, we report, for the first time in Korea, two cases of CPV-2c infection in two dogs with severe diarrhoea. The complete open reading frame (4,269nt) of CPV-2, encoding both non-structural (NS) and structural (VP) proteins, was sequenced. Based on the amino acid Gln present at residue 426 of the VP2 gene, these strains were typed as CPV-2c, and were named Korea CPV-2c_1 and Korea CPV-2c_2. These strains shared 99.48% reciprocal nucleotide sequence identity and had the highest nucleotide identity (99.77%-99.34%) with Asian CPV strains isolated in China, Italy (found in a dog imported from Thailand), and Vietnam from 2013 to 2017. Phylogenetic analysis based on the non-structural (NS1) and capsid (VP2) genes revealed that Korean CPV-2c strains clustered closely to Asian CPV strains, and separately from strains isolated in Europe, South America and North America. Amino acid changes never reported before were observed in NS1 (Thr70Pro, Cys287Tyr), VP1 (Lys17Arg, Phe33Leu) and VP2 (Gln365His, Ala516Val). Additional observed mutations, including Phe267Tyr, Tyr324Ile and Gln370Arg, have been previously reported in the recent CPV-2c strains with Asian origins. These results suggest that the Korean CPV-2c strains were potentially introduced via neighbouring Asian countries.","Moon, Bo-Youn; Jang, Jiung; Kim, Seong-Hee; Kim, Yeon-Hee; Lee, Hyun-Kyoung; So, ByungJae; Park, Choi-Kyu; Lee, Kyoung-Ki",Transbound Emerg Dis,412,16

Although the symptoms remain mild in most patients, the elderly and patients with previous comorbidities have higher rates of morbidity and mortality. Patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after decompensation, may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to systemic immune dysfunction. CASE REPORT The patient was a 51-year-old man who was hypertensive, an ex-alcoholic abstinent for 6 months, and a smoker. He was diagnosed with alcoholic liver cirrhosis in July 2019, and was using norfloxacin at home for secondary prophylaxis of bacterial peritonitis. He was also using furosemide and spironolactone to control ascites and propranolol for primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices. The patient entered our hospital in July 2020 with cough, dyspnea, runny nose, diarrhea, and fever. During hospitalization, we confirmed infection by COVID-19 and secondary nosocomial pulmonary infection. Chest tomography compatible with ground-glass standard was performed. The patient developed the need for auxiliary oxygen but without invasive mechanical ventilation. The patient received dexamethasone 6 mg/day and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (he was started on cefepime but switched to meropenem). At the end of the 14-day isolation period, he was discharged with improved respiratory status. CONCLUSIONS Despite high mortality rates in patients with advanced cirrhosis who become infected with COVID-19, we report a case with a favorable outcome. Success has been achieved with the use of medications in studies of broad-spectrum antibiotics and the rapid detection of complications caused by the virus. Further studies in SARS-CoV-2 patients with chronic liver disease are needed.","Beraldo, Rodrigo Fedatto; Marcondes, Mariana Barros; Dos Santos, Maria Natália Marques; Grillo, Thais Gagno; Pires, Gabriel Barros Tambelli; de Oliveira, Cássio Vieira",Am J Case Rep,412,20

METHODS: A randomized, cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the side effects of the BNT162b2 vaccine using an independent online questionnaire gathering responses from healthcare workers (HCWs) with detailed review of organ systems. RESULTS: Of all HCWs, 87.98% (1245/1415) completed the survey. Of them, 64.5% (803/1245) received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and reported at least one or more symptoms (classified based on organ systems and occurrence rate) post vaccination. Of these, 640/803 (79.7%) were able to continue activities of daily living (ADL), 103/803 (12.83%) had trouble temporarily to perform ADL, 99/803 (12.33%) took time off work temporarily, 20/803 (2.49%) required help from an outpatient provider, 5/803 (0.62%) required help from an emergency department and 2/803 (0.25%) required hospitalization. Despite this, 97.61% intended to have the second dose and 92.9% had already received it. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly reported symptoms (occurrence in descending order) were soreness, fatigue, myalgia, headache, chills, fever, joint pain, nausea, muscle spasm, sweating, dizziness, flushing, feelings of relief, brain fogging, anorexia, localized swelling, decreased sleep quality, itching, tingling, diarrhoea, nasal stuffiness and palpitations. Despite this, remarkable acceptance for the second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine was found among HCWs.","Kadali, Renuka A K; Janagama, Ravali; Peruru, Sharanya; Malayala, Srikrishna V",Int J Infect Dis,412,22

It is well known that DNNs are capable of analyzing complex data; however, they lack transparency in their decision making, in the sense that it is not straightforward to justify their prediction, or to visualize the features on which the decision was based. Moreover, they generally require large amounts of data in order to learn and become able to adapt to different environments. This makes their use difficult in healthcare, where trust and personalization are key issues. Transparency combined with high prediction accuracy are the targeted goals of the proposed approach. It includes both supervised DNN training and unsupervised learning of latent variables extracted from the trained DNNs. Domain Adaptation from multiple sources is also presented as an extension, where the extracted latent variable representations are used to generate predictions in other, non-annotated, environments. Successful application is illustrated through a large experimental study in various fields: prediction of Parkinson's disease from MRI and DaTScans; prediction of COVID-19 and pneumonia from CT scans and X-rays; optical character verification in retail food packaging.","Kollias, D.; Bouas, N.; Vlaxos, Y.; Brillakis, V.; Seferis, M.; Kollia, I.; Sukissian, L.; Wingate, J.; Kollias, S.",,412,16

This study provides a super learner ensemble of models for predicting COVID-19 severity among these patients. Method: The Cerner Real-World Database was used for this study. Data on adult patients (18 years or older) with cardiovascular and related circulatory diseases between 2017 and 2019 were retrieved and a total of 13 these conditions were identified. Among these patients, 33,042 admitted with positive diagnoses for COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020 (from 59 hospitals) were identified and selected for this study. A total of 14 statistical and machine learning models were developed and combined into a single more powerful super learning model for predicting COVID-19 severity on admission to the hospital. Result: LASSO regression, a full extreme gradient boosting model with tree depth of 2, and a full logistic regression model were the most predictive with cross-validated AUROCs of 0.7964, 0.7961, and 0.7958 respectively. The resulting super learner ensemble model had a cross validated AUROC of 0.8006 (range: 0.7814, 0.8163). The unbiased AUROC of the super learner model on an independent test set was 0.8057 (95% CI: 0.7954, 0.8159). Conclusion: Highly predictive models can be built to predict COVID-19 severity of patients with cardiovascular and other circulatory conditions.

Likewise, the fact is that the UN’s efforts to address climate change over the last 28 years have not been successful enough. It is evident that the global average temperature is on the rise (1.1 °C above pre-industrial levels in 2019). A particular concern comes from the fact that the Paris Agreement on keeping increases in the global average temperature to below +2 °C is an unenforceable ambition, since the focus is more on consequences than causes. In addition, economic policies regarding global taxes, as well as adaptation and mitigation measures, are questionable, as there is no evidence that changes in the climate system will proceed at the same rate in the coming years. This paper proposes an engineering approach that considers all relevant aspects of the climate change problem and proposes a new policy, named the “Climate New Deal”. It deals with: (i) Reorientation from a high-carbon economy to a green economy;(ii) The intensive use of radically new technology, e.g., “Seawater Steam Engine” technology for the simultaneous production of thermal and electric energy and drinking water;and (iii) The intensive use of energy efficient technologies and RES technologies, especially in transport.","Glasnovic, Zvonimir Margeta Karmen Logar Nataša Zabukovec",Energies,412,16

METHODS: We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. RESULTS: Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0). CONCLUSIONS: We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of &#8805;80% sensitivity and &#8805;97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures.

As healthcare workers (HCWs) fight impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on front lines, we must create safe work environments through comprehensive risk assessments, evaluation and effective implementation of counter-measures. We ask: 'What does current literature report on health risks at workplaces regarding COVID-19?' and 'What do current studies report on the effectiveness of enacted preventative recommendations?' METHODS: As a snapshot of early HCW research, on 26 April 2020, we conducted a rapid systematic literature search in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycInfo) for COVID-19-related health outcomes and preventive measures in healthcare-associated workplaces. RESULTS: 27 studies were identified as relevant for exploring the risk of infection, 11 studies evaluated preventive measures. The studies described that SARS-CoV-2 impacts significantly on HCW's health and well-being, not only through infections (n=6), but also from a mental health perspective (n=16). 4 studies reported indirect risks such as skin injuries, one study described headaches to result from the use of personal protective equipment. Few studies provided information on the effectiveness of prevention strategies. Overall, most studies on health risks as well as on the effectiveness of preventive measures were of a moderate-to-low quality; this was mainly due to limitations in study design, imprecise exposure and outcome assessments. CONCLUSIONS: Due to widespread exposure of HCW to SARS-CoV-2, workplaces in healthcare must be as safe as possible. Information from HCW can provide valuable insights into how infections spread, into direct and indirect health effects and into how effectively counter-measures mitigate adverse health outcomes. However, available research disallows to judge which counter-measure(s) of a current 'mix' should be prioritised for HCW. To arrive at evidence-based cost-effective prevention strategies, more well-conceived studies on the effectiveness of counter-measures are needed.","Gross, J Valérie; Mohren, Judith; Erren, Thomas C",BMJ Open,412,33

OBJECTIVES: To describe the characteristics, outcomes, and potential associations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 58 consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Laniado Hospital, Israel, between 14 March 2020 and 14 May 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on admission were collected and analyzed, and the association to subsequent respiratory failure was assessed. RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 70.7 ± 16.9 years (53% males, 47% females.); 74% had at least one co-morbidity. Most patients were of Jewish Ashkenazi descent. During hospitalization 15 patients (mean age 78.18 ± 10.35 years); 80% male, 73% Sephardi descent developed respiratory failure rates of 60% occurring on average 10.6 days following intubation. Laboratory tests at admission displayed a significant increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatine kinase (CK) and a decrease in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in patients who eventually developed respiratory failure (163.97 mg/L, 340.87 IU/L, 0.886 K/µl vs. 50.01 mg/L and 123.56 IU/L, 1.28 K/µl, respectively). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed an integrated parameter of CRP, CK, and ALC highly correlated with respiratory failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve revealed the area under the curve of CRP, CK, and ALC and the integrated parameter to be 0.910, 0.784, and 0.754, respectively. CRP was the strongest predictor to correlate with respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: CRP, CK, and ALC levels on admission could possibly be used to detect high-risk patients prone to develop respiratory failure.","Elhadad, Dana; Bronstein, Yotam; Yana, Moshe; Baris, Harel; Levinger, Uriel; Shapiro, Maurice; Sharon, Nechama",Isr Med Assoc J,412,1

One reason is a lack of trust among the users that leads to social isolation, although a coworking space should increase knowledge and idea exchange. As most people in coworking spaces use information and communication technologies (ICT) for their collaboration with their clients or employers, we examined if and how ICT can be used to support the positive effects and dynamics of coworking spaces. For this, we conducted eight interviews with freelancers and entrepreneurs who have already worked in coworking spaces in order to identify requirements for a complementary virtual coworking platform.

Currently, effective treatment options remain very limited for this disease; therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new anti-COVID-19 agents. In this study, we screened over 6,000 compounds that included approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials, and pharmacologically active compounds to identify leads that target the SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PLpro). Together with main protease (Mpro), PLpro is responsible for processing the viral replicase polyprotein into functional units. Therefore, it is an attractive target for antiviral drug development. Here we discovered four compounds, YM155, cryptotanshinone, tanshinone I and GRL0617 that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with IC50 values ranging from 1.39 to 5.63 µmol/L. These compounds also exhibit strong antiviral activities in cell-based assays. YM155, an anticancer drug candidate in clinical trials, has the most potent antiviral activity with an EC50 value of 170 nmol/L. In addition, we have determined the crystal structures of this enzyme and its complex with YM155, revealing a unique binding mode. YM155 simultaneously targets three ""hot"" spots on PLpro, including the substrate-binding pocket, the interferon stimulating gene product 15 (ISG15) binding site and zinc finger motif. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this screening and repurposing strategy, which has led to the discovery of new drug leads with clinical potential for COVID-19 treatments.","Zhao, Yao; Du, Xiaoyu; Duan, Yinkai; Pan, Xiaoyan; Sun, Yifang; You, Tian; Han, Lin; Jin, Zhenming; Shang, Weijuan; Yu, Jing; Guo, Hangtian; Liu, Qianying; Wu, Yan; Peng, Chao; Wang, Jun; Zhu, Chenghao; Yang, Xiuna; Yang, Kailin; Lei, Ying; Guddat, Luke W; Xu, Wenqing; Xiao, Gengfu; Sun, Lei; Zhang, Leike; Rao, Zihe; Yang, Haitao",Protein Cell (Online),412,16

In fact, based on comparisons in terms of specific enthalpy, a domain of indoor comfort conditions between 50 and 60 kJ/kg is found to comply with this objective, and an easy-to-use relationship for setting viable pairs of humidity and temperature using a proper HVAC plant is proposed. If confirmed via further investigations on this research path, these findings could open interesting scenarios on the use of indoor spaces during the pandemic.","Spena, Angelo; Palombi, Leonardo; Corcione, Massimo; Carestia, Mariachiara; Spena, Vincenzo Andrea",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),412,24

The study was performed within the EPICOVID19 web-based Italian survey, involving adults from April-June 2020. Out of 207,341 respondents, 95.9% completed the questionnaire (60% women with an average age of 47.3 vs. 48.9 years among men). The association between fear and demographic and SES characteristics, contacts with COVID-19 cases, nasopharyngeal swab, self-perceived health, flu vaccination, chronic diseases and specific symptoms was analyzed by logistic regression model; odds ratios adjusted for sex, age, education and occupation were calculated (aORs). Fear for FMs prevailed over fear for oneself and was higher among women than men. Fear for oneself decreased with higher levels of education and in those who perceived good health. Among those vaccinated for the flu, 40.8% responded they had feelings of fear for themselves vs. 34.2% of the not vaccinated. Fear increased when diseases were declared and it was higher when associated with symptoms such as chest pain, olfactory/taste disorders, heart palpitations (aORs > 1.5), lung or kidney diseases, hypertension, depression and/or anxiety. Trends in fear by region showed the highest percentage of positive responses in the southern regions.

With the immediate need for remote care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many health care systems have rapidly incorporated digital technologies to support the delivery of remote care options, including medication treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). In responding to the opioid crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials and scientific communities strongly support and advocate for greater use of TM-based medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to improve access to care and have suggested that broad use of TM during the pandemic should be sustained. Nevertheless, research on the implementation and effectiveness of TM-based MOUD has been limited. To address this knowledge gap, the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) funded (via the NIH HEAL Initiative) a study on Rural Expansion of Medication Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (Rural MOUD; CTN-0102) to investigate the implementation and effectiveness of adding TM-based MOUD to rural primary care for expanding access to MOUD. In preparation for this large-scale, randomized controlled trial incorporating TM in rural primary care, a feasibility study is being conducted to develop and pilot test implementation procedures. In this commentary, we share some of our experiences, which include several challenges, during the initial two-month period of the feasibility study phase. While these challenges could be due, at least in part, to adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic and new workflows to accommodate the study, they are notable and could have a substantial impact on the larger, planned pragmatic trial and on TM-based MOUD more broadly. Challenges include low rates of identification of risk for OUD from screening, low rates of referral to TM, digital device and internet access issues, workflow and capacity barriers, and insurance coverage. These challenges also highlight the lack of empirical guidance for best TM practice and quality remote care models. With TM expanding rapidly, understanding implementation and demonstrating what TM approaches are effective are critical for ensuring the best care for persons with OUD.","Hser, Yih-Ing; Ober, Allison J; Dopp, Alex R; Lin, Chunqing; Osterhage, Katie P; Clingan, Sarah E; Mooney, Larissa J; Curtis, Megan E; Marsch, Lisa A; McLeman, Bethany; Hichborn, Emily; Lester, Laurie S; Baldwin, Laura-Mae; Liu, Yanping; Jacobs, Petra; Saxon, Andrew J",Addict Sci Clin Pract,412,6

We describe COVID-19 infection control measures implemented and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the Emory Dialysis facilities. METHODS: Implementation of COVID-19 infection procedures commenced in February 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 preparedness assessments were conducted at each facility. Patients with COVID-19 from March 1-May 31, 2020 were included; with a follow-up period spanning March-June 30, 2020. Percentages of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated, and characteristics of COVID-19 patients were summarized as medians or percentage. Baseline characteristics of all patients receiving care at Emory Dialysis (i.e. Emory general dialysis population) were presented as medians and percentages. RESULTS: Of 751 dialysis patients, 23 (3.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age was 67.0 years and 13 patients (56.6%) were female. Eleven patients (47.8%) were residents of nursing homes. Nineteen patients (82.6%) required hospitalization and 6 patients (26.1%) died; the average number of days from a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) test to death was 16.8 days (range 1-34). Two patients dialyzing at adjacent dialysis stations and a dialysis staff who cared for them, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in a time frame that may suggest transmission in the dialysis facility. In response, universal masking in the facility was implemented (prior to national guidelines recommending universal masking), infection control audits and re-trainings of PPE were also done to bolster infection control practices. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented recommended COVID-19 infection control measures aimed at mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients with COVID-19 required hospitalizations. Dialysis facilities should remain vigilant and monitor for possible transmission of COVID-19 in the facility.","Apata, Ibironke W; Cobb, Jason; Navarrete, Jose; Burkart, John; Plantinga, Laura; Lea, Janice P",BMC Nephrol,412,20

The results show that visualizations improved the perceived safety and efficiency of the task and led to participants being more comfortable with the robot within their personal spaces. Furthermore, visualizing the motion intent in addition to the robot model was found to be more effective than visualizing the robot model alone.

This study aimed to synthesize the findings of empirical studies reporting the post-traumatic stress symptoms in the general population during the coronavirus pandemic. Whittemore and Knafl's (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 546, 2005) integrative review methodology was used to analyse and synthesize the peer-reviewed studies. Five electronic databases, PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Cochrane and Google Scholar were searched using terms related to the coronavirus pandemic and post-traumatic stress symptoms. The quality of the studies was screened and evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The sample size of the 16 studies included in this review ranged from 41 to 3480 participants, with a total of 18 039 participants. The majority of the participants' ages ranged from 30 to 39 years, and 57% of the participants were female. The following factors related to post-traumatic stress symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic were identified as follows: (i) risk factors included social discrimination, fear of uncontrolled contagion and financial burden or economic instability; and, (ii) protective factors included social support and timely government action. A traumatic experience itself can trigger the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder; however, depending on the risk and protection factors, each individual can experience different post-traumatic stress symptoms. Thus, mental health nurses should comprehensively understand how to reduce the influence of risk factors and enhance protective factors when dealing with the pandemic and related trauma. This study's findings are beneficial for identifying, preventing and managing post-traumatic stress symptoms associated with the coronavirus and future pandemics.","Hong, Soyun; Kim, Heejung; Park, Min Kyung",Int. j. ment. health nurs,412,28

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a potent antioxidant and reduces oxidative stress and inhibits activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB). ALA reduces ADAM17 activity and ACE2 upregulation. ALA is known to have antiviral effects against some viruses. ALA may show antiviral effect by reducing NF-kB activation and alleviating redox reactions. ALA increases the intracellular glutathione strengthens the human host defense. ALA activates ATP dependent K+ channels (Na+, K+-ATPase). Increased K+ in the cell raises the intracellular pH. As the intracellular pH increases, the entry of the virus into the cell decreases. ALA can increase human host defense against SARS-CoV-2 by increasing intracellular pH. ALA treatment increases antioxidant levels and reduces oxidative stress. Thus, ALA may strengthen the human host defense against SARS-CoV-2 and can play a vital role in the treatment of patients with critically ill COVID-19. It can prevent cell damage by decreasing lactate production in patients with COVID-19. Using ALA with insulin in patients with diabetes can show a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2.

The snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants. We used exploratory factor analysis to test the construct validity of the questionnaire measuring the perceived efficiency of involving community service workers in health care-related activities and Tobit models to examine its associated factors. The results showed the importance of local organizations in epidemic preparedness and response at grassroots levels, with scores ranging from 6.4 to 7.1, in which the Vietnam Youth Federation played the most important role (mean = 7.1, SD = 2.2). Of note, community service workers were viewed as performing well in health communication and education at agencies, schools, and other localities. Medical students perceived higher efficiency of involving community service workers in health care-related activities at grassroots levels as compared to health workers.

However, with the spread of the epidemic, traditional diagnostic methods have been unable to meet the requirements of efficiency and speed. Therefore, it is necessary to use artificial intelligence to help people make efficient and accurate judgments. A number of studies have shown that it is feasible to use deep learning methods to help people diagnose COVID-19. However, most of the existing methods are single-layer neural network structures, and their accuracy and efficiency need to be improved. Method In this scheme, a hybrid model is adopted. Firstly, the gray co-occurrence matrix is used to extract the features of the images, and then the extreme learning machine is used for classification.

The trade-off between pool size and test sensitivity is stated explicitly. The procedure was designed to ensure that samples that would be detectable in individual testing remain detectable in pool testing. The proposed relaxation in cut-off is dependent on the pool size, allowing a relatively tight correction to avoid loss of detection of positive samples. The methodology was evaluated in a study of pool testing of adults attending a public emergency care unit, reference for COVID-19 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and presenting flu-like symptoms. Even samples on the edge of detectability in individual testing were detected correctly. The proposed procedure enhances the consistency of RT-qPCR pool testing by enforcing that the scales of detectability in pool processing and in individual sample processing are compatible.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 357 mothers and their infants <12 months who had confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Subjects came from an anonymous worldwide online survey between May 4 and September 30, 2020, who were recruited through social media, support groups, and health care providers. Using multivariable logistic regression, Fisher's exact test, and summary statistics, we assessed the association of skin-to-skin care, feeding, and rooming-in with SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, breastfeeding outcomes, and maternal distress. Results: Responses came from 31 countries. Among SARS-CoV-2+ mothers whose infection was &#8804;3 days of birth, 7.4% of their infants tested positive. We found a nonsignificant decrease in risk of hospitalization among neonates who roomed-in, directly breastfed, or experienced uninterrupted skin-to-skin care (p > 0.2 for each). Infants who did not directly breastfeed, experience skin-to-skin care, or who did not room-in within arms' reach, were significantly less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the first 3 months, adjusting for maternal symptoms (p &#8804; 0.02 for each).

METHODS: In this retrospective archive study, pediatric patients who were followed up in the hospital with a possible or definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 and who had chest CT at presentation were included. CT scan images of the patients were reinterpreted by a pediatric radiologist and compared with their RT-PCR test results. RESULTS: Of the total of 89 patients, 33 had negative and 56 had positive RT-PCR tests. The presence of pulmonary lesions and consolidation was statistically significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group than in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.037 and 0.001, respectively). Lobe involvement of 0%-25% was higher in the RT-PCR positive group (p = 0.001), and lobe involvements of 25%-50% and 50%-75% were significantly higher in the RT-PCR negative group (p = 0.001 and 0.005, respectively).

Acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major cause of death in influenza virus infected patients. Recent studies indicated that active glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) encoded by glucagon (GCG) gene exerts anti-inflammatory functions. The aim of this study was to determine the potential role of active GLP-1 in H9N2 influenza virus-induced ALI/ARDS in mice. First, we uncovered that GCG mRNA expression levels and GCG precursor protein levels were significantly increased, but total GLP-1 and active GLP-1 levels were decreased in the lungs of H9N2-infected mice. Next, liraglutide, an active GLP-1 analogue, was used to treat infected mice and to observe its effects on H9N2 virus-induced ALI. Liraglutide treatment ameliorated the declined body weight, decreased food intake and mortality observed in infected mice. It also alleviated the severity of lung injury, including lowering lung index, decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration and lowing total protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). In addition, liraglutide did not influence viral titers in infected lungs, but decreased the levels of interleukin-1ß, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; in BALF. These results indicated that liraglutide alleviated H9N2 virus-induced ALI in mice most likely due to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines.","Bai, Yu; Lian, Pengjing; Li, Jingyun; Zhang, Zihui; Qiao, Jian",Microb Pathog,412,24

Five students who learned bahasa Indonesia for foreigners were recruited for this narrative research. They were from Thailand, Vietnam, Yemen, Sierra Leone, and Japan. Narrative data were collected through in-depth interviews and then analyzed using language appraisal and emotional geography theories. Findings showed that the forced remote learning affected students' emotional conditions, such as sadness, disappointment, anxiety, and resignation which contradicted their expectations. This empirical evidence suggests a change in remote learning management by integrating a sound instructional design to create autonomous learning.Alternate abstract:Penelitian ini menjelaskan narasi pengalaman pembelajaran jarak jauh (PJJ) mahasiswa bahasa Indonesia bagi Penutur Asing (BIPA) pada masa darurat pandemi COVID-19.

Accessibility of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has been limited by intermittent shortages of supplies required for testing, including flocked nasopharyngeal (FLNP) swabs. METHODS: We developed a 3D-printed nasopharyngeal (3DP) swab as a replacement of the FLNP swab. The performance of 3DP and FLNP swabs were compared in a clinical trial of symptomatic patients at three clinical sites (n=291) using three SARS-CoV-2 EUA tests: a modified version of the CDC Real-time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel and two commercial automated formats, Roche Cobas and NeuMoDx. RESULTS: The cycle threshold (C(t)) values from the gene targets and the RNase P gene control in the CDC assay showed no significant differences between swabs for both gene targets (p=0.152 and p=0.092), with the RNase P target performing significantly better in the 3DP swabs (p & 0.001). The C(t) values showed no significant differences between swabs for both viral gene targets in the Roche cobas assay (p=0.05 and p=0.05) as well as the NeuMoDx assay (p=0.401 and p=0.484). The overall clinical correlation of COVID-19 diagnosis between all methods was 95.88% (Kappa 0.901). CONCLUSIONS: 3DP swabs were equivalent to standard FLNP in three testing platforms for SARS-CoV-2. Given the need for widespread testing, 3DP swabs printed on-site are an alternate to FLNP that can rapidly scale in response to acute needs when supply chain disruptions affect availability of collection kits.","Decker, Summer J; Goldstein, Todd A; Ford, Jonathan M; Teng, Michael N; Pugliese, Robert S; Berry, Gregory J; Pettengill, Matthew; Silbert, Suzane; Hazelton, Todd R; Wilson, Jason W; Shine, Kristy; Wang, Zi-Xuan; Hutchinson, Morgan; Castagnaro, Joseph; Bloom, Ona E; Breining, Dwayne A; Goldsmith, Barbara M; Sinnott, John T; O039,; Donnell, Donna Gentile; Crawford, James M; Lockwood, Charles J; Kim, Kami",Clin. infect. dis,412,16

Serologically, Lm can be classified into 13 serotypes, though only four are typically linked with food contamination and illness. Since 2000, a shift in serotypes involved in listeriosis outbreaks was observed, suggesting that tracking of serotypes could help identify emerging trends. A PCR method developed in 2004 allowed detection of the four major serotypes as molecular serogroups, corresponding to broad phylogenetic groups. In this study, a novel qPCR method was developed that uses two multiplex qPCRs, one to confirm the Listeria genus and Lm species, and the second for Lm molecular serogrouping. This method was compared with the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) method for Lm and the sero-agglutination method, using a 208-strain panel. Comparison of the genus/species qPCR assay with the BAM methods found an equal or slightly higher accuracy for the qPCR method (>98%), as compared to the BAM protocol (>96%), when evaluated against independent characterization data. Molecular serogrouping using the qPCR method (96.6%) was more accurate than the sero-agglutination assay (75.6%). The qPCR method identified Lm 4bV strains, which could not be resolved using sero-agglutination. The qPCR could not identify lineages III and IV serotype 4b strains but did correctly identify 16 of 18 lineage III/IV strains. The qPCR method performed genus identification for Lm, L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. ivanovii, and L. seeligeri. Additionally, the method performed species identification for Lm, and serogrouped Lm into six molecular serogroups, 2A, 2B, 2C, 4B, NT, and 4bV. This method provided a rapid and accurate confirmation of Lm and serogroup determinations; furthermore, it could help identify otherwise unlinked strains by enabling WGS analysis based on broad phylogeny, independent of other information.","Burall, Laurel S; Sepehri, Sadra; Srinivasan, Devayani; Grim, Christopher J; Lacher, David W; Ferguson, Martine; Nambiar, Rohini; Datta, Atin R",J. foof prot,412,20

Specifically, it appears that no research has employed qualitative methodologies to explore the effects of working amidst COVID-19 on mental health for HCPs in the UK. Objective: To qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to explore the experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one centred on specific challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic, such as redeployment, isolation from loved ones, infection concerns, lack of PPE and impact on patient interpersonal care. Theme two offered insights into the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs, while many experienced feelings of fear, sadness and hypervigilance, all also demonstrated a marked resilience. Finally, many felt undervalued and misunderstood, and wished to press upon the general public seriousness of the disease. Conclusion: To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort. © 2021 The Author(s).

The use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) has been recognised as a management option for severe COVID-19 (NHS, Specialty guides for patient management during the coronavirus pandemic Guidance for the role and use of non-invasive respiratory support in adult patients with coronavirus (confirmed or suspected), https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng159 ). We offered ward-based CPAP to COVID-19, dialysis patients not suitable for escalation to ICU. The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of CPAP for COVID-19 dialysis patients compared to non-dialysis COVID-19 patients outside of the intensive care setting. We further aimed to investigate factors associated with improved outcomes. METHODS: Data was collected from a single centre (Royal Preston Hospital, UK), from March to June 2020. Treatment outcomes were compared for dialysis and non-dialysis dependent patients who received CPAP with limitations on their escalation and resuscitation status. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were used to compare outcomes. The primary study outcome was 30 day mortality. Confounders including length of admission, systemic anticoagulation and ultrafiltration volumes on dialysis were also analysed. RESULTS: Over the study period, 40 dialysis patients tested positive for COVID-19, with 30 requiring hospital admission. 93% (n = 28) required supplementary oxygen and 12% (n = 9) required CPAP on the ward. These patients were compared to a serial selection of 14 non-dialysis patients treated with CPAP during the same period. Results showed a significant difference in 30 day survival rates between the two groups: 88.9% in the dialysis group vs. 21.4% in the non-dialysis group. Statistical modelling showed that anticoagulation was also an important factor and correlated with better outcomes. CONCLUSION: This is to the best of our knowledge, the largest series of COVID-19 dialysis patients treated with CPAP in a ward-based setting. In general, dialysis dependent patients have multiple co-morbidities including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus making them vulnerable to COVID-19 and not always suitable for treatment in ICU. We showed a significantly lower 30 day mortality rate with the use of CPAP in the dialysis group (11.1%) compared to the non-dialysis group (78.6%). Despite a small sample size, we believe this study provides impetus for further work clarifying the role of CPAP in treating COVID-19 dialysis dependent patients.","Floyd, Lauren; Stauss, Madelena; Storrar, Joshua; Vanalia, Parthvi; France, Anna; Dhaygude, Ajay",BMC Nephrol,412,12

The secondary objective was to develop recommendations and identify the risk factors associated with presenting potential interactions with LPV/r. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional and multicenter study with the participation of 2 hospitals. COVID-19 patients over 18 years of age, admitted to hospital and under treatment with LPV/r were included. A screening of potential interactions related to LPV/r and home and hospital medication was carried out. Lexicomp® (Uptodate), HIV-drug interactions and COVID-drug interactions were used as the query database. RESULTS: 361 patients with a mean age of 62.77 ± 14.64 years were included, where 59.6% (n = 215) were men. 62.3% (n = 225) had 1 or more potential interactions and 26, 87% (n = 97) 2 or more. The independent variables associated with presenting &#8805;1 potential interactions were age (> 65) (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.06-3.59, P =.033), ICU admission (OR 9.22; CI 95% 1.98-42.93; P =.005), previous respiratory pathology (OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.15-7.36; P =.024), psychiatric (OR 4.14; 95 CI % 1.36-12.61; P =.013), dyslipidemia (OR 3.21; 95% CI 1.63-6.35; P =.001) and the number of drugs prescribed (OR 4.33; 95% CI 2.40-7.81; P =.000). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of potential interactions in COVD-19 patient undergoing treatment with LPV/r is high, with age (> 65), ICU admission, previous respiratory and psychiatric pathology, dyslipidemia and the number of prescribed drugs acting as risk factors.","Brandariz-Nuñez, David; Correas-Sanahuja, Marcelo; Guarc, Eva; Picón, Rafael; García, Bárbara; Gil, Rocío",Med Clin (Barc),412,1

Rapid reconfiguration was required to introduce new assays at high capacity for diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19, while maintaining existing services. AIM: The aim of this national survey was to capture Laboratory Medicine's response across the Republic of Ireland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An electronic survey developed using Microsoft Forms® was emailed on 5 October 2020 to 53 local representatives of the PeriAnalytic and Laboratory Medicine Society (PALMSoc), reaching 38 separate pathology departments in the country. RESULTS: A total of 45 responses from 38 laboratories were received (72% response rate) representing a range of departments and disciplines. Most laboratories (63%) introduced new tests, and in a time frame of less than 6 weeks (80%). Point-of-care testing (POCT) played a significant role in the response to COVID-19, with almost half of respondents (47%) reporting that additional equipment was introduced. Maintenance of the Quality Management System (QMS) proved challenging, with 60% of respondents indicating that not all aspects were sustained. When asked about changes to staff rostering, 98% of respondents reported that changes were made. All adjustments were made despite staffing challenges; only 18% of respondents described the staffing levels in their department as 100% prior to the onset of the first wave. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms an agile and resilient response to the COVID-19 pandemic from Ireland's Laboratory Medicine services despite many economic and staffing challenges.","Leonard, Ann; Murray, Brian; Prior, Anna Rose; Srinivasan, Rama; Kane, Anne; Boran, Gerard",Ir. j. med. sci,412,20

Management of patients infected with COVID-19 has led to a great risk of hospital-based transmission of infection to health-care professionals (HCPs). The HCPs at various levels in a multispecialty health-care setup are at risk of contracting the virus. Those who are involved with performing or assisting in aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) have a potentially higher risk of developing the infection. The AGPs involve a wide range of procedures such as pulmonary function testing, high-flow oxygen administration, endotracheal intubation, nebulization, application of ventilators, weaning and extubation, bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Hence, understanding the overall nature of the disease is of vital importance to develop preventive strategies to reduce transmission of the virus through aerosols. This review article intends to elucidate the port of entry associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and its spread through the AGPs. We also intend to focus on methods to prevent aerosol-related transmission of infection to HCPs by illustrating clinically practiced evidence-based protocol followed in our multispecialty health-care setup.","Kanchi, M.; Chakraborthy, M.; Joseph, A.

The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a ‘wave’ of COVID-19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; unemployment; housing and income stress; intimate partner violence; work-related trauma; and grief and loss. The ‘two-pronged’ approach used to deal with COVID-19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new-onset cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to ‘flatten the curve’ and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.","Carbone, Stephen R.",Mental Health Prev.,412,21

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a person-specific source that is used as a therapeutic adjunct for the treatment of cartilage damage because it offers a cocktail of growth factors that are necessary for wound healing and tissue regeneration. However, PRP treatments in the clinic are not satisfactory and require upgrading, especially the point of maintaining bioactivity. In this study, we presented PRP as a photo-activated and photo-crosslinkable bio-ink in terms of tissue-specific structures for the first time. We achieved long-term and constant rate growth factor release and bioactivity protection of PRP with satisfactory mechanical characteristics. Photo-crosslinked PRP hydrogel was enabled by the addition of microwave-induced methacrylated gelatin (Gel-MA), which is connected to platelets in PRP via integrin receptors in its structure and chemically cross-linked upon UV irradiation (300-500 nm). Photo-activation of PRP was realized by a polychromatic light source in the near-infrared region (PAC, 600-1200 nm). Our results showed that Gel-MA/PRP hydrogels with the desired mechanical properties (low degradation rate and high mechanical strength) released growth factors at a constant rate for the long-term by the periodic PAC application. In vitro cell culture studies (viability, proliferation, morphology, histology, immunochemistry, biochemistry, gene expression analyses) proved that proliferation and differentiation of the ATDC5 cells increased in the periodically light-applied Gel-MA/PRP hydrogel without any external chemical agents.","Irmak, Gülseren; Gümüsderelioglu, Menemse",Biomed Mater,412,16

The official US Public Health Activity estimate was recalculated using updated estimates from the data coding.Results. Although official estimates place governmental public health spending at more than $93 billion (2.5% of total spending on health), detailed examination of spending records from state governments shows that official estimates include substantial spending on individual health care services (e.g., behavioral health) and that actual spending on population-level public health activities is more likely between $35 billion and $64 billion (approximately 1.5% of total health spending).Conclusions. Clarity in understanding of public health spending is critical for characterizing its value proposition. Official estimates are likely tens of billions of dollars greater than actual spending.Public Health Implications.

Method: Adults (N = 255; range = 40-81 years) with self-reported cognitive decline underwent baseline and 2-year follow-up clinical assessment, including a brief neuropsychological screening and lumbar puncture. Five different mild cognitive impairment (MCI) algorithms were applied on baseline cognitive test results: one conventional, three amnestic (lenient, stringent, multidomain), and one comprehensive criterion. We compared predictive and diagnostic accuracy of these MCI criteria by performing logistic regression analyses and calculating diagnostic accuracy measures for 2-year outcomes of (1) clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and (2) cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in the Alzheimer's continuum. Results: The lenient amnestic MCI criterion showed the largest effect size for predicting progression to AD dementia (OR = 13.762, 99% CI = 1.969-96.194, p = .001) and AD biomarkers (OR = 4.855, 99% CI = 1.974-11.924, p < .001) after 2 years. This criterion was sensitive for progression to dementia (sensitivity = 92.0%, specificity = 54.8%, positive likelihood ratio [LR+] = 2.03, LR- = 0.15) and showed the highest overall diagnostic accuracy for AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 72.7%, specificity = 59.1%, LR+ = 1.78, negative likelihood ratio [LR-] = 0.46). The multidomain amnestic MCI criterion produced the highest specificity for dementia (sensitivity = 76.0%, specificity = 73.0%, LR+ = 2.82, LR- = 0.33) and AD biomarkers (sensitivity = 46.8% specificity = 70.9% LR+ = 1.61, LR- = 0.75). Conclusions: Defining MCI using a brief neuropsychological battery provided limited accuracy for progression to AD dementia and cerebrospinal fluid Aß. The lenient amnestic MCI criterion identified the highest number of individuals who progressed to clinical AD or showed biomarker pathology, but this approach included a substantial number of false positives.

The measures were widely believed to increase women's risk of violent victimization, most of which is by an intimate partner. We examined help-seeking during this period in a large U.S. city and used an interrupted time series analysis to assess the effects of three government interventions on domestic violence and sexual assault hotline calls and on ""911"" calls regarding domestic violence, assault, and rape. Declaration of an emergency appeared to reduce victim calls to the rape crisis hotline and the few ""911"" calls about rape. School closure was associated with a reduction in ""911"" calls about assault and rape and victim calls to the domestic violence hotline. Implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a gradual increase in domestic violence hotline calls. Although ""911"" calls regarding assault fell by nearly half, calls to police for domestic violence were unchanged. In sum, there was a decrease in help-seeking for sexual assault and assault in general but not for domestic violence during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis underscores the importance of distinguishing between the violence itself, calls to police, and calls to helplines when claims are made about changes over time in violence against women.

Because viruses frequently mutate to escape direct inhibition of viral proteins, there is interest in targeting the host proteins that the virus must co-opt to complete its replication cycle. However, a detailed understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is necessary in order to facilitate development of host-directed therapeutics. As a first step, we performed a genome-wide loss of function screen using the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E to better define the interactions between coronaviruses and host factors. We report the identification and validation of an ER-resident host protein, TMEM41B, as an essential host factor for not only HCoV-229E but also genetically distinct coronaviruses including the pandemic betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Because viruses frequently mutate to escape direct inhibition of viral proteins, there is interest in targeting the host proteins that the virus must co-opt to complete its replication cycle. However, a detailed understanding of the interactions between the virus and the host cell is necessary in order to facilitate development of host-directed therapeutics. As a first step, we performed a genome-wide loss of function screen using the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E to better define the interactions between coronaviruses and host-factors. We report the identification and validation of an ER-resident host protein, TMEM41B, as an essential host factor for not only HCoV-229E but also genetically distinct coronaviruses including the pandemic beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We show that the protein is required at an early, but post-receptor engagement, stage of the viral lifecycle. Further, mechanistic studies revealed that although the protein was not enriched at replication complexes, it likely contributes to viral replication complex formation via mobilization of cholesterol and other lipids to facilitate host membrane expansion and curvature.

The chapter outlines aspects of the highly disputed intellectual legacy of Nietzsche, especially in relation to the murderous, eugenicist policies of Nazi Germany. It then explores the notion of ‘herd immunity’ discussed in the pandemic and the apparently casual disregard for the wellbeing of vulnerable groups or the wider safety of citizens by three leaders: Boris Johnson in the UK, Donald Trump in the USA and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. These leaders’ widely noted unpreparedness for, or indifference to, the spread of the virus indicated an alarming lack of social responsibility that was thrown into dramatic relief by the quick, decisive action of other leaders, organisations and businesses. © 2020, The Author(s).","McQueen, D.; Farache, F.; Grigore, G.","Palgrave Studies in Governance, Leadership and Responsibility",412,1

Methods: The correspondence between COVID-19 and XCHD was analyzed by literature consulting. Based on network pharmacology, Cytoscape 3.6.0 and other software were then used to construct XCHD efficacy network of “Chinese medicine prescription-active ingredient-key target” for pneumonia and immune regulation, in order to confirm anti-SARS-CoV-2 active ingredients in the prescription. Some softwares were used to analyze XCHD for COVID-19 treatment in multiple aspects. Results: A total of 48 active ingredients with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect in herbs were collected; 140 active ingredients in XCHD for pneumonia treatment and immune regulation were analyzed, of which 12 ingredients had direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity including baicalein, formononetin, quercetin, etc. The active ingredients in XCHD exerted efficacy for pneumonia treatment and immunoregulation through 95 key targets such as IL-6, NOS2, and ESR1, involving multiple pathways such as the TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and influenza A. Analysis of gene co-expression and PPI interaction analysis found that ACE2 only co-expressed with NOS2 in the above targets, and also interacted with only five targets in the PPI interaction network. It is speculated that the ACE2 target only plays an important role when SARS-CoV-2 invaded the human body, and had little effect in the treatment of pneumonia after viral infection. Conclusion: The active ingredients in XCHD play a role in treating COVID-19 by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 activity, blocking the SARS-CoV-2 invasion pathway, inhibiting cytokine storm, and regulating immunity. It is worth noting that drugs designed for the ACE2 target can block virus invasion, but may not be effective for diseases such as alveolar inflammation, Therefore, this study also provides a multi-target and multi-directional space for XCHD for early COVID-19 treatment. In addition, when XCHD is used in the early treatment of COVID-19, we should pay attention to the precise use of drugs based on syndrome accurate identification, one is to avoid adverse reactions, the other is to avoid cytokine damage caused by re-crown disease.","Sun, Kai-Bin; Zhang, Xin-Yu; Liu, Jing; Sun, Rong",Chin.

An answer can help determine the susceptibility of an individual on exposure to a COVID-2019 carrier and can also provide a preliminary projection of the still-unknown infectious dose for the disease. Computational fluid mechanics enabled tracking of respiratory transport in medical imaging-based anatomic domains shows that the regional deposition of virus-laden inhaled droplets at the initial nasopharyngeal infection site peaks for the droplet size range of approximately 2.5-19 [Formula: see text]. Through integrating the numerical findings on inhaled transmission with sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and earlier measurements of ejecta size distribution generated during regular speech, this study further reveals that the number of virions that may go on to establish the SARS-CoV-2 infection in a subject could merely be in the order of hundreds.","Basu, Saikat",Sci Rep,412,16

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of adults with COVID-19 admitted to one intensive care unit, in those who underwent APP and controls. Patients in both groups had type 1 respiratory failure requiring oxygen (but not initially intubated), confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR by nasopharyngeal swab and findings of multifocal ground-glass opacities on imaging. For the APP group, serial SpO2/FiO2 measurements were recorded after each proning episode. RESULTS: Of 77 patients admitted, 50 (65%) were excluded because they had already been intubated. Another 7 (9%) had undergone APP prior to admission. Of the remaining 20, 10 underwent APP and 10 were controls. Patients in both groups had similar demographics, subsequent intubation and survival. Of those who underwent APP, SpO2/FiO2 was most likely to increase after the first episode (before median: 152, IQR 135-185; after: median 192, IQR 156-234, p=0.04). Half of participants (5) in the APP group were unable to tolerate more than two APP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care are not suitable for APP. Of those who are, many cannot tolerate more than two episodes. Improvements in SpO2/FiO2 secondary to APP are transient and most likely in the first episode. Our findings may explain why other studies have failed to show improvements in mortality from APP despite improvements in oxygenation.","Barker, Joseph; Pan, Daniel; Koeckerling, David; Baldwin, Alexander James; West, Raha",Postgrad. med. j,412,16

Here, we investigate seven deep learning architectures associated with data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to detect different pneumonia types. We also propose an image resizing method with the maximum window function that preserves anatomical structures of the chest. The results are promising, reaching an accuracy of 99.8% considering COVID-19, normal, and viral and bacterial pneumonia classes. The differentiation between viral pneumonia and COVID-19 achieved an accuracy of 99.8%, and 99.9% of accuracy between COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. We also evaluated the impact of the proposed image resizing method on classification performance comparing with the bilinear interpolation; this pre-processing increased the classification rate regardless of the deep learning architectures used. We c ompared our results with ten related works in the state-of-the-art using eight sets of experiments, which showed that the proposed method outperformed them in most cases. Therefore, we demonstrate that deep learning models trained with pre-processed X-ray images could precisely assist the specialist in COVID-19 detection.","Vieira, Pablo; Sousa, Orrana; Magalhes, Deborah; Rablo, Ricardo; Silva, Romuere",Pattern Recognit,412,1

CFR is an epidemiological measure of severity which can affect policymaking and public health responses to the disease. As we are in the middle of an active outbreak, estimating this measure will necessarily involve correcting for time- and severity- dependent reporting of cases, and time-lags in observed patient outcomes. Methods: We carry out a theoretical analysis of current estimators of the CFR. We adapt a standard statistical technique, expectation maximization (EM), in a form previously developed for pandemic influenzas to correct for time- and severity- dependent reporting in the estimated CFR of COVID-19. Code is available at https://github.com/aangelopoulos/cfr-covid-19 . Findings: We find that the na\""{i}ve estimator of CFR is asymptotically biased for the true CFR. To compensate for both of these variables we apply an expectation maximization strategy previously developed for emerging pathogens such as pandemic influenza. We obtain a CFR estimate of 2.4% for COVID-19. We also show results of our method for relative CFR by nation. Finally, we release our code on GitHub so it can be used as more data becomes available globally. Interpretation: The current strategy of estimating the CFR by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases should not be used anymore as it is unreliable. Moving forward we suggest instead the use of maximum likelihood models which correct for time-dependent bias. This may allow public health organizations and local, state, and national governments to more accurately direct resources (e.g. test kits and vaccines) to places that would be most in need by compensating for the time delay inherent in this urgent ongoing pandemic.","Angelopoulos, Anastasios Nikolas; Pathak, Reese; Varma, Rohit; Jordan, Michael I.",,412,23

METHODS: PET-CT utilization between 1 January 2020 and 15 June 2020 at a tertiary academic center was assessed using change-point-detection (CPD) analysis. COVID-19 epidemiologic trend was obtained from Connecticut Department of Public Health records. Demographic and oncologic data were gathered from electronic medical records and PET-CT scans by four reviewers in consensus. RESULTS: A total of 1685 cases were reviewed. CPD analysis identified five distinct phases of PET-CT utilization during COVID-19, with a sharp decline and a gradual recovery. There was a 62.5% decline in case volumes at the nadir. These changes correlated with COVID-19 epidemiologic changes in the state of Connecticut, with a negative correlation between COVID-19 cases and PET-CT utilization (&#964; = -0.54; P value < 0.001). Statistically significant differences in age, race, cancer type and current and prior scan positivity were observed in these five phases.

Finally, through the topology reconstruction process, the feature representations of drugs and targets are forcibly extracted to match the observed network as much as possible. Through this reconstruction process, we obtain the strength of the relationship between different nodes and predict drug candidates that may affect the treatment of COVID-19 based on the known targets of COVID- 19.

Production capacity is limited in many countries and the future course of the pandemic will likely continue with shortages for high quality masks and PPE in the foreseeable future. Hence, expectations are that mask reuse, extended wear and similar approaches will enhance the availability of personal protective measures. Repeated thermal disinfection could be an important option and likely easier implemented in some situations, at least on the small scale, than UV illumination, irradiation or hydrogen peroxide vapor exposure. An overview on thermal responses and ongoing filtration performance of multiple face mask types is provided. Most masks have adequate material properties to survive a few cycles (i.e. 30 min disinfection steps) of thermal exposure in the 75°C regime. Some are more easily affected, as seen by the fusing of plastic liner or warping, given that preferred conditioning temperatures are near the softening point for some of the plastics and fibers used in these masks. Hence adequate temperature control is equally important. As guidance, disinfectants sprayed via dilute solutions maintain a surface presence over extended time at 25 and 37°C. Some spray-on alcohol-based solutions containing disinfectants were gently applied to the top surface of masks. Neither moderate thermal aging (less than 24 h at 80 and 95°C) nor gentle application of surface disinfectant sprays resulted in measurable loss of mask filter performance. Subject to bio-medical concurrence (additional checks for virus kill efficiency) and the use of low risk non-toxic disinfectants, such strategies, either individually or combined, by offering additional anti-viral properties or short term refreshing, may complement reuse options of professional masks or the now ubiquitous custom-made face masks with their often unknown filtration effectiveness.","Celina, Mathew C.; Martinez, Estevan; Omana, Michael A.; Sanchez, Andres; Wiemann, Dora; Tezak, Matthew; Dargaville, Tim R.",Polym Degradation Stab,412,1

In tropical and subtropical regions, ARBOD diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are frequent. In both COVID-19 and ARBOD cases, an accurate diagnosis of infected patients is crucial to promote adequate treatment and isolation measures in COVID-19 cases. Overlap of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters between COVID-19 and ARBOD present themselves as an extra challenge during diagnosis. COVID-19 diagnosis is mainly performed by quantitative reverse polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), while ARBOD diagnosis is performed by serology, detection of antigen or antibody, and molecular diagnosis. In this review, the epidemiologic profile of arboviruses and SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed, and potential risks of symptom overlap is addressed. The implementation of an analytical platform based on infrared (IR) spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and RT-qPCR is discussed as an efficient strategy for a fast, robust, reliable, and cost-effective diagnosis system even during the co-occurrence of virus outbreaks. The spectral data of IR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF MS obtained from COVID-19 infected and recovered patients can be used to build up an integrated spectral database. This approach can enable us to determine quickly the groups that have been exposed and have recovered from COVID-19 or ARBOD, avoiding misdiagnoses.","Costa, Jéssica; Ferreira, Eugénio C; Santos, Cledir",,412,24

However, such category-agnostic global alignment lacks of exploiting the class-level joint distributions, causing the aligned distribution less discriminative. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel margin preserving self-paced contrastive Learning (MPSCL) model for cross-modal medical image segmentation. Unlike the conventional construction of contrastive pairs in contrastive learning, the domain-adaptive category prototypes are utilized to constitute the positive and negative sample pairs. With the guidance of progressively refined semantic prototypes, a novel margin preserving contrastive loss is proposed to boost the discriminability of embedded representation space. To enhance the supervision for contrastive learning, more informative pseudo-labels are generated in target domain in a self-paced way, thus benefiting the category-aware distribution alignment for UDA. Furthermore, the domain-invariant representations are learned through joint contrastive learning between the two domains. Extensive experiments on cross-modal cardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate that MPSCL significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, and outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","Liu, Zhizhe; Zhu, Zhenfeng; Zheng, Shuai; Liu, Yang; Zhou, Jiayu; Zhao, Yao",,412,31

The incidence and mortality for colorectal cancer is augmented in overweight and obese individuals. Previous studies demonstrated an impaired number, phenotype and functionality of natural killer (NK) cells under obese conditions. So far, the influence of obesity on NK cells in colorectal cancer tissue remained unclear. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the occurrence and localization of NK cells in colorectal tumors of normal weight and diet-induced obese rats. METHODS: Wistar rats were fed a normal-fat diet (control) or a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity. In half of the experimental groups azoxymethane (AOM) was injected to induce colorectal cancer. Tumors in colon and rectum were histopathologically classified in adenomas and adenocarcinomas and immunohistologically stained with the rat NK cell marker CD161. Occurrence and localization of NK cells were analyzed and quantified in the tunica mucosa and tunica submucosa of colorectal adenomas and the tunica submucosa of colorectal adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: NK cells are localized in the tunica mucosa and the tunica submucosa of colorectal tumors with NK cell accumulations as follicle-like aggregates especially in regions of the lamina muscularis mucosae and the lamina propria mucosae of the tunica mucosa as well as in regions of the tunica submucosa adjacent to the lamina muscularis mucosae. Although not statistically significant, the CD161 staining was clearly reduced in the tunica mucosa of colorectal tumors of rats fed a HFD compared to rats fed a control diet. Moreover, the CD161 staining in the tunica mucosa was positively correlated with the final body weight of AOM-treated rats independent of the supplied diet. DISCUSSION: For the first time, these results provide information about the localization and quantity of NK cells in colorectal tumor tissue of rats fed a control diet or high-fat diet. The slight reduction of NK cell number in colorectal tissue of rats fed a high-fat diet may contribute to an impaired tumor defense and the increased colorectal tumor outcome in diet-induced obese rats.","Bähr, Ina; JannesPörtner, Ole; Glass, Markus; Doberstein, Henriette; Goritz, Vincent; Hiller, Grit Gesine Ruth; Spielmann, Julia; Kielstein, Heike",Ann Anat,412,33

Firstly, a Siamese network with two identical convolutional neural network (CNN) sub-networks and a logistic regression for leukocyte five classification is designed, which can learn not only distinguishing features but also a similarity metric. Then for each category of the leukocytes, a typical sample is selected by the hematologist. To train the Siamese network, a leukocyte and a typical sample that belong to the same category make up a genuine pair and the leukocyte with the rest four typical samples respectively make up four impostor pairs. Obviously, the number of the genuine pairs is lesser than that of the impostor pairs. Thus, a data augmentation method suitable for leukocyte is used to enrich the amount of the genuine pairs. By training the Siamese network using the genuine pairs and impostor pairs, the Siamese network can not only shorten the similarity metric between the leukocyte and the same category of the typical sample but also increase the similarity metrics between the leukocyte and the different categories of the typical samples. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve 98.8% average testing accuracy. Graphical abstract.","Wang, Yapin; Cao, Yiping",Med. biol. eng. comput,412,29

METHODS: We conducted an interim analysis of the international, multicentre HOPE COVID-19 registry including patients admitted for a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection until 18 April 2020. Those treated with NIV were considered. The primary endpoint was a composite of death or need for intubation. The components of the composite endpoint were the secondary outcomes. Unadjusted and adjusted predictors of the primary endpoint within those initially treated with NIV were investigated. RESULTS: 1933 patients who were included in the registry during the study period had data on oxygen support type. Among them, 390 patients (20%) were treated with NIV. Compared with those receiving other non-invasive oxygen strategy, patients receiving NIV showed significantly worse clinical and laboratory signs of ARF at presentation. Of the 390 patients treated with NIV, 173 patients (44.4%) met the composite endpoint. In-hospital death was the main determinant (147, 37.7%), while 62 patients (15.9%) needed invasive ventilation. Those requiring invasive ventilation had the lowest survival rate (41.9%). After adjustment, age (adjusted OR (adj(OR)) for 5-year increase: 1.37, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.63, p<0.001), hypertension (adj(OR) 2.95, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.61, p=0.03), room air O2 saturation <92% at presentation (adj(OR) 3.05, 95% CI 1.28 to 7.28, p=0.01), lymphocytopenia (adj(OR) 3.55, 95% CI 1.16 to 10.85, p=0.03) and in-hospital use of antibiotic therapy (adj(OR) 4.91, 95% CI 1.69 to 14.26, p=0.003) were independently associated with the composite endpoint. CONCLUSION: NIV was used in a significant proportion of patients within our cohort, and more than half of these patients survived without the need for intubation. NIV may represent a viable strategy particularly in case of overcrowded and limited intensive care resources, but prompt identification of failure is mandatory to avoid harm. Further studies are required to better clarify our hypothesis.

A difference-in-difference approach is used to make causal inferences on the lockdown effect on happiness, and an OLS estimation investigates the determinants of happiness after lockdown. The results show that the lockdown had a significant and negative impact on happiness. In analysing the determinants of happiness after lockdown, we found that stay-at-home orders have positively impacted happiness during this period. On the other hand, other lockdown regulations such as a ban on alcohol sales, a fear of becoming unemployed and a greater reliance on social media have negative effects, culminating in a net loss in happiness.

This survey assessed the knowledge of COVID-19 among Nigerian parents and its effect on their monthly income. Methods: an online cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 9 - June 8, 2020, among parents/guardians with children/wards in the paediatric age-range during the lockdown stage of the outbreak in Nigeria. Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit 260 respondents. The questionnaire was administered on a Google doc form and distributed via the internet. Chi-square was used to test for differences, and statistical significance was set at p-value less than 0.05 and a 95% confidence level. Results: the mean age was 39.6 years (SD = 7.3), comprising 105 (40.4%) males, 239 (91.9%) married, and 167 (64.2%) with tertiary education. Only 29 (11.2%) had good knowledge of COVID-19.

Current $R_t$ estimates often suffer from problems such as lagging, averaging and uncertainties demoting the usefulness of $R_t$. To address these problems, we propose a new method in the framework of sequential Bayesian inference where a Data Assimilation approach is taken for $R_t$ estimation, resulting in the state-of-the-art 'DAR$_t$' system for $R_t$ estimation. With DAR$_t$, the problem of time misalignment caused by lagging observations is tackled by incorporating observation delays into the joint inference of infections and $R_t$; the drawback of averaging is improved by instantaneous updating upon new observations and a model selection mechanism capturing abrupt changes caused by interventions; the uncertainty is quantified and reduced by employing Bayesian smoothing. We validate the performance of DAR$_t$ through simulations and demonstrate its power in revealing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19.","Yang, Xian; Wang, Shuo; Xing, Yuting; Li, Ling; Xu, Richard Yi Da; Friston, Karl J.; Guo, Yike",,412,29

This study evaluated knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding PrEP in a sample of Italian MSM, in order to hypothesize strategies to implement PrEP awareness and use. No previous study has assessed this issue; Methods: An online survey was given to an opportunistic sample of Italian MSM. The questionnaire investigated sexual behaviour and habits, HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) knowledge and PrEP awareness, attitudes and practices. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify factors associated with PrEP knowledge; Results: A total of 196 MSM participated in this survey. Overall data showed that 87.2% of participants knew what PrEP is, but only 7.5% have ever used it. The main reason for not using PrEP was the cost of the therapy (26.9%). The principal source of PrEP information was the Internet (68.4%). Being regularly tested for HIV was significantly associated with PrEP knowledge (adjusted odds ratio (AdjOR) = 3.16; confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-9.29); Conclusions: Knowledge regarding PrEP was well established, but PrEP use was not equally widespread. It is necessary to improve research on PrEP usage in order to PrEP access to be granted.","Voglino, Gianluca; Gualano, Maria Rosaria; Rousset, Stefano; Forghieri, Pietro; Fraire, Isabella; Bert, Fabrizio; Siliquini, Roberta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),412,26

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational analysis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital or managed in the community and their household contacts across a London population during the period March 1st to April 1st, 2020. Symptomatology and duration were extracted from routinely collected clinical data and follow-up telephone consultations. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 141 (92 community patients, 49 discharged inpatients) were included for analysis; 77/141 (55%) reported anosmia and ageusia, nine reported only ageusia and three only anosmia. The median onset of anosmia in relation to onset of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) symptoms (as defined by the Public Health England case definition) was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5). Median duration of anosmia was 8 days (IQR 16). Median duration of COVID-19 symptoms in community patients was 10 days (IQR 8) versus 18 days (IQR 13.5) in admitted patients. As of April 1, 45 patients had ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and/or anosmia; 107/141 (76%) patients had household contacts, and of 185 non-tested household contacts 79 (43%) had COVID-19 symptoms with 46/79 (58%) reporting anosmia.

In this paper, we report the extensive molecular dynamics simulations in order to gain insight into the structure and the dynamics of NPC1 lumenal domain for the cholesterol transport and the disease behind the mutation (R518W). It was found that the mutation induces a structural shift of the NTD (N-terminal domain), toward the loop region in the MLD (middle lumenal domain), which is believed to play a central role in the interaction with NPC2 protein, so the interaction with the NPC2 protein might be less favorable compared to the wild NPC1. Also, the simulation indicates the possible re-orientation of the NTD with both the wild and the R518W mutated NPC1 after receiving the cholesterol from the NPC2, that align to form an internal tunnel, which is a possible pose for further action in cholesterol trafficking.

We explored personal accounts and findings in reporting on the early experiences from primary care during the pandemic, through the online Global Forum on Universal Health Coverage and Primary Health Care. During the early stage of the pandemic, primary care continued as the first point of contact to the health system but was poorly informed by policy makers on how to fulfil its role and ill equipped to provide care while protecting staff and patients against further spread of the infection. In many countries, the creativity and initiatives of local health professionals led to the introduction or extension of the use of telephone, e-mail and virtual consulting, and introduced triaging to separate 'suspected' COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 care. There were substantial concerns of collateral damage to the health of the population due to abandoned or postponed routine care.

This paper aims to show that, due to active behavioral changes of individuals and the inherent nature of infectious diseases, it is complicated and challenging to predict the temporal evolution of epidemics. METHODS: A modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-hospitalized-removed (SEIHR) compartment model with a discrete feedback-controlled transmission rate was proposed to incorporate individuals' behavioral changes into the model. To figure out relative uncertainties in the infection peak time and the fraction of the infected population at the peak, a deterministic method and 2 stochastic methods were applied. RESULTS: A relatively small behavioral change of individuals with a feedback constant of 0.02 in the modified SEIHR model resulted in a peak time delay of up to 50% using the deterministic method. Incorporating stochastic methods into the modified model with a feedback constant of 0.04 suggested that the relative random uncertainty of the maximum fraction of infections and that of the peak time for a population of 1 million reached 29% and 9%, respectively. Even without feedback, the relative uncertainty of the peak time increased by up to 20% for a population of 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that uncertainty originates from stochastic properties of infections. Without a proper selection of the evolution scenario, active behavioral changes of individuals could serve as an additional source of uncertainty.","Park, Seung-Nam; Kim, Hyong-Ha; Lee, Kyoung Beom",Epidemiol Health,412,16

Mandated responses used the format of much better, better, same, worse and much worse. RESULTS: A total of 73/82 (89%) medical and nursing staff completed the survey. A greater than 90% improved or neutral response was noted for 31/35 (89%) questions. About 80% of staff reported the new dedicated General Paediatrics ward provided a better or much better team-based approach, time efficient approach and overall model of care. A much better or better response was reported for communication between medical and nursing staff in 68%, team comradery in 69%, supportive/helpful nursing staff in 74%, job stress level in 66% and staff morale in 60% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Overwhelmingly positive responses from this study support a centralised or ""home"" ward model of care for General Paediatrics patients in a tertiary paediatric setting. Our findings may be relevant to General Paediatrics teams in other centres currently using multiple wards to manage their patients.","Venettacci, Oliver; Skull, Sue",J. paediatr. child health,412,22

Therefore, this study aims to explore the potential mechanism of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19 employing network pharmacology and molecular docking methods. The corresponding target genes of 45 main active ingredients in XBJ injection and COVID-19 were obtained by using multiple database retrieval and literature mining. 102 overlapping targets of them were screened as the core targets for analysis. Then built the PPI network, TCM-compound-target-disease, and disease-target-pathway networks with the help of Cytoscape 3.6.1 software. After that, utilized DAVID to perform gene ontology (GO) function enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis to predict the action mechanism of overlapping targets. Finally, by applying molecular docking technology, all compounds were docked with COVID-19 3 CL protease(3CLpro), spike protein (S protein), and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). The results indicated that quercetin, luteolin, apigenin and other compounds in XBJ injection could affect TNF, MAPK1, IL6 and other overlapping targets. Meanwhile, anhydrosafflor yellow B (AHSYB), salvianolic acid B (SAB), and rutin could combine with COVID-19 crucial proteins, and then played the role of anti-inflammatory, antiviral and immune response to treat COVID-19. This study revealed the multiple active components, multiple targets, and multiple pathways of XBJ injection in the treatment of COVID-19, which provided a new perspective for the study of the mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of COVID-19.","Xing, Yan; Hua, Ying-Rong; Shang, Jing; Ge, Wei-Hong; Liao, Jun",Chin J Nat Med,412,2

METHODS: In this observational retrospective multicentre study, we included all COVID-19 patients treated with out-of-ICU CPAP, candidates for intubation in case of CPAP failure. From these patients, we collected demographic and clinical data. RESULTS: A total of 397 COVID-19 patients were treated with CPAP for respiratory failure, with the therapeutic goal of providing intubation in case of CPAP failure. Univariable analysis showed that, age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and white cell counts were all significantly lower in patients with successful CPAP treatment compared to those failing it and undergoing subsequent intubation. The percentage changes between baseline and CPAP application in the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), PaO2, respiratory rate and ROX index were higher in patients experiencing successful CPAP compared to those failing it. FiO2 and male gender were also significantly associated with intubation. Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, percentage change in PaO2/FiO2 or PaO2 and FiO2 separately, lactate, white blood cell count, LDH and C-reactive protein levels led to an area under the curve of 0.818 and confirmed that age, LDH and percentage increase in PaO2/FiO2 are predictors of intubation.

We report on the development and implementation of an internet-based COVID-19 participatory surveillance tool in rural Appalachia. METHODS: A regional collaboration among public health partners culminated in the design and implementation of the COVID-19 Self-Checker, a local online symptom tracker. The tool collected data on participant demographic characteristics and health history. County residents were then invited to take part in an automated daily electronic follow-up to monitor symptom progression, assess barriers to care and testing, and collect data on COVID-19 test results and symptom resolution. RESULTS: Nearly 6500 county residents visited and 1755 residents completed the COVID-19 Self-Checker from April 30 through June 9, 2020. Of the 579 residents who reported severe or mild COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 symptoms were primarily reported among women (n = 408, 70.5%), adults with preexisting health conditions (n = 246, 70.5%), adults aged 18-44 (n = 301, 52.0%), and users who reported not having a health care provider (n = 131, 22.6%). Initial findings showed underrepresentation of some racial/ethnic and non-English-speaking groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether IV administration of TXA changes the blood coagulation following primary THA via thrombelastography (TEG) analysis and conventional laboratory tests. METHODS: A total of 174 patients who underwent primary THA from September 2016 to July 2018 were selected. They were randomly divided into two groups, 86 patients with IV administration of 15 mg/kg TXA and 88 controls without TXA usage. Demographic data, TEG paremeters, d-dimer levels, fibrin degradation products, hemoglobin, hematocrit concentration, platelet, transfusion rates, perioperative blood loss, and the occurrence of deep vein thrombosis were collected. TEG and conventional laboratory tests were performed the day before operation, the first day after operation, and seventh day after operation. RESULTS: There were no differences with regard to TEG or conventional laboratory tests between the two groups (p > 0.05). The total blood loss and drain blood loss in the TXA group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.05). The transfusion rates and the volume of blood transfusion of the control group were higher than those of the TXA group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The administration of IV-TXA resulted in a significant reduction in total blood loss, transfusion volumes, and transfusion rates without the increase of thromboembolic complications. Moreover, it was confirmed that TXA would not change the coagulation via the TEG analysis.","Zhang, Xing-Chen; Sun, Ma-Ji; Pan, Sheng; Rui, Min; Zhao, Feng-Chao; Zha, Guo-Chun; Pang, Yong; Zheng, Xin; Guo, Kai-Jin",J Orthop Surg (Hong Kong),412,23

In nonpregnant women, studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes cardiac injury, which can result in myocardial inflammation and damage. Despite many studies investigating the extent of cardiac compromise in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019, little is known regarding its impact on pregnant women. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to illustrate the clinical, laboratory, radiologic findings and outcomes of pregnant patients with coronavirus disease 2019 who developed myocardial injury with ventricular dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the paper records of 15 pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019, who developed myocardial injury on a single tertiary care hospital in the Dominican Republic. Patients' baseline characteristics, clinical picture, and laboratory and radiologic findings were presented, and maternal and fetal outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 154 pregnant patients diagnosed as having coronavirus disease 2019 at our hospital during the study period, 15 (9.7%), developed myocardial injury. These patients' mean age and gestational age were 29.87±5.83 and 32.31±3.68, respectively. Furthermore, 66.7% of patients presented with shortness of breath and 16.3% with palpitations. All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 86.6% needed intubation. Patients developed myocardial injury, confirmed with highly elevated troponin (34.6 [14.4-55.5 ng/mL]), and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations (209 [184-246 pg/mL]). In addition, all patients developed left ventricular dysfunction demonstrated by an echocardiogram with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 37.67±6.4. Unfortunately, 2 patients who presented with palpitations died a few days after admission. CONCLUSION: Our study showed coronavirus disease 2019 induced myocardial injury and left ventricular dysfunction in pregnant women with a 13.3% mortality rate, which was attributed to malignant arrhythmias.","Mercedes, Brisandy Ruiz; Serwat, Ayna; Naffaa, Lena; Ramirez, Nairovi; Khalid, Fatima; Steward, Sofia B; Feliz, Omar Gabriel Caro; Kassab, Mohamad Bassam; Karout, Lina",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,412,20

Anxiety about COVID-19 is more than simply worry about infection. Research provides evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome characterized by (1) worry about the dangers of COVID-19 and worry about coming into contact with coronavirus contaminated objects or surfaces, (2) worry about the personal socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, (3) xenophobic worries that foreigners are spreading COVID-19, (4) COVID-19-related traumatic stress symptoms (e.g., nightmares), and (5) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking.

The present study, based on a population-representative sample of 3075 American and Canadian adults, sought to investigate how these syndromes are related to substance use and abuse. We found substantial COVID-19-related increases in alcohol and drug use. Network analyses indicated that although the two syndromes are negatively correlated with one another, they both have positive links to alcohol and drug abuse. More specifically, COVID-19-related traumatic stress symptoms and the tendency to disregard social distancing were both linked to substance abuse.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate serum antibody responses in patients regardless of the outcome. We measured the circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels in 60 subjects with a certified history of SARS-CoV-2 infection by using immunoenzymatic, chemiluminescent, and Neutralization assays. Half patients had a severe infection, the other half were pauci-symptomatic. We analyzed their antibody response to see the trend of the humoral response. Our results showed a significant difference in circulating IgG level among the two groups. The neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was significantly higher among those who had severe disease. Furthermore, ten subjects from each group were screened twice, and a declining antibody trend was observed in pauci-symptomatic individuals. These findings provide evidence that humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in pauci-symptomatic people is weak and may not be long-lasting. This may have implications for immunity strategy and prevention, since it is still not clear whether a time-dependent decrease of both circulating and neutralizing antibodies to nonprotective levels could occur in a longer time span and whether potential vaccines are able to induce a herd immunity and a durable response.","Anichini, Gabriele; Gandolfo, Claudia; Terrosi, Chiara; Fabrizi, Simonetta; Miceli, Giovanni Battista; Gori Savellini, Gianni; Prathyumnan, Shibily; Franchi, Federico; Cusi, Maria Grazia",J Med Virol,412,1

Although, the reverse transcription polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR) test has been used for COVID-19 testing its reliability is very low. Therefore, computed tomography and X-ray images have been widely used. Artificial intelligence coupled with X-ray technologies has recently shown to be more effective in the diagnosis of this disease. With this motivation, a comparative analysis of fine-tuned deep learning architectures has been made to speed up the detection and classification of COVID-19 patients from other pneumonia groups. The models used for this analysis are MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, NASNetMobile, VGG16, Xception, InceptionResNetV2 DenseNet121, which have been fine-tuned using a new set of layers replaced with the head of the network. This research work has carried out an analysis on two datasets. Dataset-1 includes the images of three classes: Normal, COVID, and Pneumonia. Dataset-2, in contrast, contains the same classes with more focus on two prominent pneumonia categories: bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia. The research was conducted on 959 X-ray images (250 of Bacterial Pneumonia, 250 of Viral Pneumonia, 209 of COVID, and 250 of Normal cases). Using the confusion matrix, the required results of different models have been computed. For the first dataset, DenseNet121 has obtained a 97% accuracy, while for the second dataset, MobileNetV2 has performed best with an accuracy of 81%.","Aggarwal, Sonam Gupta Sheifali Alhudhaif Adi Koundal Deepika Gupta Rupesh Polat Kemal",Expert Systems,412,22

We aim to summarize the clinical features of DM patients with COVID-19 and find out potential factors associated with severe disease. Methods: In this retrospective, single-center study, the medical records of patients with COVID-19 in Changsha, Hunan, China, from January 21, 2020, to February 19, 2020, were reviewed. Epidemiological information, clinical features, and outcomes were compared between DM patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) or not. Results: A total of 241 patients confirmed with COVID-19 were enrolled, including 19 DM patients. There were more patients in DM group admitted to the ICU than non-DM group (36.8% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.045). Compared with non-DM group in the ICU, there were more female patients from DM group in the ICU (85.7% vs. 31.4%, P = 0.024). On admission, the mean level of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was higher in the ICU DM patients than that in the non-ICU DM patients (8.5% vs. 7.1%). There were more DM patients with proteinuria in the ICU group than the non-ICU group (57.1% vs. 33.3%). Twelve DM patients (63.2%) changed diabetic therapy during hospitalization, and all DM patients admitted to the ICU used insulin. As of March 14, all 19 DM patients have been discharged, and no death occurred. Conclusions: DM patients with COVID-19 are vulnerable to severe disease, especially for female patients. High levels of HbA1c and proteinuria could be potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 in DM patients. In addition to timely systemic therapy, the control of blood glucose and proper diabetic therapy is essential to improve the prognosis of severe DM patients with COVID-19.","Guo, Ting; Shen, Qinxue; Ouyang, Xiaoli; Guo, Wei; Li, Jinhua; He, Wenlong; Yu, Bo; Wu, Chenfang; Zhou, Zhiguo; Luo, Hong; Peng, Hong",J Diabetes Res,412,16

From a practice perspective, the inability to access a cardiologist for weeks if not months is usually due to an often overwhelmed clinic schedule. Leaving work, caring for a family member, transportation, parking, and other expenses are clear factors from the patient's perspective. Now, the COVID-19 crisis has brought telemedicine to the forefront of care delivery, giving patients and physicians first-hand exposure to the technology. The broader access and simplification of technology interface has provided a nontraditional mode to care delivery in which online, ""face-to-face"" video, phone visits, or even two-way text communication is easily applied. Furthermore, simple everyday technology tools can provide easy and fast access to curbside consultations, quick urgent-care questions and management, up-titrating medications, and the more important but often under-delivered continuous counseling for preventive medicine.

This disease has the liver as the major focus of its histological lesions, physiopathological alterations and clinical manifestations. Previous studies have shown alteration on lipid metabolism in the hepatosplenic form of Schistosomiasis. One of the main alterations is the reduction on lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity, an hepatic enzyme that catalyze the esterification of cholesterol in plasma In this work, we evaluate the LCAT activity in plasma from patients with hepatosplenic Schistosomiasis mansoni who were subjected to a new surgical treatment, which consists of splenectomy followed by auto-transplantation of spleen tissue. LCAT activity was detected by using a radioactive substrate. Both [14C]free and esterified cholesterol produced by the LCAT reaction were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the sample radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintilation analyzer. LCAT activity from plasma of patients subjected to splenectomy and spleen tissue implantation were reduced by 32 %, in comparison to the control group. However, in Schistosoma mansoni patients who were only clinically treated the reduction on LCAT activity was twice (64%) as much as that found in plasma of patients subjected to splenectomy and spleen tissue implantation. These results suggest a significant improvement on LCAT activity after the surgical treatment of patients with the hepatosplenic form of Schistosomiasis mansoni.","Augusto da Silva, Cesar; Fontes de Oliveira, Keila; Cristina Oliveira de Carvalho, Vera; Lúcia Coutinho Domigues, Ana; Teixeira Brandt, Carlos; Lúcia de Menezes Lima, Vera",Acta cir. bras.,412,26

However, due to the short duration of patient follow up until now, it is not clear whether this infection will be associated with longer-term neurological and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. In particular, the question of whether COVID-19 will be associated with an increased risk and rate of future dementia remains open and subject to speculation. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing number of patients have reported sudden anosmia or other olfactory dysfunction as concurrent symptoms. The possibility that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may reach the brain via the olfactory nerve or an upper nasal trancribrial route is an interesting working hypothesis. Among the identified genetic risk factors for Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), Apo E4 is one of the strongest and most frequent. People carrying one or two copies of the e4 allele of Apo E4 have significant odor recognition deficits in comparison to those not carrying this haplotype. The hypothesis invoked in this paper is that anosmia/olfactory dysfunctions induced by SARS-CoV-2 may cause an increased a risk of future neurodegenerative dementia in ApoE4 carriers, and that this risk would be higher than in Apo E4 carriers affected by anosmia not induced by SARS-CoV-2. This would be associated with virus-induced chronic modifications in the central nervous system. It is proposed that COVID-19 patients with anosmia and no other serious symptoms should be followed up as part of specifically designed and approved studies in order to identify the early stages of dementia (especially LOAD and Dementia with Lewy Bodies), thereby improving our knowledge of the mechanisms involved in pre-cognitive stages of neurodegenerative dementia and making best use of any available therapies.

In this work, we started with a c-Si(p)/MoOX heterojunction solar cell which yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.86 %, in which the MoOX film was synthesized by industry-compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). The initial PCE dropped to 10.20 % after two days because of severe migration of O and Ag at the MoOX/Ag interface. We solved this by the insertion of a CrOX layer between the MoOX layer and the Ag electrode. The solar cell was found to be stable for over 8 months in air due to the suppression of interface degradation. Our work demonstrates an effective way of improving the stability of silicon solar cells with transition metal oxide carrier selective contacts.","Li, Jingye; Pan, Tianyu; Wang, Jilei; Cao, Shuangying; Lin, Yinyue; Hoex, Bram; Ma, Zhongquan; Lu, Linfeng; Yang, Liyou; Sun, Baoquan; Li, Dongdong",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),412,5

This was a retrospective study that included patients <20 years of age with a recent mandibular fracture. The outcome variable was missed mandibular fracture, which was determined when a fracture was not suspected or diagnosed during the patient's first assessment in primary healthcare. The primary predictor variable was age group (i.e. children <13 years or teenagers/adolescents aged 13-19 years). The explanatory variables were sex, mechanism of injury, and type of facial facture. Other variables were clinical symptoms and findings. Mandibular fracture was missed at first contact in 27 of 182 patients (14.8%). Fracture was missed significantly more often in patients <13 years than in older patients (33.3% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001). The only significant symptom or clinical finding that was associated with missed fractures was skin wound of the jaw (P=0.009). There was no association between missed fracture and sex or mechanism of injury. Mandibular fractures in children are often missed at the first healthcare contact. Careful examination is necessary in paediatric mandibular injuries, particularly in the youngest age groups.

The downside of using such molecules is the potential risk of developing immune-related adverse events. Factors that trigger these autoimmune side effects are yet to be elucidated. Although any organ can potentially be affected, kidney involvement is usually rare. In this case report, we describe the first known instance of a patient being treated with an inhibitor of programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1, a checkpoint inhibitor) who develops acute tubulointerstitial nephritis after contracting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Presenting concerns of the patient: A 62-year-old patient, on immunotherapy treatment for stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma, presents to the emergency department with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection. Severe acute kidney injury is discovered with electrolyte imbalances requiring urgent dialysis initiation. Further testing reveals that the patient has contracted the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Diagnosis: A kidney biopsy was performed and was compatible with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Interventions: The patient was treated with high dose corticosteroid therapy followed by progressive tapering. Outcomes: Rapid and sustained normalization of kidney function was achieved after completion of the steroid course. Novel findings: We hypothesize that the viral infection along with checkpoint inhibitor use has created a proinflammatory environment which led to a loss of self-tolerance to renal parenchyma. Viruses may play a more important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in this patient population than was previously thought.","Buyansky, D.; Fallaha, C.; Gougeon, F.; Pepin, M. N.; Cailhier, J.

When the decision was made to reactivate the surgical practice, several major structural and operational changes were made to the regional surgical practice to optimize efficiencies. Results: The structural and operational changes implemented during reactivation resulted in improved utilization of surgical resources including improvement in OR block utilization, increased available OR time, and increased case volumes. Conclusion: Surgical and procedural leaders should consider a limited-time deferral of elective surgical cases to implement widespread OR efficiency strategies. The time selected for deferral of surgical cases should target a historically low surgical volume to minimize disruption to patient care and impact on overall OR functions.","Martin-Krajewski, Carie A; Craig, Jason E; Bledsoe, Jonathan M; Wensink, Laurie J; Crawford, Neal S; Eberhardt, Angela M; Grottke, Kara L; Helmers, Richard A",,412,18

Kerala was lauded across the world once again as a success story in containing this unprecedented pandemic, in treating those infected, and in making needed provisions for those adversely affected by the lockdown. But as it turned out, this celebration was premature as Kerala soon faced a third wave of Covid 19 infections.

We identified eight patient contact clusters (PCC) with significantly increased similarity in genomic variants compared to non-clustered samples. Incorporation of HCW location further increased the number of individuals within PCCs and identified additional links in SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways. Patients within PCCs carried viruses more genetically identical to HCWs in the same ward location.

Many patients with ovarian cancer suffer from de novo or acquired resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we report that RAB25 suppresses chemotherapy-induced mitochondrial apoptosis signaling in ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer cells. RAB25 blocks chemotherapy-induced apoptosis upstream of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by either increasing antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins or decreasing proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins. In particular, BAX expression negatively correlates with RAB25 expression in ovarian cancer cells. BH3 profiling assays corroborated that RAB25 decreases mitochondrial cell death priming. Suppressing RAB25 by means of RNAi or RFP14 inhibitory hydrocarbon-stapled peptide sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy as well as RAB25-mediated proliferation, invasion and migration.

Serology testing using ELISA proposes major advantages as a diagnostic and preventive tool to control the present SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This cohort study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in asymptomatic cancer patients. METHODS: Patients in all age groups and with any type of cancer who have been in remission or have stable disease and received their latest anticancer therapy over 2 months ago included in the study. All patients were evaluated for COVID-19 symptoms and only asymptomatic patients were enrolled for serologic screening for SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples evaluated serologically for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: A total of 168 asymptomatic cancer patients were included in the study. Of the 168 cases with a history of cancer who were asymptomatic for Covid-19, 29 cases (17.26%) had a positive serological test. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in the present study asymptomatic cancer patients revealed 17% seropositivity, approximately equal to the general population of the same age, sex, geographic region, and epidemic status. Asymptomatic infections should further be investigated and considered as playing an important role in the COVID-19 transmission chain.","Arab, Maliheh; Noei Teymoordash, Somayyeh; Talayeh, Maryam; Ghavami, Behnaz; Javadi, Abdolreza; Nouri, Behnaz",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,412,1

In melanoma, transient fluctuations in the molecular state of tumor cells mark the formation of rare cells primed to survive BRAF inhibition and reprogram into a stably drug-resistant fate. However, the biological processes governing cellular priming remain unknown. We used CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens to identify genes that affect cell fate decisions by altering cellular plasticity. We found that many factors can independently affect cellular priming and fate decisions. We discovered a new plasticity-based mode of increasing resistance to BRAF inhibition that pushes cells towards a more differentiated state. Manipulating cellular plasticity through inhibition of DOT1L before the addition of the BRAF inhibitor resulted in more therapy resistance than concurrent administration. Our results indicate that modulating cellular plasticity can alter cell fate decisions and may prove useful for treating drug resistance in other cancers.","Torre, Eduardo A; Arai, Eri; Bayatpour, Sareh; Jiang, Connie L; Beck, Lauren E; Emert, Benjamin L; Shaffer, Sydney M; Mellis, Ian A; Fane, Mitchell E; Alicea, Gretchen M; Budinich, Krista A; Weeraratna, Ashani T; Shi, Junwei; Raj, Arjun",Nat Genet,412,20

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However, this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study, we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number (Rt) of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021, as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the Rt of B.1.1.7 was 6-10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions. Our framework, which uses open-source methods requiring minimal computational resources, may be used to monitor near real-time variant dynamics in a myriad of settings.","Petrone, Mary E.; Rothman, Jessica E.; Breban, Mallery I.; Ott, Isabel M.; Russell, Alexis; Lasek-Nesselquist, Erica; Kelly, Kevin; Omerza, Greg; Renzette, Nicholas; Watkins, Anne E.; Kalinich, Chaney C.; Alpert, Tara; Brito, Anderson F.; Earnest, Rebecca; Tikhonova, Irina R.; Castaldi, Christopher; Kelly, John P.; Shudt, Matthew; Plitnick, Jonathan; Schneider, Erasmus; Murphy, Steven; Neal, Caleb; Laszlo, Eva; Altajar, Ahmad; Pearson, Claire; Muyombwe, Anthony; Downing, Randy; Razeq, Jafar; Niccolai, Linda; Wilson, Madeline S.; Anderson, Margaret L.; Wang, Jianhui; Liu, Chen; Hui, Pei; Mane, Shrikant; Taylor, Bradford P.; Hanage, William P.; Landry, Marie L.; Peaper, David R.; Bilguvar, Kaya; Fauver, Joseph R.; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Gardner, Lauren M.; Pitzer, Virginia E.; George, Kirsten St.; Adams, Mark D.; Grubaugh, Nathan D.",,412,1

Research has focused on the reasons why older adults are at greater risk. Sleep pattern across lifespan undergo marked modifications and a specific sleep profile can be observed in older adults, encompassing advanced sleep timing, a morningness preference, longer sleep-onset latency, shorter overall sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation, reduced slow-wave sleep and increased wake time after sleep onset. Additionally, increased prevalence of sleep disorders can be observed, such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Previous research has already correlated sleep disorders (especially sleep apnea) with COVID-19, but few studies have focused specifically on the older population. We believe that the intrinsic sleep pattern of older adults and the main sleep disorders in this population might be an important factor in understating why they are at a greater risk of negative outcomes of COVID-19. In this review we discussed the relationship between sleep and COVID-19 among older adults, focusing in three different aspects: 1. Sleep-related issues that might increase the likelihood of getting infected by SARS-COV-2;2. Sleep disturbances that might increase the predisposition to worse COVID-19 prognosis and outcomes;and 3.

Using National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) data from January 6, 2019-September 6, 2020, CDC tabulated weekly numbers of emergency department (ED) visits related to child abuse and neglect and calculated the proportions of such visits per 100,000 ED visits, as well as the percentage of suspected or confirmed ED visits related to child abuse and neglect ending in hospitalization, overall and stratified by age group (0-4, 5-11, and 12-17 years). The total number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect began decreasing below the corresponding 2019 period during week 11 (March 15-March 22, 2020) for all age groups examined, coinciding with the declaration of a national emergency on March 13 (2); simultaneously, the proportion of these visits per 100,000 ED visits began increasing above the 2019 baseline for all age groups. Despite decreases in the weekly number of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect, the weekly number of these visits resulting in hospitalization remained stable in 2020; however, the yearly percentage of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect resulting in hospitalization increased significantly among all age groups. Although the increased proportion of ED visits related to child abuse and neglect might be associated with a decrease in the overall number of ED visits, these findings also suggest that health care-seeking patterns have shifted during the pandemic. Hospitalizations for child abuse and neglect did not decrease in 2020, suggesting that injury severity did not decrease during the pandemic, despite decreased ED visits. Child abuse is preventable; implementation of strategies including strengthening household economic supports and creating family-friendly work policies can reduce stress during difficult times and increase children's opportunities to thrive in safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments (3).","Swedo, Elizabeth; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Leemis, Ruth; Dias, Taylor; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; Stein, Zachary; Chen, May; Agathis, Nickolas; Holland, Kristin",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,412,1

We investigated the cause of illness, transmission, and recommended control. We defined a suspected case of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) as acute onset of fever (&#8805;38°C) with sore throat or cough and at least one of the following: headache, lethargy, or difficulty in breathing. In addition, we looked at cases with onset between February 1 and March 31 in a person with a history of contact with Mr. A, his family, or other Company A employees. A confirmed case was defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of the same pathogen detected in Mr. A. Influenza-like illness was defined as onset of fever (&#8805;38°C) and cough or sore throat in a Uganda contact, and as fever (&#8805;38°C) and cough lasting less than 10 days in a Kenya contact. We collected Mr. A's exposure and clinical history, searched for cases, and traced contacts.

Against this backdrop we developed a pilot project that would introduce students to internationally available online biochemical databases, open-source modeling software and animation tools. The students received individual hands-on training to generate data allowing them to engage in discovery and contextualize learning as they would in a face-to face laboratory setting. We describe an investigation of NMR-based structures of a SARS coronavirus E channel protein, structures found in the 5X29 pdb file deposited by Surya, Li, &, Torres, and described in (2018) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1860: 1309-1317. These small proteins form ion channels that are of interest because live attenuated vaccines target these channels promising prevention and treatment for coronavirus infections. The SARS coronavirus E channel protein, a right-handed alpha-helical bundle, is composed of 5 chains, A through E. Each chain has 16 NMR structures in the database. Incorporating computational and molecular visualization tools students generate data to observe, measure, and communicate the dihedral angle backbone movement of the whole pentamer, the separate chains, and individual amino acid residues on a bond-by-bond basis. All the open access software and programs used worked within a Windows/Mac environment except one program that used Linux command lines to create models from the PDB file. Afterwards these models were animated to demonstrate and analyze dihedral angle movement within structures. The students used this work to fulfill the laboratory component of their undergraduate independent study program at in the Biological Sciences and Chemistry Departments of Lehman College, a 4-year college within the CUNY system.","Philipp, Manfred Olumuyide Ezekiel Babalola Blessing Gonzalez Janet",The FASEB Journal,412,20

The primary endpoint was mortality at 7 days after tocilizumab administration. Secondary endpoints were admission to the intensive care unit, development of ARDS and respiratory insufficiency among others. Methods: We report the preliminary results from the Vall d’Hebron cohort study at Vall d’Hebron University Hospital, in Barcelona (Spain), including all consecutive patients who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and who were treated with tocilizumab until March 25th. Results: 82 patients with COVID-19 received at least one dose of tocilizumab. The mean (± SD) age was 59.1 (19.8) years, 63% were male, 22% were of non-Spanish ancestry, and the median (IQR) age-adjusted Charlson index at baseline was 3 (1-4) points. Respiratory failure and ARDS developed in 62 (75.6%) and 45 (54.9%) patients, respectively. Median time from symptom onset to ARDS development was 8 (5-11) days. Mortality at 7 days was 26.8%. Hazard ratio for mortality was 3.3;95% CI, 1.3 to 8.5 (age-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality 2.1;95% CI, 0.8 to 5.8) if tocilizumab was administered after the onset of ARDS. Conclusion: Early administration of tocilizumab in patients needing oxygen supplementation may be critical to patient recovery.

Here, we identify features and develop simple epidemic model of COVID-19 on the basis of available epidemiological data and existing trends worldwide. Modeling of COVID-19 epidemic process was based on a classic model. A key parameter of the model, i.e. transmission parameter of SARS-CoV-2, was determined numericaly with the use of available epidemiological daily reports of COVID-19 from 17 April to 23 May 2020. Numerical determination of transmission parameter of SARS-CoV-2 according to the absolute number of COVID-19 cases in Ukraine, Indonesia and worlwide data showed its global tendency to decrease over time. Approximation of the obtained numerical values of the transmission parameter of SARS-CoV-2 was carried out using the exponential function. The results of prognostic modeling showed that by the end of summer 2020, above 30 thousand COVID-19 cases are expected in Ukraine, 100 thousand COVID-19 cases in Indonesia, and 12 million COVID-19 cases worldwide. Thus, predicting the possible consequences of the implementation of various health care control programs COVID-19 involves a comprehensive study of the epidemic process of the disease as a whole and for certain periods of time with the subsequent construction of an adequate prediction model.","Soloviov, Serhii O.; Hakim, Mohamad S.; Dzyublyk, Iryna V.; Ubohov, Serhii H.; Mintser, Ozar P.; Trokhymchuk, Viktor V.",Journal Of The Medical Sciences (Berkala Ilmu Kedokteran),412,20

In Massachusetts, triage guidelines were designed based on acute illness and chronic life-limiting conditions. In this study, we sought to retrospectively validate this protocol to cohorts of critically ill patients from our hospital. DESIGN: We applied our hospital-adopted guidelines, which defined severe and major chronic conditions as those associated with a greater than 50% likelihood of 1- and 5-year mortality, respectively, to a critically ill patient population. We investigated mortality for the same intervals. SETTING: An urban safety-net hospital ICU. PATIENTS: All adults hospitalized during April of 2015 and April 2019 identified through a clinical database search. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 365 admitted patients, 15.89% had one or more defined chronic life-limiting conditions. These patients had higher 1-year (46.55% vs 13.68%; p < 0.01) and 5-year (50.00% vs 17.22%; p < 0.01) mortality rates than those without underlying conditions. Irrespective of classification of disease severity, patients with metastatic cancer, congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and neurodegenerative disease had greater than 50% 1-year mortality, whereas patients with chronic lung disease and cirrhosis had less than 50% 1-year mortality. Observed 1- and 5-year mortality for cirrhosis, heart failure, and metastatic cancer were more variable when subdivided into severe and major categories. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with major and severe chronic medical conditions overall had 46.55% and 50.00% mortality at 1 and 5 years, respectively. However, mortality varied between conditions. Our findings appear to support a crisis standards protocol which focuses on acute illness severity and only considers underlying conditions carrying a greater than 50% predicted likelihood of 1-year mortality. Modifications to the chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis criteria should be refined if they are to be included in future models.","Nadjarian, Albert; LeClair, Jessica; Mahoney, Taylor F; Awtry, Eric H; Bhatia, Jasvinder S; Caruso, Lisa B; Clay, Alexis; Greer, David; Hingorani, Karan S; Horta, L F B; Ibrahim, Michel; Ieong, Michael H; James, Thea; Kulke, Matthew H; Lim, Remington; Lowe, Robert C; Moses, James M; Murphy, Jaime; Nozari, Ala; Patel, Anuj D; Silver, Brent; Theodore, Arthur C; Wang, Ryan Shufei; Weinstein, Ellen; Wilson, Stephen A; Cervantes-Arslanian, Anna M",Crit. care med,412,16

To do so, a finite-difference numerical scheme for the resolution of the thin film equation was set up taking into account capillary and van der Waals (vdW) forces. This method was validated by comparing the dynamics obtained from an initial harmonic perturbation to established theoretical predictions. With the addition of shear, three regimes have then been evidenced as a function of the shear rate. In the case of low shear rates the rupture is delayed when compared to the no-shear problem, while at higher shear rates it is even suppressed: the perturbed interface goes back to its unperturbed state over time. In between these two limiting regimes, a transient one in which shear and vdW forces balance each other, leading to a non-monotonic temporal evolution of the perturbed interface, has been identified. While a linear analysis is sufficient to describe the rupture time in the absence of shear, the nonlinearities appear to be essential otherwise.","Kadri, Kheireddine; Peixinho, Jorge; Salez, Thomas; Miquelard-Garnier, Guillaume; Sollogoub, Cyrille",,412,16

In this study, we investigated the dynamics of viral load and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 patients with severe and mild/moderate diseases. METHODS: Demographic and clinical information were obtained. Serial samples of blood, nasal and pharyngeal and anal swabs were collected at different time points post-onset. SARS-CoV-2 RNA and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured by qRT-PCR and immunoassays, respectively. RESULTS: Respiratory SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in 58.0% (58/100) COVID-19 patients upon admission and lasted for a median of 13 days post-onset. In addition, 5.9% (1/17) and 20.2% (19/94) of the blood and anal swab specimens were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, respectively. Anal viral RNA was more frequently detected in the patients who were positive for viral RNA in the respiratory samples upon admission. Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody developed within two weeks after onset, reached peak approximately 17 days post-onset and then maintained at relatively high level up to 50 days we analyzed in most patients. However, the levels of antibodies were variable among the patients. High titers of antibodies appeared to be associated with the severity of the disease. Furthermore, viral proteins from different sources showed significant difference of serological sensitivity especially during the first week post-onset. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate rapid clearance or self-elimination of viral RNA in about half of the COVID-19 patients upon admission. Viral RNA shedding of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in multiple tissues including the respiratory system, blood, and intestine. Variable levels of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody may be associated with disease severity. These findings have shed light on viral kinetics and antibody response in COVID-19 patients and provide scientific evidence for infection control and patient management.","Li, Linghua; Liang, Yuanhao; Hu, Fengyu; Yan, Huanchang; Li, Yueping; Xie, Zhiwei; Huang, Liping; Zhao, Jianhui; Wan, Zhengwei; Wang, Haiying; Shui, Jingwei; Cai, Weiping; Tang, Shixing",Virology,412,26

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from November 27, 2017 to November 27, 2019. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: In total, 14,894 NHs in the continental United States comprising 26,201 inspections and 176,841 deficiencies. METHODS: We measured the cumulative incidence of receiving F880: Infection Prevention and Control deficiencies, geographic variability of F880 citations across the United States, and the scope and severity of the infection control deficiencies. RESULTS: A total of 6164 NHs (41%) in the continental United States received 1 deficiency for F880, and 2300 NHs (15%) were cited more than once during the 2-year period. Geographic variation was evident for F880 deficiencies, ranging from 20% of NHs in North Carolina to 79% of NHs in West Virginia. Between 0% (Vermont) and 33% (Michigan) of states' NHs were cited multiple times over 2 years. Facilities receiving 2 or more F880 deficiencies were more reliant on Medicaid, for-profit, and served more acute residents. Infection Prevention and Control deficiencies were of similar severity but of greater scope in NHs that were cited multiple times. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic challenges hospitals with an increased surge of patients from the community, NHs will be asked to accept convalescing patients who were previously infected with the virus. NHs will need to rely on infection control practices to mitigate the effects of the virus in their facilities. Particular attention to NHs that have fared poorly with repeat infection control practices deficiencies might be a good first step to improving care overall and preventing downstream morbidity and mortality among the highest-risk patients.","Jester, Dylan J; Peterson, Lindsay J; Dosa, David M; Hyer, Kathryn",J.

To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Doogan, Caitlin; Buntine, Wray; Linger, Henry; Brunt, Samantha",J Med Internet Res,412,16

METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN were searched for papers regarding the estimation of four epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: the basic reproduction number, incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Four parameters in two groups were synthesized by bootstrapping, and their validities were evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model. RESULTS: A total of 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, and the timeliness of preprints was better. Synthesized estimates of the basic reproduction number (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and case-fatality-rate (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained. Simulated cumulative cases of the SEIRDC model matched well with the onset cases in China.

Triage pathway for KRT patients presenting with varying severity of COVID-19 illness remains ill-defined. We studied clinical characteristics of patients at initial and subsequent hospital presentations and its impact on patient outcomes. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: European Renal Association COVID-19 Database (ERACODA) was analysed for clinical and laboratory features of 1423 KRT patients with COVID-19 either hospitalized or non-hospitalized during first presentation and those representing after non-admission at initial triage. Predictors of outcomes (Hospitalisation, 28-day mortality) were determined for those not hospitalized at first presentation. RESULTS: Amongst 1423 KRT patients with COVID-19 (Hemodialysis = 1017/Transplant = 406), 25% (n = 355) were not hospitalized at first presentation (30% Hemodialysis/13% Transplant). Of these non-hospitalized patients, 10% (n = 36) re-presented second time, with a 5-day median interval between two presentations (Interquartile interval 2-7 days).

Patients on second presentation were older (72 vs. 63 years), had early respiratory symptoms and lung imaging abnormalities compared with those who did not return second time. The 28-day mortality for those admitted at first or second presentations was not significantly different (25% vs. 29%, p = 0.6). Higher age, prior smoking history, higher clinical frailty score and self-reported shortness of breath at first presentation, were identified as predictors of mortality in those discharged at initial triage. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that KRT patients with COVID-19 and mild pulmonary abnormalities with lack of pulmonary insufficiency can be safely discharged, with vigilance of respiratory symptoms, especially in those with risk factors for poor outcomes. Our findings support a risk-stratified clinical approach to admissions and discharges of KRT patients presenting with COVID-19, to aid clinical triage and optimise resource utilisation during the ongoing pandemic.","Mitra, Sandip; Jayanti, Anuradha; Vart, Priya; Coca, Armando; Gallieni, Maurizio; Øvrehus, Marius Altern; Midtvedt, Karsten; Abd ElHafeez, Samar; Gandolfini, Iliaria; Büttner, Stefan; Franssen, Casper F M; Hemmelder, Marc H",Nephrol. dial. transplant,412,30

The etiology of VMS is not clearly understood but may include genetic factors. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched PubMed and Embase in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidance. We included studies on associations between genetic variation and VMS. We excluded studies focused on medication interventions or prevention or treatment of breast cancer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of the 202 unique citations, 18 citations met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 51 to 17,695. Eleven of the 18 studies had fewer than 500 participants; two studies had &#8805; 1,000. Overall, statistically significant associations with VMS were found for variants in 14 of the 26 genes assessed in candidate gene studies. The cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1B1) gene was the focus of the largest number (n = 7) of studies, but strength and statistical significance of associations of CYP1B1 variants with VMS were inconsistent. A genome-wide association study reported statistically significant associations between 14 single-nucleotide variants in the tachykinin receptor 3 gene and VMS. Heterogeneity across trials regarding VMS measurement methods and effect measures precluded quantitative meta-analysis; there were few studies of each specific genetic variant. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants are associated with VMS. The associations are not limited to variations in sex steroid metabolism genes. However, studies were few and future studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.","Crandall, Carolyn J; Diamant, Allison L; Maglione, Margaret; Thurston, Rebecca C; Sinsheimer, Janet",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,412,20

The extracellular region of ACE2 can be administered as a soluble decoy to compete for binding sites on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S, but it has only moderate affinity and efficacy. The RBD, which is targeted by neutralizing antibodies, may also change and adapt through mutation as SARS-CoV-2 becomes endemic, posing challenges for therapeutic and vaccine development. AREAS COVERED: Deep mutagenesis is a Big Data approach to characterizing sequence variants. A deep mutational scan of ACE2 expressed on human cells identified mutations that increase S affinity and guided the engineering of a potent and broad soluble receptor decoy. A deep mutational scan of the RBD displayed on the surface of yeast has revealed residues tolerant of mutational changes that may act as a source for drug resistance and antigenic drift. EXPERT OPINION: Deep mutagenesis requires a selection of diverse sequence variants; an in vitro evolution experiment that is tracked with next-generation sequencing. The choice of expression system, diversity of the variant library and selection strategy have important consequences for data quality and interpretation.","Procko, Erik",Expert Rev Proteomics,412,1

Based on this, we aimed to show the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of this drug molecule via in vitro, in silico, and molecular techniques. Ribavirin showed antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the drug itself did not show any toxic effect over the concentration range tested. In silico analysis suggested that ribavirin has a broad-spectrum impact on SARS-CoV-2, acting at different viral proteins. According to the detailed molecular techniques, ribavirin was shown to decrease the expression of TMPRSS2 at both mRNA and protein levels 48 h after treatment. The suppressive effect of ribavirin in ACE2 protein expression was shown to be dependent on cell types. Finally, proteolytic activity assays showed that ribavirin also showed an inhibitory effect on the TMPRSS2 enzyme. Based on these results, we hypothesized that ribavirin may inhibit the expression of TMPRSS2 by modulating the formation of inhibitory G-quadruplex structures at the TMPRSS2 promoter. As a conclusion, ribavirin is a potential antiviral drug for the treatment against SARS-CoV-2, and it interferes with the effects of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression.","Unal, Mehmet Altay; Bitirim, Ceylan Verda; Summak, Gokce Yagmur; Bereketoglu, Sidar; Cevher Zeytin, Inci; Besbinar, Omur; Gurcan, Cansu; Aydos, Dunya; Goksoy, Ezgi; Kocakaya, Ebru; Eran, Zeynep; Murat, Merve; Demir, Nil; Aksoy Ozer, Zeynep Busra; Somers, Julia; Demir, Emek; Nazir, Hasan; Ozkan, Sibel Aysil; Ozkul, Aykut; Azap, Alpay; Yilmazer, Acelya; Akcali, Kamil Can",Can J Physiol Pharmacol,412,16

After an initial period with a low incidence of newly infected people, a power-law growth of the number of confirmed cases is observed. For each country, a distinct growth exponent is obtained. For Belgium, UK, and USA, countries with a large number of infected people, after the power-law growth, a distinct behavior is obtained when approaching saturation. Brazil is still in the power-law regime. Such updates of the data and projections corroborate recent results regarding the power-law growth of the virus and their strong Distance Correlation between some countries around the world. Furthermore, we show that act in time is one of the most relevant non-pharmacological weapons that the health organizations have in the battle against the COVID-19, infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus.

In a survey conducted within the first days of implementing social distancing measures in Austria and Germany, we aimed to explore the pathways from threat perception to preferences of defense strategies. We found that anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance were specifically elicited by motivational (vs. epistemic) discrepancies. In a second step, we tested the mediating effect of anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance on preferences regarding personal-social and concrete-abstract defenses. Experiencing anxiety was related to interest in security-related actions, and approach-affect was related to both personal projects and social media use. Participants experiencing reactance were more inclined to pursue personal projects (personal-abstract) and less interested in security-related (personal-concrete) actions. They also showed marginally lower system justification (social-abstract). Additionally, we examined the relationship of loneliness with defense strategies, showing that loneliness was associated with lower system justification and security behaviors. The results suggest that individuals deal with threat in their own ways, mostly depending on affective state and motivational orientation: Anxiety was related to security, approach-state to action (both social and personal), reactance to derogation of the system and disregard for security, while loneliness was associated with inaction.","Reiss, Stefan; Franchina, Vittoria; Jutzi, Chiara; Willardt, Robin; Jonas, Eva",PLoS One,412,24

METHODS: The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used to evaluate telehealth physical therapy implementation. Patient-level data were extracted from electronic medical records between the dates of March 16 and May 16, 2020 (implementation phase). Reach was defined as the proportion of physical therapy sessions completed via telehealth. Effectiveness was assessed using a patient-reported satisfaction survey with a 5-point Likert scale. Adoption was defined as the proportion of physical therapists who used telehealth. Implementation was assessed through qualitative analysis of patient and clinician perspectives to identify emergent themes, retrospectively classify strategies used during the implementation phase, and prospectively identify evidence-based strategies to increase telehealth maintenance and scale-up. Maintenance of telehealth was defined as the proportion of patients who indicated they would attend another telehealth session. RESULTS: There were 4548 physical therapy sessions provided by 40 therapists from date to date, of which 3883 (85%) were telehealth. Ninety-four percent of patients were satisfied. All physical therapists (100%) used telehealth technology at least once. Retrospectively classified and prospectively identified evidence-based strategies were organized into five qualitative themes that supported implementation: organizational factors (policies, pre-existing partnerships), engaging external stakeholders (satisfaction survey), champions (clinician leaders), clinician education (dynamic, ongoing training), and process (promote adaptability, small tests of change). Ninety-two percent of patients reported they would attend another telehealth session. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that implementation of telehealth physical therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic was feasible and acceptable in this setting. IMPACT: These results can be used to guide future health policy, quality improvement, and implementation science initiatives to expand the use and study of telehealth for physical therapy.","Miller, Matthew J; Pak, Sang S; Keller, Daniel R; Barnes, Deborah E",Phys. ther,412,21

Angiotensin II is the central effector molecule of the activated renin-angiotensin system and is degraded by the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to angiotensin (1-7). The novel coronavirus infection (classified as COVID-19) is caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and is characterized by an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to severe manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and death in a proportion of patients, mostly elderly patients with preexisting comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor to enter the target cells, resulting in activation of the renin-angiotensin system. After downregulating the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II is increasingly produced and its counterregulating molecules angiotensin (1-7) reduced. Angiotensin II increases thrombin formation and impairs fibrinolysis. Elevated levels were strongly associated with viral load and lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19. Therefore, the complex clinical picture of patients with severe complications of COVID-19 is triggered by the various effects of highly expressed angiotensin II on vasculopathy, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Future treatment options should focus on blocking the thrombogenic and inflammatory properties of angiotensin II in COVID-19 patients.","Miesbach, Wolfgang",TH Open,412,4

Since controlled production of DAMPs and SAMPs is needed to achieve full homeostatic restoration and repair from tissue injury, only their pathological, not their homeostatic, concentrations should be therapeutically tackled. Therefore, distinct caveats are proposed regarding choosing DAMPs and SAMPs for therapeutic purposes. For example, we discuss the need to a priori identify and define a context-dependent ""homeostatic DAMP:SAMP ratio"" in each case and a ""homeostatic window"" of DAMP and SAMP concentrations to guarantee a safe treatment modality to patients. Finally, a few clinical examples of how DAMPs and SAMPs might be used as therapeutic targets or therapeutics in the future are discussed, including inhibition of DAMPs in hyperinflammatory processes (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome, as currently observed in Covid-19), administration of SAMPs in chronic inflammatory diseases, inhibition of SAMPs in hyperresolving processes (e.g., compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome), and administration/induction of DAMPs in vaccination procedures and anti-cancer therapy.","Land, Walter Gottlieb",Mol Diagn Ther,412,20

Methods: Hospitalised patients with moderate (n = 5) and severe (n = 5) COVID-19 were recruited and transfused with CP from donors who recovered from mild (n = 5), moderate (n = 5), or severe (n = 1) COVID-19. Neutralising antibodies (NAbs) to the virus were measured at the end of the study using a surrogate virus neutralisation test as an alternative to the plaque reduction assay. Clinical improvement was assessed based on the modified World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint six-point scale, Brixia Chest-X-Ray scoring, and laboratory parameters. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04407208). Findings: CP transfusion in three doses of 3 mL/kg of recipient body weight at 2-day intervals was well tolerated. Good clinical improvement was achieved in all patients with moderate disease and in two patients with severe disease. Most patients at baseline had detectable NAbs with median inhibition rates comparable to those of the donors (90·91% vs. 86·31%; p = 0·379). This could be due to the unavailability of pre-donation NAb testing and postponed CP administration that required communal consent. Interpretation: This study highlights the safety of CP therapy. Although improvements were observed, we could not conclude that the outcomes were solely due to CP treatment. Further randomised controlled trials that cover different disease stages with pre-donation NAb measurements using locally applicable strategies are warranted.

One patient population that may suffer from poor outcomes during the pandemic are those with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Many practices are performing some form of teleophthalmology services for their patients, and guidance is needed on how to maintain continuity of care amongst patients with AMD using teleophthalmology. METHODS: A literature search was conducted, ending 1 August 2020, to identify AMD outcomes and telecare management strategies that could be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 237 total articles were retrieved, 56 of which were included for analysis. Four American Academy of Ophthalmology and Center for Disease Control web resources were also included. DISCUSSION: Risk-stratification models have been developed that let providers readily screen existing patients for their future risk of neovascular AMD (nAMD). When used with at-home monitoring devices to detect nAMD, providers may be able to determine who should be contacted via teleophthalmology for screening. Telemedicine triage can be used for new complaints of vision loss to determine who should be referred to a retinal specialist for management of suspected nAMD. To increase access and provider flexibility, smartphone fundus photography images sent to a centralized teleophthalmology service can aid in the detection of nAMD. Considerations should also be made for COVID-19 transmission, and teleophthalmology can be used to screen patients for the presence of COVID-19 prior to in-person office visits. Teleophthalmology has additional utility in connecting with nursing home, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients in the post-pandemic period.","Mintz, Joel; Labiste, Chase; DiCaro, Michael V; McElroy, Evan; Alizadeh, Reza; Xu, Kunyong",J Telemed Telecare,412,16

Appreciating that most learners struggle with such an abrupt shift in delivery mode, especially one that depends on self-directed learning (SDL), this exploratory, qualitative study solicited data in May 2020 from a convenience sample of 20 Saudi female postgraduate students enrolled at a public university in the Eastern Province of SA. Findings affirmed that SDL via CDE contributed to their educational growth, and they will continue to engage with SDL after the health crisis ends. In short, their SDL CDE experience changed the way they will approach their education in the future. Their high level of SDL allowed them to assume responsibility for their learning. They especially gained an appreciation for the role of reflection, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation. SDL both instilled and promoted self-confidence, self-reliance, commitment, and perseverance. Implications for future research were tendered and universities are encouraged to intentionally build learning environments that support learner-centered and self-directed learning to move the country through and beyond the COVID 19 pandemic.","Alghamdi, Amani",Journal of University Teaching and Learning Practice,412,16

To expel the chain of alteration and subversive expansion, early and effective diagnosis of infected patients is immensely important. Unfortunately, there is a lack of testing equipment in many countries as compared with the number of infected patients. It would be desirable to have a swift diagnosis with identification of COVID-19 from disease genes or from CT or X-Ray images. COVID-19 causes flus, cough, pneumonia, and lung infection in patients, wherein massive alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure can lead to death. This paper proposes two different detection methods - the first is a Gene-based screening method to detect Corona diseases (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and Human coronavirus HKU1) and differentiate it from Pneumonia. This novel approach to healthcare utilizes disease genes to build functional semantic similarity among genes. Different machine learning algorithms - eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes, Regularized Random Forest, Random Forest Rule-Based Model, Random Ferns, C5.0 and Multi-Layer Perceptron, are trained and tested on the semantic similarities to classify Corona and Pneumonia diseases. The best performing models are then ensembled, yielding an accuracy of nearly 93%. The second diagnosis technique proposed herein is an automated COVID-19 diagnostic method which uses chest X-ray images to classify Normal versus COVID-19 and Pneumonia versus COVID-19 images using the deep-CNN technique, achieving 99.87% and 99.48% test accuracy. Thus, this research can be an assistance for providing better treatment against COVID-19.","Habib, Nahida; Rahman, Mohammad Motiur",Inform Med Unlocked,412,25

METHODS: Individuals receiving services during May 8-18, 2020, from behavioral health programs that had introduced telehealth in March 2020, were invited to participate in a survey regarding their perceptions of the telehealth services. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to test for differences in survey responses in three ways: between program types, between the 2020 sample and a 2018 sample, and between individuals reported by staff to be distressed or not distressed by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Of 1,482 survey respondents, >80% reported that their ability to connect to staff, receive support, and get an appointment was at least as great as before the pandemic. Among 80% of respondents indicating interest in continuing remote services after the pandemic ended, 83% preferred a mix of remote and face-to-face services. From February 2020 to April 2020, total service utilization remained stable for treatment, outreach, and housing programs. In addition, mental health-related hospital utilization did not increase. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that telehealth, including telephone-based services, is an acceptable and even preferred service delivery mode for clients with severe mental illness. Continued investigation into the optimal dosing of face-to-face versus remote services in various settings is needed to inform service practice during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tse, Jeanie; LaStella, Drew; Chow, Elisa; Kingman, Emily; Pearlman, Shoshannah; Valeri, Linda; Wang, Hao; Dixon, Lisa B",Psychiatr Serv,412,26

A total of 41 patients were included in the study. Before the pandemic began they had been seen at our unit at weekly intervals. During lockdown from March 9, 2020, to May 18, 2020 subjects were not allowed to enter the hospital unless they needed urgency or emergency surgery, or oncological management. During the second lockdown, from October 19, 2020, to December 11, 2020 patients could be followed up at distance by direct outreach including telephoning contacts. Data obtained early after each lockdown were compared with those obtained prior to the pandemic. Data for the first lockdown show that pain intensified and there was an increase in the recurrence rate of wounds, of their severity, and of superimposed infections as compared with the prelockdown period. The risk of lower-limb amputation was also considerably greater. During the second and less restrictive lockdown, patients were followed up by telemedicine and data indicate that skin lesions had not worsened any further. The management of vascular wounds was impacted by the pandemic unfavorably with health care failures in the hospital as well as in the primary care settings. In conclusion, the treatment of vascular leg ulcers is challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic as this spreads worldwide. This seems to be in keeping with what happens for other diseases. The data we obtained indicate that the pandemic-related lockdown has a deleterious effect on vascular skin wounds, with an increase of severity and mortality risk. The impact appears to be proportional to the number and the degree of limitations imposed on people.","Sallustro, Marianna; Florio, Anna",Int J Low Extrem Wounds,412,2

Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS: A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV.

People and authorities resort to social media platforms the most to share awareness information and voice out their opinions due to their massive outreach in spreading the word in practically no time. People use a number of languages to communicate over social media platforms based on their familiarity, language outreach, and availability on social media platforms.

We investigated the impact of a variety of stressful life events on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and hostility. Methods: We analyzed data from a large prospective cohort study of men (n = 1,437) in the Boston area (assessed in 1985, 1988, and 1991). Main outcomes were measures of depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms. We used the Elders Life Stress Inventory (ELSI) to measure stressful life events in the past 12 months and examine their association with symptoms of depression, anxiety and hostility. First, we analyzed the association of stressful life events with symptom changes; second, we categorized stressful life events into finance/work, health, relationships, loss, living situations events; and third, we estimated the specific association between relationship events and depression, anxiety and hostility symptoms using multilevel models. Results: The most frequent stressful life events were health, relationship, and financial events. Depression, anxiety, and hostility symptoms were relatively stable among men who did not experience these life events. However, those who reported life events in the past 12 months had a greater increase in symptoms of depression (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and of hostility (+0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.09) than those who did not. Additionally, we found a significant decrease in hostility (−0.05; 95% CI: −0.08 to −0.01) in those experiencing no life events. Conclusion: Relationship events were more important than any other type of events, and were significantly associated with increased depression and hostility in aging men. Although the effects were small, the results point to a need to understand better the impact of relationships on psychopathology in the aging population.","Lindert, Jutta; Lee, Lewina O.; Weisskopf, Marc G.; McKee, Martin; Sehner, Susanne; Spiro, Avron",Front Psychiatry,412,26

Preceding RVIs were detected in 48 patients, including influenza A virus (n = 20), influenza B virus (n = 4), parainfluenza viruses (n = 5), metapneumovirus (n = 4), rhinovirus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial viruses (n = 6), coronaviruses (n = 2), and mixed viral infections (n = 3). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, preceding RVIs (odds ratio [OR], 2·49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1·10–5·60), male sex (OR, 2·58; 95% CI, 1·24–5·38), old age (OR, 2·92; 95% CI, 1·37–6·24), hypoalbuminemia (OR, 3·26; 95% CI, 1·56–6·84)], and azotemia (OR, 2·24; 95% CI, 1·08–4·67) were significantly associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that preceding RVIs might be one of the risk factors affecting the clinical severity of pneumococcal pneumonia.","Yoon, Young Kyung; Yang, Kyung Sook; Sohn, Jang Wook; Lee, Chang Kyu; Kim, Min Ja",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,412,21

However, the current treatment options for pneumonia are limited because of drug resistance and side effects. Our previous study preliminarily confirmed that Yinlai Decoction (YD), a common prescription for pneumonia in clinical practice, can regulate the expression of inflammatory factors, but the mechanisms are unknown yet. METHODS: In our work, a method named network pharmacology was applied, which investigated the underlying mechanisms of herbs based on a variety of databases. We obtained bioactive ingredients of YD on TCMSP database and collected potential targets of these ingredients by target fishing. Then the pneumonia-related targets database was built by TTD, Drugbank, HPO, OMIM, and CTD. Based on the matching targets between YD and pneumonia, the PPI network was built by STRING to analyze the interactions among these targets and then input into Cytoscape for further topological analysis. DAVID and KEGG were utilized for GO and pathway enrichment analysis. Then rat model based on LPS stimulated pneumonia was used to verify the possible mechanism of YD in treating pneumonia. RESULTS: Sixty-eight active ingredients, 103 potential targets and 8 related pathways, which likely exert a number of effects, were identified. Three networks were constructed using Cytoscape, which were herb-component-network, YD-pneumonia target network, and herb-component-YD target-pneumonia network. YD was verified to treat LPS-induced pneumonia by regulating the inflammatory factor IL-6, which was a predicted target. CONCLUSION: Network analysis indicated that YD could alleviate the symptoms and signs of pneumonia through regulating host immune inflammatory response, angiogenesis and vascular permeability, the barrier function of the airway epithelial cells, hormone releasing and cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis.","Xu, Jingnan; Bai, Chen; Huang, Ling; Liu, Tiegang; Wan, Yuxiang; Zheng, Zian; Ma, Xueyan; Gao, Fei; Yu, He; Gu, Xiaohong",BMC Complement Med Ther,412,28

RESULTS: Employee perceptions of safety and health climates were significantly related to their self-reported well-being during the first wave of COVID-19, even when there were changes to childcare, the ability to work, and limited social contacts. CONCLUSION: Safety and health climates may influence employee well-being even when other disruptions occur, suggesting that during emergencies, small businesses with strong climates may be better prepared to maintain employee well-being.","Brown, Carol E.; Schwatka, Natalie; Dexter, Lynn; Dally, Miranda; Shore, Erin; Tenney, Liliana; Newman, Lee S.",J Occup Environ Med,412,1

These impacts have been known to come in the form of transit-induced gentrification (TIG), a socioeconomic by-product of TOD defined as a phenomenon that occurs when the provision of transit service, particularly light rail transit (LRT), ‘up-scales’ nearby neighbourhood(s) and displaces existing residents. Consequently, TIG or even the perception of TIG can impact health outcomes (eg, anxiety) and social determinants of health (SDOH) (eg, crime). METHODS/ANALYSIS: In 2022, the purple line (PL), a 16.2 mile LRT line, is opening in Prince George’s County, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, DC, comprised of over 80% African American and Hispanic residents. By taking advantage of this natural experiment, we are proposing the GENTS (Gauging Effects of Neighborhood Trends and Sickness: Examining the Perceptions of Transit-Induced Gentrification in Prince George’s County) Study in order to evaluate perceived TIG and associated health outcome and SDOH changes, at two points in time, among Prince George’s County adults in a prospective case-comparison design during the pre-PL LRT period. Descriptive analysis and latent growth curve modelling will be used to examine these changes over time. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval has been granted by the University of Maryland Institutional Review Board. The GENTS Study will identify temporal changes in perceived TIG, health outcomes and SDOH among case and comparison residents before the completion and operation of the PL LRT, an under researched period of TOD. The dissemination of GENTS Study findings will be able to address research questions and policy issues that are specifically tailored to PG County while also providing more effective procedural solutions for other regions undergoing TOD and TIG risks.","Roberts, Jennifer D; Tehrani, Shadi O; Isom, Jr, Roger; Stone, Eric A; Brachman, Micah L; Garcia, Valerie Newsome",BMJ Open,412,16

Méthode: Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats: Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement, et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité COVID+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière.

Abstract Objective: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods: authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: 1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with covid-19; 2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); 3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and 4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of COVID + units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist / infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. Discussion: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R",Encephale,412,33

The so-called ‘exponential growth bias' is of new relevance in the context of COVID-19, because it explains why humans have fundamental difficulties to grasp the magnitude of a spreading epidemic. Here, we addressed the question, whether logarithmic scaling and contextual framing of epidemiological data affect the anticipation of exponential growth. Our findings show that underestimations were most pronounced when growth curves were linearly scaled and framed in the context of a more advanced epidemic progression. For logarithmic scaling, estimates were much more accurate, on target for growth rates around 31%, and not affected by contextual framing. We conclude that the logarithmic depiction is conducive for detecting exponential growth during an early phase as well as resurgences of exponential growth.","Hutzler, Florian; Richlan, Fabio; Leitner, Michael Christian; Schuster, Sarah; Braun, Mario; Hawelka, Stefan",Royal Society open science,412,1

METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients with, or suspected of having, coronavirus disease 2019 were collected and tested at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital, Paris, France. Using the World Heath Organisation-approved real-time-PCR assay developed by the Charité Institute of Virology as the reference, positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 189 negative and 88 positive samples were analysed. QIAstat-SARS-CoV-2 had a NPA of 90.48% (95% confidence interval (CI), 85.37%, 94.26%) and a PPA of 94.32% (95% CI, 87.24%, 98.13%).

Pregnant women are considered more vulnerable to severe viral respiratory infections owing to the physiological changes in pregnancy. In COVID-19, patient can present with a variety of symptoms of which dyspnoea is one that is also commonly seen in the late stages of pregnancy. The clinical presentation as well as response to therapy is highly variable, and since no conclusive proven treatment is available yet, prevention and symptomatic treatment remains the mainstay of management. Thus, we report a case series of four SARS-CoV-2-positive obstetric patients who presented with severe ARDS in a tertiary care hospital, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges to the clinician, and were managed with a holistic multidisciplinary stepwise approach. Through this, an effort has been made to sensitize the attending obstetrician on diverse presentation of COVID-19 disease and to emphasize the importance of prevention, early pick up, and timely optimal management of pneumonia in pregnant females with COVID-19. The clinical presentation of respiratory illness due to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy can be mistaken for exaggerated physiological changes of pregnancy leading to delay in seeking medical care. During the current pandemic, high suspicion for COVID-19 should be kept.

In this case report, we describe our first case of COVID-19 pneumonia that was complicated by cerebral venous thrombosis and bleeding in a patient with polycythemia vera. Madam A, a 72-year-old lady with polycythemia vera, ischemic stroke, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir as per hospital protocol. She continued taking hydroxyurea and aspirin for her treatment of polycythemia vera. Subsequently, she developed rectal bleeding when her platelet count was 1247 × 10(3)/μl, even though she was not on an anticoagulant. Her aspirin was withheld. One week later, she was readmitted to the hospital for cerebral venous thrombosis and her D-dimer was 2.02 μg/ml. She was commenced on a therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin. Following that, her D-dimer level showed a decreasing trend and normalized upon her discharge. Patients with polycythemia vera are prone to develop thrombotic and bleeding complications. Management of this group of patients has become more complex with COVID-19 infection. It is crucial for us to decide when to start an anticoagulant especially when there is a history of recent bleeding. We need to balance the risks of further bleeding versus potentially fatal thrombotic events. Studies have shown that D-dimer can be used as a clinical marker to predict thrombotic events in COVID-19 infection. Patients with COVID-19 infection and polycythemia vera will benefit from both pharmacological thromboprophylaxis and close monitoring for bleeding.","Chow, Lai Chee; Chew, Lee Ping; Leong, Tze Shin; Mohamad Tazuddin, Estrellita Elena; Chua, Hock Hin",SN Compr Clin Med,412,20

METHOD: A total of 55 nasal swab samples from the first wave in Hiroshima and 13 from the second wave were examined quantitatively by RT-qPCR and qualitatively by nested PCR using specific primers. Four samples from each wave underwent next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis including controls and all sequences retrieved in Japan from GISAID and GenBank. Subsequently, mutations were examined. RESULTS: Viral load ranged 7.85 × 10(1)−1.42 × 10(8) copies/ml. Of 68 samples, one was Asian type-O, 65 were European type-GR, and 2 were undetectable. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that Japan was infected with various Asian strains (L, S, V, O) from January through April. By second week of March, European strains (G, GH, GR) had appeared, and GR strains became predominant after mid-March. The first case in Hiroshima was classified as Asian strain O, and the rest were GR strains. Then, second wave of GR strains appeared independently with 11–15 base mutations. Comparing the first- and second-wave GR strains, mutation rate was 1.17–1.36 × 10(−3) base substitutions per site per year; in addition, amino acid changes occurred at S1361P and P3371S in ORF1a, A314V in ORF1b, and P151L in N. All seven GR strains were D614G variants with R202K and G203R mutations in N. A single-nucleotide insertion in ORF8 that causes a defect in ORF8 protein was found in one isolate (S66) from the second wave. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal the evolutionary hierarchy of SARS-CoV-2 in Japan. The predominant D614G variants and a new form of ORF8 deletion in Hiroshima provide the clue for role of viral factor in local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2.","Ko, Ko; Nagashima, Shintaro; E., Bunthen; Ouoba, Serge; Akita, Tomoyuki; Sugiyama, Aya; Ohisa, Masayuki; Sakaguchi, Takemasa; Tahara, Hidetoshi; Ohge, Hiroki; Ohdan, Hideki; Kubo, Tatsuhiko; Kishita, Eisaku; Kuwabara, Masao; Takahashi, Kazuaki; Tanaka, Junko",PLoS One,412,32

However, no direct comparison with the general population is available so far. The aim of this study is to detail mental health outcomes in healthcare workers compared to the general population. METHODS: 24050 respondents completed an on-line questionnaire during the contagion peak, 21342 general population, 1295 second-line healthcare workers, and 1411 front-line healthcare workers. Depressive, anxious, post-traumatic symptoms and insomnia were assessed. Specific COVID-19 related potential risk factors were also considered in healthcare workers. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms were more frequent in the general population (28.12%) and front-line healthcare workers (28.35%) compared to the second-line healthcare workers (19.98%) groups. Anxiety symptoms showed a prevalence of 21.25% in the general population, 18.05% for second-line healthcare workers, and 20.55% for front-line healthcare workers. Insomnia showed a prevalence of 7.82, 6.58, and 9.92% for the general population, second-line healthcare workers, and front-line healthcare workers, respectively. Compared to the general population, front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing total trauma-related symptoms. Both second-line healthcare workers and front-line healthcare workers had higher odds of endorsing core post-traumatic symptoms compared to the general population, while second-line healthcare workers had lower odds of endorsing negative affect and dissociative symptoms. Higher total traumatic symptom score was associated with being a front-line healthcare worker, having a colleague infected, hospitalized, or deceased, being a nurse, female gender, and younger age. CONCLUSION: This study suggests a significant psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Italian general population and healthcare workers. Front-line healthcare workers represent a specific at-risk population for post-traumatic symptoms. These findings underline the importance of monitoring and intervention strategies.","Rossi, Rodolfo; Socci, Valentina; Pacitti, Francesca; Mensi, Sonia; Di Marco, Antinisca; Siracusano, Alberto; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio",Front Psychol,412,16

Objectives: We assess the prevalence of co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with seasonal respiratory viruses, document the respiratory viruses detected among individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, and describe characteristics of individuals with respiratory virus co-infection detected. Methods: Specimens included in this study were submitted as part of routine clinical testing to Public Health Ontario Laboratory from individuals requiring testing for SARS-CoV-2 and/or seasonal respiratory viruses. Results: Co-infection was detected in a smaller proportion (2.5%) of individuals with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 than those with seasonal respiratory viruses (4.3%); this difference was not significant. Individuals with any respiratory virus co-infection were more likely to be younger than 65 years of age and male than those with single infection. Those with SARS-CoV-2 co-infection manifested mostly mild respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: Findings of this study may not support routine testing for seasonal respiratory viruses among all individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, as they were rare during the study period nor associated with severe disease. However, testing for seasonal respiratory viruses should be performed in severely ill individuals, in which detection of other viruses may assist with patient management.","Peci, Adriana; Tran, Vanessa; Guthrie, Jennifer L.; Li, Ye; Nelson, Paul; Schwartz, Kevin L.; Eshaghi, AliReza; Buchan, Sarah A.; Gubbay, Jonathan B.",Viruses,412,1

The disagreement results, in part, from the interpretation of studies that report a proportion of asymptomatic people with SARS-CoV-2 detected at a single point. Review questions: 1. Amongst people who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, what proportion does not experience symptoms at all during their infection? 2. Amongst people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are asymptomatic when diagnosed, what proportion will develop symptoms later? 3. What proportion of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is accounted for by people who are either asymptomatic throughout infection, or pre-symptomatic? Methods: Rapid living systematic review (protocol https://osf.io/9ewys/). We searched Pubmed, Embase, bioRxiv and medRxiv using a living evidence database of SARS-CoV-2 literature on 25.03.2020. We included studies of people with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) that documented follow-up and symptom status at the beginning and end of follow-up and modelling studies. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment were done by one reviewer and verified by a second, with disagreement resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. We used a common-effect model to synthesise proportions from comparable studies. Results: We screened 89 studies and included 11. We estimated an upper bound for the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections of 29% (95% confidence interval 23 to 37%) in eight studies. Selection bias and likely publication bias affected the family case investigation studies. One statistical modelling study estimated the true proportion of asymptomatic infections at 18% (95% credibility interval 16 to 20%). Estimates of the proportions of pre-symptomatic individual in four studies were too heterogeneous to combine. In modelling studies, 40-60% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are the result of transmission from pre-symptomatic individuals, with a smaller contribution from asymptomatic individuals. Conclusions: An intermediate contribution of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections to overall SARS-CoV-2 transmission means that combination prevention, with enhanced hand and respiratory hygiene, testing tracing and isolation strategies and social distancing, will continue to be needed. The findings of this systematic review of publications early in the pandemic suggests that most SARS-CoV-2 infections are not asymptomatic throughout the course of infection.","Buitrago-Garcia, D.

Treatment is limited, and mortality has surpassed 2.4 million deaths as in February, 2021. Therefore, several different therapeutic strategies are being investigated, including the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our group has previously published an analysis of the world-wide effort to investigate the use of stem cells for COVID-19 in July 2020 (Saldanha-Araújo, 2020). Here, we provide an update to such a compendium of clinical trials. Methods Using the terms “COVID-19” and “stem cells”, we searched studies in the ClinicalTrials.gov database, the World Health Organization‘s International Clinical Trials Registration Platform, and the European Union Registry of Clinical Trials in June 2020 and February 2021. Results A total of 119 clinical studies was considered, among which 99 studies aim to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs and derivatives in the treatment of COVID-19. The country with the higher number of studies was China. The most frequent tissue sources of MSCs were: umbilical cord; Wharton‘s Jelly, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. Six studies used MSC-derived exosomes. Most studies chose the intravenous route for cell therapy administration, but the inhalation route was also observed. Cell doses ranged between 0.5 × 106 and 1 × 107 cells/kg. Number of doses varied from 1 to 20 (twice/day inhalation for 10 days). Most studies are still in the recruitment process, and 2 have completed their studies and published their data. Several studies failed to describe MSC tissue source, administration route, and/or study phase. Conclusion Taken together, the present data reveals that stem cells and stem cell-derived strategies are still experimental therapies for COVID-19 treatment. Since July 2020, only one new scientific manuscript has been published describing clinical results from stem cell therapy for COVID-19. Similar to July 2020, published studies show that 51 patients received stem cell and stem cell-derived therapies and support the notion that the procedure is safe and effective in the short term for severe and critically ill patients. Long term follow-up and optimization of therapeutic regimen are still needed. The lack of complete detailed data from published studies are a challenge and compromise any further conclusions at this point.","Garcez, EM; Saldanha-Araujo, F; Silva-Carvalho, AE; Carvalho, JL",Cytotherapy,412,1

To identify factors that motivate or fail to motivate patients to update their vaccination status would help to design future strategies and awareness campaigns. Objective: Our aim was to assess the impact of primary care physicians on the immunization status of their adult patients, and to explore possible explanations. Methods: We invited students and collaborators of Geneva University to bring their paper vaccination records to receive an assessment of their immunization status and personalized vaccination recommendations. Participants completed a first questionnaire at the recruitment phase, and a second 2–3 months later. We assessed their immunization status with the viavac algorithms based on the Swiss national immunization plan. Results: Having a primary care physician did not correlate with better immunization status: only 22.5% patients who reported having a physician and 20% who reported having no physician were up-to-date (n = 432; p > 0.5). A linear regression indicates that the frequency of medical consultations did not affect patients' immunization status either. Even the participants who recently showed their vaccination record to their primary care physician did not have a better vaccination status. We explored possible explanatory factors and found evidence for the patients' overconfidence about their own immunization status: 71.2% of the participants who predicted that they were up-to-date were wrong about their actual status, and 2–3 months after having received their immunization assessment, 52.8% of the participants who “remembered” having received the assessment that they were up-to-date were wrong: they had in fact received the opposite information that they were not up-to-date. This substantial proportion of wrong beliefs suggests that adult patients are unworried and overconfident about their own immunization status, which is likely to induce a passive resistance toward vaccination updating. Conclusions: This study indicates that the vaccination coverage and beliefs of adults about their immunization status is suboptimal, and that primary care physicians need further support to improve their health-protection mandate through routine immunization check-ups. We highlight that the current covid vaccination campaigns offer a rare opportunity to update patients' immunization status and urge physicians to do so.","Papis, Thibaut; Clavien, Christine",Front Med (Lausanne),412,20

Its objectives were to: understand areas where modelling terms, methods and results are unclear; share information on how modelling can best be used in informing policy and improving practice, particularly regarding the ways to integrate a focus on health equity considerations; and sustain and advance collaborative work in the development and application of modelling in public health. METHOD: The Use of Mathematical Modelling in Public Health Decision Making for Infectious Diseases workshop brought together research modellers, public health professionals, policymakers and other experts from across the country. Invited presentations set the context for topical discussions in three sessions. A final session generated reflections and recommendations for new opportunities and tasks.

The dogma is that virus transmission happens through either respiratory droplets or contact routes. However, it is likely not the whole truth, as we describe scenarios where droplets and/or direct contact cannot alone explain how all patients were infected.

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented several challenges and has ushered in several changes in practice such as teledermatology, with many physicians adopting virtual consultations and treatments. Performing procedures in the times of COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges such as risk of transmission to doctors and staff due to potential aerosolization, release of virus droplets during the procedures, and risk of virus transfer through the instruments both in the peri- and postoperative period. This can have several medical, administrative, and legal implications. OBJECTIVES: This document aimed to outline best practices that can be followed in this scenario to perform cutaneous surgeries and procedures to ensure safer skin surgery. RECOMMENDATIONS: Standard precautions include social distancing of at least 1 m, hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), safe injection practices, sterilization and disinfection of medical devices, environmental cleaning, and respiratory hygiene. It is generally advisable to see patients only by appointments. Each clinic should have a special area at entry for screening patients and providing sanitizers and masks. Procedures, which are of short duration, performed on nonfacial areas are considered as low risk and require donning surgical mask. Procedures involved with minimal invasiveness and bleeding, short duration procedures on the face such as injectables, chemical peels, and aerosol-generating procedures on nonfacial areas are considered moderate risk. These procedures need apron with head cover, N95 mask, face shield, double gloves, and smoke evacuator with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) or ultralow particulate air (ULPA) filter. Aerosol and plume-regenerating procedures (such as ablative lasers on the face), prolonged surgeries on head (such as hair transplantation), intraoral, and intranasal procedures are considered high risk. These procedures must be carried out with full body cover with surgical gown, head cover, N95 mask, face shield, double gloves, and smoke evacuator.

Background: Vaccination is one of the effective measures to prevent COVID-19, but the vaccination acceptance varies across countries and populations. As reserve nurses, nursing students have both the professionalism of medical personnel and the special characteristics of school students, their attitudes, knowledge, and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine may greatly affect the vaccine acceptance of the population now and in the future. But little research has been done on vaccine acceptance among nursing students. Design: A cross-sectional survey of nursing students was conducted via online questionnaires in March 2021. Methods: Descriptive statistics, independent sample t tests/one-way ANOVA (normal distribution), Mann-Whitney U tests/Kruskal-Wallis H tests (skewness distribution) and multivariate linear regression were performed. Results: The score rate of attitude, knowledge and vaccination willingness were 70.07%, 80.70% and 84.38% respectively.

Multiple efforts are ongoing to control COVID19 pandemic, and clinical practice is being adapted at the same time as the pandemic progresses around the world. To reduce unnecessary in-person appointments has become crucial to minimize hospital exposition. Digital technologies allow us to perform real-time monitoring of patients' clinical status. A real-time patient monitoring system through the use of a smartphone application and wearable devices was implemented at our Center during the COVID19 pandemic. Methods Since March 2020, a real time patient monitoring system was implemented at our HCT program. All consecutive adults patients transplanted between April 2020 and July 2020 were considered for the study. Vital signs and relevant clinical information were reported during 14 consecutive days after being discharged, through the online platform provided by Trilema Fundation (saludencasa.trilema.org, Fundación Trilema, Valencia, Spain). Vital signs (cardiac frequency, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) were measured with validated oxymeters (Onyx II®, Nonin Inc, Plymouth MN USA) and blood pressure monitors (iHealth Track®, Mountain View, CA USA). Temperature was measured through domiciliary thermometers. Patients were educated to measure their respiratory frequency. A checklist of clinical symptoms was filled daily. An analogue visual scale (0-10) to detect potential cases of anxiety or depressive disorders was reported daily. Scores of >6 were evaluated by a psycho-oncologist through videoconference. All the data were reported to the online platform using a smartphone app compatible with iPhone and Android systems. A direct chat between patients and physician was available through the app. Clinical information was daily supervised by an experienced HCT hematologist. Clinical interventions were arranged if significant clinical abnormalities were documented. A hematologist with experience in HCT patients revised all the patients’ data daily. Programmed alarms were set in case of any of the following situations: fever >38 oC; oxygen saturation <92%; tachicardia >125/bpm, hypotension (sytolic<90 mmHg, diastolic > 60 mmHg; altered mental status; persistent emesis or diarrhea). Patient´s satisfaction questionnaires were evaluated individually after finalizing the 14-days clinical monitoring. Results During the study period, 21 adults underwent HCT and 16 were s were eligible to be recruited into the study (80% feasibility) with team effort and without additional costs. Reasons for not being enrolled were: language incompatibility (1 patient), no consent (1 patient), not compatible smartphone (3 patients). Of the 16 enrolled patients, median age was 50 (range 22-70 years), 37% were female and 94% had lymphoid diseases. Thirty-eight percent of HCTs were autologous and 62% allogeneic. Of the 16 enrolled patients, 25% were not able to adequately use the app due to inability in using smartphone applications. Of the remaining 12 patients, adherence in reporting study data (number of days reported of the planned 14 days study period) was as follows (average): temperature 89%, oxygen saturation 90%, respiratory frequency 70%, cardiac frequency 85%, blood pressure 89%, symptoms reporting 65%, emotional distress 71%. Automatic alarms were activated only 3 times: twice for the presence of clinical symptoms and once, for emotional distress. A videoconference with the psycho-oncologist was requested by one patient only. The chat service to communicate with hospital personnel was used in 4 patients. Data collected with the digital system helped the clinician to early recognize arterial hypertension (1 patient) and acute cutaneous GVHD grade 1 (1 patient). Only two patients of the whole cohort were readmitted within 14 days from discharge due to grade 4 odynophagia due to HSV1/2 reactivation. Patients´ experiences with telehealth systems are reported in table 1. Conclusion Telehealth monitoring can potentially improve patient's follow-up in terms of both physical and psychological outcomes. Technological problems still represent a barrier to a wider application of telehealth monitoring systems in the medical setting. Disclosures Mussetti: Novartis, Gilead: Honoraria, Research Funding.

CASE PRESENTATION: The Case 1 was a 90-year-old man, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab. Two days later, he was hospitalized and after eleven days transferred to Intensive Care Unit. A chest CT showed bilateral ground-glass opacities. Just that day, an erythematous maculo-papular rash appeared on trunk, shoulders and neck, becoming purpuric after few days. Histological evaluations revealed a chronic superficial dermatitis with purpuric aspects. The superficial and papillary dermis appeared edematous, with a perivascular lympho-granulocytic infiltrate and erythrocytic extravasation. At intraepithelial level, spongiosis and a granulocyte infiltrate were detected. Arterioles, capillaries and post-capillary venules showed endothelial swelling and appeared ectatic. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and tocilizumab. Regrettably, due to severe lung impairment, he died. The Case 2 was a 85-year-old man, admitted to Intensive Care Unit, where he was intubated. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab two days before. A chest RX showed bilateral atypical pneumonia. After seven days, a cutaneous reddening involving trunk, upper limbs, neck and face developed, configuring a sub-erythroderma. Histological evaluations displayed edema in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis. The patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir and tocilizumab. Sub-erythroderma as well as respiratory symptoms gradually improved until healing. CONCLUSIONS: The endothelial swelling detected in the Case 1 could be a morphological expression of SARS-CoV-2-induced endothelial dysfunction. We hypothesize that cutaneous damage could be initiated by endothelial dysfunction, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells or induced by immune system activation. The disruption of endothelial integrity could enhance microvascular permeability, extravasation of inflammatory cells and cytokines, with cutaneous injury. The Case 2 developed a sub-erythroderma associated with COVID-19, and a non-specific chronic dermatitis was detected at histological level. We speculate that a purpuric rash could represent the cutaneous sign of a more severe coagulopathy, as highlighted histologically by vascular abnormalities, while a sub-erythroderma could be expression of viral hematogenous spreading, inducing a non-specific chronic dermatitis.","Patrì, Angela; Vargas, Maria; Buonanno, Pasquale; Annunziata, Maria Carmela; Russo, Daniela; Staibano, Stefania; Servillo, Giuseppe; Fabbrocini, Gabriella",Diagn Pathol,412,18

Therefore, it seems necessary to provide greater insight into an invisible reality to improve the refugees’ situation. The present cross-sectional study aims to draw a general profile of refugees’ and asylum seekers’ main characteristics in Spain and their well-being. A total of 186 refugees living in Spain participated. An ad-hoc questionnaire was administered to obtain data regarding sociodemographic profile, language skills, and social and institutional support. A standardized instrument, SPANE, was used to measure well-being. It can be seen that healthcare, followed by legal aid, are the easiest to access. On the other hand, finding a job, having money, and finding housing are the most difficult. In general, it seems possible to say that the refugees present more positive feelings than negative ones, which implies a positive emotional balance, although the average score obtained for emotional balance is quite far from the highest possible score. We consider this to be a pivotal first step which can provide useful information for the further design of aid strategies to improve this vulnerable group’s situation.","León-Pinilla, Ruth; Soto-Rubio, Ana; Prado-Gascó, Vicente",Int J Environ Res Public Health,412,16

We herein report of evaluating a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine in a rhesus macaque model. METHODS: Nine monkeys were randomly assigned to high-dose, low-dose and mock groups,which were immunized with different doses of rRBD plus alum adjuvant or adjuvant alone at different time points (0, 8, 25 weeks). Immunological analysis was conducted after each immunisation. Monkeys were challenged with MERS-CoV at 14 days after the final immunisation followed by observation for clinical signs and chest X-rays. Nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were also collected for analyses. Monkeys were euthanized 3 days after challenge and multiple specimens from tissues were collected for pathological, virological and immunological tests. CONCLUSION: Robust and sustained immunological responses (including neutralisation antibody) were elicited by the rRBD vaccination. Besides, rRBD vaccination alleviated pneumonia with evidence of reduced tissue impairment and clinical manifestation in monkeys. Furthermore, the rRBD vaccine decreased viral load of lung, trachea and oropharyngeal swabs of monkeys. These data in NHP paves a way for further development of an effective human vaccine against MERS-CoV infection.","Lan, Jiaming; Yao, Yanfeng; Deng, Yao; Chen, Hong; Lu, Guangwen; Wang, Wen; Bao, Linlin; Deng, Wei; Wei, Qiang; Gao, George F.; Qin, Chuan; Tan, Wenjie",EBioMedicine,412,24

Relatedly, trade press has highlighted how offline retailers have been investing heavily in the use of their existing physical retail network for quicker delivery and pick-up of online orders. Looking at the competition between Amazon and Walmart, however, we demonstrate that focusing on quicker delivery is not the best strategy for offline retailers when opening online channels to compete with online retailers. We estimate a multivariate probit model using data from a customer survey and find that offline retailers should instead focus on delivering the fundamentals of retailing to their online customers too – larger assortment, competitive prices, and purchase convenience. Further, we employ cluster analysis to show which demographics are good targets for retailers as they develop omnichannel capabilities, as well as which demographics retailers need to keep loyal to their original channels.","Jindal, Rupinder P.; Gauri, Dinesh K.; Li, Wanyu; Ma, Yu",J Bus Res,412,1

Moreover, it is difficult to compare among the various devices regarding their sensitivity & specificity. In order to compare the performance of such devices, we used Cohen's kappa statistics to assess the level of agreement between RT-PCR and rapid antibody tests. In doing this study, we considered the term of validity after symptom-onset to compare two tests. It takes more than a week to produce antibodies in the body, and RT-PCR thus gives negative result in the convalescent period. On ELISA data from the literature kappa statistics was calculated as 1.0 beyond 10 days after symptom-onset. By taking these factors into consideration, we evaluated agreement with samples collected beyond 10 days of symptom-onset during the active period. We calculated the data from 9 devices, and the kappa statistics for English data were calculated as 0.64 on average. The same finding was 0.75 for Chinese data. These results corresponded with the values from sensitivity & specificity of their reports. Both reports had no details about the collection procedures. Kappa statistics might become even more accurate, if samples could be restricted to ones collected beyond 10 days. Regarding the data from our hospital', the kappa statistics was 0.97 when restricted to samples collected beyond 10 days, which thus showed excellent agreement. By using kappa statistics, the performances of rapid antibody tests can be shown as one figure, so that their comparison becomes easy to carry out.","Iseki, H.",,412,21

People who tended to believe that the virus was artificially created felt powerless and were more concerned about the possible side-effects of the vaccines, which was negatively associated with their vaccination intention. The source of vaccine recommendation was found to be relevant to vaccination intention. People’s vaccination intention was highest if the vaccines were recommended by health professionals, followed by friends and the government, and then mainstream media and social media. The analysis of the demographic variables showed that men tended to be more receptive to vaccines than women.

Infection, Prevention, and Control training is important in mitigating the spread of COVID‐19. The closure of universities by the Nigerian government has hampered academic activities of dental students. Our objectives were to assess the knowledge, perception, and attitude of undergraduate dental students in Nigeria to the COVID‐19 pandemic and infection control practices. METHODS: This was a cross‐sectional study of undergraduate clinical dental students from the dental schools in Nigeria. Self‐administered questionnaires were distributed to participants using an online data collection platform. Correct responses to the 45‐item questionnaire on COVID‐19 knowledge were scored to determine their knowledge level. A Likert scale of 1‐5 was used to assess the 13‐item perception and attitude questions. The level of significance was set at P values ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 102 undergraduate clinical dental students participated in the study. Males represented 54.9%, and mean age was 25.3 ± 2.4 years. Fifty percent of the students had adequate knowledge of COVID‐19. Final‐year students (58.1%) demonstrated more adequate knowledge of COVID‐19 than penultimate‐year students (28.6%, P = 0.008). Most (95.1%) respondents had positive attitudes towards infection control practices against COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Although the clinical dental students had a positive attitude to infection control practices against COVID‐19, the overall knowledge of COVID‐19 was barely adequate. Guidelines on COVID‐19 from reputable health authorities should be reviewed by dental school authorities and disseminated to the students to suit their clinical practice.","Umeizudike, Kehinde Adesola; Isiekwe, Ikenna Gerald; Fadeju, Adeyemi Dada; Akinboboye, Bolanle Oyeyemi; Aladenika, Emmanuel Temitope",J Dent Educ,412,20

METHODS: Global, regional, and national DALY numbers, crude DALY rates, age-standardized DALY and prevalence rates of refraction disorders were acquired from the GBD study 2019. Mobile cellular subscriptions, urban population, GDP per capita, access to electricity and total fertility rate were obtained from the World Bank to explore the factors that influenced the health burden of refraction disorders. Kruskal-Wallis test, linear regression and multiple linear regression were performed to evaluate the associations between the health burden with socioeconomic levels and other national characteristics. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test was used to investigate the gender disparity. RESULTS: Globally, age-standardized DALY rates of refraction disorders decreased from 88.9 (95% UI: 60.5–120.3) in 1990 to 81.5 (95% UI: 55.0–114.8) in 2019, and might fall to 73.16 (95% UI: 67.81–78.51) by 2050. Age-standardized prevalence rates would also reduce to 1830 (95% UI: 1700–1960) by 2050, from 2080 (95% UI: 1870–2310) in 1990 to 1960 (95% UI: 1750–2180) in 2019. In low SDI region, age-standardized DALY rates (equation: Y = 114.05*X + 27.88) and prevalence rates (equation: Y = 3171.1*X + 403.2) were positively correlated with SDI in linear regression respectively. East Asia had the highest blindness rate caused by refraction disorders in terms of age-standardized DALY rates (11.20, 95% UI: 7.38–16.36). Gender inequality was found among different age groups and SDI regions. CONCLUSION: Health burden of refraction disorders decreased in recent years, and may continue to alleviate in the next three decades.

We conducted a side-by-side clinical evaluation of a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay (EZ-SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR) with the commercial TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit, which has an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. The EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR incorporates two assays targeting the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, an internal control targeting the human RNase P gene, and a PCR inhibition control in a single reaction. Nasopharyngeal (NP) and anterior nares (AN) swabs were tested as individuals and pools with both assays and in the ABI 7500 Fast and the QuantStudio 5 detection platforms. The analytical sensitivity of the EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay was 250 copies/ml or approximately 1.75 genome copy equivalents per reaction. The clinical performance of the EZ-SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated using NP and AN samples tested in other laboratories. The diagnostic sensitivity of the assay ranged between 94 and 96% across the detection platforms, and the diagnostic specificity was 94.06%. The positive predictive value was 94%, and the negative predictive value ranged from 94 to 96%. Pooling five NP or AN specimens yielded 93% diagnostic sensitivity. The overall agreement between these SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays was high, supported by a Cohen’s kappa value of 0.93. The EZ-SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay performance attributes of high sensitivity and specificity with AN sample matrix and pooled upper respiratory samples support its use in a high-throughput surveillance testing program.

VERSO exploits an efficient algorithmic strategy to return robust phylogenies from clonal variant profiles, also in conditions of sampling limitations. It then leverages variant frequency patterns to characterize the intra-host genomic diversity of samples, revealing undetected infection chains and pinpointing variants likely involved in homoplasies. On simulations, VERSO outperforms state-of-the-art tools for phylogenetic inference. Notably, the application to 6,726 amplicon and RNA sequencing samples refines the estimation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution, while co-occurrence patterns of minor variants unveil undetected infection paths, which are validated with contact tracing data.

A panel data set of large-scale housing complexes (estates) is used to exploit the cross-sectional variation in the spread of SARS to estimate the effect of the disease on real estate prices and sales. SARS risk is measured by: (1) the estate-level SARS infection rate, (2) news reports, and (3) government announcements of infections. The average price declines by 1–3 percent if an estate is directly affected by SARS, and by 1.6 percent for all estates as a result of the outbreak of the disease. A back-of-the-envelope calculation of the expected price fall under the rational asset-pricing model implies that the economic value of life consistent with the SARS-related price movement was less than $1 million. This low figure contrasts with the predictions of overreaction from psychological and behavioral economics theories. An analysis of transaction volume suggests that the absence of price overreaction is likely to be related to housing market characteristics, including transaction costs, credit constraints and loss aversion.","Wong, Grace",Journal of Urban Economics,412,18

Calcium propionate is a safe and reliable food and additive that is widely used. It can be employed in silage and total mixed rations (TMR) against mycotoxin production. In the perinatal period, many cows cannot adjust to the tremendous metabolic, endocrine, and physiological changes, resulting in ketosis and fatty liver due to a negative energy balance or milk fever induced by hypocalcemia, which damages their health and reduces the production performance. Studies have revealed that calcium propionate can play an active role in solving these problems. It can also regulate rumen development in calves. This paper reviews the recent research progress regarding the application of calcium propionate in dairy cows and dairy calves. The key findings and mechanisms are summarized and potential further studies are suggested. ABSTRACT: Calcium propionate is a safe and reliable food and feed additive. It can be metabolized and absorbed by humans and animals as a precursor for glucose synthesis. In addition, calcium propionate provides essential calcium to mammals. In the perinatal period of dairy cows, many cows cannot adjust to the tremendous metabolic, endocrine, and physiological changes, resulting in ketosis and fatty liver due to a negative energy balance (NEB) or milk fever induced by hypocalcemia. On hot weather days, cow feed (TMR or silage) is susceptible to mildew, which produces mycotoxins. These two issues are closely related to dairy health and performance. Perinatal period metabolic disease significantly reduces cow production and increases the elimination rate because it causes major glucose and calcium deficiencies. Feeding a diet contaminated with mycotoxin leads to rumen metabolic disorders, a reduced reproductive rate (increased abortion rate), an increased number of milk somatic cells, and decreased milk production, as well as an increased occurrence of mastitis and hoof disease. Propionic acid is the primary gluconeogenic precursor in dairy cows and one of the safest mold inhibitors. Therefore, calcium propionate, which can be hydrolyzed into propionic acid and Ca(2+) in the rumen, may be a good feed additive for alleviating NEB and milk fever in the perinatal period of dairy cows. It can also be used to inhibit TMR or silage deterioration in hot weather and regulate rumen development in calves. This paper reviews the application of calcium propionate in dairy cows.","Zhang, Fan; Nan, Xuemei; Wang, Hui; Guo, Yuming; Xiong, Benhai",Animals (Basel),412,16

One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the ""#medtwitter"" community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis. Our method can aid in future public-health emergencies by facilitating knowledge transfer among healthcare workers in a rapidly-changing information environment, and by providing an efficient and unsupervised way of highlighting potential areas for clinical research.","Wu, Julia; Sivaraman, Venkatesh; Kumar, Dheekshita; Banda, Juan M.; Sontag, David",ArXiv,412,1

In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of using hospital parking lot traffic data extracted from high-resolution satellite imagery to augment public health disease surveillance in Chile, Argentina and Mexico. We used archived satellite imagery collected from January 2010 to May 2013 and data on the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses from the Pan American Health Organization as a reference. We developed dynamical Elastic Net multivariable linear regression models to estimate the incidence of respiratory virus illnesses using hospital traffic and assessed how to minimize the effects of noise on the models. We noted that predictions based on models fitted using a sample of observations were better. The results were consistent across countries with selected models having reasonably low normalized root-mean-squared errors and high correlations for both the fits and predictions. The observations from this study suggest that if properly procured and combined with other information, this data source could be useful for monitoring disease trends.","Nsoesie, Elaine O.; Butler, Patrick; Ramakrishnan, Naren; Mekaru, Sumiko R.; Brownstein, John S.",Sci Rep,412,27

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced a shift to virtual care models in order to reduce patient exposure to high-risk environments and to preserve valuable health care resources. This report describes one large primary care system’s model for rapid transition to virtual care (RTVC). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A RTVC model was implemented at the VA Connecticut Health Care System (VACHS), which delivers care to over 58,000 veterans. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The RTVC model included immediate virtual care conversion, telework expansion, implementation of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics, and development of standardized note templates. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Outcomes include the rates of primary encounter types, staff teleworking, and utilization of virtual respiratory urgent care clinics. In under 2 weeks, most encounters were transitioned from in-person to virtual care, enabling telework for over half of the medical staff. The majority of virtual visits were telephone encounters, though rates of video visits increased nearly 18-fold. DISCUSSION: The RTVC model demonstrates expeditious and sustained transition to virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our experiences help inform institutions still reliant on traditional in-person visits, and future pandemic response.","Spelman, Juliette F.; Brienza, Rebecca; Walsh, Robert F.; Drost, Paul; Schwartz, Amy R.; Kravetz, Jeffrey D.; Pitkin, Patricia; Ruser, Christopher",J Gen Intern Med,412,14

To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity. In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients. Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease. Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.","Wang, Xinhui; Fang, Xuexian; Cai, Zhaoxian; Wu, Xiaotian; Gao, Xiaotong; Min, Junxia; Wang, Fudi",Research (Wash D C),412,24

As a result, walking groups are actively encouraged by health professionals as a way to promote ‘healthy ageing’. This paper examines whether the promotion of community-led walking groups relies upon overly optimistic understandings that portray walking in greenspace as an inherently therapeutic practice. Accordingly, this paper introduces the concept of ‘detrimental mobilities’ to explore how the shared movement promoted via walking groups may not always be inherently therapeutic and may have some detrimental impacts on the individuals who take part in these activities. Drawing on findings from in-depth walking interviews with older members of the ‘Walking for Health’ scheme in Southampton, England, this paper examines how mobilities have the potential to disable, as much as they enable, health and wellbeing.","Paddon, Laura Isobel",Health Place,412,10

However, rapid diagnosis and identification of high-risk patients for early intervention are challenging. Using a large computed Tomography (CT) database from 4,154 patients, we developed an AI system that can diagnose NCP and differentiate it from other common pneumonia and normal controls. The AI system can assist radiologists and physicians in performing a quick diagnosis especially when the health system is overloaded. Significantly, our AI system identified important clinical markers that correlated with the NCP lesion properties. Together with the clinical data, our AI system was able to provide accurate clinical prognosis that can aid clinicians to consider appropriate early clinical management and allocate resources appropriately.

The popularity of these diagnostic platforms is constantly increasing in healthcare facilities, particularly those facing limited budgets and time, as well as in household use for individual health monitoring. The advantages of these low-cost devices over modern laboratory-based analyzers come from their availability, opportunity of rapid detection, and ease of use. The attractiveness of these portable diagnostic tools is associated primarily with their high analytical sensitivity and specificity, as well as with the easy visual readout of results. These qualities explain the growing popularity of LFIA in developing countries, when applied at small hospitals, in emergency situations where screening and monitoring health condition is crucially important, and as well as for self-testing of patients. These tools have passed the test of time, and now LFIA test systems are fully consistent with the world's modern concept of ‘point-of-care testing’, finding a wide range of applications not only in human medicine, but also in ecology, veterinary medicine, and agriculture.

However, it is not feasible for every country to have its own MSB. If countries are able to pool their resources, a regional MSB is a viable solution. This paper describes the methodology, costing and lessons learnt of establishing and maintaining an MSB over a 3-year period, for a Southern Africa Development Community region. METHODS: A national reference laboratory in South Africa was granted funding for setting up the MSB; it possessed experienced staff and suitable resources. Two additional full-time personnel were employed to carry out the activities of this project. Strict protocols for donor/patient blood sample screening, smear preparation, mass staining, quality control and slide validation were followed. Slides from the MSB were used for training and proficiency testing purposes. The initial and recurrent yearly costs to set up and maintain the MSB were calculated. RESULTS: Over 35 months, 154 batches (26,623 slides) were prepared; the majority were Plasmodium falciparum. Ninety-two percent (141/154) of batches passed internal quality control, and 89% (93/104) passed external validation. From these slides, two training slide sets and six proficiency testing slide sets were sent out. The initial year’s cost to establish an MSB was calculated at approximately $165,000, and the recurrent year-on-year cost was $130,000. CONCLUSIONS: The key components for maintaining a high-quality MSB are consistent funding, competent staff and adherence to standardized protocols. Travel to malaria-endemic areas for access to non-falciparum malaria species, and dilution of P. falciparum blood to desired parasite densities, are extremely useful to ensure variety. The MSB created here supported multiple laboratories in eight countries, and has the potential to expand.

Vaccine-promoting policymaking for public engagement is a prerequisite for social mobilization. However, making an informed and judicious choice is a dilemma for the Chinese government in the vaccine promotion context. OBJECTIVE: In this study, public opinions in China were analyzed via dialogues on Chinese social media, based on which Chinese netizens’ views on COVID-19 vaccines and vaccination were investigated. We also aimed to develop strategies for promoting vaccination programs in China based on an in-depth understanding of the challenges in risk communication and social mobilization. METHODS: We proposed a novel behavioral dynamics model, SRS/I (susceptible-reading-susceptible/immune), to analyze opinion transmission paradigms on Chinese social media. Coupled with a meta-analysis and natural language processing techniques, the emotion polarity of individual opinions was examined in their given context. RESULTS: We collected more than 1.75 million Weibo messages about COVID-19 vaccines from January to October 2020. According to the public opinion reproduction ratio (R(0)), the dynamic propagation of those messages can be classified into three periods: the ferment period (R(01)=1.1360), the revolution period (R(02)=2.8278), and the transmission period (R(03)=3.0729).

From September to October, Weibo users claimed that the vaccine was overpriced, making up 18.3% (n=899) of messages; 38.1% (n=81,909) of relevant topics on Weibo received likes. On the contrary, the number of messages that considered the vaccine to be reasonably priced was twice as high but received fewer likes, accounting for 25.0% (n=53,693). In addition, we obtained 441 (47.7%) positive and 295 (31.9%) negative Weibo messages about side effects. Interestingly, inactivated vaccines instigated more heated discussions than any other vaccine type. The discussions, forwards, comments, and likes associated with topics related to inactivated vaccines accounted for 53% (n=588), 42% (n=3072), 56% (n=3671), and 49% (n=17,940), respectively, of the total activity associated with the five types of vaccines in China. CONCLUSIONS: Most Chinese netizens believe that the vaccine is less expensive than previously thought, while some claim they cannot afford it for their entire family. The findings demonstrate that Chinese individuals are inclined to be positive about side effects over time and are proud of China’s involvement with vaccine development. Nevertheless, they have a collective misunderstanding about inactivated vaccines, insisting that inactivated vaccines are safer than other vaccines. Reflecting on netizens’ collective responses, the unfolding determinants of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance provide illuminating benchmarks for vaccine-promoting policies.","Yin, Fulian; Wu, Zhaoliang; Xia, Xinyu; Ji, Meiqi; Wang, Yanyan; Hu, Zhiwen",J Med Internet Res,412,21

The unique clinical phenomena in severe COVID-19 can be perplexing, and they include disproportionately severe hypoxemia relative to lung alveolar-parenchymal pathology and rapid clinical deterioration, with poor response to O(2) supplementation, despite preserved lung mechanics. Factors such as microvascular injury, thromboembolism, pulmonary hypertension, and alteration in hemoglobin structure and function could play important roles. Overwhelming immune response associated with “cytokine storms” could activate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may result in consumption of nitric oxide (NO), a critical vasodilation regulator. In other inflammatory infections, activated neutrophils are known to release myeloperoxidase (MPO) in a natural immune response, which contributes to production of hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, during overwhelming inflammation, HOCl competes with O(2) at heme binding sites, decreasing O(2) saturation. Moreover, HOCl contributes to several oxidative reactions, including hemoglobin-heme iron oxidation, heme destruction, and subsequent release of free iron, which mediates toxic tissue injury through additional generation of ROS and NO consumption. Connecting these reactions in a multi-hit model can explain generalized tissue damage, vasoconstriction, severe hypoxia, and precipitous clinical deterioration in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to develop therapeutic strategies to combat COVID-19.","Goud, Pravin T; Bai, David; Abu-Soud, Husam M",Int J Biol Sci,412,6

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method to implement virtual screening with convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The descriptors represent chemical molecules, and these descriptors are input into the CNN framework to train a model and predict active compounds. When compared to other machine learning methods, including random forest, naive Bayes, decision tree, and support vector machine, the proposed CNN model's evaluation of the test set showed an accuracy of 0.86, a sensitivity of 0.45, a specificity of 0.96, a precision of 0.73, a recall of 0.45, an F-measure of 0.55, and a ROC of 0.71. The CNN model screened 17 out of 918 phytochemical compounds; 60 out of 423 from the natural product NCI divset IV; 17,831 out of 112,267 from the ZINC natural product database; and 315 out of 1556 FDA-approved drugs as anti-SARS-CoV agents. Further, to prioritize drug-like compounds, Lipinski's rule of five was applied to screen anti-SARS-CoV compounds (excluding FDA-approved drugs), resulting in 10, 59, and 14,025 hit molecules. Out of 10 phytochemical compounds, 9 anti-SARS-CoV agents belonged to the flavonoid group. In conclusion, the proposed CNN model can prove useful for developing novel target-specific anti-SARS-CoV compounds.","Kumari, Madhulata; Subbarao, Naidu",Comput Biol Med,412,2

However, very few African countries have undertaken the collection and processing of CCP. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of collecting and processing of CCP, in preparation for a randomized clinical trial of CCP for treatment of COVID-19 in Uganda. Methods In a cross-sectional study, persons with documented evidence of recovery from COVID-19 in Uganda were contacted and screened for blood donation via telephone calls. Those found eligible were asked to come to the blood donation centre for further screening and consent. Whole blood collection was undertaken from which plasma was processed. Plasma was tested for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs) and anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody titers. SARS-CoV-2 testing was also done on nasopharyngeal swabs from the donors. Results 192 participants were contacted of whom 179 (93.2%) were eligible to donate. Of the 179 eligible, 23 (12.8%) were not willing to donate and reasons given included: having no time 7(30.4%), fear of being retained at the COVID-19 treatment center 10 (43.5%), fear of stigma in the community 1 (4.3%), phobia for donating blood 1 (4.3%), religious issues 1 (4.4%), lack of interest 2 (8.7%) and transport challenges 1 (4.3%). The median age was 30 years and females accounted for 3.7% of the donors. A total of 30 (18.5%) donors tested positive for different TTIs. Antibody titer testing demonstrated titers of more than 1:320 for all the 72 samples tested. Age greater than 46 years and female gender were associated with higher titers though not statistically significant. Conclusion CCP collection and processing is possible in Uganda. However, concerns about stigma and lack of time, interest or transport need to be addressed in order to maximize donations.","Muttamba, W.; Lusiba, J.; Namakula, O. L.; Kibwika, P.

However, the mechanism by which these DMVs form has not been determined. Using genetic, biochemical, and cell imaging approaches, the role of autophagy in DMV formation and MHV replication was investigated. The results demonstrated that replication complexes co-localize with the autophagy proteins, microtubule-associated protein light-chain 3 and Apg12. MHV infection induces autophagy by a mechanism that is resistant to 3-methyladenine inhibition. MHV replication is impaired in autophagy knockout, APG5–/–, embryonic stem cell lines, but wild-type levels of MHV replication are restored by expression of Apg5 in the APG5–/–cells. In MHV-infected APG5–/–cells, DMVs were not detected; rather, the rough endoplasmic reticulum was dramatically swollen. The results of this study suggest that autophagy is required for formation of double membrane-bound MHV replication complexes and that DMV formation significantly enhances the efficiency of replication. Furthermore, the rough endoplasmic reticulum is implicated as the possible source of membranes for replication complexes.","Prentice, Erik; Jerome, W.

This chapter describes current state-of-the-art molecular diagnostics and comparative genomics in medical microbiology to provide an understanding of infectious disease over the coming years. Nucleic acid-based tests are being introduced with increasing speed into routine clinical microbiology laboratories. Some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptance of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are reviewed. Historic objections are slowly being taken apart, and an accelerated introduction of molecular diagnostics is being pursued in many cases. Clear improvement in clinical testing is achieved by introducing molecular tests. Therefore, swift introduction of such tests into clinical practice is important to be pursued. Several PCR tests show increased sensitivity, excellent specificity, and cost effectiveness highlighting the success of the novel applications in the field of bacterial infections. Finally, some of the problems remaining to be solved prior to general acceptation of nucleic acid-mediated detection and identification of microbial pathogens are also reviewed.","van Belkum, Alex",Molecular Diagnostics,412,2

The used PCR systems were designed to detect sequences representing the group-specific virulence genes encoding fimbriae f5 (K99), Shiga toxins (stx(1) and stx(2)), heat-stable enterotoxins (st), heat-labile enterotoxins (lt), intimin (eae), hemolysin (hylA), and EAEC heat-stable enterotoxin (astA). In the present work, a total of 150 E. coli field isolates were recovered from 150 fecal swabs collected from 100 diarrheic and 50 apparently healthy in-contact cattle and buffalo calves under 3 months old. Out of these 150 isolated E. coli, 106 isolates from 77 diarrheic and 29 in-contact calves harbored one or more of the investigated virulence genes. The pathotyping of the isolates could classify them into shigatoxigenic E. coli (STEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) with a 30.7, 2.7, 12.7, and 7.3% distribution, respectively. Meanwhile, the detection rates of f5, stx(1), stx(2), st, lt, eae, hylA, and astA genes were 17.3, 27.3, 6.7, 10, 37.3, 17.7, 9.3, and 20.7%, respectively. These virulence genes were found either single or in different combinations, such as stx/eae, stx/st/f5, eae/st/f5, or st/lt/f5. Four attaching-effacing shigatoxigenic E. coli isolates (AE-STEC) harboring stx/eae were retrieved from diarrheic calves. Although none of the stx-or eae-positive isolates was verified as O157:H7, STEC isolates detected in apparently healthy calves have potential pathogenicity to humans highlighting their zoonotic importance as reservoirs. Atypical combinations of ETEC/STEC and ETEC/EPEC were also detected in percentages of 14.7 and 2.7%, respectively. Most of these atypical combinations were found more in buffalo calves than in cattle calves. While STEC and EPEC isolates were detected more in cattle calves than in buffalo calves, ETEC isolates were the same in the two species. The pathogenic E. coli infection in calves was recorded to be higher in the first weeks of life with the largest numbers of virulence factor-positive isolates detected at the age of 4 weeks. Histopathological examination of five intestinal samples collected from four dead buffalo calves revealed typical attaching and effacing (AE) lesion which was correlated with the presence of intimin encoding virulence gene (eae). Other lesions characterized by hemorrhagic enteritis, shortening and fusion of intestinal villi and desquamation of the lining epithelium of intestinal mucosa had also been detected.","Awad, Walid S.; El-Sayed, Amr A.; Mohammed, Faten F.; Bakry, Noha M.; Abdou, Nadra-Elwgoud M.

This is the second most deadly EVD outbreak in history, after the one that occurred in West Africa in 2014. The DRC Ministry of Health (MoH), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a range of regional and international partners, are implementing EVD response plans in these affected areas such as screening of suspect cases at points of entry, case detection, contact tracing, laboratory testing, case management and infection prevention and control, safe and dignified burials, ring vaccination (this involves vaccination of infected individuals, direct contacts of infected individuals and contacts of their contacts), and therapeutics, community mobilization and free access to healthcare services. Despite these efforts, there has been a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases within the identified affected areas, and due to a number of challenges unique to DRC, there has been an expansion in the geographical extent of transmission. The significance of the proximity of these regions to wildlife and the Virunga National Park is questionable in the EVD transmission dynamics. The close interaction between human, animal, and environmental factors, in combination with high population movement due to regular rebel attacks in these regions, suggest the need for the integration of the One Health approach in the holistic response plans for control and prevention of EVD.

Na(i) elevation has been shown to impact Ca(mito); however, whether metabolic remodelling in HF is caused by increased Na(i) has only been recently demonstrated. This novel insight may help to elucidate the contribution of metabolic remodelling in the pathophysiology of HF, the lack of efficacy of current HF therapies and a rationale for the development of future metabolism-targeting treatments.

This study is a small contribution that tries to find contrasted formulas to alleviate global suffering and guarantee a more manageable future. OBJECTIVE: In this study, a statistical approach was proposed to study the correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain and search data provided by Google Trends. METHODS: We assessed the linear correlation between Google Trends search data and the data provided by the National Center of Epidemiology in Spain—which is dependent on the Instituto de Salud Carlos III—regarding the number of COVID-19 cases reported with a certain time lag. These data enabled the identification of anticipatory patterns. RESULTS: In response to the ongoing outbreak, our results demonstrate that by using our correlation test, the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic can be predicted in Spain up to 11 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS: During the epidemic, Google Trends offers the possibility to preempt health care decisions in real time by tracking people's concerns through their search patterns. This can be of great help given the critical, if not dramatic need for complementary monitoring approaches that work on a population level and inform public health decisions in real time. This study of Google search patterns, which was motivated by the fears of individuals in the face of a pandemic, can be useful in anticipating the development of the pandemic.","Jimenez, Alberto Jimenez; Estevez-Reboredo, Rosa M; Santed, Miguel A; Ramos, Victoria",J Med Internet Res,412,20

On 23 March 2020, the UK government issued requirements for a national lockdown. The aim of this multicentre study is to gain a greater understanding of the impact lockdown has had on the rates, mechanisms and types of injuries together with their management across a regional trauma service. METHODS: Data was collected from an adult major trauma centre, paediatric major trauma centre, district general hospital, and a regional hand trauma unit. Data collection included patient demographics, injury mechanism, injury type and treatment required. Time periods studied corresponded with the two weeks leading up to lockdown in the UK, two weeks during lockdown, and the same two-week period in 2019. RESULTS: There was a 55.7% (12,935 vs 5,733) reduction in total accident and emergency (A&E) attendances with a 53.7% (354 vs 164) reduction in trauma admissions during lockdown compared to 2019. The number of patients with fragility fractures requiring admission remained constant (32 patients in 2019 vs 31 patients during lockdown; p > 0.05). Road traffic collisions (57.1%, n = 8) were the commonest cause of major trauma admissions during lockdown. There was a significant increase in DIY related-hand injuries (26% (n = 13)) lockdown vs 8% (n = 11 in 2019, p = 0.006) during lockdown, which resulted in an increase in nerve injuries (12% (n = 6 in lockdown) vs 2.5% (n = 3 in 2019, p = 0.015) and hand infections (24% (n = 12) in lockdown vs 6.2% (n = 8) in 2019, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The national lockdown has dramatically reduced orthopaedic trauma admissions. The incidence of fragility fractures requiring surgery has not changed. Appropriate provision in theatres should remain in place to ensure these patients can be managed as a surgical priority. DIY-related hand injuries have increased which has led to an increased in nerve injuries requiring intervention.","Hampton, Matthew; Clark, Matthew; Baxter, Ian; Stevens, Richard; Flatt, Elinor; Murray, James; Wembridge, Kevin",Bone Jt Open,412,1

It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","Chen, Zezhun; Dassios, Angelos; Kuan, Valerie; Lim, Jia Wei; Qu, Yan; Surya, Budhi; Zhao, Hongbiao",Results Phys,412,1

Some blame excessive outsourcing and foreign dependency for causing shortages, thus urging greater state intervention; others applaud GVCs for their flexibility and scaling up of production, while blaming states for undermining GVC operations.Using policy process-tracing and monthly trade data of seven PPE products across the US, Europe, China and Malaysia, this paper goes beyond the binary debate of either the ‘failure’ or ‘success’ of GVCs to show when and under what conditions states interacted with GVCs to produce mixed outcomes in provisioning countries with PPEs. We identify interactions between the type of state intervention and two key structural features of GVCs – geographic distribution of production and technological attributes of the product. Conceptually, the paper demonstrates the mutual constraints of states and GVCs, and highlights structural factors involved in the relationship. Looking to the future of GVCs, we caution against wholesale declarations that GVCs should be abandoned or maintained, instead concluding that paying attention to GVC structure, states and their interactions are crucial.","Dallas, Mark P.; Horner, Rory; Li, Lantian",World Dev,412,24

AIM: To analyse the efficacy of the intraoperative use of autologous fibrin glue to seal suture lines of cardiac and vascular structures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The early results of 62 patients who underwent complex cardiac operations in extracorporeal circulation were analysed. In a half of them Vivostat autologous fibrin sealant in addition to the routine haemostatic agents was applied (study group), whereas in the second group (matched-pair control group) only standard haemostatics were used. Among many other factors, special attention was paid to postoperative drainage and blood products used. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients and prevalence of comorbidities did not differ between groups. Generally, in the study group fewer haemostatic agents were used. For example, Preveleak tissue glue was applied in 3.2% of studied cases compared to one third of control patients (p = 0.008). The thoracic drainage on either day 0 or day 1 was also similar. The number of patients who received blood products did not differ between groups. More importantly, there were no significant differences in in-hospital mortality and prevalence of other postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: In this study it was found that application of autologous fibrin glue was safe and might limit use of standard haemostatic agents. Taking into account the lack of potential threats related to the transmission of infections and immune responses, it may be an interesting alternative to the previously used local haemostatics.","Jarząbek, Radosław; Greberski, Krzysztof; Bugajski, Paweł",Kardiochir Torakochirurgia Pol,412,24

RESULTS: Of all patients, 56.8% stated that they would go to the hospital in case of emergency and 28.3% expressed that they did not want to go to the hospital even in this case. 50% of the participants said that they did not want to go to the hospital under any circumstances during the pandemic process. As a result of the correlation analysis, there was an inverse correlation between the anxiety‐depression levels and encountering COVID‐19 patients and having a relative with COVID‐19 (P = .001). Inverse correlation was found between intention to go to hospital and encountering COVID‐19 patients (P = .001). CONCLUSION: It was revealed that chronic patients did not have any intentions to go to hospital during the COVID‐19 pandemic and only half of the people were willing to go to the hospital in case of emergency.

At the same time, oseltamivir, as an over-the-counter drug, is also a popular antiviral drug. As healthcare workers fighting against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have found that many patients experiencing discomfort or considered to be infected with a virus take oseltamivir. From severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 to middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and now the current COVID-19 epidemic, there is not plenty of evidence showing that oseltamivir is effective against coronavirus. Still, there is also no sufficient evidence to refute its ineffectiveness. We cannot predict whether there will be a pandemic of respiratory coronavirus in the future, so we hope to initiate such research and preliminarily explore whether oseltamivir is effective for COVID-19, which can better guide healthcare workers in the selection of appropriate antiviral drugs in the face of coronavirus epidemics. If oseltamivir is effective, then a wide promotion of its application often can achieve a double effect with half the effort. If it is not effective, then considering the side effects of oseltamivir, it is not necessary to use unreasonable drugs that will not slow the progression of the disease but can cause adverse reactions. We found that oseltamivir is not suitable for fighting against COVID-19 through the method of computer aided drug design and in vitro study and retrospective case study. Meanwhile it was high-occurrence seasons for the influenza, COVID-19 should be highly suspected in patients who did not benefit from oseltamivir.

In addition, with the crisis of COVID-19, the issue of patient transfer is even more critical, as caregivers are at a high risk of infection, causing significant damage to healthcare resources. In this paper, a patient transfer assist system named E-pat-plus (Easy Patient Transfer plus) has been proposed; it can assist caregivers in transferring patients, reduce direct contact between them, and avoid secondary injuries. In the mechanical structure of this apparatus, a novel five-gear assembly module and a synchronous belt pulley set are proposed; they are the key points to the basic functional realization of the device and can reduce the cost of the prototype. Furthermore, a fuzzy (proportion-integration-differentiation) PID-based cross-coupling control strategy is applied to the apparatus to ensure the stability and safety of the operation. Finally, some preliminary experiments, including current experiments and error experiments, are carried out to verify the reliability of the device and lay the foundation for clinical tests.","Tian, Yu; Wang, Hongbo; Zhang, Yongshun; Su, Bowen; Du, Jiazheng; Wang, Xincheng; Feng, Yongfei; Cheng, Bo; Niu, Jianye",J Healthc Eng,412,12

The transmission mechanism of COVID-19 is still unclear. Except for the initial status and the imported cases, the isolation measures and the medical treatments of the infected patients have essential influences on the spread of COVID-19. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission involving the interactive effect of various factors for the infected people, including imported cases, isolating rate, diagnostic rate, recovery rate and also the mortality rate. Under the assumption that the random incubation period, the cure period and the diagnosis period are subject to the Weibull distribution, the quantity of daily existing infected people is finally governed by a linear integral-differential equation with convolution kernel. Based on the asymptotic behavior and the quantitative analysis on the model, we rigorously prove that, for limited external input patients, both the quantity of infected patients and its variation ratio will finally tend to zero, if the infected patients are sufficiently isolated or the infection rate is small enough. Finally, numerical performances for the proposed model as well as the comparisons between our simulations and the clinical data of the city Wuhan and Italy are demonstrated, showing the validity of our model with suitably specified model parameters.","Liu, Jijun; Wang, Liyan; Zhang, Qiang; Yau, Shing Tung",Appl Math Model,412,17

The rapid mutation rate in the virus has created alarming situations worldwide and is being attributed to the false negativity in RT-PCR tests. It has also increased the chances of reinfection and immune escape. Recently various lineages namely, B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.617.3 have caused rapid infection around the globe. To understand the biophysical perspective, we have performed molecular dynamic simulations of four different spikes (receptor binding domain)-hACE2 complexes, namely wildtype (WT), Alpha variant (N501Y spike mutant), Kappa (L452R, E484Q) and Delta (L452R, T478K), and compared their dynamics, binding energy and molecular interactions. Our results show that mutation has caused significant increase in the binding energy between the spike and hACE2 in Alpha and Kappa variants. In the case of Kappa and Delta variants, the mutations at L452R, T478K and E484Q increased the stability and intra-chain interactions in the spike protein, which may change the interaction ability of neutralizing antibodies to these spike variants. Further, we found that the Alpha variant had increased hydrogen interaction with Lys353 of hACE2 and more binding affinity in comparison to WT. The current study provides the biophysical basis for understanding the molecular mechanism and rationale behind the increase in the transmissivity and infectivity of the mutants compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2.","Kumar, Vipul; Singh, Jasdeep; Hasnain, Seyed E.; Sundar, Durai",Int J Mol Sci,412,16

Below this threshold, stochastic extinction eventually causes pathogen extinction. Here we use a simulation model to explore behaviour-mediated persistence: a novel mechanism by which the population response to the pathogen determines the CCS. We model severe coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in a population where both individuals and government authorities restrict transmission more strongly when SARS-CoV-2 case numbers are higher. This results in a coupled human-environment feedback between disease dynamics and population behaviour. In a parameter regime corresponding to a moderate population response, this feedback allows SARS-CoV-2 to avoid extinction in the trough of pandemic waves. The result is a very low CCS that allows long term pathogen persistence. Hence, an incomplete pandemic response represents a ""sour spot"" that not only ensures relatively high case incidence and unnecessarily long lockdown, but also promotes long-term persistence of the pathogen by reducing the CCS. Given the worldwide prevalence of small, isolated populations in which a pathogen with low CCS can persist, these results emphasize the need for a global approach to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination.","Fair, K.

Our results support the hypothesis of a selective advantage at the basis of the spread of the G614 variant, which we suggest may be due to structural modification of the spike protein at the S1/S2 proteolytic site, and provides structural information to guide the design of variant-specific drugs.","Trucchi, Emiliano; Gratton, Paolo; Mafessoni, Fabrizio; Motta, Stefano; Cicconardi, Francesco; Mancia, Filippo; Bertorelle, Giorgio; D’Annessa, Ilda; Marino, Daniele Di",Mol Biol Evol,412,16

Competing health objectives and resource redeployment threaten to retard the scale-up of surgical services in low- and middle-income countries where access to safe, affordable and timely care is low. The key aspiration of the Lancet Commission on global surgery was promotion of resilience in surgical systems. The current pandemic provides an opportunity to stress-test those systems and identify fault-lines that may not be easily apparent outside of times of crisis. METHODS: We endeavoured to explore vulnerable points in surgical systems learning from the experience of past outbreaks, using examples from the current pandemic, and make recommendations for future health emergencies. The 6-component framework for surgical systems planning was used to categorise the effects of COVID-19 on surgical systems, with a particular focus on low- and middle-income countries. Key vulnerabilities were identified and recommendations were made for the current pandemic and for the future. RESULTS: Multiple stress points were identified throughout all of the 6 components of surgical systems. The impact is expected to be highest in the workforce, service delivery and infrastructure domains. Innovative new technologies should be employed to allow consistent, high-quality surgical care to continue even in times of crisis. CONCLUSIONS: If robust progress towards global surgery goals for 2030 is to continue, the stress points identified should be reinforced. An ongoing process of reappraisal and fortification will keep surgical systems in low- and middle-income countries responsive to “old threats and new challenges”.

Community mitigation strategies can lower the risk for disease transmission by limiting or preventing person-to-person interactions (2). U.S. states and territories began implementing various community mitigation policies in March 2020. One widely implemented strategy was the issuance of orders requiring persons to stay home, resulting in decreased population movement in some jurisdictions (3). Each state or territory has authority to enact its own laws and policies to protect the public's health, and jurisdictions varied widely in the type and timing of orders issued related to stay-at-home requirements. To identify the broader impact of these stay-at-home orders, using publicly accessible, anonymized location data from mobile devices, CDC and the Georgia Tech Research Institute analyzed changes in population movement relative to stay-at-home orders issued during March 1-May 31, 2020, by all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories.* During this period, 42 states and territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders.

We applied both human monoclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (spike protein, nucleoprotein) and rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies (envelope protein, membrane protein) to 55 different tissue antigens. We found that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies had reactions with 28 out of 55 tissue antigens, representing a diversity of tissue groups that included barrier proteins, gastrointestinal, thyroid and neural tissues, and more. We also did selective epitope mapping using BLAST and showed similarities and homology between spike, nucleoprotein, and many other SARS-CoV-2 proteins with the human tissue antigens mitochondria M2, F-actin and TPO. This extensive immune cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and different antigen groups may play a role in the multi-system disease process of COVID-19, influence the severity of the disease, precipitate the onset of autoimmunity in susceptible subgroups, and potentially exacerbate autoimmunity in subjects that have pre-existing autoimmune diseases. Very recently, human monoclonal antibodies were approved for use on patients with COVID-19. The human monoclonal antibodies used in this study are almost identical with these approved antibodies. Thus, our results can establish the potential risk for autoimmunity and multi-system disorders with COVID-19 that may come from cross-reactivity between our own human tissues and this dreaded virus, and thus ensure that the badly-needed vaccines and treatments being developed for it are truly safe to use against this disease.","Vojdani, Aristo; Vojdani, Elroy; Kharrazian, Datis",Front Immunol,412,16

The sera of 23 confirmed COVID-19 patients were processed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM detection. Three different immunoassays, viz. Abbott Architect(®) SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, and two quantitative tests, ANSH(®) SARS-CoV-2 and AESKULISA(®) SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein (NP), were performed and the results pooled, from diagnosis to serum collection. Seroconversion rates were computed for all 3 assays, and possible correlations were tested using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Overall, 70 combinations of qualitative and quantitative IgG and IgM results were pooled and analyzed. In the early phase (0-4 days after diagnosis), in all tests, IgG seroconversion rates were 43%-61%, and increased in all tests gradually to 100% after 15 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a strong positive relationship between the qualitative IgG test results and both quantitative IgG tests. IgM detection was inconsistent, with maximal concentrations and seroconversion rates between 10-15 days after diagnosis and slight-to-fair agreement between the two quantitative immunoassays. There was no significant association between mortality with IgG or IgM seroconversion or concentrations. Patients with severe COVID-19 develop an early, robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immune response involving IgG immunoglobulins. Further comparative studies are warranted to analyze the value of serological testing in predicting the severity of COVID-19 and detecting prior exposure.","Al-Mughales, Jamil A.; Al-Mughales, Tareq J.; Saadah, Omar I.",Front Immunol,412,1

The management of limited resources such as mechanical ventilators has remained a contentious issue both at an individual and institutional level since the beginning of the pandemic. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to critical care practitioners to find innovative ways to provide supplemental oxygen therapy to their patients. We present a single-center experience: a case series of five COVID-19 infected patients managed with a novel approach to provide supplemental oxygen and positive end-expiration pressure (PEEP) via the helmet. Three of the five patients responded to therapy, did not require intubation, and survived to discharge. The other two patients continued to deteriorate clinically, required endotracheal intubation, and subsequently expired during their hospitalization. We extrapolated our accumulated experience with non-invasive oxygen support by helmet in COVID-19 patients to a non-COVID-19 postoperative patient who underwent sinus surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure also resulting in avoidance of endotracheal intubation. We conclude that oxygen therapy via a helmet is a safe, cost-effective technique to prevent intubation in carefully selected patients with infectious and non-infectious causes of hypoxic respiratory failure. Our positive experience with the system warrants further large-scale study and possible technique refinement.","Harrison, Michael F.; Villar, Dolores; Yarrarapu, Siva Naga S.; Guru, Pramod; Mallea, Jorge; Torp, Klaus; Bechtle, Perry; Lee, Augustine; Franco, Pablo Moreno; Sanghavi, Devang K.",Respir Med Case Rep,412,21

The analysis is general, and applies to all SEIR-based models, not only those associated with COVID-19. We find that when modeling a rapidly spreading epidemic, seemingly minor differences in how latency is treated can lead to vastly different estimates of [Formula: see text] .

Current laboratory‐based purification techniques rely on the physical properties of small‐EVs rather than their inherited cellular fingerprints. We established a highly‐selective purification assay, termed EV‐CATCHER, initially designed for high‐throughput analysis of low‐abundance small‐RNA cargos by next‐generation sequencing. We demonstrated its selectivity by specifically isolating and sequencing small‐RNAs from mouse small‐EVs spiked into human plasma. Western blotting, nanoparticle tracking, and transmission electron microscopy were used to validate and quantify the capture and release of intact small‐EVs. As proof‐of‐principle for sensitive detection of circulating miRNAs, we compared small‐RNA sequencing data from a subset of small‐EVs serum‐purified with EV‐CATCHER to data from whole serum, using samples from a small cohort of recently hospitalized Covid‐19 patients. We identified and validated, only in small‐EVs, hsa‐miR‐146a and hsa‐miR‐126‐3p to be significantly downregulated with disease severity. Separately, using convalescent sera from recovered Covid‐19 patients with high anti‐spike IgG titers, we confirmed the neutralizing properties, against SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro, of a subset of small‐EVs serum‐purified by EV‐CATCHER, as initially observed with ultracentrifuged small‐EVs.

Since late January, massive public health interventions have been implemented nationwide to contain the outbreak. We provide an impact assessment of the transmissibility and severity of COVID-19 during the first wave in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei. METHODS: We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wenzhou, and the ten Chinese provinces that had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; and the confirmed case-fatality risk (cCFR) in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Wenzhou, and all 31 Chinese provinces. We used a susceptible–infectious–recovered model to show the potential effects of relaxing containment measures after the first wave of infection, in anticipation of a possible second wave. FINDINGS: In all selected cities and provinces, the R(t) decreased substantially since Jan 23, when control measures were implemented, and have since remained below 1. The cCFR outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was almost five times lower than that in Hubei (5·91%, 5·73–6·09). Relaxing the interventions (resulting in R(t) >1) when the epidemic size was still small would increase the cumulative case count exponentially as a function of relaxation duration, even if aggressive interventions could subsequently push disease prevalence back to the baseline level. INTERPRETATION: The first wave of COVID-19 outside of Hubei has abated because of aggressive non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, given the substantial risk of viral reintroduction, particularly from overseas importation, close monitoring of R(t) and cCFR is needed to inform strategies against a potential second wave to achieve an optimal balance between health and economic protection.

The TaqMan(®) Array Card (TAC, Life Technologies™), can simultaneously test 7 clinical specimens for up to 21 individual pathogens (depending on arrangement of controls and use of duplicate wells) by arrayed singleplex RT-qPCR on a single assay card, using minimal amounts of clinical specimens. A previous study described the development of TAC for the detection of respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens; the assay was evaluated against well-characterized analytical materials and a limited collection of human clinical specimens. OBJECTIVES: We wished to compare TAC assay performance against standard individual RT-qPCR assays for respiratory viral detection, focusing on 10 viruses (adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1–4, influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus) from a larger collection of human specimens. STUDY DESIGN: We used specimens from 942 children with ARI enrolled systematically in a population-based, ARI surveillance study (New Vaccine Surveillance Network, NVSN). RESULTS: Compared with standard individual RT-qPCR assays, the sensitivity of TAC for the targeted viruses ranged from 54% to 95% (54%, 56%, and 75% for adenovirus, human parainfluenza viruses-1 and -2, respectively, and 82%–95% for the other viruses). Assay specificity was 99%, and coefficients of variation for virus controls ranged from 1.5% to 4.5%.

Information regarding the predictors of mortality in COVID‐19 patients remains scarce. Herein, we performed a systematic review of published articles, from January 1 to April 24, 2020, to evaluate the risk factors associated with mortality in COVID‐19. Two investigators independently searched the articles and collected the data, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We looked for associations between mortality and patient characteristics, comorbidities, and laboratory abnormalities. A total of 14 studies documenting the outcomes of 4659 patients were included. The presence of comorbidities such as hypertension (OR 2.5; 95% CI 2.1‐3.1; P<0.00001), coronary heart disease (OR 3.8; 95% CI 2.1‐6.9; P<0.00001) and diabetes (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.7‐2.3; P<0.00001) were associated with significantly higher risk of death amongst COVID‐19 patients.

It is being investigated as a treatment for a growing number of diseases including hepatic encephalopathy and eradication of antimicrobial resistant organisms, and the list of indications will likely expand in the future. There is no universally accepted definition of what FMT is, and its mechanism of action remains incompletely understood; this has likely contributed to the breadth of approaches to regulation depending on interpretation. In the UK FMT is considered a medicinal product, in North America, a biological product, whereas in parts of Europe, it is considered a human cell/ tissue product. Regulation seeks to improve quality and safety, however, lack of standardisation creates confusion, and overly restrictive regulation may hamper widespread access and discourage research using FMT. FMT is generally considered safe, especially if rigorous donor screening and testing is conducted. Most short-term risks are associated with the delivery method (e.g. colonoscopy). Longer term risks are less well described but longitudinal follow-up of treated cohorts is in place to assess for this, and no signal towards harm has been found to date. Rarely it has been associated with adverse outcomes including the transmission of antibiotic resistant bacteria, and even death. It is vital patients undergoing FMT are well informed to the currently appreciated risks and benefits before proceeding.","Merrick, Blair; Allen, Liz; Zain, Nur Masirah M.; Forbes, Ben; Shawcross, Debbie L.; Goldenberg, Simon D.",Infection prevention in practice,412,7

The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. METHOD: A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called “health-related literature” while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called “infection-related literature”. The study period was from 1980 to 2019. RESULTS: The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h-index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature (n = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature (n = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-metastatic activities of DMGF on the metastatic processes of melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. A transwell assay showed that DMGF could effectively attenuate the motility of B16F10 cells, and the results of real-time PCR revealed that DMGF also suppressed the expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2). Moreover, DMGF did not influence tube formation but inhibited the migration of endothelial cells. Furthermore, animal models were used to monitor the effects of DMGF on tumor metastasis, and all models showed that DMGF significantly suppressed the metastatic behaviors of B16F10 cells, including intravasation, colonization, and invasion of the lymphatic duct. In addition, DMGF could also reduce the densities of the blood vessels in the tumor area in vivo. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of anti-metastatic activity revealed that DMGF can down-regulate the levels of key modulators of the Cdc42/Rac1 pathway to interfere in F-actin polymerization and suppress the formation of lamellipodia by reducing the phosphorylation of CREB. These data suggested that DMGF presents anti-metastatic activities in B16F10 melanoma cells. Here, we demonstrated that DMGF can inhibit the metastasis of highly invasive melanoma cancer cells through the down-regulation of F-actin polymerization. Considering these findings, DMGF may be further developed to serve as a chemoprevention drug for patients with metastatic melanoma.","Lin, Ching-Min; Lin, Yu-Ling; Ho, Shu-Yi; Chen, Pin-Rong; Tsai, Yi-Hsuan; Chung, Chen-Han; Hwang, Chia-Hsiang; Tsai, Nu-Man; Tzou, Shey-Cherng; Ke, Chun-Yen; Chang, Jung; Chan, Yi-Lin; Wang, Yu-Shan; Chi, Kwan-Hwa; Liao, Kuang-Wen",Oncotarget,412,13

This study evaluates the associations between physical activity (PA), the level of stress and quality of sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Methods: An online survey was distributed during the governmental lockdown in April 2020 and included measures for assessing physical activity, stress and sleep. The surveyed participants included all adults aged 18 years and over. The final data were collected from the 1959 respondents using: International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Findings: Almost half of the respondents indicated a low level of PA, performing only 60 min of PA daily. Most of the participants reported a moderate or high level of stress (57% and 29%, respectively) and 64% of them reported poor quality of sleep. People with low levels of stress performed on average 85.1 min/day of walking (WPA), 40.9 min/day of moderate PA (MPA) or 52.6 min/day of vigorous PA (VPA). People with good quality of sleep performed 82.9 min/day of WPA, 43.6 min/day MPA and 40.5 min/day VPA. Interpretation: The results from the study indicate that the volume of daily PA may be a predictor of the level of stress and sleep quality in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. To retain a low level of stress and good quality of sleep, a lifestyle that allows to achieve a moderate level of physical activity should be maintained. The optimal daily dose of PA is at least 70 min per day, involving different intensities.","Lipert, Anna; Kozłowski, Remigiusz; Timler, Dariusz; Marczak, Michał; Musiał, Kamila; Rasmus, Paweł; Kamecka, Karolina; Jegier, Anna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,412,10

The world is now immobilized by this infectious RNA virus. As of May 18, already more than 4.8 million people have been infected and 316k people died. This RNA virus has the ability to do the mutation in the human body. Accurate determination of mutation rates is essential to comprehend the evolution of this virus and to determine the risk of emergent infectious disease. This study explores the mutation rate of the whole genomic sequence gathered from the patient's dataset of different countries. The collected dataset is processed to determine the nucleotide mutation and codon mutation separately. Furthermore, based on the size of the dataset, the determined mutation rate is categorized for four different regions: China, Australia, The United States, and the rest of the World. It has been found that a huge amount of Thymine (T) and Adenine (A) are mutated to other nucleotides for all regions, but codons are not frequently mutating like nucleotides. A recurrent neural network-based Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model has been applied to predict the future mutation rate of this virus. The LSTM model gives Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.06 in testing and 0.04 in training, which is an optimized value. Using this train and testing process, the nucleotide mutation rate of 400(th) patient in future time has been predicted. About 0.1% increment in mutation rate is found for mutating of nucleotides from T to C and G, C to G and G to T. While a decrement of 0.1% is seen for mutating of T to A, and A to C. It is found that this model can be used to predict day basis mutation rates if more patient data is available in updated time.","Pathan, Refat Khan; Biswas, Munmun; Khandaker, Mayeen Uddin",Chaos Solitons Fractals,412,16

Key to these efforts is public access to information that is understandable, reliable and meets their needs for informed decision-making on protective health behaviours. Learning from the trends in sources used in previous outbreaks will enable improvements in information access in future outbreaks. Two separate random-digit dialled telephone surveys were conducted in Alberta, Canada, to explore information sources used by the public, together with their perceived usefulness and credibility, during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic (n = 1209) and 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic (n = 1206). Traditional mass media were the most used information sources in both surveys. Although use of the Internet increased from 25% during SARS to 56% during H1N1, overall use of social media was not as high as anticipated. Friends and relatives were commonly used as an information source, but were not deemed very useful or credible. Conversely, doctors and health professionals were considered credible, but not consulted as frequently. The use of five or more information sources increased by almost 60% between the SARS and H1N1 surveys. There was a shift to older, more educated and more affluent respondents between the surveys, most likely caused by a decrease in the use of landlines amongst younger Canadians. It was concluded that people are increasingly using multiple sources of health risk information, presumably in a complementary manner. Subsequently, although using online media is important, this should be used to augment rather than replace more traditional information channels. Efforts should be made to improve knowledge transfer to health care professionals and doctors and provide them with opportunities to be more accessible as information sources. Finally, the future use of telephone surveys needs to account for the changing demographics of the respondents accessed through such surveys.","Jardine, Cynthia G.; Boerner, Franziska U.; Boyd, Amanda D.; Driedger, S.

Fifteen ARGs (tetA, tetB, tetC, tetE, tetG, tetL, tetM, tetO, tetQ, tetS, tetX, MOX, CIT, EBC, and FOX) and two integron genes (intI1, intI2) were tracked and detected in wastewater samples from a large-scale mWWTP with four parallel processes, including three biological technologies of AAO (anaerobic-anoxic-oxic), AB (adsorption-biodegradation), and UNITANK, two different disinfection technologies, and two primary sedimentation steps. The results showed that ARGs were widely detected, among which tetA and tetM had the highest detection rate at 100%. AAO was the most effective process in removing ARGs, followed by the AB and UNITANK processes, where the separation step was critical: 37.5% AmpC β-lactamase genes were reduced by the secondary clarifier. UV disinfection was more efficient than chlorination disinfection by 47.0% in ARG removal. Both disinfection and primary sedimentation processes could effectively remove integrons, and the swirling flow grit chamber was a more effective primary settling facility in total ARG removal than the aerated grit chamber. The tet genes and AmpC β-lactamase genes were significantly correlated with the water quality indexes of BOD(5), COD(Cr), SS, TP, TOC, pH and NH(4)(+)-N (p < 0.05). In addition, the correlation between efflux pump genes and AmpC β-lactamase genes was strongly significant (r(2) = 0.717, p < 0.01).

Guided by the Risk Information Seeking and Processing Model (RISP), we propose that the perceived social norms, information insufficiency, risk perception, affective risk response, and attitudes toward seeking predict information avoidance. We supplement the RISP model by considering information overload as the vast volume and the incredulous quality of information in the COVID-19 pandemic challenge individuals’ information acquisition and processing. Using a stratified demographic sample of news consumers of a federal German state (N = 1,000), we empirically examined the proposed model, answered the research question, and tested our hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The results reveal information avoidance among one-third of the respondents. They avoided online sources, including online-mediated interpersonal sources, more often than interpersonal sources and traditional mass media. Information avoidance was linked to more negative attitudes toward seeking and negative affective risk responses, more pronounced descriptive and injunctive avoidance norms, and perceived information overload. Attitudes and information overload were the most influential predictors of avoidance. In contrast, risk perception and information insufficiency were not associated with information avoidance. This study provides insights into theory development, contributes to the information behavior literature, and identifies barriers to communication during health crises.","Link, Elena",Inf Process Manag,412,16

Lung histopathology often reveals fibrin-based blockages in the small blood vessels of patients who succumb to the disease. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired and potentially life-threatening thrombophilia in which patients develop pathogenic autoantibodies targeting phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins (aPL antibodies). Case series have recently detected aPL antibodies in patients with COVID-19. Here, we measured eight types of aPL antibodies in serum samples from 172 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These aPL antibodies included anticardiolipin IgG, IgM, and IgA; anti–β(2) glycoprotein I IgG, IgM, and IgA; and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG and IgM. We detected aPS/PT IgG in 24% of serum samples, anticardiolipin IgM in 23% of samples, and aPS/PT IgM in 18% of samples. Antiphospholipid autoantibodies were present in 52% of serum samples using the manufacturer’s threshold and in 30% using a more stringent cutoff (≥40 ELISA-specific units). Higher titers of aPL antibodies were associated with neutrophil hyperactivity, including the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), higher platelet counts, more severe respiratory disease, and lower clinical estimated glomerular filtration rate. Similar to IgG from patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, IgG fractions isolated from patients with COVID-19 promoted NET release from neutrophils isolated from healthy individuals. Furthermore, injection of IgG purified from COVID-19 patient serum into mice accelerated venous thrombosis in two mouse models. These findings suggest that half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 become at least transiently positive for aPL antibodies and that these autoantibodies are potentially pathogenic.","Zuo, Yu; Estes, Shanea K.; Ali, Ramadan A.; Gandhi, Alex A.; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Sule, Gautam; Gockman, Kelsey; Madison, Jacqueline A.; Zuo, Melanie; Yadav, Vinita; Wang, Jintao; Woodard, Wrenn; Lezak, Sean P.; Lugogo, Njira L.; Smith, Stephanie A.; Morrissey, James H.; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S.",Sci Transl Med,412,6

The Illinois shelter in place orders enacted in March and April limited work and activities outside the home. Our aim for this study was to compare the effects of the COVID-19 shelter in place orders on PAP use patterns in patients with OSA. METHODS: We selected 30 patients seen between May and October 2020. Patients had been diagnosed with OSA for at least one year, prescribed PAP therapy and had been compliant with therapy as defined by 70% use greater 4-hour for 30 days prior to their clinic visit. Using data collected from chart review as well as online ResMed AirView cloud data, we evaluated PAP on/off and average use time during shelter in place order for a 90 day period (March through May 2020). We compared this data to a similar period in the year prior. RESULTS: Average age of our study group was 58.6 years old with 19 men and 11 women. Mean AHI was 51.7. Reported average bedtime was 10:00pm with average wake time 7:30am during the shutdown compared with a bedtime of 9pm and wake up time 6:30am. Patients reported having more time to sleep and required less naps during the day. Average PAP use during shut down was 7 hours 20 minutes and average PAP use prior to shutdown was 6 hours and 50 minutes. An average of 30 additional PAP minutes was observed among patients during the shelter in place order. Only one of our patients was diagnosed with COVID during this time period. CONCLUSION: For patients with OSA on PAP therapy we observed an increase in PAP use. Among patients suddenly required to shelter in place, we observed a delayed sleep onset and wake time of more than 1 hour, resulting in a slightly longer overall PAP use time. This circadian phase shift was greater among working patients compared to retired patients. The health effects of longer PAP use and circadian phase shifting remain to be determined.

We have used this device to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. In contrast to population methods, single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis. Single-cell analysis of antiviral candidates reveals not only efficacy but also properties of the members of the viral population most sensitive to the drug, the stage of the lifecycle most affected by the drug, and perhaps even if the drug targets an interaction of the virus with its host.","Liu, Wu; Caglar, Mehmet U.; Mao, Zhangming; Woodman, Andrew; Arnold, Jamie J.; Wilke, Claus O.; Cameron, Craig E.",bioRxiv,412,12

Coping with mental and physical stressors amidst the global lockdown is especially strenuous for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and more (LGBT+) community, who are frequently subjected to social stigma and minority stress. Systematic stigma and discrimination place LGBT+ individuals at higher risk for deleterious behaviors, such as substance abuse (e.g., injection drug use, smoking, alcohol) and risky sexual practices (e.g., anal/vaginal/oral sex). Maladaptive coping behaviors consequently increase the chances of HIV/AIDS risk among LGBT+ individuals, compared to heterosexual individuals. LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS perpetually face higher rates of unemployment, income disparity, and intimate partner violence. Prolonged home confinement, and impaired accessibility to healthcare, legal, and criminal justice services during lockdown may deplete the quality of life of LGBT+ individuals Living with HIV/AIDS. Therefore, it is critical that multidisciplinary service providers, including health professionals, employers, social services providers, educational institutions and community organizations, move toward online service delivery, so that homebound HIV-positive LGBT+ individuals are secured with a wide range of care options.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We review the literature to identify the characteristics of farms that have the potential to contribute to exceptional values in the three main components of the farm reproductive number ‐ R(f): contact rate, infectiousness and duration of infectiousness, and therefore might characterize potential superspreader farms for bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. RESULTS: Farms exhibit marked heterogeneity in contact rates arising from between‐farm trading of cattle. A minority of farms act as trading hubs that greatly augment connections within cattle trading networks. Herd infectiousness might be increased by high within‐herd transmission or the presence of supershedding individuals, or infectiousness might be prolonged due to undetected infections or by repeated local transmission, via wildlife or fomites. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting control methods on putative superspreader farms might yield disproportionate benefits in controlling endemic bovine tuberculosis in Great Britain. However, real‐time identification of any such farms, and integration of controls with industry practices, present analytical, operational and policy challenges.","Fielding, Helen R.; McKinley, Trevelyan J.; Delahay, Richard J.; Silk, Matthew J.; McDonald, Robbie A.",Vet Med Sci,412,9

To address these questions, we monitored immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in convalescent individuals over seven months and following mRNA vaccination. Spike Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD)-specific circulating antibodies and plasma neutralizing activity generally decreased over time, whereas RBD-specific memory B cells persisted. Additionally, using antibody depletion techniques, we showed that the neutralizing activity of plasma specifically resides in the anti-RBD antibodies. More vigorous antibody and B cell responses to vaccination were observed in previously infected subjects relative to uninfected comparators, presumably due to immune priming by infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection also led to increased numbers of double negative B memory cells, which are described as a dysfunctional B cell subset. This effect was reversed by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the vaccination-induced reduction in symptoms in patients with “Long-COVID”.","Mishra, Pankaj Kumar; Bruiners, Natalie; Ukey, Rahul; Datta, Pratik; Onyuka, Alberta; Handler, Deborah; Hussain, Sabiha; Honnen, William; Singh, Sukhwinder; Guerrini, Valentina; Yin, Yue; Dewald, Hannah; Choudhary, Alok; Horton, Daniel B.; Barrett, Emily S.; Roy, Jason; Weiss, Stanley H.; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly, Patricia; Blaser, Martin J.; Carson, Jeffrey L.; Panettieri, Reynold A.; Lardizabal, Alfred; Chang, Theresa Li-Yun; Pinter, Abraham; Gennaro, Maria Laura",medRxiv,412,1

Adult lesser mealworms were buried in central North Carolina Cecil red clay at depths of 0, 8, 15, 23, and 30 cm and the beetles emerging from the soil counted 1, 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 21, 24, and 28 d after burial. Beetles emerged from all depths and differences among depths were not significant. Beetles survived at least 28 d buried in the soil at depths ≤30 cm. In seasonal field studies, lesser mealworm emergence from clay soil with poultry litter incorporated by disk, mulch and plow was compared with emergence from plots with no incorporation. Incorporation significantly reduced beetle emergence when poultry litter containing large numbers of beetles was applied to clay field soils during the summer (F = 3.45; df = 3, 143; P = 0.018). Although mechanical incorporation of poultry litter reduced beetle emergence relative to the control, greatest reductions were seen in plowed treatments. Beetle activity was reduced after land application of litter during colder months. Generally, lesser mealworm emergence decreased with time and few beetles emerged from the soil 28 d after litter was applied. Similarly, mechanical incorporation of poultry litter into sandy soils reduced beetle emergence (F = 4.06; df = 3, 143; P < 0.008). In sandy soils typical of eastern North Carolina, disk and plow treatments significantly reduced beetle emergence compared with control.","Calibeo-Hayes, Dawn; Denning, Steve S.; Stringham, S.

The IId subtype family (SF) is one of the most prevalent subtypes of C. parvum. Some clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein systems have been developed to detect nucleic acid with high flexibility, sensitivity and specificity. METHODS: By integrating recombinase polymerase amplification and the Cas12a/crRNA trans-cleavage system (termed ReCTC), we established end-point diagnostics by observing fluorescence readouts with the naked eye under blue light and on-site diagnostics using a lateral flow strip (LFS) biosensor. RESULTS: Our ReCTC-based diagnoses can detect as little as a single copy of a cloned C. parvum 60-kDa glycoprotein (GP60) gene, 10 oocysts per gram (OPG), clinical fecal sample without tedious extraction of genomic DNA and have no cross-reactivity with other SFs of C. parvum or other common enteric parasitic protozoa.

Studying the evolution and transmission patterns in different countries is crucial to implement effective strategies for disease control and prevention. In this work, we present the full genome sequence for 17 SARS-CoV-2 isolates corresponding to the earliest sampled cases in Mexico. Global and local phylogenomics, coupled with mutational analysis, consistently revealed that these viral sequences are distributed within 2 known lineages, the SARS-CoV-2 lineage A/G, containing mostly sequences from North America, and the lineage B/S containing mainly sequences from Europe. Based on the exposure history of the cases and on the phylogenomic analysis, we characterized fourteen independent introduction events. Additionally, three cases with no travel history were identified. We found evidence that two of these cases represent local transmission cases occurring in Mexico during mid-March 2020, denoting the earliest events described in the country. Within this Mexican cluster, we also identified an H49Y amino acid change in the spike protein. This mutation is a homoplasy occurring independently through time and space, and may function as a molecular marker to follow on any further spread of these viral variants throughout the country. Our results depict the general picture of the SARS-CoV-2 variants introduced at the beginning of the outbreak in Mexico, setting the foundation for future surveillance efforts. This work is the result of the collaboration of five institutions into one research consortium: three public health institutes and two universities. From the beginning of this work, it was agreed that the experimental leader of each institution would share the first authorship. Those were the criteria followed to assign first co-first authorship in this manuscript. The order of the other authors was randomly assigned. IMPORTANCE Understanding the introduction, spread and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 within distinct human populations is crucial to implement effective control strategies as well as the evolution of the pandemics. In this work, we describe that the initial virus strains introduced in Mexico came from Europe and the United States and the virus was circulating locally in the country as early as mid-March. We also found evidence for early local transmission of strains having the mutation H49Y in the Spike protein, that could be further used as a molecular marker to follow viral spread within the country and the region.","Taboada, Blanca; Vazquez-Perez, Joel Armando; Muñoz Medina, José Esteban; Cervantes, Pilar Ramos; Escalera-Zamudio, Marina; Boukadida, Celia; Sanchez-Flores, Alejandro; Isa, Pavel; Condado, Edgar Mendieta; Martínez-Orozco, José Arturo; Becerril-Vargas, Eduardo; Salas-Hernández, Jorge; Grande, Ricardo; González-Torres, Carolina; Gaytán-Cervantes, Francisco Javier; Vazquez, Gloria; Pulido, Francisco; Rodríguez, Adnan Araiza; Garcés Ayala, Fabiola; González Bonilla, Cesar Raúl; Muñiz, Concepción Grajales; Borja Aburto, Víctor Hugo; Badillo, Gisela Barrera; López, Susana; Rivas, Lucía Hernández; Perez-Padilla, Rogelio; Martínez, Irma López; Ávila-Ríos, Santiago; Ruiz-Palacios, Guillermo; Ramírez-González, José Ernesto; Arias, Carlos F.",bioRxiv,412,24

We conducted some optimization to improve the genome sequencing workflow. The sensitivity of the workflow was also tested by serially diluting RNA from clinical samples. The optimized pipeline was finally applied to obtain the whole genomes of 29 clinical specimens collected in Hangzhou from January to March 2020. In the 29 obtained complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2, 33 variations were identified and analyzed. The genomic variations and phylogenetic analysis hinted at multiple sources and different transmission patterns during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hangzhou, China.

These compounds may induce acute kidney injuries and are not recommended in patients with poor renal function, such as kidney transplant recipients (KTx). Methods We reviewed the records of 42 KTx with COVID-19, some of them receiving ARV (n = 10) or RDV (n = 8) as part of the COVID-19 management. Most patients were male (71%) with a median age of 52 years and median GFR 56 mL/min and had mild (36%), moderate (19%), severe (31%), and critical (12%) disease. Subgroups (patients receiving ARV, RDV, or no antivirals) were comparable regarding patient age, comorbidities or immunosuppression. Results: Seven patients (16,6%) died during hospitalization. Acute kidney injury was found in 24% KTx at admission. Upon discharge, eGFR increased in 32% and decreased in 39% of the KTx compared with the admission. The decrease was more prevalent in the RDV group (80%) compared with KTx without any antiviral treatment (29%) (p < 0.05). Most patients (62%) returned to baseline eGFR values within one month from discharge. The proportion was similar between the patients receiving antiviral treatment or not. Conclusions KTx run a high risk of COVID-19-related renal impairment. Antivirals appear safe for use without major risks for kidney injury.","Elec, Alina Daciana; Oltean, Mihai; Goldis, Patricia; Cismaru, Cristina; Lupse, Mihaela; Muntean, Adriana; Elec, Florin Ioan",Int J Infect Dis,412,1

In this study, our goal was to explore the changing expression levels of acute-phase reaction proteins (APRPs) in the serum of COVID-19 patients and to elucidate the immunological characteristics of COVID-19. In the study design, we recruited 72 COVID-19 patients, including 22 cases of mild degree, 38 cases of moderate degree and 12 cases of severe degree. We also recruited 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and 20 normal control subjects as a comparison. Fasting venous blood was taken to detect the content of complement 3 (C3), complement 4 (C4), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and prealbumin (PA). When compared the COVID-19 group with the CAP and normal control groups, respectively, the mean value of CRP and SAA in the COVID-19 group (including mild, moderate and severe patients) had increased significantly (P < 0.01), whereas the mean values of C3, C4 and PA decreased (P < 0.01). For the asymptomatic or mild symptomatic patients with COVID-19, the actual aggravation of disease may be more advanced than the clinical appearances. Meanwhile, the statistical analyses indicated that the development of COVID-19 brought about a significant increase in the content of CRP and SAA (P < 0.01), and a decline in the content of C3, C4 and PA (P < 0.01). These findings suggested that the changes in the level of APRPs could be used as indicators to identify the degree and progression of COVID-19, and the significant changes might demonstrate the aggravation of disease. This study provided a new approach to improve the clinical management plan and prognosis of COVID-19.","Li, Lu; Chen, Changzheng",Epidemiology and infection,412,9

Results: 33% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 30, 36%) of lymphoma patients and 31% (28, 34%) of caregivers but only 21% (17, 24%) of normal individuals had any level of anxiety (both pair-wise P < 0.001). Amongst lymphoma respondents physical exercise and better caregiver support were associated with less anxiety whereas female sex, receiving therapy and reduced therapy intensity were associated with more anxiety. Paradoxically, lymphoma respondents during the pandemic had better HRQoL than pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy intensity was associated with worse HRQoL whereas respondents who scored caregiver support and the online patient education programme high had better HRQoL. Conclusions: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic lymphoma patients and their caregivers had significantly higher incidence of anxiety compared with normals. Lymphoma respondents reported better HRQoL compared with pre-pandemic controls. Reduced therapy-intensity in patients with cancer may have unanticipated adverse effects on anxiety and HRQoL. Regular and intense support by caregivers and online education programmes alleviate anxiety and improve HRQoL.","Yang, S.; Dong, D.; Gu, H.; Gale, R. P.; Ma, J.; Huang, X.",,412,26

These include the well-known oligoadenylate synthase (OAS) family proteins and the recently identified OAS homologue cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS). The OAS proteins and cGAS are template-independent nucleotidyltransferases that, once activated by double-stranded nucleic acids in the cytosol, produce unique classes of 2′–5′-linked second messenger molecules, which — through distinct mechanisms — have crucial antiviral functions. 2′–5′-linked oligoadenylates limit viral propagation through the activation of the enzyme RNase L, which degrades host and viral RNA, and 2′–5′-linked cGAMP activates downstream signalling pathways to induce de novo antiviral gene expression. In this Progress article, we describe the striking functional and structural similarities between OAS proteins and cGAS, and highlight their roles in antiviral immunity.

We therefore designed and evaluated a ready-to-use 22 target respiratory infection reverse-transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) panel to determine if this would improve detection of these agents at our pediatric hospital. METHODS: RT-qPCR assays for twenty-two target organisms were dried-down in individual wells of 96 well plates and saved at room temperature. Targets included 18 respiratory viruses and 4 bacteria. After automated nucleic acid extraction of nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples, rapid qPCR was performed. RT-qPCR results were compared with those obtained by the testing methods used at our hospital laboratories. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-nine pediatric NPA samples were tested with the RT-qPCR panel. One or more respiratory pathogens were detected in 132/159 (83%) samples. This was significantly higher than the detection rate of standard methods (94/159, 59%) (P<0.001). This difference was mainly due to improved RT-qPCR detection of rhinoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, bocavirus, and coronaviruses. The panel internal control assay performance remained stable at room temperature storage over a two-month testing period. CONCLUSION: The RT-qPCR panel was able to identify pathogens in a high proportion of respiratory samples. The panel detected more positive specimens than the methods in use at our hospital. The pre-made panel format was easy to use and rapid, with results available in approximately 90 minutes. We now plan to determine if use of this panel improves patient care and antibiotic stewardship.","Ellis, Chelsey; Misir, Amita; Hui, Charles; Jabbour, Mona; Barrowman, Nicholas; Langill, Jonathan; Bowes, Jennifer; Slinger, Robert",World J Pediatr,412,18

Little is known about the extent and quality of their antiviral humoral response. Here, we analyze antibody functions in 52 asymptomatic infected individuals, 119 mild and 21 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We measured anti-Spike IgG, IgA and IgM levels with the S-Flow assay and map IgG-targeted epitopes by Luminex. We also evaluated neutralization, complement deposition and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) using replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 or reporter cell systems. We show that COVID-19 sera mediate complement deposition and kill infected cells by ADCC. Sera from asymptomatic individuals neutralize the virus, activate ADCC and trigger complement deposition. Antibody levels and functions are lower in asymptomatic individuals than in symptomatic cases. Antibody functions are correlated, regardless of disease severity. Longitudinal samplings show that antibody functions follow similar kinetics of induction and contraction. Overall, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits polyfunctional antibodies neutralizing the virus and targeting infected cells.","Dufloo, Jérémy; Grzelak, Ludivine; Staropoli, Isabelle; Madec, Yoann; Tondeur, Laura; Anna, François; Pelleau, Stéphane; Wiedemann, Aurélie; Planchais, Cyril; Buchrieser, Julian; Robinot, Rémy; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Mouquet, Hugo; Charneau, Pierre; White, Michael; Lévy, Yves; Hoen, Bruno; Fontanet, Arnaud; Schwartz, Olivier; Bruel, Timothée",Cell Rep Med,412,24

Many people have become physically inactive and developed irregular eating patterns, which leads to unhealthier lifestyles and aggravation of lifestyle-related diseases; these in turn increase the severity of COVID-19. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed a smartphone application called “Taberhythm” to investigate eating patterns, physical activity, and subjective feelings of happiness. We aimed to compare lifestyle data before and during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to objectively assess lifestyle changes during quarantine. A total of 464 smartphone users (346 women, 35 ± 12 years old, body mass index [BMI] 23.4 ± 4.5) participated in Period A (January 7 to April 28, 2019) and 622 smartphone users (533 women, 32 ± 11 years old, BMI 23.3 ± 4.0) participated in Period B (January 6 to April 26, 2020). Compared with Period A, there was a sharp decline in physical activity during Period B (4642 ± 3513 vs. 3814 ± 3529 steps/day, p<0.001), especially during the final 9 weeks in both periods (4907 ± 3908 vs. 3528 ± 3397 steps/day, p<0.001); however, there were large variations in physical activity among participants. We found a surprising trend during Period B toward increased happiness among women aged 30–50 years, the group most affected by stay-at-home policies that led to working from home and school closure. Moreover, daily eating duration declined in this population. Additionally, there was a positive association of happiness with steps per day in Period B (ρ = 0.38, p = 0.02). Despite the many negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, subjective feelings of happiness among middle-aged Japanese women tended to increase, which indicates that some favorable lifestyle changes that could be adopted during quarantine in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Azuma, Koichiro; Nojiri, Tetsuya; Kawashima, Motoko; Hanai, Akiyoshi; Ayaki, Masahiko; Tsubota, Kazuo",PLoS One,412,21

However, the validity of such scores in COVID-19 is unknown. METHODS The North West Collaborative Organization for Respiratory Research (NW-CORR) performed a multi-centre prospective evaluation of adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 during a two-week period in April 2020. Clinical variables measured as part of usual care at presentation to hospital were recorded, including the CURB-65, NEWS2, and qSOFA scores. The primary outcome of interest was 30-day mortality. RESULTS Data were collected for 830 people with COVID-19 admitted across 7 hospitals. By 30 days, a total of 300 (36.1%) had died and 142 (17.1%) had been in ICU. All scores underestimated mortality compared to their original validation in non-COVID-19 populations, and overall prognostic performance was generally poor. Among the 'low risk' categories (CURB-65<2, NEWS2<5, qSOFA<2) 30-day mortality was 16.7%, 32.9% and 21.4%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression identified features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse as most relevant prognostic variables. CONCLUSION All existing prognostic scores evaluated here underestimated adverse outcomes and performed sub-optimally in the COVID-19 setting. New prognostic tools including a focus on features of respiratory compromise rather than circulatory collapse are needed. We provide a baseline set of variables which are relevant to COVID-19 outcomes and may be used as a basis for developing a bespoke COVID-19 prognostication tool.","Frost, F.; Bradley, P.; Tharmaratnam, K.; North West Collaborative Organisation for Respiratory Research,; Wootton, D.

Numerical phenotyping is a paradigmatic example. This behavioral investigation method uses computerized measurement tools in order to collect characteristics of different psychiatric disorders. First, it is necessary to contextualize the emergence of these new methods and to question their promises and expectations. The international mental health research framework invites us to reflect on methodological issues and to draw conclusions from certain impasses related to the clinical complexity of this field. From this contextualization, the investigation method relating to digital phenotyping can be questioned in order to identify some of its potentials. These new methods are also an opportunity to test psychoanalysis. It is then necessary to identify the elements of fruitful analysis that clinical experience and research in psychoanalysis have been able to deploy regarding the challenges of digital technology. An analysis of this theme’s literature shows that psychoanalysis facilitates a reflection on the psychological effects related to digital methods. It also shows how it can profit from the research potential offered by new technical tools, considering the progress that has been made over the past 50 years. This cross-fertilization of the potentials and limitations of digital methods in mental health intervention in the context of theoretical issues at the international level invites us to take a resolutely non-reductionist position. In the field of research, psychoanalysis offers a specific perspective that can well be articulated to an epistemology of networks. Rather than aiming at a numerical phenotyping of patients according to the geneticists’ model, the case formulation method appears to be a serious prerequisite to give a limited and specific place to the integration of smartphones in clinical investigation.","Potier, Rémy",Front Psychol,412,1

Immunosensors incorporate the specific immunochemical reaction with the modern transducers including electrochemical (potentiometric, conductometric, capacitative, impedance, amperometric), optical (fluorescence, luminescence, refractive index), and microgravimetric transducers. These immunosensor devices with dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity possess the abilities to investigate the reaction dynamics of antibody–antigen binding and the potential to revolutionize conventional immunoassay techniques. With the rapid development of immunological reagents and detection equipments, immunosensors have allowed an increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantified and in particular, simple-to-use, inexpensive, and reliable immunosensing systems have been developed for areas such as outpatient monitoring, large screening programs, and remote environmental surveillance. Immunosensors with lowered detection limits and increased sensitivities have been developed in various fields, particularly in clinical analysis. A noticeable development trend is also observed in the development of immunosensors combining with other techniques such as flow injection analysis (FIA) or capillary electrophoretic (CE) analysis, which complement and improve the present immunoassay methods. Belov et al. have proposed a novel immunophenotyping method for leukemias which uses a cluster of differentiation antibody microarray, and a microarray of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay has been developed for autoimmune diagnosis of systematic rheumatic disease. Development of microfluidic immunosensor systems for proteomics and drug discovery have also been reported in recent years where the microfluidic system integrates multiple processes in a single device to improve analytical performance by reducing the reagent consumption and the analysis time, and increasing reliability and sensitivity through automation.","Wang, Hua; Shen, Guoli; Yu, Ruqin","Electrochemical Sensors, Biosensors and their Biomedical Applications",412,14

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, has a wide range of clinical manifestations ranging from subclinical infection to multi-organ failure. In addition to the respiratory system, COVID-19 also adversely affects the kidneys. In this study, we aimed to measure the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 and its association with the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods We conducted our study by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search using four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrial.gov) was performed. Our initial search returned 2,771 articles. After excluding review articles, duplicates, and non-relevant studies, we included 20 articles that reported an association between COVID-19 and AKI. We subsequently performed a random effect analysis to find the pooled prevalence, pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates, and 95% confidence intervals for severe COVID-19 and mortality outcomes in AKI using Cochrane RevMan (version 5.4) and R programming language (version 4.16-2). Results A total of 14,415 patients from various countries were included. Among the 20 cohorts, the median age was 55.8 ±8.39 years (range: 43-72 years), and 43.78% of the subjects were female. Out of a total of 14,415 patients, 3,820 developed AKI with a pooled prevalence of 11% (95% CI: 0.07-0.15; p<0.01; I(2)=98%). AKI was found to have a significant association with severe COVID-19 disease, with a pooled OR of 8.45 (95% CI: 5.56-12.56; p<0.00001; I(2)=0%).

The immune system is considered to play a crucial role for the pathogenesis of COVID-19, although especially the contribution of innate-like T cells remains poorly understood. Here, we analysed the phenotype and function of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, innate-like T cells with potent antimicrobial effector function, in patients with mild and severe COVID-19 by multicolour flow cytometry. Our data indicate that MAIT cells are highly activated in patients with COVID-19, irrespective of the course of disease, and express high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-17A and TNFα ex vivo. Of note, expression of the activation marker HLA-DR positively correlated with SAPS II score, a measure of disease severity. Upon MAIT cell-specific in vitro stimulation, MAIT cells however failed to upregulate expression of the cytokines IL-17A and TNFα, as well as cytolytic proteins, that is, granzyme B and perforin. Thus, our data point towards an altered cytokine expression profile alongside an impaired antibacterial and antiviral function of MAIT cells in COVID-19 and thereby contribute to the understanding of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.","Deschler, Sebastian; Kager, Juliane; Erber, Johanna; Fricke, Lisa; Koyumdzhieva, Plamena; Georgieva, Alexandra; Lahmer, Tobias; Wiessner, Johannes R.; Voit, Florian; Schneider, Jochen; Horstmann, Julia; Iakoubov, Roman; Treiber, Matthias; Winter, Christof; Ruland, Jürgen; Busch, Dirk H.; Knolle, Percy A.; Protzer, Ulrike; Spinner, Christoph D.; Schmid, Roland M.; Quante, Michael; Böttcher, Katrin",Viruses,412,1

The proposed model has been verified for the adequate description of the rheological behavior of suspensions, introducing a scalar variable that describes dynamically the level of internal microstructure of rouleaux at any instance, capturing accurately the aggregation and disaggregation mechanisms of the RBCs. Also, a non-linear fitting is adopted for the definition of the model’s parameters on limited available experimental data of steady and transient rheometric flows of blood samples. We present the predictability of the new model in various steady and transient rheometric flows, including startup shear, rectangular shear steps, shear cessation, triangular shear steps and LAOS tests. Our model provides predictions for the elasto-thixotropic mechanism in startup shear flows, demonstrating a non-monotonic relationship of the thixotropic index on the shear-rate. The intermittent shear step test reveals the dynamics of the structural reconstruction, which in turn is associated with the aggregation process. Moreover, our model offers robust predictions for less examined tests such as uniaxial elongation, in which normal stress was found to have considerable contribution. Apart from the integrated modeling of blood rheological complexity, our implementation is adequate for multi-dimensional simulations due to its tensorial formalism accomplished with a single time scale for the thixotropic effects, resulting in a low computational cost compared to other TEVP models.","Giannokostas, Konstantinos; Moschopoulos, Pantelis; Varchanis, Stylianos; Dimakopoulos, Yannis; Tsamopoulos, John",Materials (Basel),412,1

(2) Methods: To document the early impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis on psychiatry and mental health sectors, a systematic review of the international literature published in 2020 was conducted in PubMed (MEDLINE), Cairn.info, and SantéPsy (Ascodocpsy) databases. (3) Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 72 articles from scientific journals were selected, including papers documenting the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organization of psychiatric care delivery, work processes in psychiatry and mental health units, and personal experiences of mental health professionals. This review identified the contributions aimed at preventing the onset of mental disorders in the early stages of the health crisis. It lists the organizational changes that have been implemented in the first place to ensure continuity of psychiatric care while reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. It questions the evolution of the rights and duties of mental health professionals in the first months of the pandemic. (4) Discussion and conclusions: Although this literature review exclusively documented the early impacts of the COVID-19 health crisis, it is of significant interest, as it pictures the unprecedent situation in which psychiatry and mental health care professionals found themselves in the first stages of the pandemic. This work is a preliminary step of a study to be conducted with mental health professionals on an international scale—the Psy-GIPO2C project—based on more than 15 group interviews, 30 individual interviews, and 2000 questionnaires. The final aim of this study is to formulate concrete recommendations for decision-makers to improve work in psychiatry and mental health.","Gourret Baumgart, Jade; Kane, Hélène; El-Hage, Wissam; Deloyer, Jocelyn; Maes, Christine; Lebas, Marie-Clotilde; Marazziti, Donatella; Thome, Johannes; Fond-Harmant, Laurence; Denis, Frédéric",Int J Environ Res Public Health,412,30

Hypericin (HY) is an excellent compound that has been investigated in antiviral, antineoplastic, and antidepressant. To investigate the inhibition effect of HY on IBV infection in chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells, 3 different experimental designs: pre-treatment of cells prior to IBV infection, direct treatment of IBV-infected cells, and pre-treatment of IBV prior to cell infection were used. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), flow cytometry, and fluorescence microscopy were performed and virus titer was determined by TCID(50). The results revealed that HY had a good anti-IBV effect when HY directly treated the IBV-infected cells, and virus infectivity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, HY inhibited IBV-induced apoptosis in CEK cells, and significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of Fas, FasL, JNK, Bax, Caspase 3, and Caspase 8, and significantly increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression level in CEK cells. In addition, HY treatment could decrease IBV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in CEK cells. These results suggested that HY showed potential antiviral activities against IBV infection involving the inhibition of apoptosis and ROS generation in CEK cells.","Chen, Huijie; Feng, Rui; Muhammad, Ishfaq; Abbas, Ghulam; Zhang, Yue; Ren, Yudong; Huang, Xiaodan; Zhang, Ruili; Diao, Lei; Wang, Xiurong; Li, Guangxing",Poult Sci,412,1

This study examines two databases to probe any correlation between protests and increases of COVID-19 case rates afterward. METHODS: A BLM protest aggregator and a county-level COVID-19 database were crosswalked, matching the city that the protest occurred in with the county and its case rates at 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the index protest, and was compared with a control county in the same state with the nearest match of population size and case rate at Week 0. RESULTS: In the 22 days after the killing of George Floyd, there were 326 counties participating in 868 protests, attended by an estimated 757 077 protestors. The median case rate at Week 3 was 0.0049 in protest counties versus 0.0041 in control counties, which was found to be statistically significant. Regression analysis found that each individual protestor contributed to the case rate by 7.65 × 10(−9), which was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Although the increase was statistically significant, it was very small in magnitude and likely due to limitations of significantly different population sizes in comparators.","Neyman, Gregory; Dalsey, William",J Public Health (Oxf),412,1

Determination of early assessments for patients with a risk of clinical deterioration would benefit the management of COVID-19 outbreaks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 214 confirmed COVID-19 patients were enrolled from January 11th to February 11th 2020. Medical records including laboratory parameters, clinical outcomes and other characteristics of the admitted patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The critical patients experienced a significantly prolonged onset–admission interval and presented with lymphopenia (r=−0.547, p=0.015) and lower albumin level (p<0.001) 6 days after symptom onset. Early admission of critical patients significantly reduced the duration of hormone therapy. Starting from 9 days of hospital stay, the reduced lymphocyte counts exhibited linear growth. Furthermore, on days 9 and 12, significant correlations were demonstrated between immunological manifestations and duration of hormone therapy in critical patients, and length of hospital stay in severe patients. In addition, the virus negative conversion rate was more significantly correlated with increased lymphocytes in critical patients. CONCLUSION: Early intervention, within 6 days of symptom onset, benefited patients’ recovery from critical illness. The 9–12 days of hospital care represented a valuable window during which to evaluate the therapeutic effects on physical recovery and virus clearance.","Yuan, Jing; Kou, Shanglong; Liang, Yanhua; Lan, JianFeng; Li, Xiaohe; Zeng, Lijiao; Zou, Rongrong; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Pan, Yanchao",J Inflamm Res,412,1

Those reactions may be adaptive or not depending on situational or psychological processes. Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic through multiple pathways as suggested by Rodgers et al. (2020). Among the psychological variables that may have increased dysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors as a consequence of the social distancing and isolation, we looked at perfectionism. Perfectionism is a well-recognized risk and maintaining factor of eating-related symptoms and interact with stress increasing the probability of dysfunctional reactions (e.g., Wang and Li, 2017). The present study investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and eating behaviors by considering the mediating role of psychological distress. Data were collected from two countries (Italy and Spain) by means of an online survey. The samples included 465 (63.4% female) participants from Italy and 352 (68.5% female) from Spain. Participants completed the short form of the Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Lombardo et al., 2021) to assess self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as the short form of Three Factors Eating Questionnaire (Karlsson et al., 2000) and the Italian version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (Bottesi et al., 2015), respectively used to assess restrictive, emotional and uncontrolled eating on one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress on the other. Multigroup analysis was performed to test the hypothesized model. Results showed that other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were indirectly related to most of the dysfunctional eating aspects through the mediation of psychological distress, and the pattern obtained was consistent in both countries. These findings evidence that the psychological distress potentially related to the COVID-19 disease mediates the negative impact of interpersonal perfectionism and the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions.","Vacca, Mariacarolina; De Maria, Alessandra; Mallia, Luca; Lombardo, Caterina",Front Psychol,412,5

In this study, we explored the demographic details, clinical features, and routinely conducted laboratory investigations of patients with COVID-19 during the second and third waves of the pandemic to understand their possible diagnostic and prognostic values in Egypt. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, the demographic characteristics, detailed medical history, laboratory findings, and symptoms of all enrolled patients with SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the medical records of Beni Suef University Hospitals between December 15, 2020, and April 15, 2021. RESULTS: This retrospective study included 473 patients, almost all of whom were elderly. The median age of the patients was 48 years, and those with moderate and severe disease were older than those with mild infections. The proportion of females was higher (63.4%) than males (36.6%). Diabetes mellitus (DM) was the most common comorbidity (17.3%), and fever was the most typical manifestation of COVID-19 (62.6%). Those with severe disease showed a higher C-reactive protein level (CRP) than those with moderate (p-value 0.009) or mild (p-value 0.01) diseases. Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in patients with severe disease than in those with moderate disease (p-value 0.018). In contrast, D-dimer and serum creatinine were normal and showed no significant difference in all comparisons (p-value overall 0.21). CONCLUSION: This study observed several variations in COVID-19 patients’ characteristics. The new manifestations included skin rash, bone and low back pains, and rigors. In contrast to females, most males had moderate-to-severe illness. Old age and higher body mass index was associated with increasing severity. D-dimer and complete blood count were normal and could not identify potential COVID‐19 patients. Patients who had mild illness were still at risk of developing post-COVID complications.","Eid, Ragaey A.; Attia, Abdelrahman M.; Hassan, Mahmoud; Shaker, Marwa Abdallah; Kamal, Manar Ahmed",J Infect Public Health,412,30

Here, we combine both human mobility and non-pharmaceutical interventions (social-distancing and suspected-cases isolation) into SEIR transmission model to understand how coronavirus transmits in a global environment. Dynamic trends of region-specific time-variant reproduction number, social-distancing rate, work-resumption rate, and suspected-cases isolation rate have been estimated and plotted for each region by fitting stochastic transmission processes to the real total confirmed cases reported of each region. We find after shutdown in Wuhan, the reproduction number in Wuhan greatly declined from 6·982 (95% CI 2·558–14·668) on January 23rd, 2020 to 1.130 (95% CI 0.289–3.279) on February 7th, 2020, and there was a higher intervention level in terms of social-distancing and suspected-cases isolation in Wuhan than the Chinese average and Western average, for the period from the shutdown in Wuhan to mid-March. Future epidemic trajectories of Western countries up to October 10th, 2020, have been predicted with 95% confidence intervals. Through the scenario simulation, we discover the benefits of earlier international travel ban and rigorous intervention strategies, and the significance of non-pharmaceutical interventions. From a global perspective, it is vital for each country to control the risks of imported cases, and execute rigorous non-pharmaceutical interventions before successful vaccination development.","Yang, Tianan; Liu, Yexin; Deng, Wenhao; Zhao, Weigang; Deng, Jianwei",Sci Rep,412,11

Early in the pandemic, when need was greatest, the absence of sufficient training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions. Even now, there is a need for Chest-X-ray (CxR) screening tools in low and middle income countries (LMIC), when RT-PCR is delayed, to exclude COVID-19 pneumonia (Cov-Pneum) requiring transfer to higher care. In absence of local LMIC data and poor portability of CxR DL algorithms, a new approach is needed. Axiomatically, it is faster to repurpose existing data than to generate new datasets. Here, we describe CovBaseAI, an explainable tool which uses an ensemble of three DL models and an expert decision system (EDS) for Cov-Pneum diagnosis, trained entirely on datasets from the pre-COVID-19 period. Portability, performance, and explainability of CovBaseAI was primarily validated on two independent datasets. First, 1401 randomly selected CxR from an Indian quarantine-center to assess effectiveness in excluding radiologic Cov-Pneum that may require higher care. Second, a curated dataset with 434 RT-PCR positive cases of varying levels of severity and 471 historical scans containing normal studies and non-COVID pathologies, to assess performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had accuracy of 87% with negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data for Cov-Pneum. However, sensitivity varied from 0.66 to 0.90 depending on whether RT-PCR or radiologist opinion was set as ground truth. This tool with explainability feature has better performance than publicly available algorithms trained on COVID-19 data but needs further improvement.","Gidde, P. S.; Prasad, S. S.; Singh, A.

We undertook a UK-wide survey to study how CF centres adapted their practice during this time. Method: We contacted CF nurses to explore service changes to routine outpatient care, emergency consultations, annual reviews (AR), and use of remote monitoring between March - July 2020. Results: Nineteen centres (13 adult) caring for 34% of the UK CF population replied (response rate 35%). Eleven (58%) ceased routine FTF appointments until virtual clinics were implemented, in 1 centre solely by telephone. Six centres suspended AR, the remainder integrating them into virtual or emergency FTF appointments. All noted reduction in hospital admission rates, citing better treatment compliance, reluctance to admission, effect of shielding and initiation of CFTR modulators. Twelve centres (63%) reported increased demand for psychology input. Departmental spirometry was only performed at F2Fclinics and all centres distributed remote spirometry devices to suitable pwCF, with training delivered F2F or remotely. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings continued virtually at all centres. Fourteen (73%) reported an increase in home visits for blood tests and IV antibiotic management. To cope, 20% reduced support visits and extended TIVAD flush duration intervals. Nine continued existing research activity. Most centres reported initial technical issues with virtual clinics that were subsequently addressed and have incorporated virtual appointments into their care. Conclusions: Despite need for rapid service change, all centres continued to support their pwCF. Virtual clinics and MDT meetings were adopted by all centres within the UK and this service will strengthen in time.","Hameed, M.
