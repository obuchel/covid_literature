518,518,518,Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered Transmissible Therapies,11.158029,5.2507176,2011-03-17,"Infectious disease treatments, both pharmaceutical and vaccine, face three universal challenges: the difficulty of targeting treatments to high-risk ‘superspreader’ populations who drive the great majority of disease spread, behavioral barriers in the host population (such as poor compliance and risk disinhibition), and the evolution of pathogen resistance. Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals — analogous to ‘transmissible immunization’ that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multi-scale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ∼30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by <2-fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.","Metzger, Vincent T.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.; Weinberger, Leor S.",PLoS Comput Biol,205,1
582,582,582,Network Clustering Revealed the Systemic Alterations of Mitochondrial Protein Expression,11.220726,5.272204,2011-06-30,"The mitochondrial protein repertoire varies depending on the cellular state. Protein component modifications caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion are related to a wide range of human diseases; however, little is known about how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome) changes under such dysfunctional states. In this study, we investigated the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted (ρ(0)) mitochondria by using network analysis of gene expression data. By modularizing the quantified proteomics data into protein functional networks, systemic properties of mitochondrial dysfunction were analyzed. We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that ρ(0) cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. Human mt protein functional networks provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.","Jeon, Jouhyun; Jeong, Jae Hoon; Baek, Je-Hyun; Koo, Hyun-Jung; Park, Wook-Ha; Yang, Jae-Seong; Yu, Myeong-Hee; Kim, Sanguk; Pak, Youngmi Kim",PLoS Comput Biol,205,1
651,651,651,Inferring viral quasispecies spectra from 454 pyrosequencing reads,11.189661,5.539823,2011-07-28,"BACKGROUND: RNA viruses infecting a host usually exist as a set of closely related sequences, referred to as quasispecies. The genomic diversity of viral quasispecies is a subject of great interest, particularly for chronic infections, since it can lead to resistance to existing therapies. High-throughput sequencing is a promising approach to characterizing viral diversity, but unfortunately standard assembly software was originally designed for single genome assembly and cannot be used to simultaneously assemble and estimate the abundance of multiple closely related quasispecies sequences. RESULTS: In this paper, we introduce a new Viral Spectrum Assembler (ViSpA) method for quasispecies spectrum reconstruction and compare it with the state-of-the-art ShoRAH tool on both simulated and real 454 pyrosequencing shotgun reads from HCV and HIV quasispecies. Experimental results show that ViSpA outperforms ShoRAH on simulated error-free reads, correctly assembling 10 out of 10 quasispecies and 29 sequences out of 40 quasispecies. While ShoRAH has a significant advantage over ViSpA on reads simulated with sequencing errors due to its advanced error correction algorithm, ViSpA is better at assembling the simulated reads after they have been corrected by ShoRAH. ViSpA also outperforms ShoRAH on real 454 reads. Indeed, 7 most frequent sequences reconstructed by ViSpA from a real HCV dataset are viable (do not contain internal stop codons), and the most frequent sequence was within 1% of the actual open reading frame obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing. In contrast, only one of the sequences reconstructed by ShoRAH is viable. On a real HIV dataset, ShoRAH correctly inferred only 2 quasispecies sequences with at most 4 mismatches whereas ViSpA correctly reconstructed 5 quasispecies with at most 2 mismatches, and 2 out of 5 sequences were inferred without any mismatches. ViSpA source code is available at http://alla.cs.gsu.edu/~software/VISPA/vispa.html. CONCLUSIONS: ViSpA enables accurate viral quasispecies spectrum reconstruction from 454 pyrosequencing reads. We are currently exploring extensions applicable to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data from bacterial metagenomic samples and ecological samples of eukaryote populations.","Astrovskaya, Irina; Tork, Bassam; Mangul, Serghei; Westbrooks, Kelly; Măndoiu, Ion; Balfe, Peter; Zelikovsky, Alex",BMC Bioinformatics,205,1

1151,1151,1151,Unified Theory of Bacterial Sialometabolism: How and Why Bacteria Metabolize Host Sialic Acids,11.142509,5.611638,2013-01-15,"Sialic acids are structurally diverse nine-carbon ketosugars found mostly in humans and other animals as the terminal units on carbohydrate chains linked to proteins or lipids. The sialic acids function in cell-cell and cell-molecule interactions necessary for organismic development and homeostasis. They not only pose a barrier to microorganisms inhabiting or invading an animal mucosal surface, but also present a source of potential carbon, nitrogen, and cell wall metabolites necessary for bacterial colonization, persistence, growth, and, occasionally, disease. The explosion of microbial genomic sequencing projects reveals remarkable diversity in bacterial sialic acid metabolic potential. How bacteria exploit host sialic acids includes a surprisingly complex array of metabolic and regulatory capabilities that is just now entering a mature research stage. This paper attempts to describe the variety of bacterial sialometabolic systems by focusing on recent advances at the molecular and host-microbe-interaction levels. The hope is that this focus will provide a framework for further research that holds promise for better understanding of the metabolic interplay between bacterial growth and the host environment. An ability to modify or block this interplay has already yielded important new insights into potentially new therapeutic approaches for modifying or blocking bacterial colonization or infection.","Vimr, Eric R.",ISRN Microbiol,205,1

The bindings of eight natural components in DHI between bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy technology and molecular docking. According to the results, the quenching process of salvianolic acid B and hydroxysafflor yellow A was a static quenching procedure through the analysis of quenching data by the Stern-Volmer equation, the modified Stern-Volmer equation, and the modified Scatchard equation. Meanwhile, syringin (Syr) enhanced the fluorescence of BSA, and the data were analyzed using the Lineweaver-Burk equation. Molecular docking suggested that all of these natural components bind to serum albumin at the site I location. Further competitive experiments of SaB confirmed the result of molecular docking studies duo to the displacement of warfarin by SaB. Base on these studies, we selected SaB as a research target because it presented the strongest binding ability to BSA and investigated the influence of the multi-components coexisting in DHI on the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA binding system. The participation of these natural components in DHI affected the interaction between the components of the SaB-BSA system. Therefore, when DHI is used in mammals, SaB is released from serum albumin more quickly than it is used alone. This work would provide a new experiment basis for revealing the scientific principle of compatibility for Traditional Chinese Medicine.","Hao, Jia; Zhang, Yingyue; Wang, Xingrui; Yan, Huo; Liu, Erwei; Gao, Xiumei",PLoS One,205,1
1982,1982,1982,Origin of Long-Term Storage Stability and Nitric Oxide Release Behavior of CarboSil Polymer Doped with S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine,11.066512,5.4854712,2015-09-22,"[Image: see text] The prolonged and localized delivery of nitric oxide (NO), a potent antithrombotic and antimicrobial agent, has many potential biomedical applications. In this work, the origin of the long-term storage stability and sustained NO release mechanism of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine (SNAP)-doped CarboSil 20 80A polymer, a biomedical thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane, is explored. Long-term (22 days) localized NO release is achieved by utilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber as topcoats, which can greatly reduce the amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching from the SNAP-doped CarboSil films, as measured by LC–MS. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction characterization of SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that a polymer–crystal composite is formed during the solvent evaporation process when SNAP exceeds its solubility in CarboSil (ca. 3.4–4.0 wt %). Further, when exceeding this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic crystal form within the bulk of the polymer. The proposed mechanism of sustained NO release in SNAP-doped CarboSil is that the solubilized SNAP in the polymer matrix decomposes and releases NO, primarily in the water-rich regions near the polymer/solution interface, and the dissolved SNAP in the bulk polymeric phase becomes unsaturated, resulting in the dissolution of crystalline SNAP within the bulk of the polymer. This is a very slow process that ultimately leads to NO release at the physiological flux levels for >3 weeks. The increased stability of SNAP within CarboSil is attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the SNAP molecules that crystallize. This crystallization also plays a key role in maintaining RSNO stability within the CarboSil polymer for >8 months at 37 °C (88.5% remains). Further, intravascular catheters fabricated with this new material are demonstrated to significantly decrease the formation of Staphylococcus aureus biofilm (a leading cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections) (in vitro) over a 7 day period, with 5 log units reduction of viable cell count on catheter surfaces. It is also shown that the NO release catheters can greatly reduce thrombus formation on the catheter surfaces during 7 h implantation in rabbit veins, when compared to the control catheters fabricated without SNAP. These results suggest that the SNAP-doped CarboSil system is a very attractive new composite material for creating long-term NO release medical devices with increased stability and biocompatibility.","Wo, Yaqi; Li, Zi; Brisbois, Elizabeth J.; Colletta, Alessandro; Wu, Jianfeng; Major, Terry C.; Xi, Chuanwu; Bartlett, Robert H.; Matzger, Adam J.; Meyerhoff, Mark E.",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,205,1

In particular, how protein folding is genetically regulated has been a long-standing issue for genetics and protein biology. And a generic mechanistic model with supports of genomic data is still lacking. Recent technological advances have enabled much needed genome-wide experiments. While putting the effect of codon optimality on debate, these studies have supplied mounting evidence suggesting a role of mRNA structure in the regulation of protein folding by modulating translational elongation rate. In conjunctions with previous theories, this mechanistic model of protein folding guided by mRNA structure shall expand our understandings of genetic information and offer new insights into various biomedical puzzles.","Yang, Jian-Rong",Zool Res,205,1

Analyses performed with geNorm revealed that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) and hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) were the two most stable reference genes in response to post-oviposition time alone (POT) or with nicarbazin treatment (POT+N) of laying hens. NormFinder analyses showed that the two most stable reference genes in response to POT and POT+N were 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), ribosomal protein L4 (RPL4) and HMBS, RPL4, respectively. BestKeeper analyses showed that 18S rRNA, RPL4 and HPRT1, HMBS were the two most stable reference genes for POT, and POT+N, respectively. Of the ten reference genes, all except B2M showed geNorm M <0.5, suggesting that they were stably expressed in the shell gland tissue. Consensus from these three programs suggested HPRT1 and HMBS could be used as the two most stable reference genes in the present study. Expression analyses of four candidate target genes with the two most and the two least stable genes showed that a combination of stable reference genes leads to more discriminable quantification of expression levels of target genes, while the least stable genes failed to do so. Therefore, HMBS and HPRT1 are recommended as the two most stable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data at different stages of eggshell formation in brown-egg laying hens. Available statistical programs for reference gene ranking should include more robust analysis capability to analyse the gene expression data generated from factorial design experiments.","Samiullah, Sami; Roberts, Juliet; Wu, Shu-Biao",PLoS One,205,1

While viral RNAs are found to be compact and highly branched because of long distance base-pairing between nucleotides, recent experiments reveal that in a head-to-head competition between an ssRNA with no secondary or higher order structure and a viral RNA, the capsid proteins preferentially encapsulate the linear polymer! In this paper, we study the impact of genome stiffness on the encapsidation free energy of the complex of RNA and capsid proteins. We show that an increase in effective chain stiffness because of base-pairing could be the reason why under certain conditions linear chains have an advantage over branched chains when it comes to encapsidation efficiency. While branching makes the genome more compact, RNA base-pairing increases the effective Kuhn length of the RNA molecule, which could result in an increase of the free energy of RNA confinement, that is, the work required to encapsidate RNA, and thus less efficient packaging.","Li, Siyu; Erdemci-Tandogan, Gonca; van der Schoot, Paul; Zandi, Roya",J Phys Condens Matter,205,28

Specialized fluorescent probes can benefit the study of interactions within viruses, especially during cell studies.

Instead, we exploit their encapsulation of nucleic cargo, using three different fluorescent ATTO dyes linked to single-stranded DNA oligomers, which are hybridised to a longer DNA strand. FRET is induced upon assembly of the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, which forms monodisperse icosahedral particles of about 22 nm, thereby increasing the FRET efficiency by a factor of 8. Additionally, encapsulation of the dyes in virus-like particles induces a two-step FRET. When the formed constructs are disassembled, this FRET signal is fully reduced to the value before encapsulation. This reversible behavior makes the system a good probe for studying viral assembly and disassembly.

By considering the temperature dependence of hydrophobic interaction in the homogeneous lattice model, we were able to give a better estimate of the effective charge. In the heterogeneous lattice model, two sets of lattice sites represented different capsid subunits with asymmetric interaction strengths. In that case, the dissociation of capsids was found to shift from a sharp one-step transition to a gradual two-step transition by weakening the hydrophobic interaction between AB and CC subunits.

Such information, particularly when integrated with geospatial data, can have translational applications for a variety of fields, including public health. Estimated effective migration surfaces (EEMS) is an approach that allows visualization of the spatial patterns in genomic data to understand population structure and migration. In this study, we developed a workflow to optimize the resolution of spatial grids used to generate EEMS migration maps and applied this optimized workflow to estimate migration of Plasmodium falciparum in Cambodia and bordering regions of Thailand and Vietnam. METHODS: The optimal density of EEMS grids was determined based on a new workflow created using density clustering to define genomic clusters and the spatial distance between genomic clusters. Topological skeletons were used to capture the spatial distribution for each genomic cluster and to determine the EEMS grid density; i.e., both genomic and spatial clustering were used to guide the optimization of EEMS grids. Model accuracy for migration estimates using the optimized workflow was tested and compared to grid resolutions selected without the optimized workflow. As a test case, the optimized workflow was applied to genomic data generated from P. falciparum sampled in Cambodia and bordering regions, and migration maps were compared to estimates of malaria endemicity, as well as geographic properties of the study area, as a means of validating observed migration patterns. RESULTS: Optimized grids displayed both high model accuracy and reduced computing time compared to grid densities selected in an unguided manner. In addition, EEMS migration maps generated for P. falciparum using the optimized grid corresponded to estimates of malaria endemicity and geographic properties of the study region that might be expected to impact malaria parasite migration, supporting the validity of the observed migration patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Optimized grids reduce spatial uncertainty in the EEMS contours that can result from user-defined parameters, such as the resolution of the spatial grid used in the model. This workflow will be useful to a broad range of EEMS users as it can be applied to analyses involving other organisms of interest and geographic areas.","Li, Yao; Shetty, Amol C.; Lon, Chanthap; Spring, Michele; Saunders, David L.; Fukuda, Mark M.; Hien, Tran Tinh; Pukrittayakamee, Sasithon; Fairhurst, Rick M.; Dondorp, Arjen M.; Plowe, Christopher V.; O’Connor, Timothy D.; Takala-Harrison, Shannon; Stewart, Kathleen",Int J Health Geogr,205,22

Of over 20 different types of sugar–amino acid linkages known, the two major types are N‐glycans (Asn‐linked) and O‐glycans (Ser/Thr‐linked). An abnormal mucin‐type O‐glycan whose expression is associated with cancer and several human disorders is the Tn antigen. It has a relatively simple structure composed of N‐acetyl‐d‐galactosamine with a glycosidic α linkage to serine/threonine residues in glycoproteins (GalNAcα1‐O‐Ser/Thr), and was one of the first glycoconjugates to be chemically synthesized. The Tn antigen is normally modified by a specific galactosyltransferase (T‐synthase) in the Golgi apparatus of cells. Expression of active T‐synthase is uniquely dependent on the molecular chaperone Cosmc, which is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome. Expression of the Tn antigen can arise as a consequence of mutations in the genes for T‐synthase or Cosmc, or genes affecting other steps of O‐glycosylation pathways. Because of the association of the Tn antigen with disease, there is much interest in the development of Tn‐based vaccines and other therapeutic approaches based on Tn expression.","Ju, Tongzhong; Otto, Vivianne I.; Cummings, Richard D.",Angew Chem Int Ed Engl,205,1

Although live or attenuated virus vaccines have been used to control CSFV, it is difficult to distinguish vaccinated pigs from infected pigs; this leads to restrictions on import and export. Subunit vaccines based on the CSFV E2 glycoprotein have been developed using baculovirus or insect cell systems, but some weaknesses remain. Here, we describe production of an E2 recombinant protein using a Nicotiana benthamiana plant expression system. To do this, we took advantage of the ability of the swine Fc domain to increase solubility and stability of the fusion protein and to strengthen immune responses in target animals. N. benthamiana expressed high amounts of pFc2-fused E2 proteins, which were isolated and purified by affinity chromatography to yield a high pure recombinant protein in a cost-effective manner. Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the pmE2:pFc2 fusion exists as a multimer rather than as a dimer. Injection of recombinant pmE2 protein into mice or piglets generated anti-pmE2 antibodies with efficient neutralizing activity against CSFV. These results suggest that a purified recombinant E2 protein produced in N. benthamiana generates high titers of neutralizing antibodies in vivo; as such, the protein could be developed as a subunit vaccine against CSFV.

However, studies show that thermography suffers from low sensitivity and specificity. To achieve higher screening accuracy, we developed a screening system based on the acquisition of multiple vital-signs. This multimodal approach increases accuracy, but introduces the need for sophisticated classification methods. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the multimodal approach to infection screening from a machine learning perspective. Methods: We conduct an empirical study applying six classification algorithms to measurements from the multimodal screening system and comparing their performance among each other, as well as to the performance of thermography. In addition, we provide an information theoretic view on the use of multiple vital-signs for infection screening. The classification methods are tested using the same clinical data, which has been analyzed in our previous study using linear discriminant analysis. A total of 92 subjects were recruited for influenza screening using the system, consisting of 57 inpatients diagnosed to have seasonal influenza and 35 healthy controls. Results: Our study revealed that the multimodal screening system reduces the misclassification rate by more than 50% compared to thermography. At the same time, none of the multimodal classifiers needed more than 6 ms for classification, which is negligible for practical purposes. Conclusion: Among the tested classifiers k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine and quadratic discriminant analysis achieved the highest cross-validated sensitivity score of 93%. Significance: Multimodal infection screening might be able to address the shortcomings of thermography.",,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,205,1

The oxygen thus formed may be used to degrade hydrocarbons by means of oxygenases under seemingly anoxic conditions. Up to now, no bacterium has been described that grows on aliphatic hydrocarbons with chlorate. Here, we report that Pseudomonas chloritidismutans AW-1(T) grows on n-alkanes (ranging from C7 until C12) with chlorate as electron acceptor. Strain AW-1(T) also grows on the intermediates of the presumed n-alkane degradation pathway. The specific growth rates on n-decane and chlorate and n-decane and oxygen were 0.5 ± 0.1 and 0.4 ± 0.02 day(−1), respectively. The key enzymes chlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase were assayed and found to be present. The oxygen-dependent alkane oxidation was demonstrated in whole-cell suspensions. The strain degrades n-alkanes with oxygen and chlorate but not with nitrate, thus suggesting that the strain employs oxygenase-dependent pathways for the breakdown of n-alkanes.","Mehboob, Farrakh; Junca, Howard; Schraa, Gosse; Stams, Alfons J.

The expression of virulence factors contributes highly to the pathogenicity of C. albicans. These factors include biofilm formation, yeast-to-hyphal transition, adhesins, aspartyl proteases, and phospholipases secretion. Moreover, resistance development is a critical issue for the therapeutic failure of antifungal agents against systemic candidiasis. To circumvent resistance development, the present study investigated the virulence targeted therapeutic activity of the phyto-bioactive compound morin against C. albicans. Morin is a natural compound commonly found in medicinal plants and widely used in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic products/industries. The present study explicated the significant inhibitory potential of morin against biofilm formation and other virulence factors’ production, such as yeast-hyphal formation, phospholipase, and exopolymeric substances, in C. albicans. Further, qPCR analysis confirmed the downregulation of biofilm and virlence-related genes in C. albicans upon morin treatment, which is in correspondence with the in vitro bioassays. Further, the docking analysis revealed that morin shows strong affinity with Hwp-1 protein, which regulates the expression of biofilm and hyphal formation in C. albicans and, thereby, abolishes fungal pathogenicity. Moreover, the anti-infective potential of morin against C. albicans-associated systemic candidiasis is confirmed through an in vivo approach using biomedical model organism zebrafish (Danio rerio). The outcomes of the in vivo study demonstrate that the morin treatment effectively rescues animals from C. albicans infections and extends their survival rate by inhibiting the internal colonization of C. albicans. Histopathology analysis revealed extensive candidiasis-related pathognomonic changes in the gills, intestine, and kidney of animals infected with C. albicans, while no extensive abnormalities were observed in morin-treated animals. The results evidenced that morin has the ability to protect against the pathognomonic effect and histopathological lesions caused by C. albicans infection in zebrafish. Thus, the present study suggests that the utilization of morin could act as a potent therapeutic medication for C. albicans instigated candidiasis.","Abirami, Gurusamy; Alexpandi, Rajaiah; Durgadevi, Ravindran; Kannappan, Arunachalam; Veera Ravi, Arumugam",Front Microbiol,205,1

We used latent class analysis (LCA) to identify risk profiles in localized, malignant PCa surgical treatment delays while assessing co-occurring social determinants of health. Profiles were identified by age, marital status, race, county of residence (non-Appalachian or Appalachian), and health insurance type (none/self-pay, public, or private) reported in the Tennessee Department of Health cancer registry from 2005 to 2015 for adults ≥18 years (N = 18,088). We identified three risk profiles. The highest surgical delay profile (11% of the sample) with a 30% likelihood of delaying surgery >90 days were young Black men, <55 years old, living in a non-Appalachian county, and single/never married, with a high probability of having private health insurance. The medium surgical delay profile (46% of the sample) with a 21% likelihood of delay were 55–69 years old, White, married, and having private health insurance. The lowest surgical delay profile (42% of the sample) with a 14% likelihood of delay were ≥70 years with public health insurance as well as had a high probability of being White and married. We identified that even with health insurance coverage, Blacks living in non-Appalachian counties had the highest surgical delay, which was almost double that of Whites in the lowest delay profile. These disparities in PCa surgical delay may explain differences in health outcomes in Blacks who are most at-risk.","Montiel Ishino, Francisco A.; Rowan, Claire; Das, Rina; Thapa, Janani; Cobran, Ewan; Whiteside, Martin; Williams, Faustine",Am J Mens Health,205,1

Emergency medical service (EMS) providers serve a critical role in responding to opioid overdose for individuals living in rural or remote areas who experience opioid overdoses. They are often first at the scene of an overdose and are sometimes the only health care provider in contact with an overdose patient who either did not survive or refused additional care. As such, EMS providers have valuable perspectives to share on the causes and consequences of the opioid crisis in rural communities. METHODS: EMS providers attending a statewide EMS conference serving those from greater Minnesota and surrounding states were invited to take a 2-question survey asking them to reflect upon what they believed to be the causes of the opioid crisis and what they saw as the solutions to the opioid crisis. Results were coded and categorized using a Consensual Qualitative Research approach. RESULTS: EMS providers’ perceptions on causes of the opioid crisis were categorized into 5 main domains: overprescribing, ease of access, socioeconomic vulnerability, mental health concerns, and lack of resources and education. Responses focused on solutions to address the opioid crisis were categorized into 5 main domains: need for increased education, enhanced opioid oversight, increased access to treatment programs, alternative therapies for pain management, and addressing socioeconomic vulnerabilities. CONCLUSION: Along with the recognition that the opioid crisis was at least partially caused by overprescribing, rural EMS providers who participated in this study recognized the critical role of social determinants of health in perpetuating opioid-related harm. Participants in this study reported that education and increased access to treatment facilities and appropriate pain management, along with recognition of the role of social determinants of health in opioid dependency, were necessary steps to address the opioid crisis.","Blue, Heather; Dahly, Ashley; Chhen, Susan; Lee, Julie; Shadiow, Adam; Van Deelen, Anna G.; Palombi, Laura C.",J Prim Care Community Health,205,1

Those who have AF tend to have a much higher stroke risk than others. Although most individuals with AF benefit from anticoagulation (AC) therapy, a significant majority are hesitant to start it. To add, providers often struggle in helping patients negotiate the decision to start AC therapy. To assist in the communication between patients and providers regarding preferences and knowledge about AC therapy, different strategies are being used to try and solve this problem. In this research study, we will have patients and providers utilize the AFib 2gether app with hopes that it will create a platform for shared decision making regarding the prevention of stroke in patients with AF receiving AC therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study is to measure several outcomes related to encounters between patients and their cardiology providers where AFib 2gether is used. These outcomes include usability and perceived usefulness of the app from the perspective of patients and providers. In addition, we will assess the extent and nature of shared decision making. METHODS: Eligible patients and providers will evaluate the AFib 2gether mobile app for usability and perceived usefulness in facilitating shared decision making regarding understanding the patient’s risk of stroke and whether or not to start AC therapy. Both patients and providers will review the app and complete multiple questionnaires about the usability and perceived usefulness of the mobile app in a clinical setting. We will also audio-record a subset of encounters to assess for evidence of shared decision making. RESULTS: Enrollment in the AFib 2gether shared decision-making study is still ongoing for both patients and providers. The first participant enrolled on November 22, 2019. Analysis and publishing of results are expected to be completed in spring 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The AFib 2gether app emerged from a desire to increase the ability of patients and providers to engage in shared decision making around understanding the risk of stroke and AC therapy. We anticipate that the AFib 2gether mobile app will facilitate patient discussion with their cardiologist and other providers. Additionally, we hope the study will help us identify barriers that providers face when placing patients on AC therapy. We aim to demonstrate the usability and perceived usefulness of the app with a future goal of testing the value of our approach in a larger sample of patients and providers at multiple medical centers across the country.

During the past two decades, there have been several initiatives to integrate health surveillance systems using various mechanisms ranging from the integration of data sources to changing organizational structures and responses. The need for integration is caused by an increasing demand for joint data collection, use and preparedness for emerging infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: To review the integration mechanisms in human and animal health surveillance systems and identify their contributions in strengthening surveillance systems attributes. METHOD: The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Peer-reviewed articles were searched from PubMed, HINARI, Web of Science, Science Direct and advanced Google search engines. The review included articles published in English from 1900 to 2018. The study selection considered all articles that used quantitative, qualitative or mixed research methods. Eligible articles were assessed independently for quality by two authors using the QualSyst Tool and relevant information including year of publication, field, continent, addressed attributes and integration mechanism were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 102 publications were identified and categorized into four pre-set integration mechanisms: interoperability (35), convergent integration (27), semantic consistency (21) and interconnectivity (19). Most integration mechanisms focused on sensitivity (44.1%), timeliness (41.2%), data quality (23.5%) and acceptability (17.6%) of the surveillance systems. Generally, the majority of the surveillance system integrations were centered on addressing infectious diseases and all hazards. The sensitivity of the integrated systems reported in these studies ranged from 63.9 to 100% (median = 79.6%, n = 16) and the rate of data quality improvement ranged from 73 to 95.4% (median = 87%, n = 4). The integrated systems were also shown improve timeliness where the recorded changes were reported to be ranging from 10 to 91% (median = 67.3%, n = 8). CONCLUSION: Interoperability and semantic consistency are the common integration mechanisms in human and animal health surveillance systems. Surveillance system integration is a relatively new concept but has already been shown to enhance surveillance performance. More studies are needed to gain information on further surveillance attributes.","George, Janeth; Häsler, Barbara; Mremi, Irene; Sindato, Calvin; Mboera, Leonard; Rweyemamu, Mark; Mlangwa, James",One Health Outlook,205,11

Investigating disease-causing and high and low expressed genes can support finding the root causes of uncertainties in patient care. However, independent and timely high-throughput next-generation sequencing data analysis is still a challenge for non-computational biologists and geneticists. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we present a findable, accessible, interactive, and reusable (FAIR) bioinformatics platform, i.e., GVViZ (visualizing genes with disease-causing variants). GVViZ is a user-friendly, cross-platform, and database application for RNA-seq-driven variable and complex gene-disease data annotation and expression analysis with a dynamic heat map visualization. GVViZ has the potential to find patterns across millions of features and extract actionable information, which can support the early detection of complex disorders and the development of new therapies for personalized patient care. The execution of GVViZ is based on a set of simple instructions that users without a computational background can follow to design and perform customized data analysis. It can assimilate patients’ transcriptomics data with the public, proprietary, and our in-house developed gene-disease databases to query, easily explore, and access information on gene annotation and classified disease phenotypes with greater visibility and customization. To test its performance and understand the clinical and scientific impact of GVViZ, we present GVViZ analysis for different chronic diseases and conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, arthritis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, and multiple cancer disorders. The results are visualized using GVViZ and can be exported as image (PNF/TIFF) and text (CSV) files that include gene names, Ensembl (ENSG) IDs, quantified abundances, expressed transcript lengths, and annotated oncology and non-oncology diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize that automated and interactive visualization should be an indispensable component of modern RNA-seq analysis, which is currently not the case. However, experts in clinics and researchers in life sciences can use GVViZ to visualize and interpret the transcriptomics data, making it a powerful tool to study the dynamics of gene expression and regulation. Furthermore, with successful deployment in clinical settings, GVViZ has the potential to enable high-throughput correlations between patient diagnoses based on clinical and transcriptomics data.

These recommendations developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, aim to provide guidance on immunizations in adult and pediatric patients with IBD. This publication focused on inactivated vaccines. METHODS: Systematic reviews evaluating the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of vaccines in patients with IBD, other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, and the general population were performed. Critical outcomes included mortality, vaccine-preventable diseases, and serious adverse events. Immunogenicity was considered a surrogate outcome for vaccine efficacy. Certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Key questions were developed through an iterative online platform, and voted on by a multidisciplinary group. Recommendations were formulated using the Evidence-to-Decision framework. Strong recommendation means that most patients should receive the recommended course of action, whereas a conditional recommendation means that different choices will be appropriate for different patients. RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 15 of 20 questions. Recommendations address the following vaccines: Haemophilus influenzae type b, recombinant zoster, hepatitis B, influenza, pneumococcus, meningococcus, tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis, and human papillomavirus. Most of the recommendations for patients with IBD are congruent with the current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommendations for the general population, with the following exceptions. In patients with IBD, the panel suggested Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine for patients older than 5 years of age, recombinant zoster vaccine for adults younger than 50 year of age, and hepatitis B vaccine for adults without a risk factor. Consensus was not reached, and recommendations were not made for 5 statements, due largely to lack of evidence, including double-dose hepatitis B vaccine, timing of influenza immunization in patients on biologics, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines in adult patients without risk factors, and human papillomavirus vaccine in patients aged 27–45 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBD may be at increased risk of some vaccine-preventable diseases. Therefore, maintaining appropriate vaccination status in these patients is critical to optimize patient outcomes. In general, IBD is not a contraindication to the use of inactivated vaccines, but immunosuppressive therapy may reduce vaccine responses.","Jones, Jennifer L; Tse, Frances; Carroll, Matthew W; deBruyn, Jennifer C; McNeil, Shelly A; Pham-Huy, Anne; Seow, Cynthia H; Barrett, Lisa L; Bessissow, Talat; Carman, Nicholas; Melmed, Gil Y; Vanderkooi, Otto G; Marshall, John K; Benchimol, Eric I",J Can Assoc Gastroenterol,205,1

A mutation in the Rhizobium leguminosarum gmcA gene was generated by homologous recombination. The mutation in gmcA did not affect the growth of R. leguminosarum, but it displayed decreased antioxidative capacity at H(2)O(2) conditions higher than 5 mM. The gmcA mutant strain displayed no difference of glutathione reductase activity, but significantly lower level of the glutathione peroxidase activity than the wild type. Although the gmcA mutant was able to induce the formation of nodules, the symbiotic ability was severely impaired, which led to an abnormal nodulation phenotype coupled to a 30% reduction in the nitrogen fixation capacity. The observation on ultrastructure of 4-week pea nodules showed that the mutant bacteroids tended to start senescence earlier and accumulate poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules. In addition, the gmcA mutant was severely impaired in rhizosphere colonization. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the gmcA gene expression was significantly up-regulated in all the detected stages of nodule development, and statistically significant decreases in the expression of the redoxin genes katG, katE, and ohrB were found in gmcA mutant bacteroids. LC-MS/MS analysis quantitative proteomics techniques were employed to compare differential gmcA mutant root bacteroids in response to the wild type infection. Sixty differentially expressed proteins were identified including 33 up-regulated and 27 down-regulated proteins. By sorting the identified proteins according to metabolic function, 15 proteins were transporter protein, 12 proteins were related to stress response and virulence, and 9 proteins were related to transcription factor activity. Moreover, nine proteins related to amino acid metabolism were over-expressed.","Zou, Qian; Luo, Sha; Wu, Hetao; He, Donglan; Li, Xiaohua; Cheng, Guojun",Front Microbiol,205,1

This study assessed the impact of a risk stratification guideline for empiric antimicrobial selection relative to acceptance rates and clinical outcomes. METHODS: In 2017, a guideline for inpatients with HCAP was launched. High risk (HR) of MDR GN was defined as patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), or with >1 risk factor including: receipt of any antimicrobial within 30 days or broad spectrum antimicrobials within 90 days, hemodialysis dependence, or immunocompromised. HR patients were recommended to receive antimicrobials covering MDR GN and low-risk patients to narrower CAP regimens. Patients treated for HCAP post guideline implementation were compared with a historic 2014 cohort for guideline concordance, antimicrobial selection, and clinical outcomes. AST interventions were also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 105 patients in the post-implementation period were compared with 309 historic patients. Guideline-concordant risk-stratified therapy increased 13% [95% CI (3%, 24%)] overall. Clinical failure rates were similar with 11% vs 10% (P = 0.608) in the pre- and post-implementation periods, with an 84% AST acceptance rate (Figure 1). Treatment length decreased [8.1 to 6.6 days (P < 0.001)] and de-escalation increased [31% to 72% (P < 0.001)] as seen in Table 1. CONCLUSION: Introduction of a risk stratified guideline through AST intervention changed practice by matching MDR risk with empiric HCAP therapy. Failure rates were comparable. Secondary benefits included: decreased treatment duration and hospital stay, increased de-escalation rates and decreased MDR GN antimicrobial use in low-risk patients.

Pneu­monias cause death in this population both directly through impairment of gas exchange and progression to system infection/sepsis, as well as indirectly by precluding delivery of necessary, antineoplastic therapies. Malignancy and treatment-related impairments of host immune responses and the emergence of ­multidrug-resistant organisms associated with recurrent exposures to hospital environments may not only enhance the risks of mortality, but also exacerbate the difficulty of diagnosing pneumonia in the cancer setting. As a consequence of disordered inflammatory responses, the typical clinical observations of pneumonia, including purulent respiratory secretions and early radiographic findings, may be inapparent or absent.

Control measures must be taken based on the principles of biosecurity and disease management and at the same time making public aware of the precautionary measures at the verge of outbreak. Creation of protection and surveillance zones, various vaccination strategies viz. routine, preventive, emergency, mass and targeted vaccination programmes using live, inactivated and recombinant vaccines are the common strategies adopted in different parts of the globe. The new generation vaccines include recombinant vaccines and recombinant fusion vaccine. The pro-poor disease control programmes, giving compensation and subsidies to the farmers along with effective and efficient Veterinary Services forms integral part of control of HPAI. Following biosecurity principles and vaccination forms integral part of control programme against swine and equine influenza as well. Use of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (Zanamivir and Oseltamivir) for the treatment of human influenza has been widely accepted worldwide. The threat of increasing resistance of the flu viruses to these antivirals has evoked interest in the development of novel antiviral drugs for influenza virus such as inhibitors of cellular factors and host signalling cascades, cellular miRNAs, siRNA and innate immune peptides (defensins and cathelicidins). Commercial licensed inactivated vaccines for humans against influenza A and B viruses are available consisting of three influenza viruses: influenza type A subtype H3N2, influenza type A subtype H1N1 (seasonal) virus strain and influenza type B virus strain. As per WHO, use of tetravaccine consisting of antigens of influenza virus serotypes H3N2, H1N1, B and H5 is the most promising method to control influenza pandemic. All healthy children in many countries are required to be vaccinated between 6 and 59 months of age. The seasonal vaccines currently used in humans induce strain-specific humoral immunity as the antibodies. Universal influenza virus vaccines containing the relatively conserved ectodomain of M2 (M2e), M1, HA fusion peptide and stalk domains, NA, NP alone or in combination have been developed which have been shown to induce cross-protection. The T cell-based vaccines are another recent experimental approach that has been shown to elicit broad-spectrum heterosubtypic immunity in the host. As far as HPAI is concerned, various pandemic preparedness strategies have been documented.","Kapoor, Sanjay; Dhama, Kuldeep",Insight into Influenza Viruses of Animals and Humans,205,7

This study was aimed to develop an improved method for rapid recovery of CSFV directly from cloned cDNA. Full-length genomic cDNA from the CSFV Shimen strain, which was flanked by a T7 promoter, the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences, was cloned into the low-copy vector pOK12, producing pOKShimen-RzTΦ. Direct transfection of pOKShimen-RzTΦ into PK/T7 cells, a PK-15-derived cell line stably expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase, allowed CSFV to be rescued rapidly and efficiently, i.e., at least 12 h faster and 31.6-fold greater viral titer when compared with the in vitro transcription-based rescue system. Furthermore, the progeny virus rescued from PK/T7 cells was indistinguishable, both in vitro and in vivo, from its parent virus and the virus rescued from classical reverse genetics. The reverse genetics based on intracellular transcription is efficient, convenient and cost-effective. The PK/T7 cell line can be used to rescue CSFV directly from cloned cDNA and it can also be used as an intracellular transcription and expression system for studying the structure and function of viral genes.","HUANG, Jun-hua; LI, Yong-feng; HE, Fan; LI, Dan; SUN, Yuan; HAN, Wen; QIU, Hua-ji",J Integr Agric,205,1

We introduce several quantization techniques for building motion-word vocabularies and propose application-independent criteria for assessing the vocabulary quality.

Current policy focuses on improving domestic outbreak surveillance capacity globally in order to reduce reporting lags. However, governments also face economic and political incentives to conceal outbreaks, and these incentives largely are ignored in policy discussions. In spite of the policy implications for outbreak response, the “capacity” and “will” explanations have not been systematically examined. Analysis of a dataset coding the timeliness of outbreak reporting from 1996–2014 finds evidence that states’ unwillingness to report—rather than just their inability—leads to delayed reporting. The findings suggest that though building surveillance capacity is critical, doing so may not be sufficient to reduce reporting lags. Policy aimed at encouraging rapid reporting must also mitigate the associated economic and political costs.","Worsnop, Catherine Z",,205,19

The Chinese Government took early action and initiated multiple rounds of aid, which so far comprises the largest and longest humanitarian and health aid initiative in China’s history. By the first half of 2015, the Chinese Government had delivered four rounds of humanitarian aid against Ebola totaling 750 million RMB of funding. The fifth round of aid, which focuses on post-Ebola reconstruction and long-term public health system strengthening, is ongoing. China’s fight against Ebola in Africa manifested the principles of “sincerity, real results, affinity and good faith” that guide China’s policy on Africa and China’s view on global responsibility and security as a major power. China drew on its experience during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 and adopted a comprehensive aid scheme with “hard” and “soft” aid aiming at both long- and short-term goals, with relevant departments working closely together and adopting flexible measures. China also strengthened its coordination and cooperation with international partners, and attached importance to public communication and information disclosure. The following results were achieved: (1) China made a tremendous contribution to controlling the epidemic and local capacity-building while realizing the goal of zero infection of Chinese personnel; (2) by exerting the expertise and organizational advantage of military health institutions, China achieved greater effectiveness and efficiency and strengthened bilateral trust; and (3) China improved its biosecurity capacity and established an important platform for tropical infectious disease research and real-time monitoring of global infectious disease epidemics.","Wang, Chen",South-south Cooperation and Chinese Foreign Aid,205,1

The SBS is a complex spectrum of ill health symptoms, such as mucous membrane irritation, asthma, neurotoxic effects, gastrointestinal disturbance, skin dryness, sensitivity to odours that may appear among occupants in office and public buildings, schools and hospitals. Studies on large office buildings from USA, UK, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Germany, Canada, China, India, Netherlands, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand, substantiate the occurrence of SBS phenomena. The accumulated effects of a multitude of factors, such as the indoor environmental quality, building characteristics, building dampness, and activities of occupants attribute to SBS. A building occupant manifests at least one symptom of SBS, the onset of two or more symptoms at least twice, and rapid resolution of symptoms following moving away from the workstation or building may be defined as having SBS. Based on the peer-reviewed documentation, this chapter elaborates the magnitude of building-related health consequences due to measurable environmental causations, and the size of the population affected. The mechanisms and causative factors of SBS and illnesses include, for example, the oxidative stress resulting from indoor pollutants, VOCs, office work-related stressors, humidification, odours associated with moisture and bioaerosol exposure. Related regulatory standards and strategies for management of SBS and other illnesses are elaborated.","Nag, Pranab Kumar",Office Buildings,205,1

Basically, a system consists of a number of parts that are connected to each other. Systems differ depending on the nature of their connectedness. Simple systems have one-to-one relationships and their behaviour is precisely predictable. Complicated systems have one-to-many relationships with mostly predictable behaviours. This book deals with complex adaptive systems with many-to-many relationships. Their many-to-many relationships make their behaviour emergent, hence their outcomes are unpredictable. Complex adaptive systems have a special characteristic, the members of the system can learn from feedback and experiences. The relationships in complex adaptive systems change constantly allowing the system to evolve over time in light of changing demands. However, a system’s overall behaviour, despite its adaptation to changing circumstances, remains relatively stable within boundaries, but occasionally, its behaviour may change abruptly and dramatically for no apparent reason. Another important characteristic of complex adaptive systems is its nonlinear behaviour to change, i.e. the magnitude of change in one member of the system shows a disproportional change in that of others. As experience shows, small changes in the behaviour of a system member often show dramatic changes in the behaviour of the whole system, whereas a major change in the behaviour of that member typically results in little or no change. Studying complex adaptive systems aims to understand the relationships and the dynamics between the members of the systems. This understanding allows for better responses when the system as a whole is challenged by constraints and/or unfamiliar challenges. A special characteristic of social systems is their “goal-delivering” nature. In organisational terms these are codified by their purpose, goals, and values statements.","Sturmberg, Joachim P.",Health System Redesign,205,1

This change has provoked debate about whether China and the US have already become rivals, perhaps adversaries, in a new cold war. I examine five underlying influences shaping the newly intensifying rivalry. These influences reflect key features of the international context within which the US and China find themselves (systemic or structural constraints) and the fact that the two rivals happen to be the US and China (national or unit-level attributes). Chief among the international constraints are the structural conditions of anarchy and the distribution of power that defines the system’s polarity. The national attributes most relevant to understanding the evolution of US–China relations are the geography of the theater where the two countries’ vital interests intersect and two aspects of their militarily relevant technological capabilities. Examining these five influences draws attention to reasons for some important similarities but also differences between the current rivalry and the Soviet–American rivalry of the Cold War. It makes clear that a Cold War II, if that is what is emerging, will not simply replicate the rivalry of Cold War I. Unfortunately, this examination also directs attention to some troubling new concerns about the distinctiveness of the new rivalry and the challenges they may present in the coming decades.","Goldstein, Avery",China Int Strategy Rev.,205,1

The association of compliance with perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as ≥ 85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031). In the after-group, patients with high protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index had less complications compared to patients with low protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index (n = 187 vs. 90; p = 0.01). Protocol compliance by the attending clinicians is essential and should be monitored to facilitate an improvement in postoperative outcomes desired by the implementation of perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols.

Serving in a dual caregiving role presents unique challenges and has consequences for caregivers’ physical and mental health. Seven daily diary interviews with 46 dual dementia caregivers assessed their daily stressors and informal and formal supports. Results showed that dementia caregivers who also cared for another older relative reported poorer physical health and used more community-based services to care for the PwD. Conversely, dementia caregivers who also cared for younger relatives reported greater secondary stressors, lower family support, and use of fewer community-based services to care for the PwD. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, two telephone interviews were conducted with 15 dual dementia caregivers. Caregivers were asked in-depth questions about how the pandemic had impacted their caregiving responsibilities, mental health, and use of community-based services. Guided by stress process and behavior models, a thematic analysis of dual caregivers’ interviews revealed that caregivers had less time for themselves, engaged in self-care activities less often, and felt their social life had suffered. Many of the caregivers reported feeling exhausted, stressed, and had more things to do than they could handle. Of the eight caregivers that used services before COVID-19, six experienced a change in services including loss of services, different workers, or self-selected cancellation of services. Discussion focuses on challenges dual dementia caregivers face and the added stressors they experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hoyt, Emily; Savla, Jyoti; Roberto, Karen; Knight, Aubrey L; Blieszner, Rosemary; McCann, Brandy R",Innov Aging,205,1

These high-demand positions often coupled with few organizational or supervisory supports contribute to decreased worker well-being and low retention. Informed by the Job Demands-Resources model, we examined common demand-resource sub-groups among recently-hired child welfare workers and how sub-group membership contributed to agency retention. This study used data from the Florida Study of Professionals for Safe Families (FSPSF), a four-year, longitudinal cohort study of child welfare workers hired in 2015–16 (n = 912). We used a three-step Latent Profile Analysis (LPA) with logistic regression to identify profiles of workers based on demand and support levels at 6 months to predict agency retention 12 months later. Findings resulted in five profiles: floundering, surviving through supervisor, surviving through role, surviving through supports, and thriving. Profile distributions indicated both demands and supports were independently important for retention. Each profile had higher odds of staying at the agency compared to the floundering profile, those floundering in role and support (ORs = 2.08–7.68). Those in the thriving profile, thriving in role and support, had higher odds of staying when compared to each other profile (ORs = 2.12–7.68). Findings identify that demands and supports operate in an additive way to promote retention and suggest that agencies can address individual aspects of workers’ role and support challenges to improve retention without requiring a single approach to combat workload and environment simultaneously.","Radey, Melissa; Wilke, Dina J.",Child Adolesc Social Work J,205,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 86 consecutive patients who underwent SILA between August 2010 and August 2016 at Kinki Central Hospital. During this period, 9 residents and 6 board-certified attending surgeons performed SILA. Data on the patients' characteristics and perioperative complications were collected from their medical records. RESULTS Resident doctors operated on 55% (47/86) of patients undergoing SILA. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to patient characteristics. Mean operative time in the resident and staff surgeon groups was 74 min and 71 min, respectively (p = 0.5). Median blood loss in both the resident and staff surgeon groups was 0 mL (p = 0.3). The rate of conversion to a different operative procedure was 4% (2/47) in the resident group and 3% (1/39) in the staff surgeon group (p = 1). All three above-mentioned procedures, two (4%, 2/47) in the resident group and one (3%, 1/39) in the staff surgeon group, were converted to multi-port laparoscopic appendectomy. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 5 days for both the resident and staff surgeon groups (p = 0.7). Perioperative complications developed in 9% (4/47) of the patients in the resident group and 21% (8/39) of the patients in the staff surgeon group (p = 0.1).

However, the majority of studies were conducted at large scales (e.g., across farms), while few studies examined drivers of L. monocytogenes prevalence at smaller scales (e.g., within a single field). This study was performed to address this knowledge gap by (i) tracking L. monocytogenes distribution in two fields on one farm over a growing season, and (ii) identifying factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from drag swab, soil, and agricultural water samples. Overall, L. monocytogenes was detected in 78% (21/27), 19% (7/36), and 8% (37/486) of water, drag swab, and soil samples, respectively. All isolates were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of the 43 PFGE types identified, 14 were isolated on multiple sampling visits and/or from multiple sample types, indicating persistence in or repeated introduction into the farm environment during the study. Our findings also suggest that L. monocytogenes prevalence, even at the small spatial scale studied here, (i) was not uniform, and (ii) varied more within fields than between fields or over time. This is illustrated by the fact that plot (in-field variation), field (between field variation), and sampling visit (time) accounted for 18%, 2% and 3% of variance in odds of isolating L. monocytogenes, respectively. Moreover, according to random forest analysis, water-related factors were among the top-ranked factors associated with L. monocytogenes isolation from all sample types. For example, the likelihood of isolating L. monocytogenes from drag and soil samples increased monotonically as rainfall increased. Overall, findings from this single-farm study suggests that mitigation strategies for L. monocytogenes in produce fields should focus on water-associated risk factors (e.g., rain, distance to water), and be tailored to specific high-risk in-field areas.","Harrand, A Sophia; Strawn, Laura; Illas-Ortiz, Paloa Mercedes; Wiedmann, Martin; Weller, Daniel",Journal of food protection,205,1

METHODS Longitudinal cohort study. We included 245 adult patients monitored with an ICM indicated for the investigation of syncope. The records from days 1 to 12 March 2020 (prior to the institution of lockdown by the state government) with days 16 to 28 March 2020 were compared. RESULTS Daily physical exercise reduced markedly after the imposition of lockdown (132 [55-233] minutes vs. 78 [21-154] minutes). The mean daytime HR prior to lockdown was 77 [69-85] bpm, whereas during lockdown it was 74 [66-81] bpm. During the lockdown period, a drop in the variability in heart rate (114 [94-136] ms vs. 111 [92-133] ms) was observed. Although the incidence of AF was similar over both periods, the daily AF burden was significantly higher post-lockdown (405 [391-425] minutes vs. 423 [423-537] minutes). No differences in the number of other arrhythmias were found. CONCLUSIONS The establishment of mandatory lockdown has led to a marked drop in daily physical activity in this population which probably explains changes observed in other cardiac biometric variables. Although, in the short term, we have not documented an increased risk of arrhythmia, we cannot rule out an effect in the medium to long term or in other populations of at-risk patients.","Francisco-Pascual, Jaume; Rivas-Gándara, Núria; Santos-Ortega, Alba; Pérez-Rodón, Jordi; Benito, Begoña; Belahnech, Yassin; Ferreira-González, Ignacio",Medicina clinica,205,0

The present report describes the case of a patient with CD who developed pulmonary TB while receiving adalimumab therapy. CASE REPORT A 38-year-old penitentiary worker presented with colonic CD that was intolerant to azathioprine and was started on adalimumab. After 3 months, he experienced coughing, fever, and weight loss, and was diagnosed with pulmonary TB. A chest X-ray and tuberculin skin test performed before he started taking adalimumab were negative for latent TB. The patient was treated for 9 months to cure his infection. The use of adalimumab was suspended while the TB was investigated and he took mesalazine to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission of CD. CONCLUSIONS Adequate screening and chemoprophylaxis for latent TB are indicated in patients at high risk of infection. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, after anti-TNF therapy is started, strict monitoring is required so that opportunistic infections can be detected early and morbidity and mortality reduced in this population.","Cardoso da Silva, Douglas Inomata; Santos, Bruna Helena de Oliveira; Renosto, Fernanda Lofiego; Watanabe, Erika Mayumi; Herrerias, Giédre Soares Prates; Saad-Hossne, Rogerio; Baima, Julio Pinheiro; Sassaki, Ligia Yukie",The American journal of case reports,205,1

METHODS Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent either SPLS (n=21) with SW Kim's technique using a specially designed 30×30-cm2-sized 3XL LapBag or laparotomy (n=22) for a huge ovarian tumor from December 2008 to May 2016. Perioperative surgical outcomes were compared. RESULTS In 19/21 (90.5%) patients, SPLS was successfully performed without any tumor spillage or conversion to multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. There was no significant difference in patient characteristics, including tumor diameter and total operation time, between both groups. The postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for the SPLS group than for the laparotomy group (median, 2 [1 to 5] vs. 4 [3 to 17] days; P<0.001). The number of postoperative general diet build-up days was also significantly shorter for the SPLS group (median, 1 [1 to 4] vs. 3 [2 to 16] days; P<0.001). Immediate post-operative pain score was lower in the SPLS group (median, 2.0 [0 to 8] vs. 4.0 [0 to 8]; P=0.045). Patient-controlled anesthesia was used less in the SPLS group (61.9% vs. 100%). CONCLUSION SPLS was successful in removing most large ovarian tumors without rupture and showed quicker recovery and less immediate post-operative pain in comparison to laparotomy. SPLS using SW Kim's technique could be a feasible solution to removing huge ovarian tumors.","Kim, Jeong Sook; Lee, In Ok; Eoh, Kyung Jin; Chung, Young Shin; Lee, Inha; Lee, Jung-Yun; Nam, Eun Ji; Kim, Sunghoon; Kim, Young Tae; Kim, Sang Wun",Obstetrics & gynecology science,205,11

METHODS Two serum panels from patients hospitalized in Paris, France, and from patients living in Bangui, Central African Republic, acquired prior to the 2019 COVID-19 outbreak, were tested by 3 CE IVD-labeled RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 serology [BIOSYNEX® COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM); SIENNA™ COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette; NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19]. RESULTS Detectable IgG or IgM reactivities could be observed in 31 (3.43%) of the 902 IgG and IgM bands of the 3 RDTs used with all pre-epidemic sera. The frequencies of IgG/IgM reactivities were similar for European (3.20%) and African (3.55%) sera. IgM reactivities were observed in 9 European and 14 African sera, while IgG reactivity was observed in only 1 African serum (15.1% versus 0.66%). The test NG-Test® IgG-IgM COVID-19 showed the highest rates of IgG or IgM reactivities [6.12% (18/294)], while the test BIOSYNEX® COVID-19 BSS (IgG/IgM) showed the lowest rate [1.36% (4/294)]. Some combinations of 2 RDTs in series allowed decreasing significantly the risk of false positive test results. CONCLUSION Our observations point the risk of false positive reactivities when using currently available RDT for SARS-CoV-2 serological screening, especially for the IgM band, even if the test is CE IVD-labeled and approved by national health authorities, and provide the rational basis for confirmatory testing by another RDT in case of positive initial screening.

Despite its reversibility, it is associated with serious adverse in-hospital events and high complication rates during follow-up. Multimodality imaging is helpful for establishing the diagnosis, guiding therapy, and stratifying prognosis of TTS patients in both the acute and post-acute phase. Echocardiography plays a key role, particularly in the acute care setting, allowing for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and the identification of the typical apical-midventricular ballooning pattern, as well as the circumferential pattern of wall motion abnormalities. It is also useful in the early detection of complications (i.e. LV outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, right ventricular involvement, LV thrombi, and pericardial effusion) and monitoring of systolic function recovery. Left ventriculography allows the evaluation of LV function and morphology, identifying the typical TTS patterns when echocardiography is not available or wall motion abnormalities cannot be properly assessed with ultrasound. Cardiac magnetic resonance provides a more comprehensive depiction of cardiac morphology and function and tissue characterization and offers additional value to other imaging modalities for differential diagnosis (myocardial infarction and myocarditis). Coronary computed tomography angiography has a substantial role in the diagnostic workup of patients with acute chest pain and a doubtful TTS diagnosis to rule out other medical conditions. It can be considered as a non-invasive appropriate alternative to coronary angiography in several clinical scenarios. Although the role of nuclear imaging in TTS has not yet been well established, the combination of perfusion and metabolic imaging may provide useful information on myocardial function in both the acute and post-acute phase.","Citro, Rodolfo; Okura, Hiroyuki; Ghadri, Jelena R; Izumi, Chisato; Meimoun, Patrick; Izumo, Masaki; Dawson, Dana; Kaji, Shuichiro; Eitel, Ingo; Kagiyama, Nobuyuki; Kobayashi, Yukari; Templin, Christian; Delgado, Victoria; Nakatani, Satoshi; Popescu, Bogdan A",European heart journal cardiovascular Imaging,205,1

PS receptors typically bind to apoptotic cell membrane PS and orchestrate the uptake and clearance of apoptotic debris. Many enveloped viruses also contain exposed PS and can therefore exploit these receptors for cell entry. Viral infection can induce PS externalization in host cells, resulting in increased outer PS levels on budding virions. Scramblase enzymes carry out cellular PS externalization, thus, we targeted these proteins in order to manipulate viral envelope PS levels. We investigated two scramblases previously identified to be involved in EBOV PS levels, transmembrane protein 16F and Xk-related protein 8 (XKR8), as possible mediators of cellular and viral envelope surface PS levels during the replication of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus containing its native glycoprotein (rVSV/G) or the EBOV glycoprotein (rVSV/EBOV-GP). We found that rVSV/G and rVSV/EBOV-GP virions produced in XKR8 knockout cells contain decreased levels of PS on their surfaces, and the PS-deficient rVSV/EBOV-GP virions are 70% less efficient at infecting cells through PS receptors. We also observed reduced rVSV and EBOV virus-like particle (VLP) budding in ΔXKR8 cells. Deleting XKR8 in HAP1 cells reduced rVSV/G and rVSV/EBOV-GP budding by 60% and 65% respectively, and reduced Ebola VLP budding more than 60%. We further demonstrated that caspase cleavage of XKR8 is required to promote budding. This suggests that XKR8, in addition to mediating virion PS levels, may also be critical for enveloped virus budding at the plasma membrane. Importance Within the last decade, countries in western and central Africa have experienced the most widespread and deadly Ebola outbreaks since the virus was identified in 1976. While outbreaks are primarily attributed to zoonotic transfer events, new evidence is emerging that outbreaks may be caused by a combination of spillover events and viral latency or persistence in survivors. The possibility that Ebola can remain dormant then re-emerge in survivors highlights the critical need to prevent the virus from entering and establishing infection in human cells. Thus far, host-cell scramblases TMEM16F and XKR8 have been implicated in Ebola envelope surface phosphatidylserine (PS) and cell entry using PS receptors. We assessed the contributions of these proteins using CRISPR knockout cells and two EBOV models: rVSV/EBOV-GP and EBOV VLPs. We observed that XKR8 is required for optimal EBOV envelope PS levels and infectivity, and particle budding across all viral models.","Acciani, Marissa D; Lay Mendoza, Maria F; Havranek, Katherine E; Duncan, Avery M; Iyer, Hersha; Linn, Olivia L; Brindley, Melinda A",Journal of virology,205,1

However, among other issues, inadequate sampling can reduce accuracy, limiting the value of the technique. In this paper, we apply absolute binding free energy calculations to ligands binding to T4 lysozyme L99A and HSP90 using equilibrium and nonequilibrium approaches. We highlight sampling problems encountered in these systems, such as slow side chain rearrangements and slow changes of water placement upon ligand binding. These same types of challenges are also likely to show up in other protein-ligand systems, and we propose some strategies to diagnose and test for such problems in alchemical free energy calculations. We also explore similarities and differences in how the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium approaches handle these problems. Our results show the large amount of work still to be done to make free energy calculations robust and reliable and provide insight for future research in this area.","Baumann, Hannah M; Gapsys, Vytautas; de Groot, Bert L; Mobley, David L",The journal of physical chemistry.

Emerged from where? Mostly from animals. The AIDS virus is blamed on the butchering of primates in the African bushmeat trade, we created mad cow disease when we turned cows into carnivores and cannibals, and SARS and COVID-19 have been traced back to the exotic wild animal trade. Our last pandemic, swine flu in 2009, arose not from some backwater wet market in Asia, however. It was largely made-in-the-USA on pig production operations in the United States. In this new Age of Emerging Diseases, there are now billions of animals overcrowded and intensively confined in filthy factory farms for viruses to incubate and mutate within. Today's industrial farming practices have given viruses billions more spins at pandemic roulette. How can we stop the emergence of pandemic viruses in the first place? Whenever possible, treat the cause. The largest and oldest association of public health professionals in the world, the American Public Health Association, has called for a moratorium on factory farming for nearly two decades. Indeed, factory farms are a public health menace. In addition to discontinuing the intensive confinement practices of animal agriculture, we should continue to research, develop, and invest in innovative plant-based and cultivated meat technologies to move away from raising billions of feathered and curly-tailed test tubes for viruses with pandemic potential to mutate within.","Greger, Michael",American journal of lifestyle medicine,205,1

This trend poses a serious risk not only for physicians but also for the many patients under their care. Past research finds that one protective factor involves the quality of physicians' motivation. When physicians are more autonomously motivated, they tend to experience better occupational health. However, few studies have identified antecedent factors that support physicians' autonomous work motivation. To identify and model potential root causes of physicians' autonomous work motivation and occupational health, the current study assessed physicians' intrinsic aspirations and need satisfaction at work. Hypotheses were tested in a sample of 2,116 U.S. practicing physicians. Structural equation modeling showed that physicians who endorsed intrinsic aspirations more strongly reported better occupational health, and that this association was mediated by physicians' need satisfaction and autonomous work motivation. Implications for designing more effective individual- and system-level interventions to improve physician occupational health are discussed.","Moller, Arlen C; Olafsen, Anja H; Jager, Andrew J; Kao, Audiey C; Williams, Geoffrey C",Medical care research and review : MCRR,205,17

However, the aggregate magnitude of this association is unknown in the context of threat and deprivation types of adversity and various executive functioning domains. Objective To test the hypothesis that experiences of deprivation are more strongly associated with reduced executive functioning compared with experiences of threat during childhood and adolescence. Data Sources Embase, ERIC, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo databases were searched from inception to December 31, 2020. Both forward and reverse snowball citation searches were performed to identify additional articles. Study Selection Articles were selected for inclusion if they (1) had a child and/or adolescent sample, (2) included measures of ELA, (3) measured executive functioning, (4) evaluated the association between adversity and executive functioning, (5) were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and (6) were published in the English language. No temporal or geographic limits were set. A 2-reviewer, blinded screening process was conducted. Data Extraction and Synthesis PRISMA guidelines were used to guide data extraction and article diagnostics (for heterogeneity, small study bias, and p-hacking). Article quality was assessed, and data extraction was performed by multiple independent observers. A 3-level meta-analytic model with a restricted maximum likelihood method was used. Moderator analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneity. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes included measures of the 3 domains of executive functioning: cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory. Results A total of 91 articles were included, representing 82 unique cohorts and 31 188 unique individuals. Deprivation, compared with threat, was associated with significantly lower inhibitory control (F1,90 = 5.69; P = .02) and working memory (F1,54 = 5.78; P = .02). No significant difference was observed for cognitive flexibility (F1,36 = 2.38; P = .12). The pooled effect size of the association of inhibitory control with deprivation was stronger (Hedges g = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.57 to -0.29) compared with threat (Hedges g = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.46 to -0.08). The pooled effect size of the association of working memory with deprivation was stronger (Hedges g = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.33) compared with threat (Hedges g = -0.28; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.05). Conclusions and Relevance Experiences of both threat and deprivation in childhood and adolescence were associated with reduced executive functioning, but the association was stronger for exposure to deprivation. Efforts to address the consequences of ELA for development should consider the associations between specific dimensions of adversity and specific developmental outcomes.","Johnson, Dylan; Policelli, Julia; Li, Min; Dharamsi, Alyna; Hu, Qiaochu; Sheridan, Margaret A; McLaughlin, Katie A; Wade, Mark",JAMA pediatrics,205,1

This review aimed to determine the effect of active mobilisation and rehabilitation in the ICU on mortality, function, mobility, muscle strength, quality of life, days alive and out of hospital to 180 days, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and discharge destination, linking outcomes with the World Health Organization International Classification of Function Framework. METHODS A PRISMA checklist-guided systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and controlled clinical trials. RESULTS Fourteen studies of varying quality including a total of 1753 patients were reviewed. Active mobilisation and rehabilitation had no impact on short- or long-term mortality (p > 0.05). Meta-analysis showed that active mobilisation and rehabilitation led to greater muscle strength (body function) at ICU discharge as measured using the Medical Research Council Sum Score (mean difference 8.62 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-15.86), greater probability of walking without assistance (activity limitation) at hospital discharge (odds ratio 2.13, 95% CI 1.19-3.83), and more days alive and out of hospital to day 180 (participation restriction) (mean difference 9.69, 95% CI 1.7-17.66). There were no consistent effects on function, quality of life, ICU or hospital length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation or discharge destination.

Although surgical technology is advancing rapidly in this era, surgeons have a chance to make modifications in laparoscopic surgery by reducing the number and size of incisions. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of a single-incision laparoscopic surgical (SILS) approach for transabdominal preperitoneal mesh hernioplasty (TAPP) of bilateral inguinal hernia. METHODS Ten patients with bilateral inguinal hernia admitted to our department and underwent TAPP were retrospectively evaluated. Data regarding patient demographics, type of hernia, operating time, complications, and postoperative hospitalization were prospectively collected. SILS TAPP was performed using conventional instruments and, surgical techniques similar to standard 3-port TAPP were used, except that it was conducted through a single umbilical port. RESULTS All the patients had a bilateral inguinal hernia. All patients were male, and the mean age of the patients was 45 years (range=28 to 62 y). The mean duration of surgery was 63 minutes (range=55 to 80 min). The procedures were completed successfully on all the patients without requiring conversion to the traditional laparoscopic surgery or the use of additional trocars. There was no evidence of early recurrence during a mean follow-up period of 67 days (range=30 to 105 d). CONCLUSIONS SILS TAPP for bilateral hernia is feasible and seems to be safer.

We document a combined respiratory chain enzyme deficiency with emphasis on complex I and IV, affecting heart muscle tissue more than skeletal muscle or fibroblasts. We show this to be caused by reduced mitochondrial DNA encoded protein synthesis affecting all subunits, and resulting in dysfunction of complex I and IV assembly.

METHODS A retrospective study (Canadian Task Force Classification II-2) was carried out at a tertiary referral university hospital from August 2009 to January 2010. Women diagnosed with leiomyoma/adenomyosis and scheduled to undergo SILH were enrolled. The criteria included uterine size ≤16 weeks' gestation on pelvic examination, no suspected malignancy on sonography, normal cytology and contraindications for vaginal hysterectomy. The medical records of all consecutive patients undergoing SILH were reviewed. The main outcome measurements were the feasibility and safety of SILH in terms of conversion rate, body mass index (BMI), uterine weight, operative time, estimated blood loss, drop in hemoglobin level and complications. RESULTS Eleven consecutive patients diagnosed with leiomyoma (10) and adenomyosis (1) underwent SILH successfully during the study period, without conversion or requirement of any extra port. The mean age and BMI of the patients were 47.4 ± 4.27 years and 25.2 ± 4.61 kg/m(2), respectively.

CONCLUSIONS SILH using conventional laparoscopic instrumentation might be a feasible and safe alternative to standard multiple incision laparoscopic hysterectomy in selected patients with symptomatic benign uterine tumor. The potential advantages of our technique are: it is simple and cost-effective, due to the use of conventional, user-friendly laparoscopic instruments. Additional studies on SILH are needed to demonstrate its safety, define selective criteria and determine any benefits over conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy.","Phongnarisorn, Chailert; Chinthakanan, Orawee",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics,205,31

Neutrophils are a key determinant of the disease course of pathogen-induced pneumonia. Optimal host defense balances initial robust pulmonary neutrophil responses to control pathogen numbers, ultimately followed by resolution of inflammation to prevent pulmonary damage. Recent evidence suggests that phenotypic and functional heterogeneity in neutrophils impacts host resistance to pulmonary pathogens. Apart from their apparent role in innate immunity, neutrophils also orchestrate subsequent adaptive immune responses during infection. Thus, the outcome of pulmonary infections can be shaped by neutrophils. This review summarizes the age-driven impairment of neutrophil responses and the contribution of these cells to the susceptibility of the elderly to pneumonia. We describe how aging is accompanied by changes in neutrophil recruitment, resolution and function. We discuss how systemic and local changes alter neutrophil phenotype in aged hosts. We highlight the gap in knowledge of whether these changes in neutrophils also contribute to the decline in adaptive immunity seen with age. We further detail the factors that drive dysregulated neutrophil responses in the elderly and the pathways that may be targeted to re-balance neutrophil activity and boost host resistance to pulmonary infections.","Simmons, Shaunna R; Bhalla, Manmeet; Herring, Sydney E; Tchalla, Essi Y I; Bou Ghanem, Elsa N",Infection and immunity,205,1

Traditional techniques require the placement of invasive central venous access devices. This study aimed to compare two non-invasive technologies for the estimation of regional venous saturation (reflectance plethysmography and near infrared spectroscopy [NIRS]), using venous blood gas analysis as gold standard. Forty patients undergoing cardiac surgery were recruited in two groups. In the first group a reflectance pulse oximeter probe was placed on the skin overlying the internal jugular vein. In the second group, a Somanetics INVOS oximeter patch was placed on the skin overlying the internal jugular vein and overlying the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere. Central venous catheters were placed in all patients. Oxygen saturation estimates from both groups were compared with measured saturation from venous blood. Twenty patients participated in each group.Data were analyzed by the limits of agreement technique suggested by Bland and Altman and by linear regression analysis. In the reflectance plethysmography group, the mean bias was 4.27% and the limits of agreement were 58.3 to -49.8% (r(2) = 0.00, p = 0.98). In the NIRS group the mean biases were 10.8% and 2.0% for the sensors attached over the cerebral hemisphere and over the internal jugular vein, respectively, and the limits of agreement were 33.1 to -11.4 and 19.5 to -15.5% (r(2) = 0.22, 0.28;p = 0.04, 0.03) for the cerebral hemisphere and internal jugular sites, respectively. While transcutaneous regional oximetry and NIRS have both been used to estimate venous and tissue oxygen saturation non-invasively, the correlation between estimates of ScvO(2) and SxvO(2) were statistically significant for near infrared spectroscopy, but not for transcutaneous regional oximetry. Placement of cerebral oximetry patches directly over the internal jugular vein (as opposed to on the forehead) appeared to approximate internal jugular venous saturation better (lower mean bias and tighter limits of agreement), which suggests this modality may with refinement offer the practitioner additional clinically useful information regarding global cerebral oxygen supply and demand matching.","Colquhoun, Douglas A; Tucker-Schwartz, Jason M; Durieux, Marcel E; Thiele, Robert H",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,205,19

The test is commonly used by clinicians; however, many experts argue it lacks reliability and validity along with concerns of safety. The primary purpose of this review is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the SPT to detect AI. Methods: A search of five databases was performed from inception to 19 December 2018 using search terms related to the SPT. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the SPT was used on a patient/participant. Methodological quality assessment of diagnostic studies was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) for studies that reported data to calculate sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative likelihood ratio (-LR). Results: The search yielded 1009 articles, and 32 studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Meta-analysis on diagnostic accuracy studies assessing the SPT was not possible due to statistical heterogeneity. Six diagnostic accuracy studies assessed the SN of the SPT ranging from 0.19 to 1.00. Four of the studies assessed SP of the SPT ranging from 0.71 to 0.98. The +LR was identified in 4 studies was 0.655, 1.73, 22, and 17.25. The -LR was 1.14, 0.799, 0.571, and 0.323. Seven RCTs utilized the SPT to screen for AI, and the SPT was used in 18 case reports. Conclusion: The SPT may be inappropriate to use due to inconsistent validity, poor inter-rater reliability, and potential to cause harm.

We performed an observational retrospective study including all patients who underwent a BAL procedure in our institution, regardless of the reason for bronchoscopy, from January 2015-December 2018. Respiratory viruses were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction with a commercial multiplex panel, and a cell culture was performed to detect cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus. Positive results were correlated with clinical symptoms and patients' characteristics. Of 540 BAL samples analysed, 113 (20.9%) were positive for any respiratory virus. Viral detection was significantly associated with respiratory symptoms (83.2% vs 68.9%, P=.004) and radiological infiltrates (67.3% vs 52.2%, P=.006). The most frequent viruses detected were rhinovirus (42/113, 37.2%), influenza virus (20/113, 17.7%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) (16/113, 14.2%). Respiratory pathogens codetections were found in 51/113 (45.1%) BAL samples, including more than one virus (16/51, 31.4%), fungi (8/51, 15.7%, and bacteria (9/51, 17.6%). Viral detection was significantly higher in immunocompromised patients (26.5% vs 16.9%; P=.022). PIV and human metapneumovirus were mostly observed in lung (50.0%, 8/16) and haemopoietic transplant recipients (25%, 2/8), respectively, with clinical repercussions. Our data underline that molecular diagnosis allows identification of viral agents as the aetiology of respiratory infections; however, the high frequency of co-detections hinders identification of the agent responsible for the current respiratory symptomatology.

Understanding the lifetime of air filters is essential for assessing air pollution exposure. However, the effects of common environmental chemicals on filter performance have not been explored. Air filters in ventilation systems and air purifiers are commonly exposed to cigarette smoke aerosols. Moreover, due to the coronavirus pandemic, people are more likely to be in close proximity with smokers while wearing face masks, such that their masks will be exposed to cigarette aerosols. In this study, we applied a stepwise approach to analyze the effects of cigarette smoke on the filtration performance of electret melt-blown filter media that are commonly used to create face masks. We found that cigarette aerosols dramatically reduced filtration efficiency, while standard test particles of a similar loading weight did not affect filtration efficiency. After loading up to 204 μg/cm2 of cigarette smoke on 100 cm2 of electret filter medium, the filtration efficiency of some filters decreased from 92.5% to 33.3% (-Δ59.2%). Interestingly, we founded no changes in pressure drop following cigarette smoke exposure despite the reduction in filtration efficiency, suggesting that cigarette smoke aerosols significantly impact the electrostatic charge properties of the filters. Our results indicate that the lifetime of commonly-used air filters may be much shorter than expected and that people may unknowingly be directly exposed to airborne pollutants.","Heo, Ki Joon; Lee, Gyu Dong; Doh, Song Jun; Jung, Jae Hee",The Science of the total environment,205,20

Moreover, Galidesivir also inhibits the reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and numerous other medically important flaviviruses. Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded resistant viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an E460D substitution, in the active site of TBEV RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase (RdRp), confers resistance to Galidesivir in cell culture. Galidesivir-resistant TBEV exhibited no cross-resistance to structurally different antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine, 2'-C-methyladenosine and 4'-azido-aracytidine. Although, the E460D substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in vivo, with 100% survival rate and no clinical signs observed in infected mice. Furthermore, no virus was detected in serum, spleen or brain of mice inoculated with the Galidesivir-resistant TBEV. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity, flavivirus resistance to nucleoside inhibitors and the potential contribution of viral RdRp to flavivirus neurovirulence.IMPORTANCE Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. We have previously found that Galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, which is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus infection, has a strong antiviral effect against TBEV. For any antiviral drug, it is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works. Here, we produced TBEV mutants resistant to Galidesivir and found that the resistance is caused by a single amino acid substitution in an active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme which is crucial for replication of viral RNA genome. Although, this substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity.","Eyer, Ludek; Nougairède, Antoine; Uhlířová, Marie; Driouich, Jean-Sélim; Zouharová, Darina; Valdés, James J; Haviernik, Jan; Gould, Ernest A; De Clercq, Erik; de Lamballerie, Xavier; Ruzek, Daniel",Journal of virology,205,30

A secondary aim was to investigate whether associations varied by age. METHODS The cohort comprised COVID-19 positive Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients (N=9,347). For each outcome, we fit piecewise logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines (knots at BMIs of 23, 30, 39), adjusting for: age, sex, comorbidities, VHA nursing home residence, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental analyses included age-by-BMI interaction terms (alpha=0.05). RESULTS We found evidence of a nonlinear J-curve association between BMI and likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. BMI was associated with increased odds for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients with BMIs 30-39, but decreased odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with BMIs 23-30. Patients under age 75 with BMIs 30-39 had increased odds for mortality with increasing BMI. CONCLUSION Odds for severe outcomes with COVID-19 infection increased with increasing BMI for people with, but not without obesity. This non-linear relationship should be tested in future research.

Two-year major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis or target lesion revascularization (TLR), and net adverse cardiac events (NACE), composite of MACE or Bleeding Academic Research consortium (BARC) type 3 or 5 bleeding were assessed. We also explored associations between PPI use and patterns of 2-year DAPT cessation. RESULTS The cohort comprised 4635 patients (23% PPI users) with mean age 64.4 ±11.4 years. Two year adjusted risk of MACE (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04-1.55), NACE (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.01-1.44) and TLR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04-1.71) were significantly higher in PPI users vs. non-users, without a difference in bleeding. Although the incidence of 2-year DAPT discontinuation and interruption was similar, DAPT disruption was significantly lower among PPI users vs. non-users (10.0% vs. 14.7%, P <0.0001). Compared to non-PPI users on continued DAPT, disruption was associated with higher MACE in both PPI users (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.38-3.97) and non-users (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.02-1.94) but greater BARC 3,5 bleeding only in non-PPI users (HR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.21-3.51). CONCLUSIONS In clopidogrel treated PCI patients, the 2-year adjusted risk of MACE and NACE was significantly higher in PPI users driven by higher TLR compared to non-PPI users, without a difference in bleeding. PPI use was associated with lower incidence of DAPT disruption without an increase in disruption related bleeding compared to non-PPI users on DAPT. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Chandrasekhar, Jaya; Bansilal, Sameer; Baber, Usman; Sartori, Samantha; Aquino, Melissa; Farhan, Serdar; Vogel, Birgit; Faggioni, Michela; Giustino, Gennaro; Ariti, Cono; Colombo, Antonio; Chieffo, Alaide; Kini, Annapoorna; Saporito, Richard; Michael Gibson, C; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Cohen, David; Moliterno, David; Stuckey, Thomas; Henry, Timothy; Pocock, Stuart; Dangas, George; Gabriel Steg, P; Mehran, Roxana",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,205,8

In phase 2, robotic suturing skills were evaluated during a training program on non-surviving animals by analyzing time required for five intracorporal stitches on the small bowel. Learning curves were plotted. A significant difference in technical skills between the expert and non-expert surgeons was demonstrated in phase 1 and at the beginning of phase 2. Both surgeons reached a learning-curve plateau exhibiting similar robotic suturing skills at the end of 90 min of training. Skills were subsequently retained equally by both surgeons. Short duration of training was sufficient for the non-expert laparoscopic surgeon to match the robotic suturing performance of the expert laparoscopic surgeon.","Sumi, Yasuo; Dhumane, Parag W; Komeda, Koji; Dallemagne, Bernard; Kuroda, Daisuke; Marescaux, Jacques",Journal of robotic surgery,205,1

Studies have shown that the mechanisms of DNA methylation-mediated plant defense against DNA viruses and RNA viruses are different. However, in rice its function in response to infection of RBSDV, a double-stranded RNA virus, remains unclear. In this study, high-throughput single-base resolution bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) was carried out to analyze the distribution pattern and characteristics of cytosine methylation in RBSDV-infected rice. Widespread differences were identified in CG and non-CG contexts between the RBSDV-infected and RBSDV-free rice. We identified a large number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) along the genome of RBSDV-infected rice. Additionally, the transcriptome sequencing analysis obtained 1119 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Correlation analysis of DMRs-related genes (DMGs) and DEGs filtered 102 genes with positive correlation and 71 genes with negative correlation between methylation level at promoter regions and gene expression. Key genes associated with maintaining DNA methylation in rice were analyzed by RT-qPCR and indicated that OsDMT702 might be responsible for the global increase of DNA methylation level in rice under RBSDV stress. Our results suggest important roles of rice DNA methylation in response to RBSDV and provide potential target genes for rice antiviral immunity.","Li, Linying; He, Yuqing; Zhang, Xueying; Zhang, Hehong; Sun, Zongtao; Li, Junmin; Hong, Gaojie",International journal of molecular sciences,205,24

METHODS Between 2010 and 2014, 8 patients (4 men and 4 women) underwent endonasal endoscopic operations to resect petroclival chondrosarcomas at 2 institutions. The patients' mean age was 44.8 years (range 30-64 years). One of the patients had previously undergone radiation therapy and another a staged craniotomy. Using volumetric software, an independent neuroradiologist assessed the extent of the resections on MRI scans taken immediately after surgery and at the 3-month follow-up. Immediate complications and control of symptoms were also recorded. In addition, the authors reviewed the current literature on surgical treatment of chondrosarcoma. RESULTS The mean preoperative tumor diameter and volume were 3.4 cm and 9.8 cm(3), respectively. Six patients presented with cranial neuropathies. Endonasal endoscopic surgery achieved > 95% resection in 5 of the 8 patients and < 95% resection in the remaining 3 patients. One of the 6 neuropathies resolved, and the remaining 5 partially improved. One instance of postoperative CSF leakage required a reoperation for repair; no other complications associated with these operations were observed. All of the patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS According to the authors' experience, the endoscopic endonasal route is a safe and effective approach for the resection of appropriately selected petroclival chondrosarcomas.","Moussazadeh, Nelson; Kulwin, Charles; Anand, Vijay K; Ting, Jonathan Y; Gamss, Caryn; Iorgulescu, J Bryan; Tsiouris, Apostolos John; Cohen-Gadol, Aaron A; Schwartz, Theodore H",Journal of neurosurgery,205,1

Our aim was to perform 1-year MR angiographic and clinical follow-up of patients treated with mechanical endovascular thrombectomy using the Solitaire device. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with stroke treated between August 2010 and July 2012 were prospectively evaluated with a minimum follow-up of 1 year after mechanical endovascular thrombectomy. Angiographic follow-up was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner and included intracranial artery TOF MRA and supra-aortic artery gadolinium-enhanced MRA. Images were assessed to detect arterial abnormalities (stenosis, occlusion, dilation) and were compared with the final post-mechanical endovascular thrombectomy run to differentiate delayed and pre-existing abnormalities. Clinical evaluation was performed with the mRS and the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire quality-of-life scale. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were angiographically assessed at the mean term of 19 ± 4 months. MRA showed intracranial artery abnormalities in 10 patients, including 5 delayed intracranial artery abnormalities in 4 patients (4 stenoses and 1 dilation), 4 cases of pre-existing intracranial artery stenosis, and 2 occlusions. Pre-existing etiologic cervical artery stenosis or occlusion was observed in 2 patients. All these patients remained asymptomatic during the follow-up period. A significant clinical improvement was observed at 1-year follow-up in comparison with 3-month follow-up (P < .0001), with a good outcome achieved in 62.5% of patients and an acceptable quality of life restored. CONCLUSIONS One-year follow-up identifies delayed asymptomatic arterial abnormalities in patients treated with the Solitaire device.","Eugène, F; Gauvrit, J-Y; Ferré, J-C; Gentric, J-C; Besseghir, A; Ronzière, T; Raoult, H",AJNR.

Women are more likely to manifest abnormal bleeding symptoms due to physiologic events and menorrhagia is the most common presenting symptom. Methods this case-control study included 168 women aged between 18 and 45. The cases had menorrhagia whilst the controls did not. Blood grouping, activated partial thromboplastin time and von Willebrand factor activity tests were performed on samples collected from consenting study participants. Results the mean age was 29.96 ± 7.37. Mean vWF activity of cases was 66.6% and of controls 97.8%. The mean activated Partial ThromboplastinTime (aPTT) of cases was 31.09s and of controls was 30.40s. There was no difference in the vWF activity between blood group O (86.3%) and non-blood group O (88.0%) participants. Eight women were diagnosed with von Willebrand disease, 6 cases and 2 controls. Higher odds of von Willebrand disease were seen in the cases (OR = 6.6). Epistaxis, von Willebrand and factor activity levels and family history of menorrhagia were associated with an increased risk for menorrhagia. Conclusion von Willebrand factor activity levels were associated with menorrhagia while activated partial thromboplastin time was not. vWF activity levels did not depend on any specific blood group. The prevalence of von Willebrand disease was significantly higher in participants with menorrhagia and repeated epistaxis and family history of menorrhagia pointed to a higher risk of menorrhagia.","Munsanje, Miyoba Melinda; Kaile, Trevor; Kowa, Sumbukeni; Sinkala, Musalula; Simakando, Marah; Ndhlovu, Jacob; Chiluba, Brian Chanda",The Pan African medical journal,205,11

Quite a few infectious diseases are still lacking effective prevention or treatment. The pace of developing antiviral agents could be expedited by the availability of quick and efficient drug screening platforms. In this study, quantum dot (QD), an emerging probe for biological imaging and medical diagnostics, was employed to form complexes with virus and used as fluorescent imaging probes for exploring potential antiviral therapeutics. Inorganic CdSe/ZnS QDs synthesized in organic phase were encapsulated by amphiphilic alginate to attain biocompatible water-soluble QDs via phase transfer. Virus employed for this study was dengue virus which is a notorious one in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. To construct a QD-virus imaging modality capable of providing meaningful information, preservation of viral infectivity after tagging virus with QDs is of utmost importance. In order to form colloidal complexes of QD-virus, electrostatic repulsion force generated from both negatively charged virus and QDs was neutralized by various concentrations of cationic polybrene. Results showed that BHK-21 cells infected with dengue viruses incorporated with QDs exhibited bright fluorescence intracellularly within 30 min. To demonstrate the potency of QD-virus complexes as bioprobes for screening antiviral agents, BHK-21 cells were incubated for one hour with allophycocyanin purified from blue-green algae and then infected with QD-virus complexes. Based on the developed cell-based imaging assay, allophycocyanin with concentration of 125 microg/mL led to extremely weak intracellular fluorescence post-infection of QD-virus complexes for 30 min. That is, the efficacy of anti-dengue viral activity of the algae extract was clearly illustrated by the inorganic-organic hybrid platform constructed in current study.","Wang, Chung-Hao; Hsu, Yi-Shiou; Peng, Ching-An",Biosensors & bioelectronics,205,11

Before, adjustable gastric banding (AGB) was regarded as an alternative; nowadays, sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is a more favorable alternative. In case of unsatisfactory results, RYGB is often performed as a secondary procedure. Conversion of an AGB is associated with a high risk of complications; the hypothesis was that this would be less after conversion of an SG. METHODS All patients undergoing conversion to RYGB after AGB or SG between 2005 and 2012 were included for retrospective analysis. Patient characteristics, operative details, postoperative complications, the relief of complaints, weight loss, reasons for failure, and evolution of known comorbidities up to 2 years were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 178 patients were included (79.8 % female): AGB 110 (61.8 %) versus SG 68 (38.2 %). Main reasons for conversion were weight regain/insufficient weight loss (48.4 %) or dysphagia/reflux complaints (39.9 %). Surgical complications were found in 19 patients (AGB 13 vs SG 6; p = 0.530). Infectious complications occurred in 13 patients (AGB 11 vs SG 2; p = 0.135). Total body weight loss was equal between groups after 2 years (AGB 31.6 ± 11.0 % vs SG 31.6 ± 12.0 %; p = 0.998). Similar results were found in a subgroup analysis on patients undergoing conversion for additional weight loss (AGB 31.7 ± 11.7 % vs SG 27.0 ± 13.1 %; p = 0.173). CONCLUSIONS Conversion to RYGB after failed AGB or SG showed comparable short-term results in terms of postoperative complications and weight loss.","van Wezenbeek, M R; van Oudheusden, T R; de Zoete, J P J G M; Smulders, J F; Nienhuijs, S W",Obesity surgery,205,16

Presented herein is the initial comparison of LESS donor nephrectomy (LESS-DN) and standard laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy (LLDN). OBJECTIVE To determine whether LESS-DN provides any measurable benefit over LLDN during the perioperative period and subsequent convalescence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between November 2007 and November 2008, 18 consecutive patients underwent LESS-DN (17 left DN, 1 right DN). A contemporary matched-pair cohort of 17 patients undergoing standard LLDN was selected for retrospective comparison. INTERVENTIONS LESS-DN was performed through an intraumbilical novel multichannel port. The kidney was extracted through a slightly extended umbilical incision. MEASUREMENTS All data were prospectively accrued in an institutional review board-approved database. Convalescence data included visual analog pain scores and questionnaires containing patient-reported time to recovery end points. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS One right-sided donor was converted to standard laparoscopy and excluded from analysis. Baseline demographics, operating time, blood loss, and hospital stay were comparable between groups. Compared to LLDN, patients undergoing LESS-DN had similar in-hospital analgesic requirements and mean visual analog scores at discharge. After discharge, patient-reported convalescence was faster in the LESS-DN group, including days on oral pain medication (20 vs 6; p=0.01), days off work (46 vs 18; p=0.0009), and days to 100% physical recovery (83 vs 29; p=0.03). Mean warm ischemia time was longer in the LESS-DN group (3 vs 6.1 min; p<0.0001); however, allograft function was immediate and comparable between groups. One allograft in the LESS-DN group thrombosed postoperatively. Regardless of laparoscopic approach, patients' global satisfaction with kidney donation and willingness to recommend their procedure to others were favorable and equivalent between groups. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective matched-pair comparison between LESS-DN and LLDN suggests that the single-port approach may be associated with quicker convalescence. In this initial series, LESS-DN had longer ischemia time, yet early allograft outcomes were comparable.","Canes, David; Berger, Andre; Aron, Monish; Brandina, Ricardo; Goldfarb, David A; Shoskes, Daniel; Desai, Mihir M; Gill, Inderbir S",European urology,205,24

The aim of this parallel group study was to determine whether monitoring depth of anaesthesia influences the incidence of postoperative delirium. METHODS Patients who were planned for surgery in general anaesthesia expected to last at least 60 min and who were older than 60 yr were included between March 2009 and May 2010. A total of 1277 patients of a consecutive sample were randomized (n=638 open, n=639 blinded) and the data of 1155 patients were analysed (n=575 open, n=580 blinded). In one group, the anaesthesiologists were allowed to use the bispectral index (BIS) data to guide anaesthesia, while in the other group, BIS monitoring was blinded. Cognitive function was evaluated at baseline, 1 week, and 3 months after operation. RESULTS Delirium incidence was lower in patients guided with BIS. Postoperative delirium was detected in 95 patients (16.7%) in the intervention group compared with 124 patients (21.4%) in the control group (P=0.036). In a multivariate analysis, the percentage of episodes of deep anaesthesia (BIS values <20) were independently predictive for postoperative delirium (P=0.006; odds ratio 1.027). BIS monitoring did not alter the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (7th day P=0.062; 90th day P=0.372). CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative neuromonitoring is associated with a lower incidence of delirium, possibly by reducing extreme low BIS values. Therefore, in high-risk surgical patients, this may give the anaesthesiologist a possibility to influence one precipitating factor in the complex genesis of delirium.

A PGL tumor hypersecretes catecholamines and causes symptoms identical to those in patients with hyper-functioning adrenal pheochromocytoma (PCC). In this study, we compared the surgical outcome of laparoscopic surgery, including laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery, in patients with PCC and patients with retroperitoneal solitary PGL. METHODS The records of 49 patients with PCC and 9 patients with unilateral retroperitoneal PGL at our institution from January 2001 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Multiple tumors, tumors suspected of being malignant preoperatively, and tumors operated on using a retroperitoneal approach were excluded from the study. RESULTS Each group was equivalent with respect to patient background, hemodynamic variables, and preoperative biochemical assessments, including plasma catecholamine levels and catecholamine levels in 24-hour urine samples. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the PGL group (149.4 ± 56.5 minutes v 189.8 ± 44.9 minutes, P=0.019). In univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor size ≥ 50 mm and PGL were statistically significant factors that predicted prolonged operative time. Intraoperative hypotension occurred in 15 patients in the PCC group and in 8 patients in the PGL group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.002). One postoperative complication in the PCC group and two postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher) in the PGL group were observed, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.012). Twenty-two patients in this series underwent LESS surgery (PCC: n=19; PGL: n=3), and there was no statistically significant difference in the perioperative outcomes between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS The present results demonstrate that the operation for solitary extraperitoneal PGL required a longer operative time and had more hypotensive episodes and higher postoperative morbidity than the PCC group. Though the perioperative outcome of LESS surgery for PGL is comparable to that of PCC, we should treat the patients with PGL accordingly.","Hattori, Seiya; Miyajima, Akira; Hirasawa, Yousuke; Kikuchi, Eiji; Kurihara, Isao; Miyashita, Kazutoshi; Shibata, Hirotaka; Nakagawa, Ken; Oya, Mototsugu",Journal of endourology,205,1

DESIGN Original Article. SETTING Intensive care units at a single-center teaching hospital. PATIENTS Critically ill COVID-19 patients under contact and special droplet precautions. INTERVENTIONS Relocation of intravenous pumps for COVID-19 patients from bedside to outside the patient room using extension tubing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary objective of the study was to measure the impact of this strategy on COVID-19 exposure, utilizing the number of nurse entries into the patient room as a surrogate endpoint, and extrapolation of this data to determine the reduction or PPE usage. Secondary endpoints included incidence of extravasation, hyperglycemia, hypotension, and diagnosis of CLABSI/bacteremia. A statistically significant reduction in the primary endpoint of the study was observed as room entries prior to pump relocation averaged 15.36 (± 4.10) as opposed to an average of 7.92 (± 2.19) following pump relocation (p < 0.0001). In both pre- and post-pump relocation groups, there was no incidence of extravasation or CLABSI. No significant differences were noted in number of patients experiencing hyperglycemia, hypotensive episodes, or bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS There was a significant decrease in COVID-19 exposure based on the number of nurse entries following the relocation of intravenous pumps from inside to outside of the patient room. These results may be cautiously extrapolated to suggest a decrease in personal protective equipment utilization. Future prospective, randomized controlled trials investigating the impact of this strategy are required.","Shah, Ami; Xu, Jiashan; Friedman, Seana; Puskas, John D; Bhatt, Himani V; Yimen, Mekeleya",Journal of intensive care medicine,205,19

AIM To provide a rapid expert guide for GPs and long COVID clinical services. DESIGN AND SETTING A Delphi study was conducted with a panel of primary and secondary care doctors. METHOD Recommendations were generated relating to the investigation and management of long COVID. These were distributed online to a panel of UK doctors (any specialty) with an interest in, lived experience of, and/or experience treating long COVID. Over two rounds of Delphi testing, panellists indicated their agreement with each recommendation (using a five-point Likert scale) and provided comments. Recommendations eliciting a response of 'strongly agree', 'agree', or 'neither agree nor disagree' from 90% or more of responders were taken as showing consensus. RESULTS Thirty-three clinicians representing 14 specialties reached consensus on 35 recommendations. Chiefly, GPs should consider long COVID in the presence of a wide range of presenting features (not limited to fatigue and breathlessness) and exclude differential diagnoses where appropriate. Detailed history and examination with baseline investigations should be conducted in primary care. Indications for further investigation and specific therapies (for myocarditis, postural tachycardia syndrome, mast cell disorder) include hypoxia/desaturation, chest pain, palpitations, and histamine-related symptoms. Rehabilitation should be individualised, with careful activity pacing (to avoid relapse) and multidisciplinary support. CONCLUSION Long COVID clinics should operate as part of an integrated care system, with GPs playing a key role in the multidisciplinary team. Holistic care pathways, investigation of specific complications, management of potential symptom clusters, and tailored rehabilitation are needed.","Nurek, Martine; Rayner, Clare; Freyer, Anette; Taylor, Sharon; Järte, Linn; MacDermott, Nathalie; Delaney, Brendan C",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,205,33

The present study aimed to illuminate how the general public in Germany reacted to the prospect of increasing the length, the intensity and/or the flexibility of distancing rules implied by different lockdown scenarios. Endorsement of and compliance with five specific lockdown scenarios were assessed in a large (N = 14,433) German sample. Results showed that lockdown length affected respondents' reactions much more strongly than intensity or flexibility. Additional analyses (i.e., mixture distribution modelling) showed that half of the respondents rejected any further extensions or intensifications, while 20% would endorse long-term strategies if necessary. We argue that policy-makers and political communicators should take the public's endorsement of and compliance with such scenarios into account, as should simulations predicting the effects of different lockdown scenarios.","Gollwitzer, Mario; Platzer, Christine; Zwarg, Clarissa; Göritz, Anja S",International journal of psychology : Journal international de psychologie,205,8

Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) Security Maps developed in the 1930s assigned neighborhoods one of four grades that pertained to perceived investment risk of borrowers from that neighborhood: green (grade A) were considered ""Best"", blue (grade B) ""Still Desirable"", yellow (grade C) ""Definitely Declining"", and red (grade D, hence the term ""redlining"") ""Hazardous"". Geocoded residential addresses at the time of birth were superimposed on HOLC Security Maps to assign each birth a HOLC grade. We adjusted for potential confounders present at the time of Security Map creation by assigning HOLC polygons areal-weighted 1940s Census measures. We then employed propensity score matching methods to estimate the association of historical HOLC grades on current birth outcomes. Because tracts graded A had almost no propensity of receiving grade C or D and because grade B tracts had low propensity of receiving grade D, we examined birth outcomes in the three following comparisons: B vs. A, C vs. B, and D vs. C. RESULTS The prevalence of preterm birth, SGA and mortality tended to be higher in worse HOLC grades, while the prevalence of LBW varied across grades. Overall odds of mortality and preterm birth increased as HOLC grade worsened. Propensity score matching balanced 1940s census measures across contrasting groups. Logistic regression models revealed significantly elevated odds of preterm birth (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00-1.05), and SGA (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05) in the C vs. B comparison and significantly reduced odds of preterm birth (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91-0.95), LBW (OR: 0.94-95% CI: 0.92-0.97), and SGA (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96) in the D vs. C comparison. Results differed by metropolitan area and maternal race. CONCLUSION Similar to prior studies on redlining, we found that worsening HOLC grade was associated with adverse birth outcomes, although this relationship was less clear after propensity score matching and stratifying by metropolitan area. Higher odds of preterm birth and SGA in grade C versus grade B neighborhoods may be caused by higher-stress environments, racial segregation, and lack of access to resources, while lower odds of preterm birth, SGA, and LBW in grade D versus grade C neighborhoods may due to population shifts in those neighborhoods related to gentrification.","Nardone, Anthony L; Casey, Joan A; Rudolph, Kara E; Karasek, Deborah; Mujahid, Mahasin; Morello-Frosch, Rachel",PloS one,205,16

METHODS A total of 126 RHCC patients in the subcapsular location after initial radical hepatectomy were included in this study between Dec 2014 and Jan 2018. These patients were divided into the RFA group (46 cases) and the repeat hepatectomy group (80 cases). The primary endpoints include repeat recurrence-free survival (rRFS) and overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoint was complications. The propensity-score matching (PSM) was conducted to minimize the bias. Complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification, and severe complications were defined as classification of complications of ≥grade 3. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the incidence of severe complications were observed between RFA group and repeat hepatectomy group in rRFS and OS both before (1-, 2-, and 3-year rRFS rates were 65.2%, 47.5%, and 33.3% vs 72.5%, 51.2%, and 39.2%, respectively, P = 0.48; 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 93.5%, 80.2%, and 67.9% vs 93.7%, 75.8%, and 64.2%, respectively, P = 0.92) and after PSM (1-, 2-, and 3-year rRFS rates were 68.6%, 51.0%, and 34.0% vs 71.4%, 42.9%, and 32.3%, respectively, P = 0.78; 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 94.3%, 82.9%, and 71.4% vs 88.6%, 73.8%, and 59.0%, respectively, P = 0.36). Moreover, no significant differences in the incidence of severe complications were observed between the RFA group and repeat hepatectomy group.

Many pharmaceutical companies are exploring the use of old drugs to establishing new drug dosage forms and drug delivery systems, in particular for use in neglected diseases. The formation of complexes with cyclodextrins is widely used to improve the stability, solubility, and bioavailability of pharmaceutical drugs, as well as reduce both the toxicity and side effects of many of these drugs. The aim of this study was to characterize solid compounds obtained from the association between furazolidone (FZD) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD). The solid compounds were prepared in molar ratios of 1:1 and 1:2 (drug:CD) by kneading and lyophilization. Molecular docking was used to predict the preferred relative orientation of FZD when bound in both studied cyclodextrins. The resulting solid compounds were qualitatively characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermal analysis (DSC and TG/DTG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy with image mapping (Raman mapping), and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C NMR) in the solid state. The cytotoxicity of the compounds against THP-1 macrophages and the 50% growth inhibition (IC50) against Leishmania amazonensis promastigote forms were subsequently investigated using in vitro techniques. For all of the solid compounds obtained, the existence of an association between FZD and CD were confirmed by one or more characterization techniques (TG/DTG, DSC, SEM, XRD, RAMAN, and 13C NMR), particularly by a significant decrease in the crystallinity of these materials and a reduction in the melting enthalpy associated with furazolidone thermal events. The formation of more effective interactions occurred in the compounds prepared by lyophilization, in a 1:2 molar ratio of the two CDs studied. However, the formation of an inclusion complex was confirmed only for the solid compound obtained from HP-β-CD prepared by lyophilization (LHFZD1:2). The absence of cytotoxicity on the THP-1 macrophage lineages and the leishmanicidal activity were confirmed for all compounds. MHFZD1:2 and LHFZD1:2 were found to be very active against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis, while all others were considered only active. These results are in line with the literature, demonstrating the existence of biological activity for associations between drugs and CDs in the form of complexes and non-complexes. All solid compounds obtained were found to be promising for use as leishmanicidal agents against promastigote forms of L. amazonensis.","Carvalho, Suzana Gonçalves; Cipriano, Daniel Fernandes; de Freitas, Jair Carlos Checon; Junior, Miguel Ângelo Schettino; Ocaris, Enrique Ronald Yapuchura; Teles, Carolina Bioni Garcia; de Jesus Gouveia, Aurileya; Rodrigues, Ricardo Pereira; Zanini, Marcos Santos; Villanova, Janaína Cecília Oliveira",Drug delivery and translational research,205,26

The aim of this study was to determine whether tailored antiaggregant medication based on platelet reactivity testing with multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate) yields superior outcomes after intracranial flow-diverting stent (FDS) implantation compared with standard clopidogrel treatment. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the following data from 100 consecutive patients: endovascular procedure characteristics, antiaggregant medications, procedural variables, and perioperative complications after FDS implantation for intracranial aneurysm. Patients were divided into two groups: uniform treatment with clopidogrel (untailored, early phase) and tailored treatment based on the results of aggregometry (late phase). Statistical comparisons included the Fisher exact test to compare categorical variables between the standard and aggregometry groups and the Mann-Whitney U test to compare ADP test values within the aggregometry group between groups receiving tailored or untailored treatment. RESULTS In the aggregometry group (68 patients, 71 procedures) there were 17 (25%) clopidogrel-resistant patients, according to a cut-off value of 468 area under the aggregation curve; 12 underwent FDS implantation under tailored antiaggregant medication. In the standard treatment group (32 patients, 33 procedures) there were 3 (9.1%) spontaneous thrombotic events and 1 (3.3%) technical hemorrhagic complication. In the aggregometry group there were 2 (2.8%) spontaneous hemorrhagic events and 1 (1.4%) technical ischemic complication. In the aggregometry group, thrombotic complications and morbidity were lower than in the standard (no test) group (p<0.03). CONCLUSIONS Tailoring platelet reactivity according to multiple electrode aggregometry decreases the rate of thrombotic complications after intracranial FDS implantation.","Oran, Ismail; Cinar, Celal; Bozkaya, Halil; Korkmaz, Mehmet",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,205,1

In the absence of data this review utilizes the Ring Theory of Personhood (RToP) to evaluate how a physician's concept of personhood is affected caring for terminally ill children in order to better support them holistically. METHODS Using PRISMA Guidelines, 14 researchers carried out independent searches of PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and gray literature databases for articles published between 2000 to 2019. Concurrent and independent employment of content and thematic analysis (Split Approach) was used to enhance the trustworthiness of the analysis. RESULTS 13,424 titles and abstracts were retrieved, 188 full texts were evaluated, and 39 articles were included and analyzed. Identical categories and themes identified using the Split Approach suggest that caring for dying children in PPC impacts the physician's professional identity, clinical decision making, personal well-being and relationships. The data also suggests that the magnitude of these effects depends on the presence of protective and risk factors. CONCLUSION Aside from providing a novel insight into the upon the physician, this review proffers a unique approach to accounting for the presence, magnitude and influence of incoming catalysts, resultant conflicts, and protective and risk factors upon the physician's personhood. Further studies into the changes in personhood are required. Design of a personalized assessment tool based on the RToP will help direct timely, appropriate and personalized support to these physicians.","Ngiam, Lisa Xin Ling; Ong, Yun Ting; Ng, Jun Xuan; Kuek, Joshua Tze Yin; Chia, Jeng Long; Chan, Natalie Pei Xin; Ho, Chong Yao; Abdurrahman, Ahmad Bin Hanifah Marican; Kamal, Nur Haidah Ahmad; Cheong, Clarissa Wei Shuen; Ng, Cheng Han; Tan, Xiu Hui; Tan, Lorraine Hui En; Chin, Annelissa Mien Chew; Mason, Stephen; Jumat, Muhammad Raihan; Chiam, Min; Krishna, Lalit Kumar Radha",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,205,16

Clinical data on AlloDerm RTU use is, however, limited, particularly with respect to histologic evidence of graft integration and clinical outcomes. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent tissue-expander/implant reconstruction with the use of AlloDerm RTU from March 2011 to September 2012 were included in this analysis. Biopsies of AlloDerm RTU/capsule interface were obtained at the time of expander/implant exchange and evaluated for evidence of cellularization, vascularization, and inflammatory reaction. Data on postoperative complications were retrieved from patient records. Results A total of 116 biopsy specimens from 68 patients were obtained. At biopsy, on visual inspection, nearly all grafts were fully integrated within the host tissue. Histologically, graft specimens demonstrated mild-to-moderate neovascularization and cellular repopulation with no inflammatory cells. All patients were followed for 5 years postoperatively. Short-term postoperative complications of skin necrosis, seroma, and infection occurred in 10.3%, 4.3%, and 2.6% of reconstructions, respectively. Capsular contracture (grade 3) was the only long-term complication (5.2%). Rates of short- and long-term complications are similar to those observed in our previous experience with AlloDerm reconstructive tissue matrix. Conclusions AlloDerm RTU used in breast reconstructive surgery fully integrates and incorporates into host tissue. There were no unexpected safety concerns with its use at short-term or at long-term, at least up to 5 years of follow-up.","Gabriel, Allen; Maxwell, G Patrick",Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Methods: Based on current understanding of the disease, we set up five scenarios and use the infectious disease transmission dynamic and pandemic theoretical static models to evaluate the demand for medical resources. Results: Different epidemic strength and strategies of disease control and prevention resulted in different levels of medical resource request, and active control strategy and effective measures could significantly decrease the requirement. During the epidemic rising phase, the cost of prevention and control measures and the requirement of professional response capacities would increase with potential high risk of medical resource demand sharply increasing.

Alkbh5 has effects on m6A density and splicing events in tumors during ICB. Alkbh5 modulates Mct4/Slc16a3 expression and lactate content of the tumor microenvironment and the composition of tumor-infiltrating Treg and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Importantly, a small-molecule Alkbh5 inhibitor enhanced the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Notably, the ALKBH5 gene mutation and expression status of melanoma patients correlate with their response to immunotherapy.

We resolved two sub-diffusion exponential decays for free rhodamines in aqueous solutions, of which the slower component scales linearly with the viscosity of the solution. Correlation data for proteins and DNA labeled with tetramethylrhodamine were fitted with three to four exponential decays describing flickering dynamics on a time scale between 0.5 and 100 μs. We investigated the nature of these processes by performing experiments under different experimental conditions and for different samples. On the basis of how their population and lifetime change with viscosity, the oxygen content of the solution, the laser irradiance, and the detection geometry, we assigned these states, in the order of increasing lifetimes, to a triplet state, a hybrid between twisted-intramolecular-charge-transfer state and a ground state lactonic state, a lactonic state, and a photoionized state, respectively. Our data suggests that none of the observed sub-diffusion correlation decays can be directly assigned to the intramolecular dynamics of the labeled biomolecules. However, we found evidence that the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the biomolecule appears in the correlation curves as a modulation of the photophysics of the dye label. This shows the importance of accurate control measurements and appropriate modeling of the dye photophysics in fluorescence correlation studies, and it cautions against direct assignments of dark-state relaxation times to folding kinetics in proteins and nucleic acids.","Mazouchi, Amir; Bahram, Abdullah; Gradinaru, Claudiu C",The journal of physical chemistry.

This was a quantitative research methodology using descriptive statistical analyses with a sequential explanatory design. RESULTS One thousand-three-hundred and seventy-four participants from 100 countries on 6 continents joined the Webinar, 557 (40%) of whom completed the questionnaire. Over 70% of participants reported that they ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that the Webinar format promoted deep learning for each of the topics compared to other standard learning methods (textbook and journal learning). Two-thirds expressed a preference for attending a Webinar rather than an international conference. Over 80% of participants highlighted significant barriers to attending conferences including cost (79%), distance to travel (49%), time commitment (51%), and family commitments (35%). Strengths of the Webinar included expertise, concise high-quality presentations often discussing contentious issues, and the platform quality. The main weakness was a limited time for questions. Just over 53% expressed a concern for the carbon footprint involved in attending conferences and preferred to attend a Webinar.

Recent data show a more complex situation, with mortality rates for overall cardiovascular disease, including coronary heart disease and stroke, decelerating, whereas those for heart failure are increasing. To mark the 40th anniversary of the Bethesda Conference, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association cosponsored the ""Bending the Curve in Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Bethesda + 40"" symposium. The objective was to examine the immediate and long-term outcomes of the 1978 conference and understand the current environment. Symposium themes included trends and future projections in cardiovascular disease (in the United States and internationally), the evolving obesity and diabetes epidemics, and harnessing emerging and innovative opportunities to preserve and promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular disease. In addition, participant-led discussion explored the challenges and barriers in promoting cardiovascular health across the lifespan and established a potential framework for observational research and interventions that would begin in early childhood (or ideally in utero).

In this paper, we present a technical solution to address this challenge. Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-designed user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment.

Dans le but d’appuyer la rédaction de lignes directrices sur la prise en charge de la COVID-19, nous avons réalisé une revue systématique des bénéfices et des préjudices associés à 7 traitements antiviraux contre cette infection. MÉTHODES: Nous avons effectué des recherches dans MEDLINE, Embase, le Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed et 3 bases de données chinoises (CNKI, Wanfang Data et SinoMed) jusqu’au 19 avril 2020, dans medRxiv et ChinaXiv jusqu’au 27 avril 2020, ainsi que dans Chongqing VIP jusqu’au 30 avril 2020. Nous avons sélectionné des études sur la ribavirine, la chloroquine, l’hydroxychloroquine, l’umifénovir (Arbidol), le favipiravir, l’interféron et le lopinavir/ritonavir. Lorsqu’il n’y avait pas de données directes d’études sur la COVID-19, nous avons retenu des données indirectes d’études sur le syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère (SRAS) et le syndrome respiratoire du Moyen-Orient (SRMO) pour l’analyse de l’efficacité, et d’études sur d’autres infections respiratoires virales aiguës pour l’analyse de l’innocuité. RÉSULTATS: Le taux de décès chez les patients atteints d’une forme sans signe clinique de gravité de COVID-19 était extrêmement bas, ce qui ne permet pas de conclure à un effet important sur la mortalité. Nous n’avons obtenu que des données de très faible qualité indiquant que la plupart des traitements avaient peu ou pas de bénéfices sur les paramètres à l’étude, quelle que soit la gravité de la COVID-19. Seule exception : le traitement au lopinavir/ritonavir, pour lequel nous avons obtenu des données de faible qualité faisant état d’une réduction de la durée du séjour en unité de soins intensifs (différence des risques [DR] 5 jours de moins, intervalle de confiance [IC] de 95 % 0 à 9 jours) et de la durée d’hospitalisation (DR 1 jour de moins, IC de 95 % 0 à 2 jours). En ce qui concerne l’innocuité, les données étaient de faible ou de très faible qualité, sauf pour le traitement au lopinavir/ritonavir, où des données de qualité moyenne laissaient supposer une augmentation probable de la diarrhée, des nausées et des vomissements. INTERPRÉTATION: À l’heure actuelle, rien ne prouve de façon convaincante que les traitements antiviraux apportent des bénéfices importants dans la lutte contre la COVID-19, bien que les données propres à chaque traitement n’excluent pas cette possibilité.

BaCo0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ with a perovskite-phase cathode has demonstrated efficient triple charge conduction (H+/O2-/e-) for high-performance cathode in low-temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LT-SOFC). Here we designed another type of triple-charge conducting perovskite oxide based on Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.1Fe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1O3-δ (BSCFZY) which formed a heterostructure with ionic conductor Ca0.04Ce0.80Sm0.16O2-δ (SCDC) showing both a high ionic conductivity of 0.22 Scm-1 and an excellent power output of 900 mW/cm2 in a hybrid-ion LT-SOFC. In addition to demonstrating that a heterostructure BSCFZY-SCDC approach can be a good functional electrolyte, the existence of hybrid H+/O2- conducting species in BSCFZY-SCDC was confirmed. The hetero-interface formation between BSCFZY and SCDC can be explained by energy band alignment which was verified through UV-Vis and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The interface may help in providing a pathway to enhance the ionic conductivities and to avoid short-circuiting. Various characterization techniques are being used to probe the electrochemical and physical properties of the material containing dual-ion characteristics. The results indicate that the triple charge conducting electrolyte is a potential candidate to further reduce the operating temperature of SOFC, but simultaneously maintaining a high performance.","Rauf, Sajid; Zhu, Bin; Shah, M A K Yousaf; Tayyab, Zuhra; Attique, Sanam; Ali, Nasir; Mushtaq, Naveed; Wang, Baoyuan; Yang, Changping; Asghar, Muhammad Imran; Lund, Peter D",ACS applied materials & interfaces,205,19

Simple metrics for characterizing volatility in blood components within the hospital transfusion service have not been established. METHODS We measured the volatility of demand for blood services at a large academic urban general hospital over a 6-month period from July 2019 to December 2019 prior to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. RESULTS Among 4416 consecutive hours assessed, there were 693 h (16%) with spikes in demand for blood components with a mean (sd) of 3.8 (2.7) spikes/day. Spikes in demand were frequently clustered. The median number of hours between spikes differed by shift (6 h for days; 3 h for evenings; 3 h for nights). The percentage of shift hours with demand spikes also differed (9% day; 19% evening; 18% night). During the study, 32,447 components were distributed to 19,431 patients. Of these, 11,819 components (36%) were distributed during hours of peak demand. Hours with a simultaneous spike in both component demand and patient demand occurred in 5% of hours or approximately once each day. CONCLUSION Demand for transfusion services was highly volatile in an unpredictable fashion. We provide an approach that could be used to benchmark spikes in demand for blood services at hospitals. Consideration of the frequency, unpredictability, and magnitude of spikes in demand may be relevant for hemovigilance programs and for strategies to determine the laboratory staffing needed for good patient care.","Walter, 'Sunny' Dzik",Transfusion,205,1

In this paper, we described the clinical presentation and outcomes of patients presenting with band or band-adjustment reservoir sepsis from our series from a single institution. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected clinical, anthropometric and biochemical data from patients who underwent LAGB placement over a five-year period at a metropolitan teaching hospital. Those patients requiring surgical intervention for prosthesis-related sepsis were included in the review. RESULTS Of the 445 patients in this series, 10 (2.2%) developed prosthesis sepsis and required operative intervention. Three (0.7%) presented with reservoir sepsis requiring removal of the reservoir. One had band erosion identified and the entire prosthesis removed. In seven (1.5%) of the patients, infections occurred at the gastric band. Two patients presented with purulent peritonitis and underwent immediate band removal. The remainder presented with band abscesses and either had their band removed (three patients) or left in position and the sepsis treated with drainage and antibiotics (two patients). CONCLUSIONS In our current series, a small proportion of LAGB patients developed prosthesis-related infection that typically required port or band removal and usually occurred early in the post-operative course. We have modified our prophylactic antibiotic regime and surgical technique as a result of this review. In selected cases of band infection, bands were salvaged with subsequent acceptable weight loss, suggesting that LAGB salvage in the presence of sepsis may be achievable in some patients.","Facek, Michael; Receveur, Imke; Darbar, Archie; Richardson, Andrea; Leibman, Steven; Smith, Garett",ANZ journal of surgery,205,6

Injection of embryoid bodies to septic mice improved the condition of their lungs and significantly increased their survival rate. Although embryoid bodies secretedsphingosine-1-phosphate in vitro, its serum levels in mouse plasma were significantly reduced compared to that in the control (untreated mice receiving PBS). Low concentrations of sphingosine-1-phosphate protected endothelial cells, while high concentrations disrupted endothelial barrier integrity. Therefore, exogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate secreted by embryoid bodies during early stage of sepsis might down regulate endogenous production of sphingosine-1-phosphate. Inhibition of excessive sphingosine-1-phosphate release protects against endothelial injury and suppresses a vicious cycle of inflammatory reactions.

We aimed to investigate the frequency and the impact on clinical outcome of PE elevation and acute pancreatitis in such patients. METHODS Clinical data, laboratory tests, and cross-sectional images were analyzed from COVID-19 patients admitted to the Tor Vergata Hospital in Rome. Variables associated with PE abnormalities, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death were investigated through univariate and multivariate analyses and Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS Pancreatic enzymes were available in 254 of 282 COVID-19 patients. Among these, 66 patients (26%) showed mild elevation of PE, and 11 patients (4.3%) had severe elevation (>3 times of the upper limit of normal). Overall, 2 patients met the diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis. Hepatic and renal involvements were associated with PE elevation. Multivariate analysis showed that mild and severe PE elevations were significantly associated with ICU admission (odds ratios, 5.51 [95% confidence interval, 2.36-12.89; P < 0.0001] and 26.2 [95% confidence interval, 4.82-142.39; P < 0.0001]).

Seven complexityinformed principles previously published in this Journal are applied to formulate recommendations to improve the design and implementation of metrics. (1) Acknowledge unpredictability. When designing a metric, policy-makers need to leave room for flexibility to account for unforeseen situations. When implementing a metric, they need to promote sense-making of relevant stakeholders. (2) Sense-making shall be encouraged because it is a social process to understand a metric, align values and develop a coherent strategy. Sense-making is important to (3) cope with self-organised gaming behaviours and to (4) facilitate interdependencies between ED and other departments as well as organisations. (5) We also need to attend to the relationship between senior management and frontline staff. Additionally, to address one of the methodological weaknesses in Tenbensel and colleagues' study, (6) adaptive research approach is needed to better answer emerging questions. (7) Conflict should be harnessed productively. I hope these recommendations could limit gaming in future metrics and encourage stakeholders to view inevitable gaming as an improvement opportunity.","Chen, Junqiao",International journal of health policy and management,205,1

The aim of this study was to identify changes in suicide counts after their deaths. METHODS Suicide data were obtained from the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public-use mortality file. A time-series analysis was performed, examining monthly suicide data by age group (⩽19, 20-44, 45-64 and ⩾65 years), for both men and women, for all suicide methods and for hanging versus non-hanging methods, from January 1999 to December 2018. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving-average models were fitted to the pre-June 2018 period, estimating suicides in subsequent months and identifying deviations from expected values. The volume of Twitter posts about Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain was used as a proxy of societal attention. RESULTS Tweets about the celebrities were mainly concentrated in June 2018 and faded quickly in July. Total suicides exceeded the 95% confidence interval for June and approximated the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval in July. Over this 2-month span, there were 418 (95% confidence interval = [184, 652]) more suicides than expected, including 275 (95% confidence interval = [79, 471]) excess suicides in men and 182 (95% confidence interval = [93, 271]) in women. These equate to 4.8%, 4.1% and 9.1% increases above expected counts. There were 392 (95% confidence interval = [271, 514]) excess suicides by hanging, a 14.5% increase, with no significant increase in all other methods combined. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE These findings demonstrate that mortality following celebrity suicides can occur at a similar magnitude to that observed for other public health emergencies. They underscore the urgency for interventions to mitigate imitation effects after celebrity suicide reporting.","Sinyor, Mark; Tran, Ulrich S; Garcia, David; Till, Benedikt; Voracek, Martin; Niederkrotenthaler, Thomas",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,205,1

As intravenous administration burdens patients, orally administered treatments are needed. This phase 1, open-label, single-dose crossover study in 42 healthy adults evaluated bioequivalence of a 105-mg edaravone oral suspension and intravenous edaravone (60 mg/60 min). The evaluation was whether the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ratio of the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point and to infinity of unchanged edaravone were between the bioequivalence limit of 0.80 and 1.25. Metabolic profiles and elimination pathways were also compared between the 2 routes. Geometric mean ratios and 90%CIs of area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point and to infinity for unchanged edaravone satisfied bioequivalence limits. The geometric mean ratio and its lower limit of 90%CI of Cmax of the 105-mg oral suspension compared with 60-mg intravenous formulations for unchanged edaravone fell within bioequivalence limits. Both formulations showed triphasic plasma concentration-time profiles of unchanged edaravone after reaching Cmax . Plasma concentrations of edaravone inactive metabolites after oral administration were higher than with intravenous administration. Edaravone in both routes underwent urinary excretion, mainly as the glucuronide conjugate and, to a lesser extent, as the sulfate conjugate. Urinary excretion of unchanged edaravone was low, and urinary relative composition ratios of unchanged edaravone and metabolites were similar for both formulations. These findings showed equivalent exposure of the 105-mg oral suspension of edaravone to the 60-mg intravenous formulation, supporting further investigation of the oral suspension for treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.","Shimizu, Hidetoshi; Nishimura, Yukiko; Shiide, Youichi; Yoshida, Kaori; Hirai, Manabu; Matsuda, Munetomo; Nakamaru, Yoshinobu; Kato, Yuichiro; Kondo, Kazuoki",Clinical pharmacology in drug development,205,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients treated with robotic assisted partial nephrectomy across the 4 participating institutions. Demographic, blood loss, warm ischemia time, and intraoperative and postoperative complication data were collected. All complications were graded according to the Clavien classification system. RESULTS A total of 450 consecutive robotic assisted partial nephrectomies were done between June 2006 and May 2009. Overall 71 patients (15.8%) had a complication, including intraoperative and postoperative complications in 8 (1.8%) and 65 (14.4%), respectively. Hemorrhage developed in 2 patients (0.2%) intraoperatively and in 22 (4.9%) postoperatively. Seven patients (1.6%) had urine leakage. As classified by the Clavien system, complications were grade I-II in 76.1% of cases and grade III-IV in 23.9%. Robotic assisted partial nephrectomy was converted to open or conventional laparoscopic surgery in 3 patients (0.7%) and to radical nephrectomy in 7 (1.6%). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS Current data indicate that robotic assisted partial nephrectomy is safe. Most postoperative complications are Clavien grade I or II, or can be managed conservatively.","Spana, Gregory; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Dulabon, Lori M; Petros, Firas; Rogers, Craig G; Bhayani, Sam B; Stifelman, Michael D; Kaouk, Jihad H",The Journal of urology,205,2

While adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) has traditionally been managed via an open approach, appropriately selected patients may benefit from laparoscopy. The objective of our study was to compare short-term postoperative outcomes in patients with adhesive SBO treated with laparotomy versus laparoscopy. METHODS Using the ACS NSQIP participant use files (2005-10), patients with a postoperative diagnosis of adhesive SBO were selected for inclusion in this study. Patients with bowel resections or concomitant procedures were excluded. Both univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were performed to compare 30-day outcomes in the open and laparoscopic groups. RESULTS A total of 4,616 patients with adhesive SBO were identified: 3,697 (80.1%) and 919 (19.3%) in the open and laparoscopic groups, respectively. Mean operative time was similar in both groups. The mortality and overall complications were 84 (2.3%) and 819 (22.2%), respectively, in the open group compared to 7 (0.8%) and 81 (8.8%) in the laparoscopic group, with respective unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 0.33 (0.13-0.71, P < 0.01) and 0.39 (0.30-0.49, P < 0.01). The adjusted OR for overall complications was 0.46 (0.37-0.59, P < 0.01) favouring the laparoscopic group.

In this article, direct evidence from studies of COVID-19, and indirect evidence from studies of infections caused by other coronaviruses (eg SARS, MERS) and of the ICU experience are explored to identify the potential course of recovery and areas where nurses can help. Most people will have an uncomplicated recovery. However, it appears that a more complicated recovery is likely to be associated with severe disease.

Good functional outcome was defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2. RESULTS Seventy-four patients fulfilled our study criteria. The full-scale inter-rater agreement for CT-ASPECTS and DWI-ASPECTS was 0.579 and 0.867, respectively. DWI-ASPECTS correlated with functional outcome (P=0.004), whereas CT-ASPECTS did not (P=0.534). Both DWI-ASPECTS and CT-ASPECTS correlated with DWI volume. The receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that DWI-ASPECTS outperformed both CT-ASPECTS and the time interval between symptom onset and start of the procedure for predicting good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, ≤2) and DWI volume ≥70 mL. CONCLUSION Inter-rater agreement for DWI-ASPECTS was superior to that for CT-ASPECTS. DWI-ASPECTS outperformed NCCT ASPECTS for predicting functional outcome at 90 days.","McTaggart, Ryan A; Jovin, Tudor G; Lansberg, Maarten G; Mlynash, Michael; Jayaraman, Mahesh V; Choudhri, Omar A; Inoue, Manabu; Marks, Michael P; Albers, Gregory W",Stroke,205,7

METHODS Data of patients with rectal malignancies diagnosed in the Netherlands between 1989 and 2018 were retrieved from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and grouped according to the RARECARE cancer list. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated using the European Standard Rate. The Joinpoint Regression Program was used for analysing trends and joinpoints and for the estimation of annual percentage changes (APCs). Patient characteristics, treatment details and relative survival (RS) were reported for different histological types of rectal malignancies and compared between different time periods. RS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. RESULTS A total of 88,299 cases of rectal malignancies were included of which 2125 (2.5%) were categorised as rare histological subtypes. The incidence of rectal neuro-endocrine tumours (NET) (APC: 6.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.4%; 7.1%), rectal sarcoma (APC: 5.8%, 95% CI: 2.9%; 8.7%) and rectal adenocarcinoma (APC 1.0%, 95% CI: 0.26%; 1.8%) increased. Prognosis was best in patients with rectal NET (5-year RS: 72.4%, 95% CI: 70.1%; 74.7%) and worst in patients with rectal melanoma (5-year RS: 8.9%, 95% CI: 5.1%; 15.7%). RS has improved in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, rectal sarcoma and rectal lymphoma in 2008-2018 (p-values p < 0.001, p = 0.023 and p = 0.029). CONCLUSION Significant increases in incidence were observed for different types of rectal malignancies. Differences in incidence, treatment and survival found in this study could be useful to make clinicians aware of specific diseases.","van Rees, Jan M; Elferink, Marloes A G; Tanis, Pieter J; de Wilt, Johannes H W; Burger, Jacobus W A; Verhoef, Cornelis",European journal of cancer,205,31

In recent decades a plethora of studies have provided new data highlighting the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and atherothrombosis in two-way interactions with various cardiovascular risk factors and further influencing these dynamic processes. The concept of targeting residual inflammatory risk among individuals with ischemic heart disease (IHD) is therefore gaining increasing attention. Recently, several landmark randomized controlled trials have assessed different pharmacological approaches that may mitigate this residual risk. The results of some of these studies, such as CANTOS with canakinumab and COLCOT and LoDoCo2 with colchicine, are promising and have provided data to support this concept. Moreover, though several aspects remain to be clarified, these trials have shown the potential of modulating inflammation as a new target to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in secondary prevention patients. In the present review, we aim to present a pragmatic overview of the complex interplay between inflammation and IHD, and to critically appraise the current evidence on this issue while presenting future perspectives on this topic of pivotal contemporary interest.","Vilela, Eduardo M; Fontes-Carvalho, Ricardo",Revista portuguesa de cardiologia : orgao oficial da Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia = Portuguese journal of cardiology : an official journal of the Portuguese Society of Cardiology,205,1

New challenge of EORTC and JCOG.,11.14973,5.3657475,2017,"ICU patients typically are given large amounts of fluid and often develop oedema. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the oedema would change inter-electrode resistance and, thus, require a different approach to using non-invasive electrical stimulation of nerves to assess muscle force. Inter-electrode tissue resistance in the lower leg was measured by applying a 300 µs constant current pulse and measuring the current through and voltage across the stimulating electrodes. The protocol was administered to nine ICU patients with oedema, eight surgical patients without oedema and eight healthy controls. No significant difference in inter-electrode resistance was found between the three groups. For all groups, resistance decreased as stimulation current increased. In conclusion, inter-electrode resistance in ICU patients with severe oedema is the same as the resistance in regular surgical patients and healthy controls. This means that non-invasive nerve stimulation devices do not need to be designed to accommodate different resistances when used with oedema patients; however, surface stimulation does require higher current levels with oedema patients because of the increased distance between the skin surface and the targeted nerve or muscle.","Durfee, William K; Young, Joseph R; Ginz, Hans F",Journal of medical engineering & technology,205,12

The relationships of this preclinical finding with retinal thickness or reduced parafoveal vessel density have not been established. This study investigated the relationships of ganglion cell layer thickness with retinal thickness and parafoveal vessel density in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS This was an observational, cross-sectional, prospective study that used optical coherence tomography angiography to compare non-diabetic patients (group 1) with diabetic patients without retinopathy (group 2). Ganglion cell layer thickness, macular thickness, and parafoveal vessel density (central, inner, and complete) medians were compared between groups (Mann-Whitney U test), and their relationships were assessed in each group (Spearman Rho test). RESULTS In total, 68 eyes were included in this study: 34 in group 1 and 34 in group 2. Ganglion cell layer thickness did not differ between groups in any sector. There were strong positive correlations between fields 2 (superior parafoveal), 3 (temporal parafoveal), and 4 (inferior parafoveal) of the optical coherence tomography macular thickness map and the ganglion cell layer thickness in all sectors in both groups. Central vessel density mean was lower in diabetic patients. In group 1 alone, thickness changes in the inferior and nasal inferior ganglion cell layer sectors were partially explained by inner vessel density (r2=0.32 and r2=0.27). CONCLUSIONS Mean ganglion cell layer thickness was not lower in diabetic patients without retinopathy than in non-diabetic patients. Moreover, it exhibited a substantial correlation with total macular thickness. Parafoveal vessel density decreased before ganglion cell layer thinning was observed.","Somilleda-Ventura, Selma A; Blanco-Hernández, Dulce M Razo; Ocampo-Moreno, Itzel; Lima-Gómez, Virgilio",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,205,5

In this prespecified analysis, we aimed to investigate the relationship between risk factor control during follow-up and outcome of patients in the medical arm of SAMMPRIS. METHODS Data from SAMMPRIS participants in the medical arm (n = 227) were analyzed. Risk factors were recorded at baseline, 30 days, 4 months, and then every 4 months for a mean follow-up of 32 months. For each patient, values for all risk factor measures were averaged and dichotomized as in or out of target. RESULTS Participants who were out of target for systolic blood pressure and physical activity, as well as those with higher mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein, were more likely to have a recurrent vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death) at 3 years compared to those who had good risk factor control. In the multivariable analysis, greater physical activity decreased the likelihood of a recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, or vascular death (odds ratio 0.6, confidence interval 0.4-0.8). CONCLUSIONS Raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and physical inactivity should be aggressively treated in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis to prevent future vascular events. Physical activity, which has not received attention in stroke prevention trials, was the strongest predictor of a good outcome in the medical arm in SAMMPRIS.

However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure. We verify theoretical compatibility through a meta-analysis of a state-of-the-art bibliographic database on energy policy, narratives and computational social science. Furthermore, we establish a proof-of-concept using a narrative-based case study on energy externalities in slum rehabilitation housing in Mumbai, India. We find that the nested application contributes to the literature gap on the need for multidisciplinary methodologies that can systematically include qualitative evidence into policymaking.","Debnath, Ramit; Darby, Sarah; Bardhan, Ronita; Mohaddes, Kamiar; Sunikka-Blank, Minna",Energy research & social science,205,1

Global rates of PTB continue to increase from 9.8 to 10.6% over a 15-year period from 2000 to 2014. Vaginal progesterone is commonly used by clinicians as a prevention strategy, with recent evidence affirming the benefit of vaginal (micronised) progesterone to prevent PTB in women with a shortened cervix (< 25 mm). Given the low incidence of a short cervix at mid-gestation in high-risk populations further evidence is required. The objective of this review is to determine if vaginal progesterone reduces spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) before 37 weeks in asymptomatic high-risk women with a singleton pregnancy with a normal mid-gestation cervical length. METHODS Studies will be sourced from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Register of Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception onwards with the search terms 'progesterone' and 'preterm birth'. Studies will be screened and included if they assess vaginal progesterone compared to placebo in women with a normal cervical length. The primary outcome will be sPTB < 37 weeks, with secondary outcomes of sPTB < 34 weeks. Two independent reviewers will conduct study screening at abstract and full text level, data extraction and risk of bias assessment with disagreements resolved by an experienced researcher. The Mantel-Haenszel statistical method and random effects analysis model will be used to produce treatment effect odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. DISCUSSION This review will assess the current body of evidence and provide clarity regarding the potential benefits and best practice of use of vaginal progesterone in asymptomatic women with high-risk singleton pregnancies and normal cervical length.

Implementation of social isolation and distancing measures to stop the spread of the disease and to reduce potential harm to patients has necessitated the use of alternate models of health-care delivery. Changes that would normally take months or years have occurred within days to weeks. METHODS We conducted analysis of outpatient clinic data during the period of the pandemic and compared this to previous telehealth use. We also present the results of clinician and patient telehealth experience surveys. RESULTS We describe a 2255% increase in the use of telehealth at a tertiary hospital within a period of six weeks, and a significant simultaneous reduction in the outpatient clinic failure-to-attend rate. The vast majority of patients and clinicians agreed that the standard of care provided by telehealth was the same as that provided by on-site appointments. DISCUSSION Telehealth that previously had only limited utilisation has now become a main method for the delivery of outpatient care. Clinicians and patients agreed that consultations provided by telehealth were of the same standard as those provided on site. Health care in the post-pandemic period should embed the use of telehealth for outpatient care and consider the range of other clinical contexts where this can be utilised.","Schulz, Thomas; Long, Karrie; Kanhutu, Kudzai; Bayrak, Ilana; Johnson, Douglas; Fazio, Timothy",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,205,8

Faced with increasing illness burden and costs, healthcare systems are currently working towards integrated care to streamline these interactions and improve efficiency. To support this, one promising resource is the information on routine care delivery stored in various electronic healthcare databases (EHD). In chronic conditions, care delivery pathways (CDPs) can be constructed by linking multiple data sources and extracting time-stamped healthcare utilisation events and other medical data related to individual or groups of patients over specific time periods; CDPs may provide insights into current practice and ways of improving it. Several methods have been proposed in recent years to quantify and visualise CDPs. We present the protocol for a systematic review aiming to describe the content and development of CDP methods, to derive common recommendations for CDP construction. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols. A literature search will be performed in PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, IEEE, CINAHL and EMBASE, without date restrictions, to review published papers reporting data-driven chronic CDPs quantification and visualisation methods. We will describe them using several characteristics relevant for EHD use in long-term care, grouped into three domains: (1) clinical (what clinical information does the method use and how was it considered relevant?), (2) data science (what are the method's development and implementation characteristics?) and (3) behavioural (which behaviours and interactions does the method aim to promote among users and how?). Data extraction will be performed via deductive content analysis using previously defined characteristics and accompanied by an inductive analysis to identify and code additional relevant features. Results will be presented in descriptive format and used to compare current CDPs and generate recommendations for future CDP development initiatives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Database searches will be initiated in May 2019. The review is expected to be completed by February 2020. Ethical approval is not required for this review. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

This monocarboxypeptidase, best known for its ability to metabolize angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang 1-7, counteracts the adverse effects of Ang II mediated by the AT1 Ang II receptor. Ang peptides are classically considered to be metabolized by aminopeptidases, by which the nomenclature Ang III (des-Asp1Ang II, 2-8 heptapeptide) and Ang IV (des-Asp1des-Arg2Ang II, 3-8 hexapeptide) are derived. This report compares the ability of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) to metabolize Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, (4-8 pentapeptide) relative to Ang II to form corresponding des-omega-Phe metabolites. rhACE2 has highest affinity (lowest Km) for Ang III, followed by Ang II ∼ Ang V, followed by Ang IV. However, rhACE2 has the highest Kcat for metabolising Ang IV followed by Ang V, Ang III and Ang II. The enzymatic efficiency (Kcat/Km) is highest for Ang V and Ang III followed by Ang IV and is lowest for Ang II. As a gluzincin metallopeptidase, ACE2 requires a zinc molecule at its active site for catalysis. This report also documents inhibition of ACE2 activity by concentrations of zinc exceeding 10 µM. These observations extend the functional significance of ACE2 to include the metabolic inactivation of Ang III, Ang IV and Ang V, reemphasizing the importance of monitoring zinc intake to maintain metabolic homeostasis.","Polak, Yasmin; Speth, Robert C",Peptides,205,1

Little evidence exists on which interventions are effective at preventing ulceration. Participants who are adherent to self-care behaviours have significantly better outcomes. Motivational interviewing is an intervention that has been used successfully for conditions where adherence is important, such as reduction of obesity and HbA1c levels. A systematic review was conducted to determine whether motivational interviewing is effective at improving adherence for the prevention of Diabetic Foot Ulceration. Electronic searches were run without date or language restrictions in MEDLINE (viaEBSCOhost), CINAHL (viaEBSCOhost), ProQuest (Health and Medical Collection, Nursing and Allied Health Database, PsycINFO, Psychology, PsychArticles), AMED, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science Core Collections. Papers were included if participants had or were at risk of diabetic foot ulceration. Studies required motivational interviewing or a motivational approach as the sole intervention or as a component. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies were included if ulceration and/or at least one behavioural outcome was measured before and after the intervention. Five studies met the inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity prevented the pooling of data. One study used motivational interviewing as the sole intervention. This study found a short-term positive effect on footwear adherence. The remaining four studies had a motivational component within their interventions. Two of these studies showed the intervention to be effective but both were at a high risk of bias. This review demonstrates an evidence gap.

However, the contribution of σ1s to these effects in an otherwise isogenic viral background has not been defined. To evaluate the role of σ1s in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we used reverse genetics to generate a σ1s-null reovirus. Following infection with wild-type virus, we observed an increase in the percentage of cells in G2/M, whereas the proportion of cells in G2/M following infection with the σ1s-null mutant was unaffected. Similarly, we found that the wild-type virus induced substantially greater levels of apoptosis than the σ1s-null mutant. These data indicate that σ1s is required for both reovirus-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To define sequences in σ1s that mediate these effects, we engineered viruses encoding C-terminal σ1s truncations by introducing stop codons in the σ1s open reading frame. We also generated viruses in which charged residues near the σ1s amino terminus were replaced individually or as a cluster with nonpolar residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that amino acids 1 to 59 and the amino-terminal basic cluster are required for induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Remarkably, viruses that fail to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis also are attenuated in vivo. Thus, identical sequences in σ1s are required for reovirus-induced cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that the σ1s-mediated properties are genetically linked and suggest that these effects are mechanistically related.","Boehme, Karl W; Hammer, Katharina; Tollefson, William C; Konopka-Anstadt, Jennifer L; Kobayashi, Takeshi; Dermody, Terence S",Journal of virology,205,16

Although, several studies have been conducted for better understanding of these viruses` evolution, and designing the effective anti-viral drugs and vaccines, the impact of human beings on occurrence of zoonotic diseases has been less considered and discussed. Improvement in global health resulted in human population growth, increasing demand for animal proteins, more exposures to wildlife, zoonotic and degradation of environment, which have facilitated interspecies transmissions. Since world population is increasing proportionately, the protection of public health against zoonotic diseases is a challenging task. It seems that intensified revision of human lifestyle is the best strategy to prevent the potential devastating future zoonotic pandemics. Herein, the characteristics of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, their transmission routs, their pathogenicity, the therapeutic and prevention approaches including of attempts for designing of effective prophylactic vaccines, anti-viral drugs, and the animal models that have been used for these studies have been reviewed (Ref. 134).

Difficulties exist in cryopreservation of the relatively large ovarian tissue mass. This study evaluates whether a human postmenopausal ovary can be used, as a complement to animal models, in studies of this research field. METHODS Postmenopausal human ovaries (n = 10) were isolated and flushed through ovarian arteries with either the cryoprotectant dimethylsulphoxide or Ringer-Acetate, followed by slow freezing. After thawing, production of androgens during in vitro perfusion and morphology (light/electron microscopy) were assessed. RESULTS The dimethylsulphoxide-cryopreserved ovaries showed larger secretion of androgens during perfusion than Ringer Acetate-cryopreserved ovaries. Light microscopy showed well preserved morphology in both groups. Electron microscopy revealed normal appearance of stroma and vessels in the dimethylsulphoxide group. CONCLUSIONS The study demonstrates the potential to use the postmenopausal human ovary for further studies aiming at optimizing cryopreservation protocols, with special reference to ovarian vascularity and stroma.","Milenkovic, Milan; Gharemani, Manda; Bergh, Anette; Wallin, Ann; Mölne, Johan; Fazlagic, Elvedin; Eliassen, Eirik; Kahn, Jarl; Brännström, Mats",Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,205,31

These limitations include the low concentrations and variability of pollutants and mass-transfer problems caused by pollutant hydrophobicity. A new latex-based biocoating was herein optimized for the abatement of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) toluene, trichloroethylene, n-hexane, and α-pinene using acclimated activated sludge dominated by members of the phylum Patescibacteria. The influence of the water content, the presence of water absorbing compounds, the latex pretreatment, the biomass concentration, and the pollutant load was tested on VOC removal efficiency (RE) by varying the formulation of the mixtures. Overall, hexane and trichloroethylene removal was low (<30%), while high REs (>90%) were consistently recorded for toluene and pinene. The assays demonstrated the benefits of operating at high water content in the biocoating, either by including mineral medium or water absorbing compounds in the latex-biomass mixtures. The performance of the latex-based biocoating was likely limited by VOC mass-transfer rather than by biomass concentration in the biocoating. The latex-based biocoating supported a superior toluene and pinene removal than biomass in suspension when VOC loading rate was increased by a factor of 4.","González-Martín, Javier; Cantera, Sara; Lebrero, Raquel; Muñoz, Raúl",Chemosphere,205,16

Large case series have shown improved survival following hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) in patients diagnosed with metastases more than 12 months after index colorectal surgery (metachronous), compared with those with synchronous metastases. This study investigated whether delayed hepatic resection for CRLM affects long-term survival. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing hepatic resection for CRLM in a single centre (1987-2007) were grouped according to the timing of hepatectomy relative to index bowel surgery: less than 12 months (synchronous; group 1), 12-36 months (group 2) and more than 36 months (group 3). Cancer-specific survival was calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS There were 577 patients (48·0 per cent) in group 1, 467 (38·9 per cent) in group 2 and 158 (13·1 per cent) in group 3. The overall 5-year cancer-specific survival rate after liver surgery was 42·3 per cent, with no difference between groups. However, when measured from the time of primary colorectal surgery, group 3 showed a survival advantage at both 5 and 10 years (94·1 and 47·6 per cent respectively) compared with groups 1 (46·3 and 24·9 per cent) and 2 (57·1 and 35·0 per cent) (P = 0·003). Survival graphs showed a steeper negative gradient from 5 to 10 years for group 3 compared with groups 1 and 2 (-0·80 versus - 0·34 and - 0·37), indicating an accelerated mortality rate. CONCLUSION Patients undergoing delayed liver resection for CRLM have a survival advantage that is lost during long-term follow-up.","Swan, P J; Welsh, F K S; Chandrakumaran, K; Rees, M",The British journal of surgery,205,1

The study was performed with NIRO 200NX which employs both the Modified Beer-Lambert (MBL) method to measure total hemoglobin (tHb, expressed in µM), and Spatially Resolved Spectroscopy (SRS) to measure total hemoglobin content (nTHI, expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.)). SRS tends to not be affected by extracranial blood flow. As vasoconstriction with phenylephrine mainly occurs in the extracranial area, we hypothesized that if NIRS measurements are indeed prone to extracranial contamination, tHb will be more affected by the administration of phenylephrine than nTHI. After ethical committee approval, 20 consenting cardiac surgery patients were included. Phenylephrine was administered whenever clinically indicated and its effect on nTHI and tHb was evaluated. To adjust for the difference in raw scale units, Z-scores were calculated. Data were analyzed with Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and the Hodges-Lehmann method. A total of 191 data sets were obtained in 20 patients (10 male, 65 ± 15 years, 77 ± 16 kg, 166 ± 11 cm). The median difference before and after administration of phenylephrine was - 0.006 a.u.

RECENT FINDINGS Rates of pyomyositis have increased recently in the United States, possibly because of an increase in risk factors such as IV drug use, obesity, and diabetes. Other peripheral nervous system infections, such as diphtheria, have become more common in older patients secondary to a lack of revaccination or waning immunity. Although recommended treatment regimens for most infections remain unchanged over recent years, debate over the ideal dosing and route of administration continues for some infections such as tetanus and leprosy (Hansen disease). SUMMARY Infections of the peripheral nervous system are varied in terms of the type of infection, localization, and potential treatment. Nerve conduction studies and EMG can help determine localization, which is key to determining an initial differential diagnosis. It is important to recognize infections quickly to minimize diagnostic delays that could lead to patient morbidity and mortality.","LoRusso, Samantha",Continuum,205,32

METHODS Retrospective cohort study of 186 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 1st-April 15th, 2020 at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. The cohort included 62 patients with autoimmune disease and 124 age- and sex-matched controls. The primary outcome was a composite of intensive care unit admission, intubation, and death, with secondary outcome assessing time to in-hospital death. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications, vital signs, and laboratory values were collected. Conditional logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to assess the association between autoimmune disease and clinical outcomes. RESULTS Patients with autoimmune disease were more likely to have at least one comorbidity (25.8% vs. 12.9%, p=0.03), take chronic immunosuppressive medications (66.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.01), and have had a solid organ transplant (16.1% vs. 1.6%, p<0.01). There were no significant differences in intensive care unit admission (14.2% vs. 19.4%, p=0.44), intubation (14.2% vs. 17.7%, p=0.62) or death (17.5% vs. 14.5%, p=0.77).

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical database of patients presenting to the ED during the national lockdown period (26 March to 30 June 2020). We used the same time interval in the year 2019 as the control period in our analysis. We collected baseline characteristics and outcomes of each patient in the ED. The primary outcome was the incidence rate ratio (IRR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of the average daily ED visits. Secondary outcomes included the IRR with 95% CI of total admissions and ICU admissions. RESULTS The average number of daily ED visits decreased significantly from 89.1 to 57.0 (-36.0%, IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.67-0.70). However, the proportions of 'Resuscitation' and 'Emergency' triage level were increased (29.1% vs. 19.2%, p < 0.001). Total ED admission rate and intensive care unit (ICU) admission rate were also increased (33.5% vs. 28.3%, p < 0.001 and 10.2% vs. 7.5%, p < 0.001, respectively). The IRR for the admission rate was 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.26), and the IRR for the ICU admission rate was 1.35 (95% CI 1.21-1.52). CONCLUSION The national lockdown in Thailand was associated with a significant reduction in average daily ED visits across traumatic and non-traumatic patients.

The purpose of this systematic review is to examine whether proportional modes improved patient-ventilator interaction and whether they had an impact on the weaning success and length of mechanical ventilation, in comparison with PSV. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through May 13, 2018. We included both parallel-group and crossover randomized studies that examined the efficacy of proportional modes in comparison with PSV in mechanically ventilated adults. The primary outcomes were (1) asynchrony index (AI), (2) weaning failure, and (3) duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS We included 15 studies (four evaluated PAV, ten evaluated NAVA, and one evaluated both modes). Although the use of proportional modes was not associated with a reduction in AI (WMD - 1.43; 95% CI - 3.11 to 0.25; p = 0.096; PAV-one study, and NAVA-seven studies), the use of proportional modes was associated with a reduction in patients with AI > 10% (RR 0.15; 95% CI 0.04-0.58; p = 0.006; PAV-two studies, and NAVA-five studies), compared with PSV. There was a significant heterogeneity among studies for AI, especially with NAVA. Compared with PSV, use of proportional modes was associated with a reduction in weaning failure (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.26-0.75; p = 0.003; PAV-three studies) and duration of mechanical ventilation (WMD - 1.78 days; 95% CI - 3.24 to - 0.32; p = 0.017; PAV-three studies, and NAVA-two studies). Reduced duration of mechanical ventilation was found with PAV but not with NAVA. CONCLUSION The use of proportional modes was associated with a reduction in the incidence with AI > 10%, weaning failure and duration of mechanical ventilation, compared with PSV. However, reduced weaning failure and duration of mechanical ventilation were found with only PAV. Due to a significant heterogeneity among studies and an insufficient number of studies, further investigation seems warranted to better understand the impact of proportional modes.

""Engagement"" in health care is often defined as a positive, fulfilling work-related state of mind, which is characterized by vigor, dedication and absorption. The aim of this scoping review is to identify factors associated with, and tools used to measure physician engagement. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature were searched. Supplementary articles were obtained by searching article references. All quantitative and qualitative study designs were eligible that described factors associated with, and tools used to measure, hospital physician engagement. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. Groupings and clustering were conducted to determine dominant groups or cluster of characteristics. Conceptual mapping was then conducted to identify patterns. RESULTS A total of 15 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. All were published between 2012 and 2017. Studies were predominantly conducted in Germany (n=8). Factors associated with physician engagement were synthesized into individual characteristics (n=7), work environment characteristics (n=7), and work outcomes (n=5). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale was the most commonly used tool (n=14). CONCLUSIONS This scoping review provides a strong evidence-based platform to further advance knowledge in the area of physician engagement. The identification of environmental factors assists hospital administrative leaders in understanding how they might intervene to affect engagement, while the identification of individual characteristics enable identification of vulnerable physicians, permitting identification of the most pertinent targeted areas for focus.","Perreira, Tyrone A; Perrier, Laure; Prokopy, Melissa",Medical care,205,1

However, the magnitude of the problem, associated risk factors and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS This article describes the design and methodology of the Swiss Atrial Fibrillation (Swiss-AF) Cohort Study, a prospective multicentre national cohort study of 2400 patients across 13 sites in Switzerland. Eligible patients must have documented AF. Main exclusion criteria are the inability to provide informed consent and the presence of exclusively short episodes of reversible forms of AF. All patients undergo extensive phenotyping and genotyping, including repeated assessment of cognitive functions, quality of life, disability, electrocardiography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. We also collect information on health related costs, and we assemble a large biobank. Key clinical outcomes in Swiss-AF are death, stroke, systemic embolism, bleeding, hospitalisation for heart failure and myocardial infarction. Information on outcomes and updates on other characteristics are being collected during yearly follow-up visits. RESULTS Up to 7 April 2017, we have enrolled 2133 patients into Swiss-AF. With the current recruitment rate of 15 to 20 patients per week, we expect that the target sample size of 2400 patients will be reached by summer 2017. CONCLUSION Swiss-AF is a large national prospective cohort of patients with AF in Switzerland. This study will provide important new information on structural and functional brain damage in patients with AF and on other AF related complications, using a large variety of genetic, phenotypic and health economic parameters.","Conen, David; Rodondi, Nicolas; Mueller, Andreas; Beer, Juerg; Auricchio, Angelo; Ammann, Peter; Hayoz, Daniel; Kobza, Richard; Moschovitis, Giorgio; Shah, Dipen; Schlaepfer, Juerg; Novak, Jan; di Valentino, Marcello; Erne, Paul; Sticherling, Christian; Bonati, Leo; Ehret, Georg; Roten, Laurent; Fischer, Urs; Monsch, Andreas; Stippich, Christoph; Wuerfel, Jens; Schwenkglenks, Matthias; Kuehne, Michael; Osswald, Stefan",Swiss medical weekly,205,12

Therefore, there is a risk of the endoscope or instruments physically damaging body tissues. To overcome this problem, we developed a Ø5-mm, 3-D endoscope using a single 1/10-inch CCD camera and pneumatic vibration mechanism. METHODS The 3-D endoscope proposed in this paper consists of an outer and inner sleeve, a 1/10-inch CCD camera attached to its distal end, and a pneumatic vibration mechanism attached to its proximal end. This endoscope can acquire left and right endoscopic images for stereovision in synchrony with the periodical motion generated by the vibration mechanism. We measured the displacement at the proximal and distal end of the 3-D endoscope simultaneously, and evaluated the feasibility of its use in vivo. RESULTS The displacement at the distal end of the endoscope to which the CCD camera is attached was approximately ±0.25 mm. The timing when the displacement of the CCD camera was at maximal amplitude coincided with the timing when the displacement of its proximal end was at maximal amplitude. In the in vivo experiment, this 3-D endoscope can provide clear 3-D images of the surgical area. CONCLUSIONS The developed 3-D endoscope that uses a single CCD camera and pneumatic vibration mechanism can successfully visualize internal organs inside the body even though the CCD camera is moved by the vibration. Therefore, the risk of damage to fragile body tissues can be significantly decreased.","Kamiuchi, Hiroki; Kuwana, Kenta; Fukuyo, Tsuneo; Yamashita, Hiromasa; Chiba, Toshio; Dohi, Takeyoshi; Masamune, Ken",Surgical endoscopy,205,31

We aimed to determine whether abnormal liver biochemistry, assessed at baseline and at repeat measures over time, was associated with death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19, in a United Kingdom population. We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom, matching 585 hospitalized patients who were SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive to 1,165 hospitalized patients who were RT-PCR negative for age, sex, ethnicity, and preexisting comorbidities. A total of 26.8% (157/585) of patients with COVID-19 died compared to 11.9% (139/1,165) in the group without COVID-19 (P < 0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the group with COVID-19 had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.004) and hypoalbuminemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, P < 0.001) compared to the group without COVID-19. Within the group with COVID-19, those with hypoalbuminemia at presentation had 1.83-fold increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.67), while the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged ≥75 years (adjusted HR, 3.96; 95% CI, 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with preexisting liver disease (adjusted HR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.58-7.16). In the group with COVID-19, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased (R = 0.192, P < 0.0001) and albumin declined (R = -0.123, P = 0.0004) over time in patients who died. Conclusion: In this United Kingdom population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with COVID-19. Baseline hypoalbuminemia and rising ALP over time could be prognostic markers for death, but investigation of larger cohorts is required to develop a better understanding of the relationship between liver biochemistry and disease outcome.","Wang, Tingyan; Smith, David A; Campbell, Cori; Harris, Steve; Salih, Hizni; Várnai, Kinga A; Woods, Kerrie; Noble, Theresa; Freeman, Oliver; Moysova, Zuzana; Marjot, Thomas; Webb, Gwilym J; Davies, Jim; Barnes, Eleanor; Matthews, Philippa C",Hepatology communications,205,23

METHODS Epidemiological investigations, patients' measles serology, and phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin (H) and nucleoprotein (N) genes of measles virus isolates were conducted. RESULTS In total, 29 HKIA staff of diverse ranks and working locations were infected with measles within 1 month. Significantly fewer affected staff had history of travel than non-HKIA-related measles patients [10 of 29 (34.5%) vs 28 of 35 (80%); P < .01]. Of 9 airport staff who could recall detailed exposure history, 6 (66.7%) had visited self-service food premises at HKIA during the incubation period, where food trays, as observed during the epidemiological field investigation, were not washed after use. Furthermore, 1 airport baggage handler who was admitted to hospital A before rash onset infected 2 healthcare workers (HCWs) known to have 2 doses of MMR vaccination with positive measles IgG and lower viral loads in respiratory specimens. Infections in these 2 HCWs warranted contact tracing of another 168 persons (97 patients and 71 HCWs). Phylogenetic comparison of H and N gene sequences confirmed the clonality of outbreak strains. CONCLUSION Despite good herd immunity with overall seroprevalence of >95% against measles, major outbreaks of measles occurred among HKIA staff having daily contact with many international pssengers. Lessons from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and measles outbreaks suggested that an airport can be a strategic epidemic center. Pre-exanthem transmission of measles from airport staff to HCWs with secondary vaccine failure poses a grave challenge to hospital infection control.","Cheng, Vincent C C; Wong, Shuk-Ching; Wong, Sally C Y; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chen, Jonathan H K; Yip, Cyril C Y; Hung, Derek L L; Li, Xin; Chuang, Vivien W M; Tsang, Owen T Y; Woo, Gibson K S; Chuang, Shuk-Kwan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,205,17

There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation. These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well. In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.","Balachandar, V; Mahalaxmi, I; Kaavya, J; Vivekanandhan, G; Ajithkumar, S; Arul, N; Singaravelu, G; Senthil Kumar, N; Mohana Dev, S",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,205,29

The age-related prevalence of PD, combined with increased vulnerability due to age-related comorbidities, makes PD patients protection a priority. Methodology: We reviewed potentials and limitations of teleneurology in PD and suggested a specific battery of tests, including patient-reported outcomes, smartphone applications, and neurological examination through telemedicine. Conclusions: These tools can provide full neurological consultations, with the engagement of both patients and caregivers, and can support clinicians in defining whether patients need to access diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Telemedicine will also carry a value in the future, within conventional health care, to support clinicians in decision making, enabling more efficacious follow-up, reducing burden for caregivers, and delivering neurological expertise to local realities. These advantages are very important when there is physical distance between patients and neurologists, and when patients are not recommended to attend in-person consultations.","Miele, Giuseppina; Straccia, Giulia; Moccia, Marcello; Leocani, Letizia; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Bonavita, Simona; Lavorgna, Luigi",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,205,1

Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective long-term treatment for obesity. In addition to weight loss, bariatric surgery produces additional health benefits such as remission of type 2 diabetes, remission of hypertension, and decreased risk of developing certain types of cancer. The mechanisms beyond weight loss for these benefits remain incompletely defined. Therefore, animal models of bariatric surgery are being developed and validated to identify the mechanisms leading to these benefits, with the goal of improving understanding of gastrointestinal physiology and identifying new therapeutic targets. VSG has become the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in the clinic in the United States because it is highly effective at producing weight loss and metabolic improvement, and is simpler to perform than other bariatric procedures. Therefore, we have developed and validated a murine model of VSG. This murine VSG model recapitulates many of the effects of VSG seen in humans, including improved glucose and blood pressure regulation. The method is based on isolation of the stomach, ligation of gastric vessels, and removal of 70% of the stomach by transecting along the greater curvature of the stomach. We have successfully applied this surgical protocol to various genetically modified mouse lines to define the mechanistic contributors to the benefits of VSG. Furthermore, this murine VSG model has been combined with other surgical techniques, to achieve deeper mechanistic insight. Therefore, this is a simple and versatile model for studying gastrointestinal physiology and the health benefits of bariatric surgery.","Garibay, Darline; Cummings, Bethany P",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,205,24

From July 2008 to October 2015, 39 consecutive patients with SHHCC were screened. Of these, 12 were treated with TACE/TAE and repeated RF ablation (TACE/TAE + RF ablation group) and the remaining 27 patients were treated with the aforementioned new strategy (new strategy group). Local tumor progression (LTP)-free survival, intrahepatic distant recurrence (IDR)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed on several clinicopathological variables to identify factors affecting long-term outcome and intrahepatic recurrence. Correlation analysis was also performed. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year LTP-free survival rates and OS rates were significantly higher in the new strategy group than in the TACE/TAE + RF ablation group (82.9% vs 58.3%, 73.9% vs 29.2%, 18.5% vs 9.7%, P = 0.002; 92.0% vs 75.0%, 84.0% vs 33.3%, 32.7% vs 16.7%, P = 0.025). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in the 1-, 2-, and 3-year IDR-free survival rates (P = 0.108). Using univariate analysis, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP > 200 ng/mL), ablative margin (AM > 1.0 cm), and well-differentiated cells were found to be significant factors for predicting LTP, IDR, and OS. Surgical elimination was found to be a significant factor only for predicting OS. In multivariate analyses, AFP (>200 ng/mL), AM (>1.0 cm), and well-differentiated cells were found to be significant independent factors linked to LTP, IDR, and OS. Correlation analysis indicated that AM > 1.0 cm was strongly associated with surgical elimination (P < 0.001, correlation coefficient = 0.877). For patients with SHHCC who were initially excluded from surgery, the new strategy including repeated RF ablation combined with ablated lesion elimination following TACE/TAE should now be considered as an alternative treatment.","Ke, Shan; Gao, Jun; Kong, Jian; Ding, Xue-Mei; Niu, Hai-Gang; Xin, Zong-Hai; Ning, Chun-Min; Guo, Shi-Gang; Li, Xiao-Long; Zhang, Long; Dong, Yong-Hong; Sun, Wen-Bing",Medicine,205,1

Such transfer depends on the coexistence of more recruited (source) liquid-like lung regions together with less recruited (target) solid-like lung regions. Pendelluft may improve gas exchange, but because of tidal recruitment, it may also contribute to injury. We hypothesize that higher positive end-expiratory pressure levels decrease the propensity to pendelluft and that with lower positive end-expiratory pressure levels, pendelluft is associated with improved gas exchange but increased tidal recruitment. DESIGN Crossover design. SETTING University animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS Anesthetized landrace pigs. INTERVENTIONS Surfactant depletion was achieved by saline lavage in anesthetized pigs, and ventilator-induced lung injury was produced by ventilation with high tidal volume and low positive end-expiratory pressure. Ventilation was continued in each of four conditions: positive end-expiratory pressure (low or optimized positive end-expiratory pressure after recruitment) and spontaneous breathing (present or absent). Tidal recruitment was assessed using dynamic CT and regional ventilation/perfusion using electric impedance tomography. Esophageal pressure was measured using an esophageal balloon manometer. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS Among the four conditions, spontaneous breathing at low positive end-expiratory pressure not only caused the largest degree of pendelluft, which was associated with improved ventilation/perfusion matching and oxygenation, but also generated the greatest tidal recruitment. At low positive end-expiratory pressure, paralysis worsened oxygenation but reduced tidal recruitment. Optimized positive end-expiratory pressure decreased the magnitude of spontaneous efforts (measured by esophageal pressure) despite using less sedation, from -5.6 ± 1.3 to -2.0 ± 0.7 cm H2O, while concomitantly reducing pendelluft and tidal recruitment. No pendelluft was observed in the absence of spontaneous effort. CONCLUSIONS Spontaneous effort at low positive end-expiratory pressure improved oxygenation but promoted tidal recruitment associated with pendelluft. Optimized positive end-expiratory pressure (set after lung recruitment) may reverse the harmful effects of spontaneous breathing by reducing inspiratory effort, pendelluft, and tidal recruitment.","Yoshida, Takeshi; Roldan, Rollin; Beraldo, Marcelo A; Torsani, Vinicius; Gomes, Susimeire; De Santis, Roberta R; Costa, Eduardo L V; Tucci, Mauro R; Lima, Raul G; Kavanagh, Brian P; Amato, Marcelo B P",Critical care medicine,205,1

In March of this year, more than 300 Iranians died and 1,000 became ill after consuming methanol in the hope that it would protect them against the novel coronavirus. We review the context and magnitude methanol toxicity, pathophysiology, principal medical issues, and human variability in metabolism. While toxicologists and clinicians may need to be especially attentive to this problem, it is becoming clear that the social and economic underpinnings of the methanol poisoning crisis must be actively and urgently explored and managed as vigorously as its toxicologic and pathophysiologic components.","Pressman, Peter; Clemens, Roger; Sahu, Saura; Hayes, A Wallace",Cutaneous and ocular toxicology,205,16

In the case of coronaviruses, the interaction with surfaces (including the skin surface) is mediated by their large glycoprotein spikes that protrude from (and cover) the viral envelope. Here, we perform all atomic simulations between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and human skin models. We consider an ""oily"" skin covered by sebum and a ""clean"" skin exposing the stratum corneum. The simulations show that the spike tries to maximize the contacts with stratum corneum lipids, particularly ceramides, with substantial hydrogen bonding. In the case of ""oily"" skin, the spike is able to retain its structure, orientation and hydration over sebum with little interaction with sebum components. Comparison of these results with our previous simulations of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike with hydrophilic and hydrophobic solid surfaces, suggests that the ""soft"" or ""hard"" nature of the surface plays an essential role in the interaction of the spike protein with materials.","Domingo, Marc; Faraudo, Jordi",Soft matter,205,20

METHODS The indication for DP-LADG was preoperative clinical Stage IA gastric cancer. We compared 20 patients who underwent DP-LADG with 24 patients of clinical Stage IA patients who underwent C-LADG. RESULTS The mean operation time was significantly longer for DP-LADG (250.5 min) than for C-LADG (197.5 min); however, the mean operation time for the last 5 patients undergoing DP-LADG (209 ± 31.1 min) was almost the same as that for C-LADG. There were no significant differences between DP-LADG and C-LADG in terms of blood loss, number of lymph nodes dissected, rates of conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, and length of postoperative hospital stay.

METHODS Between April 2009 and December 2012, 16 consecutive patients with gastric GISTs underwent SPLGR. The patients undergoing the SPLGR were case-matched for age, sex, body mass index and tumor location with those undergoing MPLGR. The demographic and surgical outcomes were analyzed and compared from the review of a prospectively collected database of 16 patients who underwent MPLGR. RESULTS All 16 patients underwent complete SPLGR without any intraoperative complications. No significant differences were observed in the mean length of the operation (91.4 vs. 94.1 min), blood loss (6.3 vs. 10.1 ml) and length of postoperative hospital stay (4.7 vs. 5.4 days) between the SPLGR and MPLGR groups. The tumor size was similar (37.8 vs. 32.1 mm) and negative surgical margins were achieved in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 27 months, all 16 SPLGR patients were disease-free. CONCLUSIONS Our initial comparison demonstrated that SPLGR, when performed by experienced surgeons, is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with gastric GISTs, resulting in good surgical and oncological outcomes.","Sasaki, Akira; Nitta, Hiroyuki; Otsuka, Koki; Fujiwara, Hisataka; Takahara, Takeshi; Wakabayashi, Go",Surgery today,205,12

This study used a developmental series of dry crania to reconstruct CET and dilator tubae (DT, the muscle opening the CET) morphology. Timing and directionality of CET and upper respiratory tract (URT) growth were investigated. Traditional and 3D geometric morphometrics (GM) were used to assess bony landmarks on the crania. The series was divided using dental eruption into 7 growth stages ranging from before eruption of deciduous dentition (approximately the first 6 postnatal months) to eruption of the first permanent maxillary molar (after approximately 6 years). Bony endpoints of the CET and DT were used to calculate their morphology. GM analysis showed substantial shape differences between newborns, early infants and all later developmental stages. Univariate measures showed the largest growth change between birth and 6 months. Subsequently, CET morphology changed little in the latter half of year 1, instead maturing gradually until approximately 3 years whereas DT relative length and orientation finish growth by the end of year one. Incongruence in slower CET growth and faster DT growth could impact CET function between 6 and 12 months and be a contributing factor of OM. Tubal aeration may improve after this time when both CET and DT morphology mature, coinciding with clinically reported drop-off in ear infections. This article is protected by copyright.

The objective of the study was to determine the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and ct-free survival (CFS) of pulmonary thermal ablation (TA) and its place in the treatment of mCRC. PATIENTS AND METHODS All consecutive patients treated (over 11 years) with percutaneous TA for lung metastasis of colorectal origin were reviewed. All sequences of treatments were considered. We determined the OS, DFS and CFS of pulmonary TA. RESULTS Two hundred and nine patients underwent 323 TA procedures for 630 lung metastases. Majority of the metastases (71.5%) were unilateral with a median diameter of 10 mm (2-46). A single metastasis was treated in 95 patients (45.5%), and 2-8 in 114 patients (54.5%). One hundred and thirty-two patients (63.2%) had only a single procedure, 77 patients (36.8%) had 2-5 procedures. Following the first TA (n = 209), 125 patients (59.8%) resumed ct. Sixty-four out of the 126 patients presenting lung progression were treated again with TA. The median CFS was 12.2 months (95% CI: 10.3-17.7). Patients with no extra-pulmonary metastases showed a statistically better CFS than those who had extra-pulmonary metastases with a median of 20.9 and 9.2 months, respectively (p < 0.001). Median follow-up and OS were 50 and 67.6 months, respectively. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates, for the first time, that TA enables a CFS of 12.2 months that extended to 20.9 months in patients who presented with lung-only metastases.

Advances in the development of wild-type, recombinant MVs which express fluorescent proteins making infected cells readily detectable in living tissues and animals, has also increased our understanding of this important and highly transmissible human disease. Thus, it is timely to review how these advances have provided new insights into MV infection of immune, epithelial and neural cells. This demands access to primate samples that help us understand the early and acute stages of the disease, which are challenging to dissect due to the mild/self-limiting nature of the infection. It also requires well-characterized and rather rare human tissue samples from patients who succumb to neurological sequelae to help study the consequences of the long-term persistence of this RNA virus in vivo. Collectively, these studies have provided unique insights into how the use of two cellular receptors, CD150 and PVRL4, governs the in vivo tissue-specific temporal patterns of virus spread and resulting pathological lesions. Analysis of tissue samples has also demonstrated the importance of differing mechanisms of virus cell-to-cell spread within lymphoid, epithelial and neural tissues in the dissemination of MV during acute and long-term persistent infections. Given the incentive to eradicate MV globally, and the inevitable question as to whether or not vaccination should cease in light of the existence of closely related morbilliviruses, a thorough understanding of measles pathological lesions is essential.","Ludlow, Martin; McQuaid, Stephen; Milner, Dan; de Swart, Rik L; Duprex, W Paul",The Journal of pathology,205,1

Improved knowledge about the risks is needed to identify opportunities to prevent work-related infectious diseases. The objective of the current study was to provide an updated overview of the published evidence on the exposure to pathogens among non-healthcare workers. Because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, we also aimed to gain more evidence about exposure to several respiratory tract pathogens. METHODS Eligible studies were identified in MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane between 2009 and 8 December 2020. The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019107265). An additional quality assessment was applied according to the Equator network guidelines. RESULTS The systematic literature search yielded 4620 papers of which 270 met the selection and quality criteria. Infectious disease risks were described in 37 occupational groups; 18 of them were not mentioned before. Armed forces (n=36 pathogens), livestock farm labourers (n=31), livestock/dairy producers (n=26), abattoir workers (n=22); animal carers and forestry workers (both n=16) seemed to have the highest risk. In total, 111 pathogen exposures were found. Many of these occupational groups (81.1%) were exposed to respiratory tract pathogens. CONCLUSION Many of these respiratory tract pathogens were readily transmitted where employees congregate (workplace risk factors), while worker risk factors seemed to be of increasing importance. By analysing existing knowledge of these risk factors, identifying new risks and susceptible risk groups, this review aimed to raise awareness of the issue and provide reliable information to establish more effective preventive measures.","Acke, Sofie; Couvreur, Simon; Bramer, Wichor M; Schmickler, Marie-Noëlle; De Schryver, Antoon; Haagsma, Juanita A",Occupational and environmental medicine,205,1

We hypothesized that there is significant variability in anesthesia staffing and anesthetic techniques. METHODS We conducted an online survey of anesthesiology directors at every FTC within the North American Fetal Therapy Network (NAFTNet). The survey included details of fetal interventions performed in 2018, anesthesia staffing models, anesthetic techniques, fetal monitoring, and postoperative management. RESULTS There was a 92% response rate. Most FTCs are located within an adult hospital and employ a small team of anesthesiologists. There is heterogeneity when evaluating anesthesiology fellowship training and staffing, indicating there is a multidisciplinary specialty team-based approach even within anesthesiology. Minimally invasive fetal interventions were the most commonly performed. The majority of FTCs also performed ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) and open mid-gestation procedures under general anesthesia (GA). Compared to FTCs only performing minimally invasive procedures, FTCs performing open fetal procedures were more likely to have a pediatric surgeon as director and performed more minimally invasive procedures. CONCLUSIONS There is considerable variability in anesthesia staffing, caseload, and anesthetic techniques among FTCs in NAFTNet. Most FTCs used maternal sedation for minimally invasive procedures and GA for EXIT and open fetal surgeries.","Wood, Cristina L; Zuk, Jeannie; Rollins, Mark D; Silveira, Lori J; Feiner, John R; Zaretsky, Michael; Chatterjee, Debnath",Fetal diagnosis and therapy,205,1

However, there is a lack of fundamental validation work of such three-layer cranial bone models by combining high-fidelity computational modeling and rigorous experiments. Here, non-contact vibration experiments are conducted on an assortment of dry bone segments from the largest cranial bone regions (parietal, frontal, occipital, and temporal) to estimate the first handful of modal frequencies and damping ratios, as well as mode shapes, in the audio frequency regime. Numerical models that consider the cortical tables and the diploë as domains with separate isotropic material properties are constructed for each bone segment using a routine that identifies the cortical table-diploë boundaries from micro-computed tomography scan images, and reconstructs a three-dimensional geometry layer by layer. The material properties for cortical tables and diploë are obtained using a Hounsfield Unit-based mass density calculation combined with a parameter identification scheme for Young's modulus estimation. With the identified parameters, the average error between experimental and numerical modal frequencies is 1.3% and the modal assurance criterion values for most modes are above 0.90, indicating that the layered model is suitable for predicting the vibrational behavior of cranial bone. The proposed layered modeling and identified elastic parameters are also useful to support computational modeling of cranial guided waves and mode conversion in medical ultrasound. Additionally, the diploë elastic properties are rarely reported in the literature, making this work a fundamental characterization effort that can guide in the selection of material properties for human head models that consider layered cranial bone.","Kohtanen, E; Mazzotti, M; Ruzzene, M; Erturk, A",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,205,13

We assessed the impact of the baseline liver function (AST, ALT, and bilirubin) on COVID-19-related outcomes, including on mortality, intensive care unit admission, and non-fatal severe complications. METHODS After a systematic review of the relevant studies, odds ratio, mean difference, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, were calculated for the prediction of relevant COVID-19 outcomes by performing a meta-analysis using fixed and random effects models. A Fagan nomogram was used to assess the clinical utility. Heterogeneity was explored by sensitivity analysis and univariable meta-regression. RESULTS Twenty-six studies were included (22 studies and 5271 patients for AST, 20 studies and 5440 subjects for ALT, and 9 studies and 3542 patients for bilirubin). The outcomes of the studies were: survival (n=8), intensive care unit admission (n=4), and non-fatal severe complications (n=16). AST>ULN (OR 3.10 (95%CI 2.61-3.68)), ALT>ULN (OR 2.15 (95%CI 1.43-3.23)), and bilirubin >ULN (OR 2.78 (95%CI 1.88-4.13)) were associated with an increased prevalence of severe complications, with 78%, 77% and 94% of specificity, respectively. The mean difference between mild and severe COVID-19 was 10.7 U/L (95%CI 5.8-15.6) for AST, 8 U/L (95%CI 1.0-15) for ALT, and 0.3 mg/dL (95%CI 0.16-0.45) for bilirubin. CONCLUSIONS Patients showing liver injury had significantly higher risks of developing severe COVID-19 compared to those with normal liver function tests at admission. We should include the assessment of AST, ALT, and total bilirubin routinely in patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 in order to anticipate those at risk of developing COVID-19-related outcomes.","Ampuero, Javier; Sánchez-Torrijos, Yolanda; García Lozano, María Del Rosario; Maya, Douglas; Romero-Gómez, Manuel",Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva,205,20

Our aim was to assess the effects of antibiotic administration (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin) on the establishment and elimination of intestinal colonization with a CTX-M-15 ESBL and OXA-162 carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST15 (KP5825) in a murine (C57BL/6 male mice) model. Whole genome sequencing of KP5825 strain was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Conjugation assays were carried out by broth mating method. In colonization experiments, 5 × 106 CFU of KP5825 was administered to the animals by orogastric gavage, and antibiotics were administered in their drinking water for two weeks and were changed every day. The gut colonization rates with KP5825 were assessed by cultivation and qPCR. In each of the stool samples, the gene copy number of blaOXA-162 and blaCTX-M-15 were determined by qPCR. Antibiotic concentrations in the stool were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography and a bioanalytical method. The KP5825 contained four different plasmid replicon types, namely IncFII(K), IncL, IncFIB and ColpVC. IncL (containing the blaOXA-162 resistance gene within a Tn1991.2 genetic element) and IncFII(K) (containing the blaCTX-M-15 resistance gene) plasmids were successfully conjugated. During ampicillin and ceftazidime treatments, colonization rate of KP5825 increased, while, ciprofloxacin treatments in both concentrations (0.1 g/L and 0.5 g/L) led to significantly decreased colonization rates. The gene copy number blaOXA-162 correlated with K. pneumoniae in vivo, while a major elevation was observed in the copy number of blaCTX-M-15 from the first day to the fifteenth day in the 0.5 g/L dose ceftazidime treatment group. Our results demonstrate that commonly used antibiotics may have diverse impacts on the colonization rates of intestinally-carried CPE, in addition to affecting the gene copy number of their resistance genes, thus facilitating their stable persistance and dissemination.","Stercz, Balázs; Farkas, Ferenc B; Tóth, Ákos; Gajdács, Márió; Domokos, Judit; Horváth, Viola; Ostorházi, Eszter; Makra, Nóra; Kocsis, Béla; Juhász, János; Ligeti, Balázs; Pongor, Sándor; Szabó, Dóra",Scientific reports,205,1

It is strongly related to work overload and has been a scarcely studied topic in pediatric urology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, authorities' recommendations have led to big changes in pediatric urology practice worldwide. This study aimed to evaluate the level of burnout in Ibero-American pediatric urologists (IPUs) during this pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted by applying an electronic survey during the COVID-19 pandemic peak to members of the two major associations of pediatric urology in Ibero-America (the Ibero-American Society of Pediatric Urology [SIUP] and the Brazilian School of Pediatric Urology [BSPU]) to evaluate demographic, pre-pandemic, and pandemic data. Burnout levels were assessed using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) questionnaire. RESULTS A response rate of 40% was obtained (182 out of 455 IPU respondents). Participants were from 14 different countries in Ibero-America and 75.4% were male. Data showed that during the pandemic there was a significant decrease in weekly workload, that is: > 40 h per week (h/w) (91.4%-44.6%, p < 0.001); and >6 h/w (94.9%-45.1%%, p < 0.001) in operating room time (ORT). Personal (Pe-BO), work-related (W-BO), and patient-related (Pa-BO) burnout levels among IPUs were 26.3%, 22.3%, and 7.4%, respectively (Summary table). An important difference by gender was seen, with women suffering more from the syndrome (odds ratio of 2.67 [95% confidence interval, 1.285.58; p = 0.013] for Pe-BO and OR of 3.26 [95% CI, 1.52-7.01; p = 0.004] for W-BO).

To determine the role of interferons (IFNs) in the ability of bats to coexist with viruses, we sequenced the type I IFN locus of the Australian black flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first gene map of the IFN region of any bat species. Our results reveal a highly contracted type I IFN family consisting of only 10 IFNs, including three functional IFN-α loci. Furthermore, the three IFN-α genes are constitutively expressed in unstimulated bat tissues and cells and their expression is unaffected by viral infection. Constitutively expressed IFN-α results in the induction of a subset of IFN-stimulated genes associated with antiviral activity and resistance to DNA damage, providing evidence for a unique IFN system that may be linked to the ability of bats to coexist with viruses.","Zhou, Peng; Tachedjian, Mary; Wynne, James W; Boyd, Victoria; Cui, Jie; Smith, Ina; Cowled, Christopher; Ng, Justin H J; Mok, Lawrence; Michalski, Wojtek P; Mendenhall, Ian H; Tachedjian, Gilda; Wang, Lin-Fa; Baker, Michelle L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,205,16

The aim of this study was to examine and compare the early development of four Australian AHSCs to explore how they are enacting their impact-focused role. METHODS A descriptive qualitative methodology was employed across four AHSCs located in diverse health system settings in urban and regional locations across Australia. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews with 15 academic, industry and executive board members of participating AHSCs. The analysis combined inductive and deductive elements, with inductive categories mapped to deductive themes corresponding to the study aims. RESULTS AHSCs in Australia are in an emergent state of development and are following different pathways. Whilst varied approaches to support research translation are apparent, there is a dominant focus on structure and governance, as opposed to action-oriented roles and processes to deliver strategic goals. Balancing collaboration and competition between partners presents a challenge, as does identifying appropriate ways to evaluate impact. CONCLUSION The early stage of development of AHSCs in Australia presents an important opportunity for formative learning and evaluation to optimise their enactment of knowledge mobilisation processes for impact.","Edelman, Alexandra; Clay-Williams, Robyn; Fischer, Michael; Kislov, Roman; Kitson, Alison; McLoughlin, Ian; Skouteris, Helen; Harvey, Gillian",International journal of health policy and management,205,30

METHODS Between 2004 and 2009, 33 patients (18 women; mean age 47 years) with iliofemoral DVT underwent pharmacomechanical thrombectomy using the AngioJet (n = 18) or Trellis (n = 15) devices with 10 mg of tenecteplase. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and venography were performed over the iliofemoral segments before and after treatment. Cross-sectional vessel and lumen diameters were measured from the IVUS scans and the post-procedure anteroposterior and lateral venograms at 3 points (proximal, mid-section, and distal) along each iliofemoral vein by 2 independent observers blinded to the treatment method. Volumes of the recanalized segments were calculated and compared to volumes of the original venous segments to assess clot lysis with each PMT device. IVUS scans and venograms were also compared for their ability to identify residual lesions or clot in need of treatment. Repeatability between and among observers was analyzed using the Bland and Altman method. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed; there were only 2 minor bleeding complications. The mean volume of the recanalized segment was 2255+/-66 mm(3) by IVUS, representing 80% lysis of the clot compared to what was perceived as >90% lysis with venography (p<0.05). IVUS was able to delineate significant residual thrombus, stenosis, or May-Thurner anatomy requiring ancillary interventions in 100% of patients versus 48% (16/33) on the venograms (p<0.01). Quantitative assessments of the diameters of the involved venous segments from the venograms and IVUS were consistent between and among observers. Comparing the similar patient subgroups, AngioJet resulted in greater clot lysis (88%) versus the Trellis device (72%; p<0.01), corresponding to recanalized venous segment volumes of 2486+/-74 and 2025+/-57 mm(3) and total venous segment volumes of 2826+/-84 and 2813+/-79 mm(3), respectively. CONCLUSION IVUS is superior to venography for detection of residual thrombus and underlying venous pathology after pharmacomechanical thrombectomy. While greater clot lysis was seen with the AngioJet system, both the AngioJet and Trellis devices resulted in excellent clinical clot lysis.","Murphy, Erin H; Broker, Harshal S; Johnson, Eric J; Modrall, J Gregory; Valentine, R James; Arko, Frank R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,205,24

We reconstructed the progression of almond leaf scorch disease by using broad phylogenetic evidence supported by epidemiological data. Bayesian phylogenetic inference predicted that both Xf subspecies found in Majorca, fastidiosa ST1 (95% highest posterior density, HPD: 1990-1997) and multiplex ST81 (95% HPD: 1991-1998), shared their most recent common ancestors with Californian Xf populations associated with almonds and grapevines. Consistent with this chronology, Xf-DNA infections were identified in tree rings dating to 1998.

The present study demonstrates that in infected cells, the capsid protein is associated with the nonstructural p150 protein via the short self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein. Mutational analyses indicated that hydrophobic amino acids in this N-terminal region are essential for its N-terminal self-interaction, which is critical for the capsid-p150 association. An analysis based on a subgenomic replicon system demonstrated that the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein plays a key role in promoting viral gene expression. Analyses using a virus-like particle (VLP) system also showed that the self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein is not essential for VLP production but is critical for VLP infectivity. These results demonstrate that the close cooperative actions of the capsid protein and p150 require the short self-interacting N-terminal region of the capsid protein during the life cycle of the rubella virus. IMPORTANCE The capsid protein of rubella virus promotes viral RNA replication via an unknown mechanism. This protein interacts with the nonstructural protein p150, but the importance of this interaction is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the short N-terminal region of the capsid protein forms a homo-oligomer that is critical for the capsid-p150 interaction. These interactions are required for the viral-gene-expression-promoting activity of the capsid protein, allowing efficient viral growth. These findings provide information about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of rubella virus RNA replication via the cooperative actions of the capsid protein and p150.","Sakata, Masafumi; Otsuki, Noriyuki; Okamoto, Kiyoko; Anraku, Masaki; Nagai, Misato; Takeda, Makoto; Mori, Yoshio",Journal of virology,205,1

We aim to describe the infectious syndromes, clinical care, the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms and outcomes in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective cohort of patients labeled as support or comfort care in a tertiary care center between 2016-2019. RESULTS A total of 347 patients were included with a mean age of 68.5 years, who were predominantly males (59.94%), bedbound (69.74%), on tube feeding (66.86%), and required indwelling urinary catheters (61.96%). The total number of admissions during the first year was 498, with the mean length of stay being 30 days. The number of infectious syndromes identified during that period was 821episodes, with a mean of 2 infectious syndromes per admission. The most common infection identified was pneumonia (41.66%) followed by urinary tract infections (27.16%). A total of 3891 microbiological cultures were taken with a mean of 5 cultures per infectious syndrome. The most commonly identified pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria (61.03%), with a high rate of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) (48.53%). The one-year mortality was 86.4%. Using carbapenem antibiotic and pneumonia were the independent predictors used for the MDROs. CONCLUSION Our study reflects the high burden of infections, antimicrobial resistance, and hospital admissions among a population with limited life expectancy. A consensus regarding investigating and managing of infectious syndromes, and antimicrobial prescription is needed to reduce the harms associated with overuse of antimicrobials.","Mahmoud, Ebrahim; Abanamy, Reem; Binawad, Eman; Alhatmi, Hind; Alzammam, Ali; Habib, Abdulrahman; Alturaifi, Dana; Alharbi, Ahmed; Alqahtani, Hajar; Aldohayan, Mohammed",Journal of infection and public health,205,23

Recent high-profile reports from international expert bodies have called for a significant reduction in global dietary meat intake, particularly RPM, especially in high-income settings, while acknowledging the importance of animal-sourced foods to population nutrition in many lower-income countries. However, this presents a major yet under-investigated political challenge given strong cultural preferences for meat and the economic importance and power of the meat industry. METHODS A theoretically-guided narrative review was undertaken. The theoretical framework used to guide the review considered the interests, ideas and institutions that constitute food systems in relation to meat reduction; and the instrumental, discursive and structural forms of power that actors deploy in relation to others within the food system. RESULTS High production and consumption levels of RPM are promoted and sustained by a number of factors. Actors with an interest in RPM included business and industry groups, governments, intergovernmental organisations, and civil society. Asymmetries of power between these actors exist, with institutional barriers recognised in the form of government-industry dependence, trade agreement conflicts, and policy incoherence. Industry lobbying, shaping of evidence and knowledge, and highly concentrated markets are key issues. Furthermore, prevailing ideologies like carnism and neoliberalism present embedded difficulties for RPM reduction. The literature noted the power of actors to resist meat reduction efforts exists in varying forms, including the use of lobbying, shaping of evidence and knowledge, and highly concentrated markets. CONCLUSION There are a number of political challenges related to RPM reduction that contribute to policy inertia, and hence are likely to impede the transformation of food systems. Research on policy efforts to reduce RPM production and consumption should incorporate the role of power and political feasibility.","Sievert, Katherine; Lawrence, Mark; Parker, Christine; Baker, Phillip",International journal of health policy and management,205,1

The aim of the present study was to examine the correlation between the IAP and the number of obesity-related co-morbidities. METHODS A total of 63 morbidly obese patients who were undergoing bariatric surgery had their IAP measured intraoperatively while in a supine position and under general anesthesia. The IAP readings were obtained through an indwelling urinary bladder catheter. The correlation of obesity-related co-morbidities, including systemic hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, urinary stress incontinence, lower extremity edema, obstructive sleep apnea, and abdominal wall hernia, and the level of IAP were examined using a stepwise regression analysis model. RESULTS Of the 62 patients, 57 were women. The mean age was 44 + or - 11 years, and the body mass index was 49 + or - 10 kg/m(2). Of the 62 patients, 48 (77%) had an elevated IAP (> or = 9 cm H(2)O). A significant and positive correlation was found between the IAP level and the number of obesity-related co-morbidities (Pearson's r = .8; P <.05). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that systemic hypertension, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and body mass index were predictors of elevated IAP. A normal IAP appeared to offer a protective effect against systemic hypertension. CONCLUSION In this cohort of mainly obese women, the baseline IAP of morbidly obese patients was abnormally elevated. A greater IAP correlated with the presence of a greater number of obesity-related co-morbid conditions. Systemic hypertension was significantly associated with an elevated IAP. Chronic increases in IAP might, in part, be responsible for the pathogenesis of systemic hypertension in the morbidly obese.","Varela, J Esteban; Hinojosa, Marcelo; Nguyen, Ninh",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,205,1

The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. Methods CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. Results The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. Conclusion The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams.","Beattie, Zachary; Miller, Lyndsey M; Almirola, Carlos; Au-Yeung, Wan-Tai M; Bernard, Hannah; Cosgrove, Kevin E; Dodge, Hiroko H; Gamboa, Charlene J; Golonka, Ona; Gothard, Sarah; Harbison, Sam; Irish, Stephanie; Kornfeld, Judith; Lee, Jonathan; Marcoe, Jennifer; Mattek, Nora C; Quinn, Charlie; Reynolds, Christina; Riley, Thomas; Rodrigues, Nathaniel; Sharma, Nicole; Siqueland, Mary Alice; Thomas, Neil W; Truty, Timothy; Wall, Rachel; Wild, Katherine; Wu, Chao-Yi; Karlawish, Jason; Silverberg, Nina B; Barnes, Lisa L; Czaja, Sara; Silbert, Lisa C; Kaye, Jeffrey",Digital biomarkers,205,27

In some poor countries life expectancy is between 37-40 years lower than in rich countries; furthermore, maternal and infant mortality is high and there is lack of access to basic preventive and life-saving medicines, as well a high prevalence of neglected diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Moreover, globalization has made the world more connected than before such that health challenges today are no longer limited within national or regional boundaries, making all persons equally vulnerable. Because of this, diseases in the most affluent countries are closely connected with diseases in the poorest countries. In this paper, we argue that, because of global health inequalities, in a situation of equal vulnerability, there is need for global solidarity not only as a means of reducing health inequalities, but also as a way of putting up a united force against global health challenges. We argue for an African approach to solidarity in which the humanity of a person is not determined by his/her being human or rational capacity, but by his/her capacity to live a virtuous life. According to this view of solidarity, because no one is self-sufficient, no individual can survive alone. If we are to collectively flourish in a world where no individual, nation or region has all the health resources or protection needed for survival, we must engage in solidarity where we remain compassionate and available to one another at all times.","Tosam, Mbih J; Chi, Primus Che; Munung, Nchangwi Syntia; Oukem-Boyer, Odile Ouwe Missi; Tangwa, Godfrey B",Developing world bioethics,205,4

We hypothesized that early bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) exposures would be associated with sex-dependent changes in preschool executive function. METHODS A subsample of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort (n = 312) provided maternal second trimester (prenatal) and 3-month postpartum (postnatal) urine samples, from which BPA and BPS concentrations were quantified. When children were age 2 and 4, mothers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). Changes in standardized T scores on the BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition were investigated. RESULTS Adjusted multivariate regression analyses showed that child sex modified the associations between maternal postnatal BPA and changes in executive function. Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations predicted increasing difficulties from age 2 to 4 in the domains of inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition in female, but not male children. The other bisphenol concentrations were not associated with changes in executive function. CONCLUSION Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, these findings justify further investigation on the effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure on child cognitive development. IMPACT Higher concentrations of maternal BPA at 3-month postpartum were associated with increasing difficulties in inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition from age 2 to 4 in girls, but not boys.Prenatal BPA and prenatal/postnatal BPS were not significant predictors of change in executive function in boys and girls.The current study extends previous research to show that maternal postnatal BPA could also impact child executive function.Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, the current findings suggest that additional precautions may be needed to protect infants' neurodevelopment from indirect exposure to BPA.","England-Mason, Gillian; Liu, Jiaying; Martin, Jonathan W; Giesbrecht, Gerald F; Letourneau, Nicole; Dewey, Deborah",Pediatric research,205,5

Type I IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral activity that also enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Viruses trigger activation of pDCs and type I IFN responses mainly through the Toll-like receptor pathway. However, a variety of activating and inhibitory pDC receptors fine tune the amplitude of type I IFN responses. Chronic activation and secretion of type I IFN in the absence of infection can promote autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, while activated pDCs promote immunity and autoimmunity, resting or alternatively activated pDCs may be tolerogenic. The various roles of pDCs have been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo with depleting antibodies. However, depleting antibodies cross-react with other cell types that are critical for eliciting protective immunity, potentially yielding ambiguous phenotypes. Here we discuss new approaches to assess pDC functions in vivo and provide preliminary data on their potential roles during viral infections. Such approaches would also prove useful in the more specific evaluation of how pDCs mediate tolerance and autoimmunity. Finally, we discuss the emergent role of pDCs and one of their receptors, tetherin, in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis.","Swiecki, Melissa; Colonna, Marco",Immunological reviews,205,1

Two current textbooks have completely different recommendations, but there is no evidence to support either theory. This project evaluates distortion in gypsum casts that have been prepared from wax-lined and unlined metal impression trays. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of wax on the border and in the palate of metal-perforated impression trays on the dimensional stability of the resulting irreversible hydrocolloid impression. MATERIALS AND METHODS A dentaform was prepared with marks on the cusp tips of teeth 6 and 11 and distobuccal cusps of teeth 2 and 15. Using a standard maxillary rim lock impression tray, alginate impressions were made using a dentaform with no wax lining, wax lining the border of the tray, and wax lining the border and the palate (n = 10). Casts were randomized. Six measurements were taken using a stereographic measuring microscope, from tooth #6 to #11, #11 to #15, #15 to #2, #2 to #6, #6 to #15, and #2 to #11. An acrylic template was used to position the cast in a reproducible position on the microscope. RESULTS Trays lined with wax on the border and the palate yielded casts with significantly different dimensions when compared to those poured from unlined or border-lined trays (p < 0.05). Casts produced from unlined and border-lined trays were not significantly different in dimension from the dentaform (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION There is no difference between the metal tray with no wax, the metal tray with a wax around the border, and the dentaform. The clinician can make irreversible hydrocolloid impressions using wax on the periphery or without wax on the periphery and feel confident that the impression has not been compromised in its ability to accurately reproduce the maxillary arch when used. Caution should be exercised when adding wax to the palate of the impression tray.","Hansen, Paul; Franco, Raul; Beatty, Mark",Journal of prosthodontics : official journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,205,1

Various tests are available, however the psychometric properties of these measures have not been systematically reviewed for this population. METHOD A systematic search of electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, CINHAL, Cochrane, and PEDro) was performed to identify papers that: (a) reported original psychometric data, (b) examined a measure of exercise capacity, (c) examined children with CF aged eight to 18 years; and (d) were published in English after 1950. The level of psychometric evidence was evaluated using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist. RESULTS Searches identified 1025 papers. Forty-six papers were included, covering 15 tests: incremental cardiopulmonary exercise test using a cycle ergometer (CPET(cycle)) or treadmill (CPET(treadmill)), 6 minute walk test (6MWT), modified shuttle test (MST), 3-minute step test (3MST), 2 minute walk test (2MWT), Bratteby walk test, intermittent sprint test, speed ramp test, incremental step test, forward-backwards jump test (FBJT), astride jump test (AJT), motor quotient test, Munich fitness test, and Glittre ADL test. CONCLUSION There is a plethora of exercise tests available with varying psychometric robustness. The CPET, 6MWT, and MST have fair to good psychometric properties, but each with their clinical advantages and limitations. Thus, a Selection Guide was developed to assist clinicians and researchers in selecting the most appropriate exercise test for various situations.","Lang, Ray Lei; Stockton, Kellie; Wilson, Christine; Russell, Trevor Glen; Johnston, Leanne Marie",Pediatric pulmonology,205,7

Pregnant women are exposed to additional pressure due to the indirect adverse effects of this pandemic on their physical and mental health. Since the psychological wellness framework is weak in developing countries, it is likely that geographical factors affect the prevalence. Therefore, the goal of this meta-analysis is to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We searched databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library for articles. The quality of studies was determined based on the STROBE checklist. I2 and Cochrane Q-test were used to determine heterogeneity. Fixed effects and/or random effects models were also employed to estimate pooled prevalence. RESULTS Since heterogeneity was fairly high in all analyses, the random effect model was used. According to the results of random effects in the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence was 18.7% (95% CI: 0.06-0.36%; I2=99%,P<0.001) for anxiety and 25.1% (95% CI: 0.18-0.33%; I2=97%, P<0.001) for depression. The results of continent subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of anxiety was higher in western country (38%) than in Asia country (7.8%). The prevalence of anxiety in Italy (38%), Canada (56%), Pakistan (14%), Greece (53%), Sri Lanka (17.5%), and China (0.3-29%) and Iran 3.8% as well as the prevalence of depression in Canada (37%), Belgium (25%), Turkey (35.4%), Sri Lanka (19.5%), and China (11-29%) has been reported. CONCLUSION Covid-19 may impose extra pressure on the emotional wellbeing of pregnant women. Therefore, there is an urgent need for resources to help mitigate anxiety and depression in pregnant women.","Ghazanfarpour, Masumeh; Bahrami, Fereshteh; Rashidi Fakari, Farzaneh; Ashrafinia, Farzane; Babakhanian, Masoudeh; Dordeh, Mohammad; Abdi, Fatemeh",Journal of psychosomatic obstetrics and gynaecology,205,0

Theoretically, research participants and study personnel could get infected in the closed environment of the exercise laboratory by contact with respiratory droplets from an infected person, by breathing virus-laden aerosols, or by touching fomites. Older adults are at increased risk of developing more severe disease and of dying from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This special article offers guidance - informed by a synthesis of scientific data and recommendations of the CDC and WHO, - on procedures that can be implemented in exercise laboratories to minimize risk of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections. Most tests of physical function (e.g., gait speed, Short Physical Performance Battery) are not aerosol-generating and are associated with only a small increase in minute ventilation; in contrast, CPXT markedly increases minute ventilation and is potentially aerosol-generating. Researchers should evaluate the benefit-to-risk ratio of information gained from the laboratory assessment versus the risk of SARS-CoV2 infection. Risk mitigation strategies described here fall into four categories: personal hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment; standardized screening; reconfiguration of laboratory space; and optimization of laboratory ventilation. The proposed safety measures are not intended to replace institutional policy, state or federal guidelines; they may not apply to all settings and are expected to evolve as more definitive information becomes available. These practical measures to maximize protection against SARS-CoV2 infection can help maximize participant and staff safety, reduce anxiety, and facilitate protocol adherence, and study integrity.

Here, we aimed to identify the potential benefits of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery for resectable PDAC. Methods We reviewed radiologically resectable PDAC patients who received resection with curative intent at a tertiary hospital in South Korea between January 2012 and August 2019. A total of 202 patients underwent curative resection for resectable PDAC: 167 underwent surgical resection first during this period, and 35 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy/chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery. Resectable PDAC patients were subdivided, and 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to reduce selection bias. Results Compared with the group that received surgery first, the group that received neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery had significantly smaller tumors (22.0 mm vs 27.0 mm, p=0.004), a smaller proportion of patients with postoperative pathologic T stage (p=0.026), a smaller proportion of patients with lymphovascular invasion (20.0% vs 40.7%, p=0.022), and a larger proportion of patients with negative resection margins (74.3% vs 51.5%, p=0.049). After PSM, the group that received neoadjuvant therapy had a significantly longer progression-free survival than those in the group that underwent surgery first (29.6 months vs 15.1 months, p=0.002). Overall survival was not significantly different between the two groups after PSM analysis. Conclusions We observed significantly better surgical outcomes and progression-free survival with the addition of neoadjuvant therapy to the management of resectable PDAC. However, despite PSM, there was still selection bias due to the use of different regimens between the groups receiving surgery first and neoadjuvant therapy.

OBJECTIVE To survey physicians who are actively involved in the care of patients with cerebrovascular aneurysms to determine current aneurysm treatment preferences. METHODS A 25-question SurveyMonkey online survey was designed and distributed electronically to members of the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery, Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons Combined Cerebrovascular Section. RESULTS 211 physicians completed the survey. Most respondents recommend endovascular treatment as the first-line management strategy for most ruptured (78%) and unruptured (71%) aneurysms. Thirty-eight per cent of respondents indicate that they routinely treat all patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage regardless of grade. Most physicians use the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms data for counseling patients on natural history risk (80%); a small minority (11%) always or usually recommend treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms of <5 mm. Two-thirds of respondents continue to recommend clipping for most middle cerebral artery aneurysms, while most (51%) recommend flow diversion for wide-necked internal carotid artery aneurysms. Follow-up imaging schedules are highly variable. Neurosurgeons at academic institutions and those practicing longer were more likely to recommend clipping surgery for aneurysms (p<0.05).

In this article, we describe the sequence of pathological changes in COVID-19 and discuss the implications for approaches to treatment. METHODS Standardized autopsies were performed on thirteen patients who had died of COVID-19. The findings were analyzed together with clinical data from the patients' medical records. RESULTS Most (77%) of the deceased patients were men. Their median age at death was 78 years (range, 41-90). Most of them had major pre-existing chronic diseases, most commonly arterial hypertension. The autopsies revealed characteristic COVID-19-induced pathological changes in the lungs, which were regarded as the cause of death in most patients. The main histological finding was sequential alveolar damage, apparently due in large measure to focal capillary microthrombus formation. Alveolar damage leads to the death of the patient either directly or by the induction of pulmonary parenchymal fibrosis. Diffuse lung damage was seen exclusively in invasively ventilated patients. CONCLUSION Autopsies are crucial for the systematic assessment of new diseases such as COVID-19: they provide a basis for further investigations of disease mechanisms and for the devising of potentially effective modes of treatment. The autopsy findings suggest that focal damage of the microvascular pulmonary circulation is a main mechanism of lethal lung disease due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It may also be a cause of persistent lung damage in patients who recover from severe COVID-19.","Kommoss, Felix K F; Schwab, Constantin; Tavernar, Luca; Schreck, Johannes; Wagner, Willi L; Merle, Uta; Jonigk, Danny; Schirmacher, Peter; Longerich, Thomas",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,205,1

Although many locally operated surgical robots and devices have been developed, none can safely grasp organs and provide traction. A new manipulator with a detachable commercial forceps was developed that can act as a third arm for a surgeon situated in a sterile area near the patient. This mechanism can be disassembled into compact parts that enable mobile use. METHODS A mobile locally operated detachable end-effector manipulator (LODEM) was developed and tested. This device uses crank-slider and cable-rod mechanisms to achieve 5 degrees of freedom and an acting force of more than 5 N. The total mass is less than 15 kg. The positional accuracy and speed of the prototype device were evaluated while performing simulated in vivo surgery. RESULTS The accuracy of the mobile LODEM was 0.4 mm, sufficient for handling organs. The manipulator could be assembled and disassembled in 8 min, making it highly mobile. The manipulator could successfully handle the target organs with the required level of dexterity during an in vivo laparoscopic surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS A mobile LODEM was designed that allows minimally invasive robotically assisted endoscopic surgery by a surgeon working near the patient.

Several commercially available products have emerged recently. The TriPort system and the SILS Port are single-port devices that allow the surgeon to perform laparoscopic surgery through a 2- to 3-cm periumbilical incision. This study aimed to ascertain whether these devices allow safe and reliable access for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS From March 2008 to June 2009, single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted for 22 patients with an average age of 40 years (range, 23-73 years). The data collected prospectively after institutional review board approval included demographics, operative time, complications, and reasons for conversion to standard four-port laparoscopic surgery. RESULTS The operation was completed successfully for 21 of the 22 patients (15 women and 7 men) using five different techniques. The mean body mass index (BMI) of the patients was 32.7 kg/cm(2) (range, 22.3-46.1 kg/cm(2)). Three of the patients had previously undergone laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The mean operative time was 80.8 min (range, 51-156 min). One patient experienced a Richter's hernia postoperatively, which required a reoperation and subsequent bowel resection. One patient required conversion to a standard four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy because the articulating instrument could not reach the gallbladder from the umbilicus. CONCLUSION The results from the current series show single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be a promising technique. A variety of patient demographics appear suited to this approach. The operative time in this series compares favorably with that for the standard four-port operation. The feasibility of single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now established. However, routine application of this novel technique requires an evaluation of its safety and cost effectiveness in larger studies. In addition, its superiority over standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of postoperative pain, cosmesis, and overall patient satisfaction requires further study. Refinements in instrumentation will enable wider use of this novel minimally invasive approach.","Romanelli, John R; Roshek, Thomas B; Lynn, David C; Earle, David B",Surgical endoscopy,205,31

In Hong Kong, low socioeconomic districts were the epicentres of third-wave outbreak of COVID-19 in July and August 2020, suggesting that people from low socioeconomic class are vulnerable groups. Socially disadvantaged people are relatively more vulnerable to the physical, mental, and social impacts of infectious diseases. To achieve more effective infection control, the social determinants of health and existing health inequalities should be identified, and understanding the experiences of socially disadvantaged groups in the COVID-19 outbreak will be beneficial to health authorities in formulating a responsive infection control policy targeting the needs of the socially disadvantaged. This article investigates the experiences of economically disadvantaged groups during the COVID-19 outbreak and examines how they were further disadvantaged in the outbreak by delineating how health inequality intersected with social inequality. In-depth, semistructured interviews were conducted from February to April 2020 with 35 participants from the poverty class in Hong Kong. The high prices of surgical face masks and disinfecting products as well as the economic impacts induced by COVID-19-related social distancing policies imposed severe economic burden on the participants. In addition to economic and housing deprivation, social inequality was closely associated with health inequality, which made the participants more vulnerable to infection. Social inequality is associated with and can worsen health inequality. Here, the participants, who were of low socioeconomic status were more disadvantaged in health and in the attainment of social resources such as employment, education, face masks, disinfection products and right to use public facilities, during the COVID-19 outbreak. All these elements may have interrelated effects and in turn limit accessibility to healthcare and lead to less positive health outcomes and consequently to health inequality.","Siu, Judy Yuen-Man",Health & social care in the community,205,1

The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin microvascular reactivity in patients with critical COVID-19. METHODS Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined. Skin perfusion was investigated through Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. RESULTS Compared to controls, patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion and reduced responses to endothelial-dependent (ACh, p = 0.002) and endothelial-independent (SNP, p = 0.01) vasodilator drugs on study day 1. In addition, the ACh/SNP ratio was significantly reduced in patients (0.50 ± 0.36 versus 0.91 ± 0.49 in controls, p = 0.02). Three months after disease onset, surviving patients tended to have reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation compared to controls (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS This small-sized pilot study demonstrates that critical COVID-19 infection is associated with microvascular impairment and, in particular, a markedly reduced endothelial function. Our results also suggest that microvascular function may not be fully recovered three months after disease onset.","Tehrani, Sara; Gille-Johnson, Patrik",Shock,205,12

T cell immunodeficiency can be acquired in the form of inborn errors, or can result from perturbations to the thymus due to aging or irradiation/chemotherapy required for cancer treatment. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) from compatible donors is a cornerstone for the treatment of hematological malignancies and immunodeficiency. Although it can restore a functional immune system, profound impairments exist in recovery of the T cell compartment. T cells remain absent or low in number for many months after HSCT, depending on a variety of factors including the age of the recipient. While younger patients have a shorter refractory period, the prolonged T cell recovery observed in older patients can lead to a higher risk of opportunistic infections and increased predisposition to relapse. Thus, strategies for enhancing T cell recovery in aged individuals are needed to counter thymic damage induced by radiation and chemotherapy toxicities, in addition to naturally occurring age-related thymic involution. Preclinical results have shown that robust and rapid long-term thymic reconstitution can be achieved when progenitor T cells, generated in vitro from HSCs, are co-administered during HSCT. Progenitor T cells appear to rely on lymphostromal crosstalk via receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) and RANK-ligand (RANKL) interactions, creating chemokine-rich niches within the cortex and medulla that likely favor the recruitment of bone marrow-derived thymus seeding progenitors. Here, we employed preclinical mouse models to demonstrate that in vitro-generated progenitor T cells can effectively engraft involuted aged thymuses, which could potentially improve T cell recovery. The utility of progenitor T cells for aged recipients positions them as a promising cellular therapy for immune recovery and intrathymic repair following irradiation and chemotherapy, even in a post-involution thymus.","Singh, Jastaranpreet; Mohtashami, Mahmood; Anderson, Graham; Zúñiga-Pflücker, Juan Carlos",Frontiers in immunology,205,1

We sought to characterize and compare grandparent- and parent-headed households with respect to adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), child temperament, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and caregiver aggravation and coping. METHODS Using a combined data set of children ages 3 to 17 from the 2016, 2017, and 2018 National Survey of Children's Health, we applied survey regression procedures, adjusted for sociodemographic confounders, to compare grandparent- and parent-headed households on composite and single-item outcome measures of ACEs; ADHD; preschool inattention and restlessness; child temperament; and caregiver aggravation, coping, support, and interactions with children. RESULTS Among 80 646 households (2407 grandparent-headed, 78 239 parent-headed), children in grandparent-headed households experienced more ACEs (β = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07 to 1.38). Preschool-aged and school-aged children in grandparent-headed households were more likely to have ADHD (adjusted odds ratio = 4.29, 95% CI: 2.22 to 8.28; adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.34 to 2.20). School-aged children in these households had poorer temperament (βadj = .25, 95% CI: -0.63 to 1.14), and their caregivers experienced greater aggravation (βadj = .29, 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.49). However, these differences were not detected after excluding children with ADHD from the sample. No differences were noted between grandparent- and parent-headed households for caregiver coping, emotional support, or interactions with children. CONCLUSIONS Despite caring for children with greater developmental problems and poorer temperaments, grandparent caregivers seem to cope with parenting about as well as parents.","Rapoport, Eli; Muthiah, Nallammai; Keim, Sarah A; Adesman, Andrew",Pediatrics,205,29

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Ninety-eight consecutive, client owned dogs. METHODS Medical records of dogs undergoing an elective laparoscopic procedure were reviewed. Dogs were classified as SPAS or MPAS according to the initial surgical approach. Duration of surgery, intraoperative complications, reason for open conversion, and postoperative complications were recorded and compared. RESULTS The duration of surgery for SPAS gastropexy (P = .0039), ovariectomy (P = .0052), and gastropexy/ovariectomy combined (P = .0002) were significantly reduced compared to corresponding MPAS procedures. Nine splenic punctures occurred during MPAS. The frequency of intraoperative complications was significantly less for SPAS (0/44) than MPAS (12/54, P = .004). Elective conversion was performed because of gastric malpositioning in 1 dog and emergent conversion was required because of bleeding from the ovarian pedicle in 2 dogs (0/44 SPAS, 3/54 MPAS, P = .250). There were 14/76 dogs with followup to suture removal with postoperative complications, all incisional (7/31 SPAS, 7/45 MPAS, P = 1.0).

Their therapeutic management is still challenging: among therapeutic options, lidocaine patch 5% was rarely used in acute neuralgia on lesional skin, and its efficacy to prevent post-herpetic neuralgia was never studied. The efficacy and tolerability of lidocaine patch 5% was evaluated in 38 patients with acute neuralgia (19) and post-herpetic neuralgia (19). Pain intensity was investigated using DN4 questionnaire and NRS-11 scale at baseline and at week 2, 4, and 8. The use of rescue therapy was also evaluated. A significant reduction of DN4 and NRS-11 was observed already at W2, with further improvement at W4 and W8. A complete response to treatment (DN4 and NRS-11 = 0) at week 8 was higher in patients with acute neuralgia (63.2%) than post-herpetic neuralgia (31.6%). Rescue therapy gradually decreased in acute neuralgia patients from week 2 (57.9%) to week 8 (10.5%), with only 2 patients needing neuroleptics. In post-herpetic neuralgia patients rescue therapy remained stable (68.4%). According to our results, lidocaine patch 5% applied on lesional skin was well tolerated and ensured a rapid pain relief in acute neuralgia; if early used, it prevented post-herpetic neuralgia in almost all patients.

BACKGROUND CT might have a prognostic predictive value beyond its diagnostic value. METHODS Sixty-eight patients, 32 with cytokine storm and 36 without cytokine storm, were included in the study. Four different scoring methods were created according to elementary lesions, distribution and involvement rate. CT scores and demographic findings of the cases were compared in the cytokine storm and non-cytokine storm groups. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 57.72 (SD: 13.5) and 40 (58.8 %) of them were male. The cytokine storm was significantly more common among male patients and patients of older age (p=0.04). The AUC values of CT score 1, CT score 2, CT score 3, and CT score 4 were as follows; 0.772 (95% CI; 0.651-0.892), 0.766 (95% CI; 0.647-0.885), 0.758 (95% CI; 0.639-8.78), and 0.760 (95% CI; 0.640-0.881), respectively.

OBJECTIVES The aim of the present study was to evaluate the 5-year efficacy of LSG on weight loss, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms, and obesity-associated co-morbidities. SETTING Tertiary-care referral hospital. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed 105 obese patients undergoing LSG from January 2006 to December 2009. The preoperative evaluation included demographic characteristics, evaluation of co-morbidities, a double-contrast barium swallow, and an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy. The following data were collected at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery: weight, improvement/remission of co-morbidities, complications, and revisional surgery. RESULTS According to preoperative body mass index (BMI), patients were divided into Group 1 (n = 61) with BMI≤50 kg/m(2) and Group 2 (n = 44) with BMI>50 kg/m(2). The follow-up rate was 94% after 5 years (n = 99). Delta BMI (BMI at follow-up-preoperative BMI) was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 at 1-3 years and 5 years (P<.001). Furthermore, at 5 years, Group 2 showed a significantly higher percentage total weight loss (%TWL) (26.6%±18.3% versus 33.5%±12.9%, P = .006) than Group 1, whereas percentage excess weight loss was similar (58.4%±21.8% versus 55.3%±19.5%, P = .5).Younger age at surgery and absence of postoperative GERD were associated with a better %TWL at 5 years (P<.001 and P = .03). CONCLUSION LSG is an effective procedure at long-term, with good weight loss outcomes and with a considerable improvement of obesity-associated co-morbidities. Younger age at surgery and absence of postoperative GERD were associated with a better %TWL at 5 years.","Angrisani, Luigi; Santonicola, Antonella; Hasani, Ariola; Nosso, Gabriella; Capaldo, Brunella; Iovino, Paola",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,205,16

Despite the widely hypothesized role of a cytokine storm in disease severity, no study thus far has explored the association between immunosuppression and disease severity in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE This study aims to examine the association between the use of immunosuppressant medication and outcomes of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS Nine hundred and eighty-one consecutive patients hospitalized between March 12, 2020, and April 15, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were enrolled in this cohort study and subdivided by immunosuppression status. The patients were followed up for a minimum of 28 days (median 37 days) for the primary endpoint of mortality. Secondary endpoints included the composite of intubation or death, and the composite of mortality, intubation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) requirement. RESULTS During the follow-up period, 354 (36.1%) of study patients died. The immunosuppressed cohort (n=31) had significantly higher mortality rates (aHR 2.067, 95%CI 1.20-3.57, p=0.009). There was no association between immunosuppression and the composite endpoint of mortality or intubation (aHR 1.49 95%CI 0.88-2.51, p=0.14) and of the composite endpoint of mortality, intubation, or CPAP (aHR 1.36 95%CI 0.81-2.30 p=0.245). CONCLUSION In this cohort study of 981 confirmed COVID-19 patients consecutively hospitalized at a large North West London hospital, immunosuppressant use was associated with significantly higher mortality rates.

Major lethal outbreaks of viral respiratory infections in hospitals have been caused by coronaviruses imported from abroad by travelers. SUMMARY Although viruses circulating in the local community are common causes of hospital outbreaks, major outbreaks have been caused by the coronaviruses imported from abroad by travelers. A high degree of clinical awareness and rapid enforcement of infection control measures are required to prevent transmission and spread.","Wilson, Peter; Zumla, Alimuddin",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,205,16

The conventional means to measure the hemodynamic status are not sensitive enough to appreciate the severity of general, and more specifically of cerebral circulatory imbalance. The aim was to study cerebral tissue oxygenation during postnatal adaptation in these infants using near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS The tissue hemoglobin index (THI), tissue oxygenation index (TOI), arterial oxygen saturation (pre-ductal SaO₂) and heart rate (HR) were recorded immediately after birth, and again after 12-24 hours of life in 15 newborns delivered by vacuum extraction due to fetal distress. A comparison with 19 healthy newborns delivered by elective cesarean section was performed. RESULTS Newborns delivered by vacuum extraction had significantly higher THI 10 to 15 minutes after birth. TOI and HR were significantly higher in the first 5 min and SaO₂ in the first 10 minutes but then did not differ from those after cesarean section. CONCLUSION Infants delivered by vacuum extraction following fetal distress show transient deviations in cerebral oxygenation and perfusion after birth which were not detectable after 24 hours.","Karen, Tanja; Wolf, Martin; Nef, Rahel; Haensse, Daniel; Bucher, Hans Ulrich; Schulz, Gabriele; Fauchère, Jean-Claude",BMC pediatrics,205,24

The transmission dynamics of C. parvum and the influence of temporal, spatial, parasitic, and host-related factors on the parasite (sub)populations were studied. The relationship of those factors to the risk of cryptosporidiosis was also investigated using results from 1,368 fecal specimens submitted to the veterinary laboratories for routine diagnosis during 2005. The prevalence was greatest in the northwest and midwest of the country and on farms that bought in calves. The panmixia (random mating) detected in the C. parvum population may relate to its high prevalence, the cattle density, and the frequent movement of cattle. However, local variations in these factors were reflected in the C. parvum subpopulations. This study demonstrated the importance of biosecurity in the control of bovine cryptosporidiosis (e.g., isolation and testing of calves before introduction into a herd). Furthermore, the zoonotic risk of C. parvum was confirmed, as most specimens possessed GP60 and MS1 subtypes previously described in humans.","De Waele, Valérie; Van den Broeck, Frederik; Huyse, Tine; McGrath, Guy; Higgins, Isabella; Speybroeck, Niko; Berzano, Marco; Raleigh, Pat; Mulcahy, Grace M; Murphy, Thomas M",Applied and environmental microbiology,205,16

The purpose of this study is to assess the baseline occurrence of negative psychological factors and evaluate the relationships between psychological factors and demographic characteristics among Appalachian women who received abnormal Pap results. METHODS We conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from Appalachia Kentucky women (N = 521) ages ≥18 enrolled in an intervention. Data included sociodemographics, Beck depression and anxiety inventories, fatalism, and personal control measures. Multiple variable logistic regression was used to investigate the association between demographics and psychological factors. FINDINGS Participants were predominantly White (96.2%), with mean age 28.93 ± 11.03 years, and the majority (77%) had yearly income below $20,000. Depression was reported by 34.6% (n = 173); 10% (n = 50) experienced moderate or severe anxiety; 20.6% (n = 107) had fatalistic beliefs; and 55.1% (n = 289) believed they lacked personal control over cancer. Women with lower income had higher occurrence of depression (P = .003). Women with moderate to severe anxiety were significantly older than those with low to moderate depression (34.44 vs 28.34, P < .001). Controlling for other variables, as age increased, the odds of fatalistic beliefs increased, OR (95%) = 1.042 (1.022, 1.062). When education level increased, the odds of fatalistic beliefs decreased, OR (95%) = 0.873 (0.800, 0.952). CONCLUSIONS Given the high occurrence of depression, anxiety, and fatalistic beliefs among this population, health care providers should assess for underlying mental health diagnoses and psychological distress during each patient encounter and provide recommendations to address them.","Adegboyega, Adebola; Dignan, Mark; Sha, Shuying; Nkwonta, Chigozie; Williams, Lovoria B",The Journal of rural health : official journal of the American Rural Health Association and the National Rural Health Care Association,205,1

Here we report the long-term outcome of patients in this trial. METHODS We randomly assigned (1:1, stratified by centre with randomly permuted block sizes) 451 patients with recent transient ischaemic attack or stroke related to 70-99% stenosis of a major intracranial artery to aggressive medical management (antiplatelet therapy, intensive management of vascular risk factors, and a lifestyle-modification programme) or aggressive medical management plus stenting with the Wingspan stent. The primary endpoint was any of the following: stroke or death within 30 days after enrolment, ischaemic stroke in the territory of the qualifying artery beyond 30 days of enrolment, or stroke or death within 30 days after a revascularisation procedure of the qualifying lesion during follow-up. Primary endpoint analysis of between-group differences with log-rank test was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT 00576693. FINDINGS During a median follow-up of 32·4 months, 34 (15%) of 227 patients in the medical group and 52 (23%) of 224 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint event. The cumulative probability of the primary endpoints was smaller in the medical group versus the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) group (p=0·0252). Beyond 30 days, 21 (10%) of 210 patients in the medical group and 19 (10%) of 191 patients in the stenting group had a primary endpoint. The absolute differences in the primary endpoint rates between the two groups were 7·1% at year 1 (95% CI 0·2 to 13·8%; p=0·0428), 6·5% at year 2 (-0·5 to 13·5%; p=0·07) and 9·0% at year 3 (1·5 to 16·5%; p=0·0193). The occurrence of the following adverse events was higher in the PTAS group than in the medical group: any stroke (59 [26%] of 224 patients vs 42 [19%] of 227 patients; p=0·0468) and major haemorrhage (29 [13%]of 224 patients vs 10 [4%] of 227 patients; p=0·0009). INTERPRETATION The early benefit of aggressive medical management over stenting with the Wingspan stent for high-risk patients with intracranial stenosis persists over extended follow-up. Our findings lend support to the use of aggressive medical management rather than PTAS with the Wingspan system in high-risk patients with atherosclerotic intracranial arterial stenosis.

We identified three clusters of differentially expressed innate immune response genes in lungs from H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/04) influenza virus-infected ferrets by oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Interferon response genes were more strongly expressed in H5N1-infected ferret lungs than in lungs from ferrets infected with the less pathogenic H3N2 subtype. In particular, robust CXCL10 gene expression in H5N1-infected ferrets led us to test the pathogenic role of signaling via CXCL10's cognate receptor, CXCR3, during H5N1 influenza virus infection. Treatment of H5N1-infected ferrets with the drug AMG487, a CXCR3 antagonist, resulted in a reduction of symptom severity and delayed mortality compared to vehicle treatment. We contend that unregulated host interferon responses are at least partially responsible for the severity of H5N1 infection and provide evidence that attenuating the CXCR3 signaling pathway improves the clinical course of H5N1 infection in ferrets.","Cameron, Cheryl M; Cameron, Mark J; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Ran, Longsi; Xu, Luoling; Turner, Patricia V; Ran, Ran; Danesh, Ali; Fang, Yuan; Chan, Pak-Kei M; Mytle, Nutan; Sullivan, Timothy J; Collins, Tassie L; Johnson, Michael G; Medina, Julio C; Rowe, Thomas; Kelvin, David J",Journal of virology,205,1

These PVDF structures were placed in the peritoneal folds of the USL at the pelvic wall to mimic the lateral and backward tension and to avoid rectal obstruction. A special tunneling device was used, which allowed the semi-circular placement of the structure without destroying the peritoneum. METHODS A 59-year-old woman with mixed urinary incontinence and apical prolapse (pelvic organ prolapse quantification system, POP-Q, stage 2) of the uterus underwent laparoscopic bilateral USL replacement. USLs were replaced by PVDF structures by performing the cervicosacropexy (CESA) technique using a semi-circular tunneling device. RESULTS Apical support was restored (POP-Q stage 0), and the patient was continent thereafter. The tunneling device was pulled through the peritoneal folds of the USLs toward the cervix. The new USL structures were brought to their physiological position. The new technique did not lead to any complications and did not cause any side effects during 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Restoration of apical prolapse and urinary continence was achieved by bilateral USL replacement using a semi-circular tunneling device that was inserted through the lateral abdominal trocar incision.","Ludwig, Sebastian; Morgenstern, Bernd; Mallmann, Peter; Jäger, Wolfram",International urogynecology journal,205,5

Pre-pandemic research demonstrated that online self-disclosure benefits people's psychological health by establishing meaningful relationships, obtaining social support, and achieving self-acceptance, particularly in times of crisis. However, it is unclear whether these dynamics transition well to lockdown conditions where online self-disclosure must stand almost entirely on its own. Longitudinal investigations are needed to gain insight into the psychological functionalities of online self-disclosure during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE This study aims to determine temporal associations between smartphone online self-disclosure (as a communicative behavior) and critical indicators of psychological health (including both psychopathological as well as hedonic and eudaimonic states) during the first COVID-19 lockdown in . METHODS We conducted a representative two-wave panel survey between late March/April 2020 and May 2020. A total of 416 participants completed both waves (43.1% attrition rate). A partially measurement invariant over-time structural equation model was calculated to determine the temporal associations between online self-disclosure, fear of COVID-19, happiness, and psychological well-being. RESULTS The analysis revealed that fear of COVID-19 significantly predicts online self-disclosure over time (b = .24, P = .003) and happiness (b = -.14, P = .04) over time, but not psychological well-being (b = .03, P = .48). That is, stronger COVID-19 fears at T1 prompted more online self-disclosure and less happiness at T2. Online self-disclosure, on the other hand, significantly predicted happiness (b = .09, P = .02), but neither fear of COVID-19 (b = -.01, P = .57) nor psychological well-being (b = -.01, P = .57) over time. Participants who engaged more strongly in online self-disclosure at T1 felt happier at T2 but did not differ from less-disclosing participants concerning their COVID-19 fears and psychological well-being at T2. Importantly, happiness and psychological well-being were significantly related over time (happiness T1 -> psychological well-being T2: b = .11, P < .001; psychological well-being T1 -> happiness T2: b = .42, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that online self-disclosure might play a pivotal role in coping with pandemic stressors. Being restricted in their options, individuals increasingly turn to their smartphones and social media to disclose their feelings, problems, and concerns during lockdown. While online self-disclosure might not alleviate fears or improve psychological well-being, our results demonstrate that it made people experience more happiness during this crisis. This psychological resource may help them withstand severe over longer timeframes psychological consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.

We used the hybrid intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair (IPOM) plus method, which combines open and laparoscopic surgery to treat incarcerated umbilical hernia in a severely obese patient. CASE PRESENTATION A 46-year-old man presented in our department with a chief complaint of a painful mass in the umbilical region. Incarcerated umbilical hernia was diagnosed on the basis of abdominal computed tomography, and the decision was made to perform emergency surgery. The patient was severely obese (body mass index, 53.8 kg/m2), and the incarcerated portion of the hernia was therefore first addressed by open surgery. As bowel resection was unnecessary, the risk of infection was considered low, and after direct closure of the hernia orifice, IPOM was performed laparoscopically using the hybrid IPOM plus method. CONCLUSION Among severely obese patients, first trocar insertion is difficult and the wound site tends to come under strain, meaning that simple closure of the hernia orifice results in a high recurrence rate. The hybrid IPOM plus method used in this case combines open surgery and laparoscopy and appears useful for treating uninfected incarcerated umbilical hernia in severely obese patients safely and with an anticipated low rate of postoperative recurrence.","Yanari, Shingo; Suto, Takayuki; Fujiwara, Hisataka; Ariyoshi, Yu; Umemura, Akira; Sasaki, Akira",Surgical case reports,205,33

PET/CT using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET/CT) is one of the basic staging examinations with a certain prognostic significance and has recently been studied for the possibility of showing prognostic or predictive results suitable for the individualization of treatment strategy. PURPOSE The aim of this review is to map the role of 18-FDG-PET/CT in predicting the response to CHMT and CRT, which could be a starting point for personalized treatment. CONTENT The change in metabolic activity in the maximum standardized uptake value is most often used to quantify the treatment response; total lesion glycolysis is a volumetric parameter. A method for standardizing measurements was offered in the PERCIST system. Several studies have been published showing that the decrease in metabolic activity after chemotherapy correlates with a surrogate measure of the treatment outcome, which is the degree of tumor regression in the resected tissue, but also with survival or time to progression. The cut-off value separating sensitive and resistant tumors varied from 33 to 78%, the measurement took place either at the end of neoadjuvant treatment or „early“, about 2 weeks after the first cycle of CHMT. However, this value has not yet been validated and the parameters of sensitivity, specificity and negative and positive predictive values for the prediction of treatment outcome fluctuated significantly. In the case of preoperative CRT, PET/CT could not predict the complete response to the treatment with satisfactory accuracy. Studies using early metabolic response to change the treatment strategies in non-responders have not yet shown whether changing the treatment in patients without an early metabolic response to CHMT will improve survival. In the case of randomization, a standard arm with a continuation of the original CHMT was never used. CONCLUSION Evaluation of an early PET-based response has the potential to modify the treatment in patients who have not demonstrated an early response to CHMT. However, this is not an approach suitable for routine practice outside of clinical trials. So far, it seems possible to use an early metabolic response for small, exploratory studies evaluating new agents and their combinations in the preoperative treatment of localized esophageal cancer or gastroesophageal junction cancer.","Zemanová, M; Obermannová, R; Haruštiak, T",Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,205,1

QUIN also regulates glutamate uptake into neurons, which may be due to modulation of Na+-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). To determine the biological relationships between QUIN and glutamate dysfunction, we first quantified the functionality and kinetics of [3H]QUIN uptake in primary human neurons using liquid scintillation. We then measured changes in the protein expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT3 and EAAT1b in primary neurons treated with QUIN and the EAAT inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid (2,4-PDC) using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was further used to elucidate intracellular transport of exogenous QUIN and the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). Structural insights into the binding between QUIN and EAAT3 were further investigated using molecular docking techniques. We report significant temperature-dependent high-affinity transport leading to neuronal uptake of [3H]QUIN with a Km of 42.2 μM, and a Vmax of 9.492 pmol/2 min/mg protein, comparable with the uptake of glutamate. We also found that QUIN increases expression of the EAAT3 monomer while decreasing the functional trimer. QUIN uptake into primary neurons was shown to involve EAAT3 as uptake was significantly attenuated following EAAT inhibition. We also demonstrated that QUIN increases the expression of aberrant EAAT1b protein in neurons further implicating QUIN-induced glutamate dysfunction. Furthermore, we demonstrated that QUIN is metabolised exclusively in lysosomes. The involvement of EAAT3 as a modulator for QUIN uptake was further confirmed using molecular docking. This study is the first to characterise a mechanism for QUIN uptake into primary human neurons involving EAAT3, opening potential targets to attenuate QUIN-induced excitotoxicity in neuroinflammatory diseases.","Braidy, Nady; Alicajic, Hayden; Pow, David; Smith, Jason; Jugder, Bat-Erdene; Brew, Bruce J; Nicolazzo, Joseph A; Guillemin, Gilles J",Molecular neurobiology,205,1

However, the effects on breast cancer screening in lower income populations are unknown. This study examined changes in breast cancer screening rates (BCSRs) during the pandemic among 32 community health centers (CHCs) that provided health care to lower income populations. METHODS Secondary data from 32 CHCs participating in an American Cancer Society grant program to increase breast cancer screening services were used. BCSRs were defined as the percentage of women aged 50 to 74 years who had a medical visit in the past 12 months (142,207 in 2018, 142,003 in 2019, and 150,630 in 2020) and received a screening mammogram within the last 27 months. BCSRs in July 2020, July 2019, and June 2018 were compared with screening rate ratios (SRRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS BCSRs significantly rose by 18% between 2018 and 2019 (from 45.8% to 53.9%; SRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.17-1.18) and then declined by 8% between 2019 and 2020 (from 53.9% to 49.6%; SRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.92-0.93). If the 2018-2019 BCSR trends had continued through 2020, 63.3% of women would have been screened in 2020 in contrast to the 49.6% who were; this potentially translated into 47,517 fewer mammograms and 242 missed breast cancer diagnoses in this population. CONCLUSIONS In this study of 32 CHCs, BCSRs declined by 8% from July 2019 to 2020, and this reversed an 18% improvement between July 2018 and 2019. Declining BCSRs among CHCs during the COVID-19 pandemic call for policies to support and resources to identify women in need of screening.","Fedewa, Stacey A; Cotter, Megan M; Wehling, Kristen A; Wysocki, Karla; Killewald, Richard; Makaroff, Laura",Cancer,205,31

There were 5 males and 12 females, aged 14-22 years, with an average of 17.7 years. The patella dislocated for 2 to 8 times (mean, 3.6 times). The disease duration was 2-7 years (mean, 4.6 years). The patellar apprehension tests were positive. Preoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS) score, Lysholm score, Tegner score, and Kujala score were 4.2±1.1, 47.8±8.1, 3.6±1.1, and 56.8±5.7, respectively.

In the wake of several high-profile police killings, the United States has begun another reckoning with structural racism, injustice, and violence against Black Americans. The objectives of this project were to explore the impact of racialized sociopolitical events on Black Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students.Methods. Focus groups were conducted with second to fourth-year Black PharmD students enrolled at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Pharmacy. The focus groups were conducted in summer 2020, beginning two months after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police officers and concluding before the start of the fall semester. Data analysis was conducted using a phenomenological approach, and themes were identified using inductive coding.Results. Twenty-four participants were recruited into five focus group sessions. Thematic Analysis of the transcripts resulted in three distinct themes related to the study objectives: Vicarious Trauma, Hypervigilance, and Fight or Flight Responses. The study results show that Black students experience significant psychological distress due to prominent racially traumatic events. Black students may withdraw from non-Black persons due to hypersensitivity and anxiety or they may be willing to engage in candid conversations.Conclusion.

Therapy for symptoms must remain flexible and individualized because the specific needs of the patient will change as disease progresses. Because strangulation is uncommon, malignant bowel obstruction is usually not a surgical emergency. There is usually time to proceed with deliberate and thoughtful decisions on how best to meet the needs and expectations of the individual patient and family. Providers must be well versed in both surgical and nonsurgical therapeutic options, the natural history of disease, and be active and compassionate providers to foster meaningful ongoing dialogue focused on excellent care even after cure is no longer possible. The palliative triangle not only allows patient, family, and surgeon to effectively utilize the full continuum of care that can be delivered, but also it supports end-of-life decisions when continuity in care matters most. Due to social distancing requirements, the dynamics of communication between patient, family, and surgeon have changed.

However, the exact mechanisms on how the number and position of branches are determined are still not fully understood. Here, we investigated the role of Arl8B, an adaptor molecule between lysosomes and kinesins. In chick retinal ganglion cells, downregulation of Arl8B reduces axon branch density and shifts their location more proximally, while Arl8B overexpression leads to increased density and more distal positions of branches. These alterations correlate with changes in the location and density of lysosomes and autophagosomes along the axon shaft. Diminishing autophagy directly by knockdown of atg7, a key autophagy gene, reduces branch density, while induction of autophagy by rapamycin increases axon branching, indicating that autophagy plays a prominent role in axon branch formation. In vivo, local inactivation of autophagy in the retina using a mouse conditional knockout approach disturbs retino-collicular map formation which is dependent on the formation of interstitial axon branches. These data suggest that Arl8B plays a principal role in the positioning of axon branches by spatially controlling autophagy, thus directly controlling formation of neural connectivity in the brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe formation of interstitial axonal branches plays a prominent role in numerous places of the developing brain during neural circuit establishment. We show here that the GTPase Arl8B controls density and location of interstitial axon branches, and at the same time controls also density and location of the autophagy machinery. Up- or down-regulation of autophagy in vitro promotes or inhibits axon branching. Local disruption of autophagy in vivo disturbs retino-collicular mapping. Our data suggest that Arl8B controls axon branching by controlling locally autophagy. This work is one of the first reports showing a role of autophagy during early neural circuit development and suggests that autophagy in general plays a much more prominent role during brain development than previously anticipated.","Adnan, Gee; Rubikaite, Aine; Khan, Moqadisa; Reber, Michael; Suetterlin, Philip; Hindges, Robert; Drescher, Uwe",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,205,1

Participation in the quality assurance study is voluntary. Since 2005, 3,125 sleeve gastrectomies have been performed in 80 hospitals. The number of procedures has increased from 1 in 2005 to 1,564 in 2010. Initially, the leakage rate was 7 % in 2007. The leakage rate dropped to 1.7 in 2010. The mean age of patients was 43.5 years and mean body mass index (BMI) was 52.03 kg/m(2). BMI and comorbidities are significantly higher in male than in female patients. The leakage rate in female patients was, at 1.60 %, significantly lower than in male patients, at 3.28 %. Sleeve gastrectomy is becoming more and more popular in Germany.

Vascular reactivity can be monitored with a moving linear correlation of blood pressure to cerebral blood volume trended with near-infrared spectroscopy (hemoglobin volume index, HVx). We hypothesized that the lower limits of autoregulation (LLA) and the optimal blood pressure (ABPopt) associated with the most active autoregulation could be determined by HVx in patients undergoing CPB. METHODS Adult patients (n = 109) who underwent CPB for cardiac surgery had monitoring of both autoregulation (Mx) and vascular reactivity (HVx). Individual curves of Mx and HVx were constructed by placing each in 5 mmHg bins. The LLA and ABPopt for each subject were then identified by both methods and compared for agreement by correlation analysis and Bland-Altman. RESULTS The average LLA defined by Mx compared to HVx were comparable (66±13 and 66±12 mmHg). Correlation between the LLA defined by Mx and HVx was significant (Pearson r = 0.2867; P = 0.0068). The average ABPopt with the most robust autoregulation by Mx was comparable to HVx (75±11 and 74±13 mmHg) with significant correlation (Pearson r = 0.5915; P < or =0.0001). DISCUSSION Autoregulation and vascular reactivity monitoring are expected to be distinct, as flow and volume have different phasic relationships to pressure when cerebrovascular autoregulation is active. However, the two metrics have good agreement when identifying the LLA and optimal blood pressure in patients during CPB.","Blaine Easley, R; Kibler, Kathleen K; Brady, Kenneth M; Joshi, Brijen; Ono, Masahiro; Brown, Charles; Hogue, Charles W",Neurological research,205,29

We compared clinical and angiographic outcomes and complication rates in 2 groups of patients with unruptured carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms treated for 7 years by either standard coil-based techniques or flow diversion. MATERIALS AND METHODS From February 2006 to December 2013, 162 unruptured carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms were treated endovascularly in 138 patients. Sixty-seven aneurysms were treated by coil-based techniques in 61 patients. Flow diverters were deployed in 95 unruptured aneurysms (77 patients), with additional coiling in 27 patients. Complication rates, clinical outcome, and immediate and long-term angiographic results were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS No procedure-related deaths occurred. Four procedure-related thromboembolic events (6.6%) leading to permanent morbidity in 1 case (1.6%) occurred in the coiling group. Neurologic complications were observed in 6 patients (7.8%) in the flow-diversion group, resulting in 3.9% permanent morbidity. No statistically significant difference was found between complication (P = .9) and morbidity rates (P = .6). In the coiling group (median follow-up, 31.5 ± 24.5 months), recanalization occurred at 1 year in 23/50 (54%) aneurysms and 27/55 aneurysms (50.9%) at the latest follow-up, leading to retreatment in 6 patients (9%). In the flow-diversion group (mean follow-up, 13.5 ± 10.8 months), 85.3% (35/41) of all aneurysms were occluded after 12 months, and 74.6% (50/67) on latest follow-up. The retreatment rate was 2.1%. Occlusion rates between the 2 groups differed significantly at 12 months (P < .001) and at the latest follow-up (P < .005). CONCLUSIONS Our retrospective analysis shows better long-term occlusion of carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms after use of flow diverters compared with standard coil-based techniques, without significant differences in permanent morbidity.","Di Maria, F; Pistocchi, S; Clarençon, F; Bartolini, B; Blanc, R; Biondi, A; Redjem, H; Chiras, J; Sourour, N; Piotin, M",AJNR.

Inhibitory neural feedback associated with activation of mechano- and metabo-sensitive muscle afferents has been implicated in this phenomenon. This study aimed to quantify and compare the effects of pre-induced fatigue and concurrent rising pain (evoked by muscle ischemia) on the contralateral leg exercise capacity, neuromuscular performance, and corticomotor excitability and inhibition of knee extensor muscles. Pre-induced fatigue in one leg had a greater detrimental effect than the concurrent rising pain on the contralateral limb cycling capacity. Furthermore, pre-induced fatigue, but not concurrent rising pain, reduced corticospinal inhibition recorded from tested contralateral muscles. Regardless of the origin or mechanisms modulating sensory afferents during single-leg cycling exercise (i.e. pre-induced fatigue vs. concurrent rising pain), the limit of exercise tolerance remained the same and exercise was terminated upon achievement of a sensory tolerance limit. ABSTRACT Individuals often need to maintain voluntary contractions during high intensity exercise in the presence of fatigue and pain. This investigation examined the effects of pre-induced fatigue and concurrent rising pain (evoked by muscle ischemia) in one leg on motor fatigability and corticospinal excitability/inhibition of the contralateral limb. Twelve healthy males undertook four experimental protocols including unilateral cycling to task failure at 80% of peak power output with i) the right-leg (RL), ii) the left-leg (LL), iii) RL immediately preceded by LL protocol (FAT-RL) and (iv) RL while blood flow was occluded in the contralateral (left) leg (PAIN-RL). Participants performed maximal and submaximal 5-s right-leg knee extensions during which transcranial magnetic and femoral nerve electrical stimuli were delivered to elicit motor evoked (MEP) and compound muscle action potentials (Mmax), respectively. The pre-induced fatigue reduced the right leg cycling time-to-task failure (Mean±SD; 332 ± 137 s) to a greater extent than concurrent pain (460 ± 158 s), compared to RL (580 ± 226 s) (P<0.001). The MVC force declined less following FAT-RL (P<0.019) and PAIN-RL (P<0.032) compared to RL. Voluntary activation declined, and the corticospinal excitability recorded from knee extensors increased, similarly after the three conditions (P<0.05). However, the pre-induced fatigue, but not concurrent pain, reduced corticospinal inhibition compared to RL (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that regardless of the origin and/or mechanisms modulating sensory afferent feedback during single-leg cycling (e.g. pre-induced fatigue vs. concurrent rising pain), the limit of exercise tolerance remains the same, suggesting that exercise will be terminated upon achievement of sensory tolerance limit.

OBJECTIVE To describe the incidence of outcomes during and after the periprocedural period among Medicare beneficiaries undergoing CAS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational study with a mean follow-up time of approximately 2 years among 22,516 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries at least 66 years old undergoing CAS (2005-2009) who were linked to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' CAS database. Database procedure dates were required to fall during a Medicare hospitalization for CAS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Periprocedural (30-day) and long-term risks of mortality and stroke or transient ischemic attack, as well as periprocedural myocardial infarction. Subgroups were based on sociodemographic, clinical, and center-level factors, as well as the Stenting and Angioplasty With Protection in Patients at High Risk for Endarterectomy (SAPPHIRE) trial or Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy vs Stenting Trial (CREST) enrollment criteria. RESULTS The mean patient age was 76.3 years, 60.5% were male, 93.8% were of white race, 91.2% were at high surgical risk, 47.4% were symptomatic, and 97.4% had carotid stenosis of at least 70%. Crude 30-day mortality, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction risks were 1.7% (95% CI, 1.5%-1.8%), 3.3% (95% CI, 3.0%-3.5%), and 2.5% (95% CI, 2.3%-2.7%), respectively. Mortality during a mean follow-up time of 2 years was 32.0% (95% CI, 31.0%-33.0%), with rates of 37.3% (95% CI, 35.8%-38.7%) among symptomatic patients and 27.7% (95% CI, 26.4%-28.9%) among asymptomatic patients. Older age, symptomatic carotid stenosis, and nonelective hospital admission were associated with increased adjusted hazards of mortality and stroke or transient ischemic attack during and after the periprocedural period. The presence of a stroke center, government ownership, and a hospital bed capacity of 500 or more were associated with increased adjusted hazards of periprocedural mortality and stroke or transient ischemic attack. Few patients met the SAPPHIRE trial or CREST enrollment criteria primarily because physicians did not meet proficiency requirements either due to exceeding periprocedural complication trial thresholds or not meeting minimum CAS volume requirements. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Competing risks may limit the benefits of CAS in certain Medicare beneficiaries, particularly among older and symptomatic patients who have higher periprocedural and long-term mortality risks. The generalizability of trials like the SAPPHIRE or CREST to the Medicare population may be limited, underscoring the need to evaluate real-world effectiveness of carotid stenosis treatments.","Jalbert, Jessica J; Nguyen, Louis L; Gerhard-Herman, Marie D; Jaff, Michael R; White, Christopher J; Rothman, Andrew T; Seeger, John D; Kumamaru, Hiraku; Williams, Lauren A; Chen, Chih-Ying; Liu, Jun; Tsai, Thomas T; Aronow, Herbert D; Johnston, Joseph A; Brott, Thomas G; Setoguchi, Soko",JAMA neurology,205,17

Logistic regression analysis was used to obtain an adjusted odds ratio for rapid weight loss and hernia development. RESULTS We reviewed all 934 LGB procedures performed. The average initial BMI was 49.1 kg/m2 (range=34-91 kg/m2). EWL based on our current averages at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively were 20, 40, 60, 75, and 85%. We statistically defined rapid EWL as greater than the 90th percentile for weight loss. Rapid EWL was noted in 33.2% (310/934) of patients. Fifty-eight (6.2%) patients were identified with IH. Of these, 27(46.5%) had periods of rapid EWL (odds ratio [OR]=1.83; 95% CI=1.07, 3.02). Bivariate analysis of patient factors that led to rapid EWL identified initial BMI (49.3 vs. 46.6 kg/m2) and rapid EWL as increasing the likelihood of developing IH (p=0.026). A multivariate logistic model for IH identified only rapid EWL as a predictive factor. Locations of IH were the jejunojejunostomy (24), Pedersen's defect (23), adhesions (9), and colonic mesentery (1). There were five patients with combined JJ and Pederson's hernias. CONCLUSION Outcomes from missed IH can be catastrophic. In our large, single-center series, we have found that patients who undergo periods of rapid EWL are at nearly twice the risk for development of IH as the rest of the gastric bypass population.","Schneider, Christopher; Cobb, William; Scott, John; Carbonell, Alfredo; Myers, Katie; Bour, Eric",Surgical endoscopy,205,1
148507,148507,148507,Introducing laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer in general practice: a retrospective cohort study based on a nationwide registry database in Japan.,11.265285,5.4115825,2019,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in dramatic changes to sleep patterns and higher prevalence of insomnia, which threaten overall mental and physical health. We examined whether safety behaviors in response to COVID-19, worry in response to COVID-19, and depression predicted insomnia, with age, race, and sex as covariates. A community sample from the United States (n = 321, Mage = 40.02, SD = 10.54; 53.6% female) recruited using online crowdsourcing completed self-report measures in May of 2020 and again three months later. At baseline, our model accounted for 68.1% of the variance in insomnia, with depression as the only significant predictor (β = .70, p < .001). In the longitudinal analyses, only baseline insomnia symptoms predicted 3-month follow-up insomnia symptoms (β = .70, p < .001; 67.1% of variance). Of note, COVID-19 worry and some COVID-19 safety behaviors were related to 3-month follow-up safety behaviors, but not insomnia. Our findings demonstrated that depression is an important factor to consider for concurrent insomnia symptoms. Our results have implications regarding the development of interventions for insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest that clinicians should consider depression when assessing for and treating insomnia symptoms.","Pizzonia, Kendra L; Koscinski, Brandon; Suhr, Julie A; Accorso, Catherine; Allan, Darcey M; Allan, Nicholas P",Cognitive behaviour therapy,205,16

Historically, the inability to seal vessels in the 5-7 mm range has been perceived as an inherent limitation of ultrasonic technology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sealing of vessels up to 7 mm in diameter with an ultrasonic device that modulates energy delivery during the sealing period. METHODS In ex vivo benchtop and in vivo acute and survival preclinical models, a new ultrasonic device, Harmonic ACE(®)+7 Shears (Harmonic 7), was compared with advanced bipolar devices in sealing vessels 1-7 mm in diameter with respect of burst pressure, seal reliability, and seal durability. Lateral thermal damage and transection time were also evaluated. RESULTS Ex vivo tests of Harmonic 7 demonstrated significantly greater median burst pressures than an advanced bipolar device both for vessels <5 mm in diameter (1,078 mmHg and 836 mmHg, respectively, P=0.046) and for those in the range of 5-7 mm (1,419 mmHg and 591 mmHg, P<0.001). In vivo tests in porcine and caprine models demonstrated similar rates of hemostasis between Harmonic 7 and advanced bipolar devices, with high success rates at initial transection and seal durability of 100% after a 30-day survival period. CONCLUSION Sealing 5-7 mm vessels is not a limitation of the type of energy used but of how energy is delivered to tissue. These studies document the ability of ultrasonic energy alone to reliably seal large vessels 5-7 mm in diameter, with significantly greater burst pressure observed in in vitro studies than those observed with an advanced bipolar technology when energy delivery is modulated during the sealing cycle. Furthermore, the seals created in 5-7 mm vessels are shown to be reliable and durable in in vivo preclinical studies.","Timm, Richard W; Asher, Ryan M; Tellio, Karalyn R; Welling, Alissa L; Clymer, Jeffrey W; Amaral, Joseph F",Medical devices,205,30

We investigated the potential of grapevine cv Askari in phytoremediation of heavy metal (HM) pollutions. In total 80 grapevine seedlings were exposed to four levels of HM stress (mild, low, moderate, and severe) in greenhouse condition during two growing years (2018 and 2019). The HM concentrations (Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Pb) were subsequently determined in the soils, roots, and grapevine aboveground parts (AGPs), and then phytoextraction and phytostabilization potential assessment indices, i.e., biological absorption coefficient (BAC), bioconcentration factor (BCF), and translocation factor (TF), were calculated. Results led to ranking of the cumulative concentration order of the HMs, i.e.: soils (3476.6) > AGPs (1418.8) > roots (562.2) mg/kg-DW. The mean concentrations ranking order of studied HMs were in soil: Cu (1184.8) > Pb (865.5) > Cd (803.2) > Cr (623.0) > Zn (277.9) mg/kg-DW; roots, Cu (242.0) > Cd (239.5) > Zn (188.8) > Pb (63.5) > Cr (17.2) mg/kg-DW; and AGP environments, Cu (910.2) > Cd (322.9) > Zn (160.3) > Pb (152.9) > Cr (25.3) mg/kg-DW. Principal component analysis results demonstrated the same distribution pattern for the studied HMs between soil, root, and AGP environments, and the highest correlation coefficients were found for Cu, Zn, and Cd. Based on the obtained results (Cu-BAC (> 1), Zn-BCF (> 1), Zn-TF (< 1), Cu-AGP mean concentrations (> 1000 mg/kg-DW), and Cd-AGP mean concentrations (> 100 mg/kg-DW)), it can be concluded that grapevine cv Askari possesses potentials for phytoremediation purposes of Cu, Zn, and Cd. These results were acquired in a greenhouse environment and under controlled conditions; we suggest that the phytoremediation potential of this grapevine variety be assessed in a contaminated vineyard environment as well.","Mirzaei, Mohsen; Verrelst, Jochem; Bakhtiari, Alireza Riyahi; Marofi, Safar",Environmental science and pollution research international,205,19

METHOD The patient group (n = 84) and the healthy controls (HCs, n = 92) filled in the questionnaire including the socio-demographic form, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced through the online survey link. RESULTS The COVID-19 patients had higher perceived social support and coping strategies scores than the HCs. However, anxiety and depression scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. In logistic regression analysis performed in COVID-19 patients, the presence of chest CT finding (OR = 4.31; 95% CI = 1.04-17.95) was a risk factor for anxiety and the use of adaptive coping strategies (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.73-0.99) had a negative association with anxiety. In addition, the use of adaptive coping strategies (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79-0.98) and high perceived social support (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.93- 0,99) had a negative association with depression symptoms.

The aim of this study was to compare cats with lymphoma between 1980 and 1994 (first period) and between 1995 and 2009 (second period) concerning FeLV antigenaemia and age distribution. In addition, differences between FeLV antigen-positive and antigen-negative cats with lymphoma regarding patients' characteristics, tumour location and outcome were evaluated. There was a significant decrease in the percentage of lymphoma cases associated with progressive FeLV infection from the first (59 per cent) to the second (13 per cent) observation period. FeLV antigen-positive cats were significantly younger (median 3.7 v 11.3 years), and had significantly shorter response duration (median 25 days v 472 days) with therapy. In the cats of the second period, gastrointestinal and extranodal lymphomas were the most common anatomical sites, and the majority of those cats were FeLV antigen-negative. Thus, other aetiologies than progressive FeLV infection must have a greater impact on cancerogenesis among affected cats with lymphoma to date.","Meichner, K; Kruse, D B; Hirschberger, J; Hartmann, K",The Veterinary record,205,31

The resulting international validation and lengthy acceptance and implementation process of what are called now monocyte activation tests (MATs) finally is impacting on animal numbers - at least in Europe - reducing them by more than 70% and counting. The author sees no reason for continuing any regulatory rabbit testing for pyrogens except the lack of acceptance of MATs in some regions of the world. The availability of MATs has opened also the discussion about the shortcomings of LAL/BET, namely its restriction to Gram-negative pyrogens, non-reflection of the potency of these in humans, interference and masking by many products, and animal welfare concerns for horseshoe crabs. The obvious advantages of MATs in all these respects should lead to a shift from LAL/BET to MATs. We are starting to see this for vac-cines and medical devices, but other areas like safety testing of blood transfusions, cell therapies and nanomaterials, and the assessment of air-borne pyrogens still need to grasp the opportunity provided by MATs. While the different MATs can jointly serve these needs, the whole blood MAT has some advantages as discussed here.","Hartung, Thomas",ALTEX,205,26

Rapidly and sensitively detecting SARS-CoV-2 viruses can help control the spread of viruses. However, it is an arduous challenge to apply semiconductor-based substrates for virus SERS detection due to their poor sensitivity. Therefore, it is worthwhile to search novel semiconductor-based substrates with excellent SERS sensitivity. Herein we report, for the first time, Nb2C and Ta2C MXenes exhibit a remarkable SERS enhancement, which is synergistically enabled by the charge transfer resonance enhancement and electromagnetic enhancement. Their SERS sensitivity is optimized to 3.0 × 106 and 1.4 × 106 under the optimal resonance excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Additionally, remarkable SERS sensitivity endows Ta2C MXenes with capability to sensitively detect and accurately identify the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Moreover, its detection limit is as low as 5 × 10-9 M, which is beneficial to achieve real-time monitoring and early warning of novel coronavirus. This research not only provides helpful theoretical guidance for exploring other novel SERS-active semiconductor-based materials but also provides a potential candidate for the practical applications of SERS technology.","Peng, Yusi; Lin, Chenglong; Long, Li; Masaki, Tanemura; Tang, Mao; Yang, Lili; Liu, Jianjun; Huang, Zhengren; Li, Zhiyuan; Luo, Xiaoying; Lombardi, John R; Yang, Yong",Nano-micro letters,205,24

The aim of this study was to determine whether the 3D laparoscopy is beneficial in transabdominal preperitoneal laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (TAPP). METHOD In this prospective, single-blinded, single-center, superior randomized trial, patients scheduled for TAPP were randomly allocated to either 3D or two-dimensional (2D) TAPP laparoscopic approaches. Patients were excluded if secondary operation was planned, the risk of conversion was high, or the surgeon had less than five previous 3D laparoscopic procedures. Patients were operated on by 13 residents and 3 attendings. The primary endpoint was operation time. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02367573). RESULTS Total 278 patients were randomized between 5th February 2015 and 23rd October 2017. Median operation time was shorter in the 3D group (56.0 min vs. 68.0 min, p < 0.001). 10 (8%) patients in 3D group and 6 (5%) patients in 2D group had clinically significant complications (Clavien-Dindo 2 or higher) (p = 0.440). Rate of hernia recurrence was similar between groups at 1-year follow-up. In the subgroup analyses, operation time was shorter in 3D laparoscopy among attendings, residents, female surgeons, surgeons with perfect stereovision, surgeons with > 50 3D laparoscopic procedures, surgeons with any experience in TAPP, patients with body mass indices < 30, and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs. CONCLUSION 3D laparoscopy is beneficial and shortens operation time but does not affect safety or long-term outcomes of TAPP.","Koppatz, Hanna E; Harju, Jukka I; Sirén, Jukka E; Mentula, Panu J; Scheinin, Tom M; Sallinen, Ville J",Surgical endoscopy,205,1

Background. Learning from the SARS epidemic pointed to the importance of quality nursing practice considerations that minimize cross-transmission of infection while maximizing patient-focused care. Hence, a modular nursing model was adopted. DESIGN AND METHOD This study comprised pre- and postintervention phases. Data collection tools to evaluate modular nursing practice included a work sampling observation checklist, focused group interviews with nurses, questionnaires addressing nurses' perceived competence and caring attributes, a patient satisfaction questionnaire, and a hand hygiene audit. A series of education sessions were conducted between the two phases. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used for data triangulation. RESULTS Modular nursing practice, focusing on continuity of care, led to changes in the nature of direct care activities and improvement in patient/family education frequency. Also, a general increase in nurses' hand washing frequency was noted. However, when nurses perceived time pressure, a lapse in hand hygiene compliance was found. Because of human resource and inefficiency issues, some nurses in the studied wards did not embrace geographical separation for infection control. Positive correlations were found for nurses' perceived infection control practice competence and their perceived caring attributes. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE In examining nursing practice models within complex clinical situations, the significance lies not only in the model's effects but also in other operational outcomes.","Chan, Engle Angela; Chung, Joanne W Y; Wong, Thomas K S",Journal of clinical nursing,205,29

Predisposition plays a major role in about 5-10% of adult cancers and in certain childhood tumors. As access to genomic testing for cancer patients continues to expand, the identification of potential germline pathogenic variants (PGPVs) through tumor-DNA sequencing is also increasing. Statistical methods have been developed to infer the presence of a PGPV without the need of a matched normal sample. These methods are mainly used for exploratory research, for example in real-world clinico-genomic databases/platforms (CGDB). These databases are being developed to support many applications, such as targeted drug development, clinical trial optimization, and postmarketing studies. To ensure the integrity of data used for research, a quality management system should be established, and quality oversight activities should be conducted to assess and mitigate clinical quality risks (for patient safety and data integrity). As opposed to well-defined 'good practice' quality guidelines (GxP) areas such as good clinical practice, there are no comprehensive instructions on how to assess the clinical quality of statistically derived variables from sequencing data such as PGPVs. In this article, we aim to share our strategy and propose a possible set of tactics to assess the PGPV quality and to ensure data integrity in exploratory research.","Ménard, Timothé; Rolo, Donato; Koneswarakantha, Björn",Pharmaceutical medicine,205,1

There is a great demand for novel chemical agents that are capable of killing specific pathogens or augmenting the efficiency of existing disinfectants. Herein, we report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization (through FT-IR, HR-MS, SEM, TGA-DSC, CV, UV and SCXRD analyses) of six novel copper(ii) complexes, [CuL(4X-An)] (5a-5d), [CuL(An)] (5e), and [CuL(benzhydrylamine)] (5f), and their evaluation as anti-microbial agents against WHO priority pathogens, confirming their possible use in hospital settings. The compounds were synthesized with a Schiff base (H2L) obtained by the condensation reaction of 3-acetyl-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2,4(3H)-dione (DHA) and benzohydrazide and further addition of different p-substituted aniline (An) molecules. Single crystal structure analyses revealed that the aniline derivatives are isostructural to the copper atom in a square planar coordination, while the benzhydrylamine complex forms a dimer (5f), with a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the metal. Time-kill kinetics and reduced microbial recovery studies revealed excellent bactericidal action against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Particularly, the novel compound 5f significantly reduced microbial recovery compared to ethanol-based sanitisers. In fact, addition of 5f to 70% ethanol remarkably synergized the killing with >6-log reduction in microbial burden. Overall, our novel compounds would increase the disinfection efficacy in hospitals and industries, thereby improving the efficiency and minimizing the risk of infections.","Richa,; Kushwaha, Namrata; Negi, Sheetal; Kumar, Ajay; Zangrando, Ennio; Kataria, Ramesh; Saini, Vikram",Dalton transactions,205,26

Yet, field evidence regarding how norms might be linked to perceived risk of sanction is limited. In this study, we focused on communities located in peri-urban areas of Tamil Nadu, India, and examined how people's perceived prevalence of a socially desirable behavior (i.e., toilet use) relates to the perceived risk of sanctions for deviating from this behavior (i.e., open defecation) in the sanitation domain. Cross-sectional data from 2427 participants in 75 communities revealed that the majority (77%, n = 1861) perceived the risk of informal sanctions related to open defecation. Among those, verbal reprimand was the most common (60%), followed by advice (30%) and gossip (7%). Results from multilevel logistic regression indicated that those who believed toilet use was prevalent in their community were more likely to perceive the risk of social sanctions for open defecation. Moderation analysis revealed that this relationship was robust among women, but attenuated among men. Our findings suggest that women are more likely to expect social sanctions if they deviate from what is perceived as the prevalent sanitation behavior (e.g., toilet use) in their community. Open defecation practices are known to cause psychosocial stress among women due to their experiences with sanitation insecurity, which may include fear of disapproval from community members. Our results highlight the need for gendered intervention strategies when sanitation programs leverage social influence for behavior change.","Kuang, Jinyi; Ashraf, Sania; Shpenev, Alex; Delea, Maryann Greene; Das, Upasak; Bicchieri, Cristina",PloS one,205,5

When using indirect VL, it has been suggested that it may be preferable to obtain a deliberately restricted view of the larynx to facilitate passage of the endotracheal tube. We used the GlideScope® GVL video laryngoscope (GVL) to test whether deliberately obtaining a restricted view would result in faster and easier tracheal intubation than with a full view of the larynx. METHODS We recruited 163 elective surgical patients and randomly allocated the participants to one of two groups: Group F, where a full view of the larynx was obtained and held during GVL-facilitated tracheal intubation, and Group R, with a restricted view of the larynx (< 50% of glottic opening visible). Study investigators experienced in indirect VL performed the intubations. The intubations were recorded and the video recordings were subsequently assessed for total time to intubation, ease of intubation using a visual analogue scale (VAS; where 0 = easy and 100 = difficult), first-attempt success rate, and oxygen saturation after intubation. Complications were also assessed. RESULTS The median [interquartile range (IQR)] time to intubation was faster in Group R than in Group F (27 [22-36] sec vs 36 [27-48] sec, respectively; median difference, 9 sec; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 13; P < 0.001). The median [IQR] VAS rating for ease of intubation was also better in Group R than in Group F (14 [6-42) mm vs 50 mm [17-65], respectively; median difference, 20 mm; 95% CI, 10 to 31; P < 0.001). There was no difference between groups regarding the first-attempt success rate, oxygen saturation immediately after intubation, or complications. CONCLUSIONS Using the GVL with a deliberately restricted view of the larynx resulted in faster and easier tracheal intubation than with a full view and with no additional complications. Our study suggests that obtaining a full or Cormack-Lehane grade 1 view may not be desirable when using the GVL.

152976,152976,152976,The Effect of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Physician Assistant Educators.,11.0385,5.3915334,2020-07-28,"BACKGROUND The emerging infection of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in late December, 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused an extreme health concern, with many patients having progressed to acute respiratory disease or other complications in a short period. Meanwhile, the risk factors associated with the disease progression still remain elusive. METHODS A cohort of 17 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infections who were admitted to the Ninth Hospital of Nanchang between January 28 and February 6, 2020, were enrolled in this study. All the patients received standardized treatment. The disease progression was evaluated every 7 days after admission. The clinical, radiologic, and laboratory characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the factors associated with the disease progression were screened by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The cohort comprised 11 women (64.7%) and 6 men (35.3%) between the ages of 18 to 70 years old. All patients had a reported history of contact with infection-confirmed patients. Fever (11/64.7%) and cough (8/47.1%) were the most common symptoms, whereas dyspnea (2/11.8%) and fatigue (3/17.6%) were rare, and there was no patient with diarrhea symptoms. There were 5 patients with aggravated disease at the first disease progression evaluation, and no patient received mechanical ventilation, transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), or progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, or death. Based on the disease progression, patients were divided into the non-aggravation group (12 cases) and the aggravation group (5 cases). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to their clinical characteristics. Chest computed tomography (CT) on admission revealed there were 8 patients (47.1%) with invasive lesions found bilaterally on the lungs on multiple lobes, 4 patients (23.5%) with invasive lesions on 1 lobe, and 5 patients (29.4%) with normal chest CT. The aggravation group had1 patient (20.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 3 (60.0%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 1 (20.0%) with normal chest CT; meanwhile, the nonaggravation group had 3 patients (25.0%) with invasive lesions on one lobe, 5 (41.7%) with invasive lesions on multiple lobes, bilaterally, and 4 (33.3%) with normal chest CT. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. In the aggravation group, the total lymphocyte counts significantly decreased in comparison to that in the non-aggravation group. Further analysis showed that the CD4+ T cell count but not the CD8+ T cell count of the aggravation group was significantly lower than that of the non-aggravation group. Correlation analysis indicated total lymphocyte count was positively correlated with CD4+ T cell count, and no significant differences were found between the 2 groups in other laboratory measurements, including those of white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer. Finally, a binary logistic regression model was used to identify the factors associated with the disease progression. It was found that total lymphocyte count was a risk factor associated with disease progression in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. CONCLUSIONS A higher cell count of total lymphocytes may indicate a better outcome of the disease, and immune response may be a vital factor for directing disease progression in the early stage of 2019-nCoV infection.","Zhou, Yulong; Zhang, Zhicheng; Tian, Jie; Xiong, Shaoyun",Annals of palliative medicine,205,1

However, this test is associated with increased risks of viral dissemination and environmental contamination and shows relatively low sensitivity, attributable to technical deficiencies in the sampling method. Given that COVID-19 is transmitted via exhaled aerosols and droplets, and that exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is an established modality for sampling exhaled aerosols, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in EBC offers a promising diagnostic approach. However, current knowledge on the detection and load of the virus in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients remains limited and inconsistent. The objective of the study was to quantify the viral load in EBC collected from COVID-19 patients and to validate the feasibility of SARS-CoV-2 detection from EBC as a diagnostic test for the infection. METHOD EBC samples were collected from 48 COVID-19 patients using a collection device, and viral loads were quantified by RT-PCR targeting the E gene. Changes in detection rates and viral loads relative to patient characteristics and days since disease onset were statistically evaluated. RESULTS Need for mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with higher viral load (p<0.05). Need for oxygen administration or mechanical ventilation, less than 3 days since onset, and presence of cough or fever were significantly associated with higher detection rates (p<0.05). Among spontaneously breathing patients, viral load in EBC attenuated exponentially over time. The detection rate was 86% at 2 days since onset and deteriorated thereafter. In mechanically ventilated patients, detection rate and viral load were high regardless of days since onset. CONCLUSION These results support the feasibility of using RT-PCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 from EBC for COVID-19 patients within 2 days of symptom onset.","Sawano, Makoto; Takeshita, Kyousuke; Ohno, Hideaki; Oka, HIdeaki",Journal of breath research,205,1

METHODS A systematic MEDLINE and repository search concerning clinical trials for aripiprazole in bipolar disorder was conducted. RESULTS The meta-analysis of four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on acute mania suggests that the effect size of aripiprazole versus placebo was equal to 0.14 but a more reliable and accurate estimation is 0.18 for the total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score. The effect was higher for the PANSS-positive subscale (0.28), PANSS-hostility subscale (0.24) and PANSS-cognitive subscale (0.20), and lower for the PANSS-negative subscale (0.12). No data on the depressive phase of bipolar illness exist, while there are some data in favour of aripiprazole concerning the maintenance phase, where at week 26 all except the total PANSS score showed a significant superiority of aripiprazole over placebo (d = 0.28 for positive, d = 0.38 for the cognitive and d = 0.71 for the hostility subscales) and at week 100 the results were similar (d = 0.42, 0.63 and 0.48, respectively).

Here, we further characterized a lethal transgenic mouse model of MERS-CoV infection and disease that globally expresses human CD26 (hCD26)/DPP4. The 50% infectious dose (ID50) and lethal dose (LD50) of virus were estimated to be <1 and 10 TCID50 of MERS-CoV, respectively. Neutralizing antibody developed in the surviving mice from the ID50/LD50 determinations, and all were fully immune to challenge with 100 LD50 of MERS-CoV. The tissue distribution and histopathology in mice challenged with a potential working dose of 10 LD50 of MERS-CoV were subsequently evaluated. In contrast to the overwhelming infection seen in the mice challenged with 10(5) LD50 of MERS-CoV, we were able to recover infectious virus from these mice only infrequently, although quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) tests indicated early and persistent lung infection and delayed occurrence of brain infection. Persistent inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the lungs and brain stems at day 2 and day 6 after infection, respectively. While focal infiltrates were also noted in the liver, definite pathology was not seen in other tissues. Finally, using a receptor binding domain protein vaccine and a MERS-CoV fusion inhibitor, we demonstrated the value of this model for evaluating vaccines and antivirals against MERS. As outcomes of MERS-CoV infection in patients differ greatly, ranging from asymptomatic to overwhelming disease and death, having available both an infection model and a lethal model makes this transgenic mouse model relevant for advancing MERS research. IMPORTANCE Fully characterized animal models are essential for studying pathogenesis and for preclinical screening of vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection and disease. When given a high dose of MERS-CoV, our transgenic mice expressing hCD26/DPP4 viral receptor uniformly succumbed to death within 6 days, making it difficult to evaluate host responses to infection and disease. We further characterized this model by determining both the ID50 and the LD50 of MERS-CoV in order to establish both an infection model and a lethal model for MERS and followed this by investigating the antibody responses and immunity of the mice that survived MERS-CoV infection. Using the estimated LD50 and ID50 data, we dissected the kinetics of viral tissue distribution and pathology in mice challenged with 10 LD50 of virus and utilized the model for preclinical evaluation of a vaccine and drug for treatment of MERS-CoV infection. This further-characterized transgenic mouse model will be useful for advancing MERS research.","Tao, Xinrong; Garron, Tania; Agrawal, Anurodh Shankar; Algaissi, Abdullah; Peng, Bi-Hung; Wakamiya, Maki; Chan, Teh-Sheng; Lu, Lu; Du, Lanying; Jiang, Shibo; Couch, Robert B; Tseng, Chien-Te K",Journal of virology,205,1

New methods such as single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have the potential to close this gap in our knowledge. In this review, we analyze applications of scRNA-Seq from the aging and circadian rhythm fields and highlight new findings emerging from the analysis of single cells, especially in humans or rodents. Furthermore, we judge the potential of scRNA-Seq to identify common traits of both processes.

The sudden increase in the number of patients and deaths from this novel type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic poses a serious challenge to all arenas of health care delivery system. The care of high-time dependent-factor illnesses is essential for the survival of a patient and the need for avoiding impairment of health. The purpose of the review is to highlight that a change in first-aid attitudes can be assumed behind the delay in immediate interventions initiated by first responders during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To maintain socially important first aid, the European Resuscitation Council amended its guidelines on first aid, basic life support and made further recommendations at the time of pandemic on first-aid education, too. For effective domestic adaptation, the present overview summarises the most important aspects of guidelines and their supplements and also covers their practical implementations. The main purpose of the change in guidelines is to bring the willingness of the first responders back to the level before the coronavirus pandemic, and to further enhance it with professional educational materials and modern methods.

Prior to participating in a cross-disciplinary IPV training program, medical care (N = 223) and social/behavioral practitioners (N = 197) completed a survey that ascertained current practices, provisions, and perceived barriers related to IPV screening and referral. Roughly half of the study participants did not routinely screen their patients/clients for IPV, with no differences for the professional groupings. Utilization of referral resources was significantly lower for medical care providers, 78.5% of whom did not use any. Perceived barriers to screening and referral were examined as practitioner-based and organization-based, and we identified tangible provisions (protocols and practice materials) as a relevant variable. As we conjectured, organization-based barriers were more strongly associated with lower rates of screening and referral than were practitioner-based barriers, regardless of professional grouping. Moreover, tangible provisions, controlling for perceived barriers, significantly added to routine screening and frequency of referral resources usage, particularly for medical care providers. Results are discussed in the context of a systems-level approach to improving IPV services in health care with organizational practice enhancements.","Kosiak, Klaudia; Contreras, Isaias M; Stoever, Jane; Toohey, Julianne; Novaco, Raymond W",Journal of interpersonal violence,205,1

In addition, the effect of H. pylori colonization of the stomach of patients undergoing stapling procedures is unclear. As a result, the need for detection and treatment of H. pylori in patients undergoing VSG is unknown. METHODS Four hundred and eighty patients undergoing VSG are the subject of this study. Three surgeons at a single institution performed the procedures. The remnant stomach was sent to pathology and tested for the presence of H. pylori using immunohistochemistry. All patients were discharged on proton pump inhibitors. RESULTS Of the 480 patients who underwent VSG, 52 were found to be H. pylori positive based on pathology. There was no statistically significant difference in age (p = 0.77), sex (p = 0.48), or BMI (p = 0.39) between the groups. There were 17 readmissions post-op. Five of these were in the H. pylori positive cohort. Six of these complications were classified as severe (anastomotic leak, intra-abdominal collection, or abscess), with two in the H. pylori positive cohort (Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference in the severe complication rates between the two groups (p = 0.67). There were no readmissions for gastric or duodenal ulceration or perforation.

A review of consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with the intention of splenic preservation was conducted. Patient demographics, operative data, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Fifty-five consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with the intention of splenic preservation; 5 required splenectomy (9 %). Of the remaining 50 patients, 31 (62 %) had splenic vessel ligation, and 19 (38 %) had vessel preservation. Patient demographics and tumor size were similar. The vessel ligation group had significantly more pancreas removed (95 vs 52 mm, P < 0.001) and longer operative times (256 vs 201 min, P = 0.008). Postoperative outcomes, complication rates, and splenic viability were similar between groups. Laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy is a safe operation with a high rate of success (91 %). Vessel ligation was the chosen technical strategy for lesions that required resection of a greater length of pancreas. We found no advantage to either technique with respect to outcomes and splenic preservation.

However, 34.3% of the women have had unintended pregnancies and 14.2% had induced abortion. FGD findings revealed that non-use of contraceptives and contraceptive failure were major reasons for unintended pregnancies and induced abortion. The significant predictors of induced abortion were non-use of contraceptives, age≥ 40 years and multiparity. Conclusion Induced abortion still occur among married women particularly those not using contraceptives, aged ≥40 years and those with high parity.

In recent years, FDO2 prediction formulas have been proposed. However, they do not take into account the effect of inspiratory flow (V̇I) on the FDO2 . The aim of this study was to validate a new FDO2 prediction formula, which takes into account the V̇I and compares it with other FDO2 prediction formulas. METHODS During a bench study, spontaneous breathing was generated with a mechanical test lung connected to a mechanical ventilator set to volume control mode. O2 flow from a wall-mounted tube was delivered through a heat-and-moisture exchanger filter. A flow sensor recorded each breath of the V̇I in ambient temperature and barometric pressure conditions. Three parameters [O2 flow at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 L/min; minute ventilation at 5, 10, 15, 20 L/min; and ratio of the inspiratory time (TI) to the total breathing cycle time (Ttot) (TI/Ttot) of 0.33 (TI/Ttot value) and 0.50 (TI/Ttot value)] were modified to generate many ventilatory patterns. An O2 analyzer continuously examined the FDO2 . RESULTS When the O2 flow and/or TI/Ttot increased, the FDO2 increased. When the minute ventilation increased, the FDO2 decreased. The results of the Bland-Altman method for the FDO2 , calculated by using our mathematical model and the measured FDO2 , showed that the mean ± SD bias value was equal to 1.49 ± 0.84%, and the limits of agreement ranged from -0.17% to 3.14%. The intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.991 for TI/Ttot = 0.33 and 0.994 for TI/Ttot = 0.50, and the coefficient of variation was 2.1% for TI/Ttot = 0.33 and 1.3% for TI/Ttot = 0.50. The results of the Bland-Altman method for the FDO2 calculated by using the Shapiro formula and the FDO2 measured on the bench indicated that the bias value was 0.075 ± 8.66% and the limits of agreement ranged from -16.89% to 17.04%. For the Vincent formula, the bias value was 3.08% ± 8.56% and the limits of agreement ranged from -13.69% to 19.84%. CONCLUSIONS The V̇I has a major impact on FDO2 during O2 therapy at low flow.

Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the cell proliferation and differentiation were performed, considering also the effect of a common adhesion factor, namely polylysine. We observed that on graphene substrates the cells proliferate faster with respect to glass; additionally, the presence of the adhesion factor enhances the difference and, remarkably, boosts the cell differentiation on the graphene-based interface. To understand the mechanism underlying a different cell behavior on the same adhesion coating, we carried out a physicochemical investigation of the studied interfaces (glass and graphene, bare and polylysine coated) by several techniques. In particular, we employed infrared spectroscopy to gain information on polylysine conformation, and atomic force microscopy force-distance curves to study adhesion properties at the surface. The results indicate that polylysine has an enhanced binding affinity for graphene, as well as a different molecular arrangement on graphene with respect to glass. These properties act as surface cues to trigger the cell response.","El Merhie, Amira; Salerno, Marco; Heredia-Guerrero, José Alejandro; Dante, Silvia","Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",205,1

The purpose of this study protocol is to provide a meta-synthesis methodology for comparing the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy and physical exercise on controlling cardiovascular risk factors and preventing ASCVD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. We plan to conduct a computerised search in Medline, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and SPORTDiscus from inception to May 2020 for studies testing the effectiveness of physical exercise or fixed-dose combination drug therapy in preventing ASCVD, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and controlling some cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and dyslipidaemia). Since performing network meta-analyses (NMA) is a statistical approach that allows direct and indirect comparisons of interventions, where sufficient studies are included, we plan to perform the following NMA comparing the effect of fixed-dose combination therapy and physical exercise interventions on (1) improving lipid profile, (2) reducing blood pressure, (3) preventing cardiovascular events and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and (4) improving compliance with the therapeutic strategy and reducing adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval will not be needed because data included in the NMA will be extracted from published trials that meet accepted ethical standards. The results will be published in academic peer-reviewed journals, and the evidence gathered by this project could be included in the preventive cardiovascular disease guidelines.

Severity of CCHF can vary from a mild and nonspecific illness, to a severe disease with fatal outcomes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have increasing impact on the different pathways of viral infections. Within the transition process from acute phase to convalescence with 18 CCHF patients, we investigated the impacts on miRNA via microarray for the first time. We also compared miRNA gene expression within 16 severe and 15 mild cases. We identified Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) pathways associated with significant miRNAs utilizing DIANA TOOLS mirPath v.3. In this study miR-15b-5p and miR-29a-3p were significantly downregulated in statistical terms; miR-4741, miR-937-5p, miR-6068, miR-7110-5p miR-6126 and miR-7107-5p were upregulated in acute cases in comparison with convalescent patients (p≤0.05). 28 miRNAs (8 downregulated, 20 upregulated) were differentially expressed in severe CCHF patients compared with mild cases (p≤0.05). While miR-6732-3p, miR-4436b-5p, miR-483-3p, miR-6807-5p had the highest downregulation; miR-532-5p, miR-142-5p, miR-29c-3p and let-7f-5p had the highest upregulation in severe patients in comparison with mild cases. Consequently, we determined that CCHF induced miRNAs are associated with antiviral and proinflammatory pathways in acute and severe cases. In comparison with convalescence, these miRNAs in acute period may be therapeutic targets. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS This study is a retrospective review of consecutive patients diagnosed with moderate or severe aCAS at our institution between 2000 and 2001. Data were gathered from both carotid arteries for each patient excluding vessels operated within 1 year of diagnosis and occlusions. Multivariate analysis was performed to analyze factors associated with ipsilateral transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke. RESULTS We identified 214 patients (58.8% men; median age 70 years) and collected data on 349 vessels. Degree of stenosis was severe (>70%) upon diagnosis in 92 (26.4%) vessels. Median length of follow-up was 13 years (interquartile range 10-14), and mean number of time points for follow-up imaging were 8.1 ± 3.9. Progression of stenosis was observed in 237 (67.9%) vessels, and 72 (20.6%) patients developed symptoms ipsilateral to the stenosis (TIA in 14.4%, non-disabling stroke in 4%, disabling stroke in 2.2%). Median time to appearance of first symptom was 6 years (range 1-13). On multivariate analysis, degree of baseline stenosis, intracranial stenosis >50%, plaque ulceration, silent infarction and previous history of TIA/stroke were associated with ipsilateral TIA/stroke, but progression of stenosis was not. CONCLUSIONS There was a substantial rate of progression of stenosis in patients with aCAS over time despite adequate medical therapy, but progression of stenosis did not increase the risk of ipsilateral TIA/stroke. Over long-term follow-up, 1 in 5 patients with aCAS developed ipsilateral TIA/stroke, though most events were either transient or non-disabling.","Singh, Tarun D; Kramer, Christopher L; Mandrekar, Jay; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Rabinstein, Alejandro A",Cerebrovascular diseases,205,33

These include a lack of clear categorization of digital health education in the literature; constantly evolving concepts, pedagogies, or theories; and a multitude of methods, features, technologies, or delivery settings. The Digital Health Education Collaboration was established to evaluate the evidence on digital education in health professions; inform policymakers, educators, and students; and ultimately, change the way in which these professionals learn and are taught. The aim of this paper is to present the overarching methodology that we use to synthesize evidence across our digital health education reviews and to discuss challenges related to the process. For our research, we followed Cochrane recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews; all reviews are reported according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidance. This included assembling experts in various digital health education fields; identifying gaps in the evidence base; formulating focused research questions, aims, and outcome measures; choosing appropriate search terms and databases; defining inclusion and exclusion criteria; running the searches jointly with librarians and information specialists; managing abstracts; retrieving full-text versions of papers; extracting and storing large datasets, critically appraising the quality of studies; analyzing data; discussing findings; drawing meaningful conclusions; and drafting research papers. The approach used for synthesizing evidence from digital health education trials is commonly regarded as the most rigorous benchmark for conducting systematic reviews. Although we acknowledge the presence of certain biases ingrained in the process, we have clearly highlighted and minimized those biases by strictly adhering to scientific rigor, methodological integrity, and standard operating procedures. This paper will be a valuable asset for researchers and methodologists undertaking systematic reviews in digital health education.","Car, Josip; Carlstedt-Duke, Jan; Tudor Car, Lorainne; Posadzki, Pawel; Whiting, Penny; Zary, Nabil; Atun, Rifat; Majeed, Azeem; Campbell, James",Journal of medical Internet research,205,17

Translocase of mitochondrial outer membrane 70 (Tom70) primarily facilitates the import of mitochondrial preproteins that may be involved in the regulation of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. This study aimed to investigate the role of Tom70 in the development of myocardial injury in leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) diabetic mice. Tom70 siRNA or an overexpressing lentivirus was intramuscularly injected into mouse hearts or used to treat cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. We found that Tom70 was downregulated in the diabetic hearts compared with the level in the wild-type hearts and that knocking down Tom70 exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ventricular dysfunction in the db/db mice. Similarly, the in vitro data demonstrated that silencing Tom70 enhanced high-glucose and high-fat (HGHF) medium treatment-induced mitochondrial superoxide production, decreased ATP production and the mitochondrial membrane potential, and enhanced cell apoptosis in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Importantly, overexpression of Tom70 alleviated HGHF medium-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo data confirmed that reconstitution of Tom70 ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, and ventricular dysfunction in the db/db mice. In addition, Tom70 overexpression mitigated mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction in the hearts of the db/db mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that downregulation of Tom70 contributes to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and that reconstitution of Tom70 may be a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy.","Wang, Peijian; Wang, Dan; Yang, Yi; Hou, Jixin; Wan, Jindong; Ran, Fei; Dai, Xiaozhen; Zhou, Peng; Yang, Yongjian",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,205,23

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a new low-thrombin fibrin sealant for seroma prevention. METHODS A total of 60 consecutive patients with median incisional hernias who required OVHR with WSD of at least 100 cm(2) were included in the prospective non-randomized study. The fibrin glue group (FG) comprised 30 patients who had undergone OVHR with sublay mesh placement as well as subcutaneous application of low-thrombin fibrin sealant. This cohort of patients was compared with a control group (CG) of 30 consecutive patients who had previously undergone OVHR without prevention of seroma formation with regard to outcome measures such as seroma formations and wound complications. RESULTS Though the median extent of subcutaneous dead space was larger in the FG than in the CG (229 vs.174 cm(2); p = 0.012), seroma formation occurred in three of the FG versus 16 of the CG patients (p = 0.003). Postoperative wound complications occurred in two of the FG versus nine of the CG patients (p = 0.002). Four patients in the CG and none in the FG required re-operation within 30 days (p < 0.001).

The assessment of the endothelial corneal cells is needed since it facilitates the personal evaluation of the functional endothelial stock. Specular microscopy investigation offers a scale of the functional strength of the endothelium of cornea, which is vital before all intraocular interventions. Endotamponade agents are very suitable and important tools in the surgical treatment of retinal detachment, but their use must be differentiated depending on the uniqueness of each patient. This research shows corneal endothelial damages caused by intraocular tamponade agents of different types in the case of pars plana vitrectomy for cases of multitude retinal detachments. The purpose of the research was to determine the changes that appear in the endothelium of the cornea and to deal with the results when different tamponade agents are used in the surgical cure for retinal detachment. Specular endothelial corneal microscopy records were achieved and the modifications of the following parameters revealed corneal implication: mean endothelial cell densities, average cell area, coefficient of variation, hexagonality and corneal center thickness. On the first day and at three months postoperatively, a statistically significant reduction was observed for the CV, MCD, and HEX parameters (p 0.001), but no statistically significant difference of the two endotamponade agents (for MCD, p=0.15; for CV, p=0.63; for HEX, p=0.93) was noticed.

Although advances in targeted molecular targeted therapy have shown promise, none of these agents have yet demonstrated significant clinical benefits. Bromo- and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins inhibitors have been considered potential therapeutic drugs for HCC but the biological activity remains unclear. This present study found that BET proteins inhibition did not effectively suppress the progression of HCC using a transgenic HCC mouse model. Mechanistically, the BET proteins inhibitor JQ1 upregulated the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, JQ1 enhanced the expression of Rab8A, which upregulated the expression of PD-L1 on the plasma membrane. This study also showed that JQ1 combined with anti-PD-L1 Ab effectively suppressed HCC progression, and this benefit was obtained by enhancing the activation and cytotoxic capabilities of CD8 T cells. These results revealed the crucial role and regulation of BET proteins inhibition on the expression of PD-L1 in HCC. Thus, combining BET proteins inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade offers an efficient therapeutic approach for HCC.","Liu, Chen; Miao, Xiaolong; Wang, Yao; Wen, Liang; Cheng, Xiawei; Kong, Deqiang; Zhao, Pengwei; Song, Dandan; Wang, Xinyi; Ding, Xianfeng; Xia, Hongguang; Wang, Weilin; Sun, Qiming; Gong, Weihua",Cancer science,205,7

We demonstrated infectious virus stability in clinical samples, including those dried for prolonged periods of time. Infectious virus correlated with time since symptom onset with no detection after 7-8 days in immunocompetent hosts and with N-gene based Ct values [≤]25 significantly predictive of yielding plaques in culture.

Clinical salivary isolates caused illness in a hamster model with a minimum infectious dose of [≤]14 PFU/mL. Our findings of high quantitative burdens of infectious virus, stability even with drying, and a very low minimal infectious dose suggest multiple modes of transmission are exploited by SARS-CoV-2, including direct contact, large respiratory droplet, and fomite transmission and in the context of a high binding avidity to human cellular receptors, offer an explanation of the high contagiousness of this virus.","Lin, Y.-C.; Malott, R.

Pharmacists have been identified as potential immunisers in COVID-19 policies, yet there are no reported active surveillance systems operating in pharmacies. We integrated an established participant-centred active vaccine safety surveillance system with a cloud-based pharmacy immunisation-recording program. We measured adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reported via the new surveillance system in pharmacies, and compared these to AEFI reported via an existing surveillance system in non-pharmacy sites (general practice and other clinics). Methods: A prospective cohort study of individuals>10 years receiving influenza immunisations from 22 pharmacies and 90 non-pharmacy sites between March and October, 2020, in Australia. Active surveillance was conducted using SMS and smartphone technology, via an opt-out system. Multivariable logistic regression (including a subgroup analysis of participants over 65 years) was used to assess differences in proportions of AEFI between participants immunised in pharmacies compared to non-pharmacy sites, adjusting for confounders of age, sex, and influenza vaccine brand. Results: Of 101,440 influenza immunisation participants (6,992 from pharmacies; 94,448 from non-pharmacy sites), 77,498 (76.4%) responded; 96.1% (n=74,448) within 24 hours. Overall, 4.8% (n=247) pharmacy participants reported an AEFI, compared with 6.0% (n=4,356) non-pharmacy participants (adjusted odds ratio: 0.87; 95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.99; p=0.039). Similar proportions of AEFIs were reported in pharmacy (5.8%; n=31) and non-pharmacy participants (6.0; n=1617) aged over 65 years (adjusted odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.65 to 1.35; p=0.725). Conclusion: High and rapid response rates demonstrate good participant engagement with active surveillance in both pharmacy and non-pharmacy participants. Significantly fewer AEFIs reported after pharmacist immunisations compared to non-pharmacy immunisations, with no difference in older adults, suggests different cohorts attend pharmacy and non-pharmacy immunisers. The integrated pharmacy system is rapidly scalable across Australia with global potential.","Salter, S.

The in-patient’s drugs are warehoused in a centralized location such as hospital pharmacy. The required or prescribed drugs available in the pharmacy will be distributed to the patient by either the nurse or attendant. The attendant often collects the medicine from the pharmacy. This process is quite time-consuming and in this COVID‘19 pandemic should maintain social distancing by the attendant in the pharmacy. In a field where time is of great importance and can save lives and also, a human intervention which in turn need to maintain social distancing, we can use MeDrones that will dispense medicines to the designated patient(s) location which will avoid human intervention and social distancing to defeat COVID-19 pandemic which is the need of the hour. The drone will be designed to deliver payload (tablets/saline) within/across the hospital premises. Apart from delivering medicines to the respective patients, the drone will be equipped to decide the optimal path to reach patients and prioritize attending to critical patients based on the hospital’s central database. The drones can be customized to return the unused medicines from the patient’s location to the pharmacy. Lightweight secured drugs container kit with authentication enabled will be designed for carrying the medicines to distribute to the respective destination inside the healthcare centre.

A portable virus capture device coupled with label-free Raman Spectroscopy holds the promise of fast detection by rapidly obtaining the Raman signature of a virus followed by a machine learning approach applied to recognize the virus based on its Raman spectrum. In this paper, we present a machine learning analysis on Raman spectra of human and avian viruses. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier specifically designed for spectral data achieves very high accuracy for a variety of virus type or subtype identification tasks. In particular, it achieves 99% accuracy for classifying influenza virus type A vs. type B, 96% accuracy for classifying four subtypes of influenza A, 95% accuracy for differentiating enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, and 99% for differentiating avian coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) from other avian viruses. Furthermore, interpretation of neural net responses in the trained CNN model using a full-gradient algorithm highlights Raman spectral ranges that are most important to virus identification. By correlating ML-selected salient Raman ranges with the signature ranges of known biomolecules and chemical functional groups (e.g. amide, amino acid, carboxylic acid) we verify that our ML model effectively recognizes the Raman signatures of proteins, lipids and other vital functional groups present in different viruses and uses a weighted combination of these signatures to identify viruses. The accurate and interpretable machine learning model developed for Raman virus identification presents promising potential in a real-time virus detection system. Significance Statement A portable micro-fluidic platform for virus capture promises rapid enrichment and label-free optical identification of viruses by Raman spectroscopy. A large Raman dataset collected on a variety of viruses enables the training of machine learning (ML) models capable of highly accurate and sensitive virus identification. The trained ML models can then be integrated with the portable device to provide real-time virus detection and identification capability. We validate this conceptual framework by presenting highly accurate virus type and subtype identification results using a convolutional neural network to classify Raman spectra of viruses.","Ye, Jiarong; Yeh, Yin-Ting; Xue, Yuan; Wang, Ziyang; Zhang, Na; Liu, He; Zhang, Kunyan; Yu, Zhuohang; Roder, Allison; Lopez, Nestor Perea; Organtini, Lindsey; Greene, Wallace; Hafenstein, Susan; Lu, Huaguang; Ghedin, Elodie; Terrones, Mauricio; Huang, Shengxi; Huang, Sharon Xiaolei",bioRxiv,205,16

This outbreak has claimed the lives of so many people. It has a long-term negative impact on public health. The goal of this study is to develop an intelligent computer-aided system that can detect positive COVID-19 cases automatically, which can help with daily medical problems. The proposed system is based on the convolution neural network (CNN) architecture and can automatically expose discriminative features on chest X-ray images due to its convolution with rich filter families and weight-sharing characteristics. As a deep feature extractor, the CNN model SqueezeNet was used. The extracted deep discriminative features were fed machine Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network (NN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and k-nearest neighbor learning algorithms. As a result, the NN classifier with an accuracy of 97.24 per cent, a sensitivity of 0.9724, a specificity of 0.9858, and an F-score of 0.972 provided the most effective results. The high detection performance obtained in this study demonstrates the utility of deep CNN features and an NN classifier approach for detecting COVID-19 cases in CXR images.

METHODS From April 1986 to December 2006, 200 patients who underwent elective surgery with stage II and III right-sided colon cancer were analyzed. The period for group I referred back to the time when laparoscopic approach had not yet been introduced. The period for group II was designated as the time when first laparoscopic approach for right colectomy was carried out until we overcame its learning curve. The period for group III was the period after overcoming this learning curve. RESULTS When groups I and II, and groups II and III were compared, overall survival (OS) did not differ significantly whereas disease-free survival (DFS) in groups I and III were statistically higher than in group II (P = 0.042 and P = 0.050). In group III, laparoscopic surgery had a tendency to provide better long-term OS ( P = 0.2036) and DFS ( P = 0.2356) than open surgery. Also, the incidence of local recurrence in group III (2.6%) was significantly lower than that in groups II (7.4%) and I (12.1%) ( P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS Institutions should standardize their techniques and then provide fellowship training for newcomers of laparoscopic colon cancer surgery. This technique once mastered will become the gold standard approach to colon surgery as it is both safe and feasible considering the oncological and technical aspects.","Kye, Bong-Hyeon; Kim, Jun-Gi; Cho, Hyeon-Min; Lee, Jung Hwan; Kim, Hyung-Jin; Suh, Young-Jin; Chun, Chung-Soo",World journal of surgical oncology,205,33

Use of these tests can lead to more accurate and rapid diagnoses. This review discusses laboratory tests, both new and old, and the role they currently play in the evaluation of animals presented with gastrointestinal problems. A minimum database helps assess the severity of the disorder, detect extra-gastrointestinal causes of problems and assists in formulating diagnostic and therapeutic plans. Faecal examination remains one of the most important diagnostic procedures in the investigation of gastrointestinal problems. Zinc sulphate faecal flotation is an excellent routine screening technique for helminth and protozoal infections, including giardiasis. Rectal cytology can assist in the diagnosis of large bowel disorders. Interpretation of faecal immunodiagnostic tests is hampered by insufficient knowledge of test sensitivities and specificities. Routine faecal cultures are not warranted and faecal occult blood tests are rarely indicated. Serum tests for gastric inflammation are now under development. The serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity test remains the gold standard technique for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Breath hydrogen tests can be helpful in assessing the functional relevance of mild abnormalities in small-bowel biopsy specimens. Subnormal concentrations of serum cobalamin appear to be more specific indicators of gastrointestinal disease in cats than in dogs. Tests for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth remain controversial and assessment of gastrointestinal permeability has yet to prove its value in the diagnostic assessment of companion animals with gastrointestinal problems.

J. Snijder et al., J. Biol. Chem. 271:4864-4871, 1996) located in nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4). Three probable SP cleavage sites had previously been identified in the ORF1a protein. Their proteolysis explained the main processing products generated from the C-terminal part of the ORF1a protein in infected cells (E. J. Snijder et al., J. Virol. 68:5755-5764, 1994). By using sequence comparison, ORF1a expression systems, and site-directed mutagenesis, we have now identified two additional SP cleavage sites: Glu-1430 / Gly and Glu-1452 / Ser. This means that the ORF1a protein can be cleaved into eight processing end products: nsp1 to nsp8. By microsequence analysis of the nsp5 and nsp7 N termini, we have now formally confirmed the specificity of the SP for Glu / (Gly/Ser) substrates. Importantly, our studies revealed that the C-terminal half of the ORF1a protein (nsp3-8) can be processed by the SP following two alternative pathways, which appear to be mutually exclusive. In the majority of the nsp3-8 precursors the SP cleaves the nsp4/5 site, yielding nsp3-4 and nsp5-8. Subsequently, the latter product is cleaved at the nsp7/8 site only, whereas the newly identified nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 sites appear to be inaccessible to the protease. In the alternative proteolytic cascade, which is used at a low but significant level in infected cells, it is the nsp4/5 site which remains uncleaved, while the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 sites are processed to yield a set of previously unnoticed processing products. Coexpression studies revealed that nsp3-8 has to interact with cleaved nsp2 to allow processing of the nsp4/5 junction, the first step of the major processing pathway. When the nsp2 cofactor is absent, the nsp4/5 site cannot be processed and nsp3-8 is processed following the alternative, minor pathway.","Wassenaar, A L; Spaan, W J; Gorbalenya, A E; Snijder, E J",Journal of virology,205,17

The current study was designed to determine whether the stage of pregnancy when infection occurs influences pregnancy outcome. Rats were inoculated with 3 X 10(7) CFU of M. pulmonis at 10 days prior to breeding (-10) or at gestational day (gd) 11 or 14 and were necropsied at gd 11, 14, or 18 or within 24 h of parturition (term). Control rats received sterile broth. M. pulmonis was isolated from the placenta, amniotic fluid, or fetal tissues only from rats infected prior to breeding (P < 0.001). All infected rats had significantly more loss of pups than did control rats (P < 0.006), but rats infected prior to breeding or at the beginning of the third trimester (gd 14) were much more likely to have fetal losses. Rats infected in the early second trimester after implantation (gd 11) did not experience severe losses. Litter sizes, total litter weight, and individual pup weight from all infected rats, regardless of gestational stage when infected, were significantly smaller than those of control rats (P < 0.001).

OBJECTIVE To compare the detection of apnea and the prediction of oxygen desaturation and hypoxemia using capnography versus clinical surveillance during procedural sedation for percutaneous transhepatic cholangiodrainage (PTCD). METHODS Twenty consecutive patients scheduled for PTCD were included in the study. All patients were sedated during the procedure using midazolam and propofol. Aside from standard monitoring, additional capnographic monitoring was used and analyzed by an independent observer. RESULTS The mean (± SD) cumulative duration of apnea demonstrated by capnography was significantly longer than the mean cumulative duration of clinically detected apnea (207.5 ± 348.8 s versus 8.2 ± 17.9 s; P=0.015). The overall number of detected episodes of apnea was also significantly different (113 versus seven; P=0.012). There were 15 events of oxygen desaturation (decrease in oxygen saturation [SaO2] ≥ 5%), which were predicted in eight of 15 cases by capnography and in one of 15 cases by clinical observation. There were three events of hypoxemia (SaO2 <90%) that were predicted in three of three cases by capnography and in one of three cases by clinical observation.

Among those IAQ conditions, the concentrations of CO, O3, and HCHO exceeded the regulation values of the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) mostly in the morning. The concentrations of bacteria and fungi did not exceed the regulation values but still posed potential health and environment problems for workers, patients, and visitors. Therefore, self-made silver-coated zeolite (AgZ) was used as a filter material in air cleaners to remove bio-aerosols in the respiratory care ward (RCW), and the removals were still effective after 120 hr. The cumulative bio-aerosol removals for bacteria and fungi were 900 and 1,088 colony-forming units (CFU) g(-1) after 24 hr and were above 3,100 and 2,700 CFU g(-1) after 120 hr. From the research results, it is suggested that AgZ filtering could be used as a feasible engineering measure for hospitals to control their bacteria and fungi parameters in IAQ management. Hospitals should maintain their environmental management and monitoring programs and use different engineering measures to improve different IAQ parameters. IMPLICATIONS This study investigated the IAQ conditions in the field at a hospital in Chia-Yi County in southern Taiwan. Although concentrations of most parameters were still within the regulation values, the concentrations of CO, O3, and HCHO were partially exceeded. We propose a method using an air cleaner with silver-coated zeolite (AgZ) as a possible engineering measure, and there were effective reductions of bacteria and fungi to lower levels with antibacterial effects after 120 hr. Furthermore, this study implies that hospitals should continuously maintain environmental monitoring programs and adopt optimal engineering measures for different needs.","Shen, Jyun-Hong; Wang, Yeoung-Sheng; Lin, Jhan-Ping; Wu, Sheng-Hung; Horng, Jao-Jia",Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association,205,1

The substitution of one amino acid within the predicted proteinase domain (His-3006-->Asp-3006) abolishes, or at least significantly reduces, this activity. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of a purified, 34-kDa cleavage product shows that the bacterial fusion protein is cleaved at the dipeptide Gln-2965-Ala-2966, which is the predicted amino-terminal end of the putative 3C-like proteinase domain.

One recombinant virus had no deletion in the E3 region, whereas a 1.2 kb fragment was removed from the E3 region in the remainder of the recombinant viruses. One stable construct with a 4.4 kb insertion had a genome size of 109.6% of the wild-type genome, the largest reported for any recombinant adenovirus. Only those viruses that carried the S gene in the left to right orientation expressed the S gene. Three recombinant viruses were tested by oral immunization of pigs and both antibody response and virus shedding were monitored. None of the pigs showed clinical signs and the virus was recovered from rectal swabs until 6-7 days post-infection. Viruses expressing the S gene induced TGEV- and PAdV-5-specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, TGEV-specific secretory IgA was detected in the small intestine and in the lungs of the immunized animals.","Tuboly, T; Nagy, E",The Journal of general virology,205,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Web and PubMed searchusing the keywords ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID19"", ""COVID Urology"", ""COVID surgery"", ""consensus methods"",""nominal group"", ""Delphi method"". A narrative revision of the literature until the 20th May 2020, including articles and documents in English and Spanish.;RESULTS: Medical practice in Spain has been forced to rapidly adapt to the pandemic, dedicating most ofits material and human resources to the care of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. This has meant a significant reduction of the routine practice in Urology, as in other medical specialities, limiting the medical attention tourgent and emergent cases. Programmed activity has been reserved for selected cases in which a delayed attention could compromise survival. Different scientific associations have made a significant effort to adapt their recommendations to the pandemic, prioritizing high-risk oncologic cases, and reducing the use of ventilators and hospital stays to the minimum. These restrictions must be dynamic, adapting to the de-escalating phases as the pandemic is more controlled, widening the range of services available. In this de-escalate there is an additional challenge, being the difficulty in generating quality scientific evidence. In order to obtain such evidence, consensus methods have been used, such as the nominal group technique or the Delphi method. CONCLUSIONS The COVID19 pandemic has meant a complete disruption in the routine activity in Urologyin Spain, with a need for prioritizing the attention of urgent and high-risk oncologic pathology. These restrictions must be progressively modified according to the de-escalating process in the general population.","López-Fando, Luis; Santiago, Marta; Ruiz, Mercedes; Sánchez, Álvaro; Jiménez, Miguel",Archivos espanoles de urologia,205,16

A polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of animals with acute lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural network. The resulting network is intended for predicting left and right lung regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification and consolidation. Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer, and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated and poorly aerated tissue. Lower left and lower right lobes were consistently more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation without requiring COVID-19 cases for training.","Gerard, Sarah E; Herrmann, Jacob; Xin, Yi; Martin, Kevin T; Rezoagli, Emanuele; Ippolito, Davide; Bellani, Giacomo; Cereda, Maurizio; Guo, Junfeng; Hoffman, Eric A; Kaczka, David W; Reinhardt, Joseph M",ArXiv,205,1

In this study, we found that a particular strain of mouse hepatitis virus, JHM2c, which has a deletion of a 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence (UUUAUAAAC) immediately downstream of the leader RNA, transcribed subgenomic mRNA species containing a whole array of heterogeneous leader fusion sites. Using a transfected defective interfering RNA which contains an IS and a reporter (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) gene and JHM2c as a helper virus, we demonstrated that subgenomic mRNAs transcribed from the defective interfering RNAs were extremely heterogeneous. The leader-mRNA fusion sites in this virus can be grouped into five types. In type I, the leader is fused with the consensus IS of the template RNA at a site within the UCUAA repeats, consistent with the classical model of discontinuous transcription. In type II, the leader is fused with the consensus IS as in type I, but the leader of mRNA contains some nucleotide substitutions within the UCUAA repeats. In type III, the leader is fused with mRNAs at a site either upstream or downstream of the consensus IS. The sequences around the fusion sites bear little or no homology to the leader. As a result, mRNAs contain sequences complementary to the template sequences upstream of the IS or have sequence deletions downstream of the IS. In type IV, the leader is fused to the IS at the 9-nt sequence immediately downstream of the UCUAA repeats. In type V, the leader-mRNA fusion site contains a duplication of a portion of the leader sequence or an insertion of nontemplated sequences which are not present in either leader or template RNA. These patterns of leader-mRNA fusion resemble the aberrant homologous recombination frequently seen in other RNA viruses. The degree of heterogeneity of leader fusion sites is dependent on the sequences of both the leader RNA and IS. These results suggest that leader-mRNA fusion in coronavirus transcription does not require direct RNA-RNA interaction between complementary sequences. A modified model of RNA transcription and recombination based on protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions is proposed. This study also provides a paradigm for aberrant homologous recombination.","Zhang, X; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,205,1

We show here that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate, a key regulator of the autophagic process, plays an important role in innate antiviral immune responses. Atg5-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were resistant to vesicular stomatitis virus replication, which was largely due to hyperproduction of type I interferons in response to immunostimulatory RNA (isRNA), such as virus-derived, double-stranded, or 5'-phosphorylated RNA. Similar hyperresponse to isRNA was also observed in Atg7-deficient MEFs, in which Atg5-Atg12 conjugation is impaired. Overexpression of Atg5 or Atg12 resulted in Atg5-Atg12 conjugate formation and suppression of isRNA-mediated signaling. Molecular interaction studies indicated that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate negatively regulates the type I IFN production pathway by direct association with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and IFN-beta promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) through the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs). Thus, in contrast to its role in promoting the bactericidal process, a component of the autophagic machinery appears to block innate antiviral immune responses, thereby contributing to RNA virus replication in host cells.","Jounai, Nao; Takeshita, Fumihiko; Kobiyama, Kouji; Sawano, Asako; Miyawaki, Atsushi; Xin, Ke-Qin; Ishii, Ken J; Kawai, Taro; Akira, Shizuo; Suzuki, Koichi; Okuda, Kenji",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,205,1

The epitopes recognized differ sufficiently between virus subtypes and species to distinguish viruses and provide an important basis for disease diagnosis. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) causes acute febrile illness in humans and has high mortality in equines. The most specific detection methods for serum antibodies use live virus in neutralization assays or in blocking enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. However, work with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus requires biosafety level 3 containment and select agent security in the United States. We report two new assays for detection of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus neutralizing antibody responses, based on virus pseudotypes. The first provides detection by marker gene expression after 20 hours and is particularly suited for high-throughput screening; the second uses a new, rapid virus entry assay to give readouts within 1 hour. Both assays are safe, sensitive, and in general recapitulate neutralizing antibody titers obtained by conventional plaque reduction assays. Each is suitable as a rapid primary screen for detection of neutralizing antibodies against Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.","Kolokoltsov, Andrey A; Wang, Eryu; Colpitts, Tonya M; Weaver, Scott C; Davey, Robert A",The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,205,33

Whether we refer to COVID-19 as a pandemic (a widely used word) or a syndemic (a new emerging term), we now know that specific immunotypes have been linked to both risk to infection and presentation of this disease. Application of assessment tools that support a fuller understanding of individual immune system status is next-level care that providers must prepare for and deliver. Commonly used biometric devices already gather data that can be relevant and useful to a phenotypic evaluation of immune function. These variables include pulse rate, blood oxygenation, sleep cycles, respiration rate, heart rate variability, continuous blood glucose monitoring, and ambulatory blood pressure. When coupled with traditional blood analytes and measurements of nutrient status, a more complete picture of immunological function may be revealed. Innovative questionnaires and algorithms can also be helpful additions to a clinician's toolkit. In a therapeutic relationship between provider and patient, this approach may lead to options for personalized immune intervention using diet, medical nutrition, and lifestyle medicine.","Bland, Jeffrey S",Integrative medicine,205,19

Amantadine also inhibits the induction of inflammatory factors such as RANTES, activates kinase p38 of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases (JNK), which inhibit viral replication. It also significantly inhibits the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the bronchial epithelial cell and blocks the viroporin proton channel of the virus. In addition, it has the ability to pass through the membrane of lysosomes into their interior and act as an alkalizing agent, which prevents the release of viral RNA into the cell, which may be a key element in therapeutic management. Memantine also reduces inflammation, mainly in the nervous system, but also acts as a lysosomotropic factor, inhibiting viral replication. However, it is important to bear in mind when undertaking amantadine or memantine therapy with side effects that may overlap with COVID- 19 symptoms, worsening the condition of patients. Currently, the effectiveness of amantadine and memantine in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 symptoms has been demonstrated in a few clinical trials, mainly in patients treated for neurodegenerative diseases. The obtained results are of considerable value, but require confirmation in further studies.","Plusa, Tadeusz",Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,205,16

The typical low abundance of membrane proteins in their natural hosts makes it necessary to overexpress these proteins either in heterologous systems or through in vitro translation/cell-free expression. Heterologous expression of proteins, in turn, leads to multiple obstacles, owing to the unpredictability of compatibility of the target protein for expression in a given host. The highly hydrophobic and (or) amphipathic nature of membrane proteins also leads to challenges in producing a homogeneous, stable, and pure sample for structural studies. Circumventing these hurdles has become possible through the introduction of novel protein production protocols; efficient protein isolation and sample preparation methods; and, improvement in hardware and software for structural characterization. Combined, these advances have made the past 10-15 years very exciting and eventful for the field of membrane protein structural biology, with an exponential growth in the number of solved membrane protein structures. In this review, we focus on both the advances and diversity of protein production and purification methods that have allowed this growth in structural knowledge of membrane proteins through X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM).","Pandey, Aditya; Shin, Kyungsoo; Patterson, Robin E; Liu, Xiang-Qin; Rainey, Jan K",Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,205,9

Specifically, this analysis examines variation in investment inputs, intervention outputs, and capacity changes to inform expectations of health-promotion capacity-building investment. DESIGN/SETTING This multiple case study involving both qualitative and quantitative data is based on seven provincial dissemination projects involved in the Canadian Heart Health Initiative. METHODS Data on investment, number, and type of capacity-building activities and capacity changes come from a questionnaire, key informant interviews, and project report analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively and for trends, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. RESULTS Per capita investments in capacity building ranged from a low of $0.21 in Ontario to $167.41 in Prince Edward Island. Multiple, tailored capacity-building interventions were used in each project. Mostly positive but modest changes were observed in at least five dimensions of capacity in all but one project. CONCLUSION These findings reveal that capacity building for chronic disease prevention requires a long-term investment and is context specific. Even limited investment can produce interventions that appear to positively influence capacity for chronic disease prevention. The findings also suggest an urgent need to expand surveillance to include indicators of capacity-building investments and interventions to allow policy makers to make more informed decisions about investments in public health.","Robinson, Kerry; Farmer, Tracy; Riley, Barb; Elliott, Susan J; Eyles, John",American journal of health promotion : AJHP,205,24

Although total secretory IgA was significantly associated only with reduction of symptoms, total protein in nasal washings appeared to protect against infection also, indicating that other locally produced proteins, not identified, may be associated with resistance. Two of the many factors which may affect the concentration of circulating and local protective proteins and thus influence the outcome of virus inoculation, namely, sex of the volunteer and the interval since the previous cold, were examined. Male volunteers or volunteers who had had evidence of a recent respiratory infection were less likely to be infected, but if they were infected, they had lower clinical scores and stopped shedding virus earlier than the rest.

METHODOLOGY: In this cross-sectional observational study, matched saliva and oral swabs were collected from a total of 115 subjects: 70 immunocompetent subjects with no mucosal abnormalities, 22 with mucosal abnormalities and 23 therapeutically immunocompromised individuals. Extracted DNA was analysed by multiplex qPCR for detection and quantification of HHVs 1-6. RESULTS: At least one human herpes virus was detected in 77.1% of immunocompetent individuals with no mucosal abnormalities, with EBV the most commonly detected at 61.4%. HHV-6 was detected in 17.1%, HSV-1 in 4.3% and CMV in 1.1%. Detection was higher in saliva than in oral swabs. There was no detection of HSV-2 or VZV. Neither presence of oral mucosal abnormality nor therapeutic immunocompromise was related to increased detection of human herpes virus. CONCLUSION: Commensal detection rates of EBV are high, and caution in clinical correlation of positive detection is warranted. Commensal CMV rates are low, and detection is likely to be clinically relevant. This study presents a comprehensive commensal detection rate of HHVs 1-6 by qPCR in saliva and swabs.","Yap, Tami; Khor, Shuan; Kim, Jung Seo; Kim, Jaeyoung; Kim, Sung Yun; Kern, Johannes S; Martyres, Raymond; Varigos, George; Chan, Hiu Tat; McCullough, Michael J; Thomas, Melissa L; Scardamaglia, Laura",Oral dis,205,16

Here, using PCR with reverse transcription, serology, sequencing the viral genome and virus isolation, we show that 2 out of 15 dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period from a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian. A 2.5-year-old male German shepherd was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs. Antibody responses were detected in both dogs using plaque-reduction-neutralization assays. Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases. The dogs remained asymptomatic during quarantine. The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This may be because corticosteroids are ineffective in relieving the sarcoidosis patient's symptoms/dysfunction or because the clinician has determined that the risks of corticosteroids outweigh their benefits. Interestingly, when corticosteroids truly fail to improve a sarcoidosis patient's condition, it is very rarely because of failure of the drug as an anti-granulomatous agent; rather, it is usually because the patient's symptoms were unrelated to active sarcoid granulomas. In this manuscript, we review the causes of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis. The clinician should consider these causes when confronted with a sarcoidosis patient who is either not responding to corticosteroids, developing corticosteroid side-effects, or is at significant risk of developing such side-effects. We believe that determining the cause of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis may aid the clinicians in optimizing the care of sarcoidosis patients and clinical researchers in appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials.","Goldman, Chananya; Judson, Marc A",Respir Med,205,29

Estimating the economic impacts of a prevailing pandemic is fraught with uncertainties about the epidemiology of the disease and the breadth of disruption of economic activities. This paper employs historical and near real-time Google search data to estimate the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on demand for selected services across 182 countries. The analysis exploits the temporal and spatial variations in the spread of the virus and finds that demand for services that require face-to-face interaction, such as hotels, restaurants and retail trade, has substantially contracted. In contrast, demand for services that can be performed remotely or provide solutions to the challenges of reduced personal interactions, such as information and communications technology (ICT), and deliveries, has increased significantly. In a span of three months, the pandemic has resulted in a 63 percent reduction in demand for hotels, while increasing demand for ICT by a comparable rate. The impacts appear to be driven by supply contractions, due to social distancing and lockdown measures, and demand shocks as consumers shelter in place, with the latter dominating for most services. The magnitude of the changes in demand varies considerably with government responses to the pandemic.","Abay, K. A.; Tafere, K.; Woldemichael, A.",Policy Research Working Paper - World Bank|2020.

This review examines the evidence for these sex and gender differences and aims to illustrate possible mechanisms behind such sensitivity. Successful entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the body is dependent on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, sex-based differences in the expression of the ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 may explain the disparities in COVID-19 severity and fatality. Furthermore, these disparities may also be attributed to sex-based difference in immunological responses. Finally, the differences in clinical outcomes of COVID-19 infections between men and women may be due to gendered differences in behaviors, such as smoking, and prevalence to comorbidities. An understanding of the sex and gender sensitivities of COVID-19 infection is a necessary component towards the creation of effective treatment options and therapies for the virus.

We identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2 and, interestingly, found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2. Infected cells activated strong pro-inflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon.

Spike (S) glycoproteins on the viral membrane bind to ACE2 receptors on the host cell membrane and initiate fusion, and S protein is currently among the primary drug target to inhibit viral entry. The S protein can be in a receptor inaccessible (closed) or accessible (open) state based on down and up positions of its receptor-binding domain (RBD), respectively. However, conformational dynamics and the transition pathway between closed to open states remain unexplored. Here, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from closed and open states of the S protein trimer in the presence of explicit water and ions. MD simulations showed that RBD forms a higher number of interdomain interactions and exhibits lower mobility in its down position than its up position. MD simulations starting from intermediate conformations between the open and closed states indicated that RBD switches to the up position through a semi-open intermediate that potentially reduces the free energy barrier between the closed and open states. Free energy landscapes were constructed, and a minimum energy pathway connecting the closed and open states was proposed. Because RBD-ACE2 binding is compatible with the semi-open state, but not with the closed state of the S protein, we propose that the formation of the intermediate state is a prerequisite for the host cell recognition.","Gur, Mert; Taka, Elhan; Yilmaz, Sema Zeynep; Kilinc, Ceren; Aktas, Umut; Golcuk, Mert",J Chem Phys,205,16

Gestion des cas groupés - clusters de COVID-19. (2020). 2 Surveillance definitions for COVID-19. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Résultats En 2020, 4,352 signalements (SIN) de Covid-19 nosocomiales ont été émis. Parmi ces SIN, 1845 cas groupés (CG) représentant 18 778 cas patients (60%), 12 574 cas soignants (40 %) et 10 cas visiteurs. La répartition par service des CG signalés est la suivante : 828 en médecine, 567 en SSR, 139 en chirurgie, 108 en SLD, 61 en secteur EHPAD, 42 en soins intensifs, 35 aux urgences, 13 en gynécologie-obstétrique, 3 en imagerie et 48 dans les services supports (laboratoire, cuisine, …). La part des professionnels dans les CG est variable selon les services: elle est proche de la moyenne dans les services de médecine (46 %) et de chirurgie (53 %), elle est plus faible dans les services de SSR (34 %), SLD (27 %) et secteur EHPAD (26 %) et plus élevée en Gynécologie-Obstétrique (63%), en Soins Intensifs (74 %), aux urgences (92 %) et en Imagerie (100 %). Les principales hypothèses formulées pour expliquer la transmission du virus sont: (1) la découverte fortuite d’un cas, (2) le non-respect strict des mesures barrières et (3) les pauses/transmissions entre professionnels sur leur lieu de travail. La première hypothèse est au premier plan dans les services de médecine (38 %) et de chirurgie (44 %), secteur EHPAD (46 %), SLD (41 %) et SSR (42 %). La 3e hypothèse est au premier plan dans les services de gynécologie-obstétrique (62 %), imagerie (100 %) et urgences (43 %). En soins intensifs les 3 hypothèses sont au même niveau (environ 1/3).

Immune system processes and functionalities are organized as circadian rhythms, and they are also strongly influenced by sleep status. Sleep is a vital behavioral state of living beings and a modulator of immune function and responsiveness. Shiftworkers show increased risk for developing viral infections due to possible compromise of both innate and acquired immunity responses. Short sleep and sleep loss, common consequences of shiftwork, are associated with altered integrity of the immune system. We discuss the possible excess risk for COVID-19 infection in the context of the common conditions among shiftworkers, including nurses, doctors, and first responders, among others of high exposure to the contagion, of sleep imbalance and circadian disruption.

Therefore, this audit carried out its 4th cycle of physical health monitoring for patients on antipsychotics with severe mental illness (SMI) under the CMHT during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to observe its impact on physical health monitoring. In addition, with the increased use of telepsychiatry substituting routine face-to-face appointments during the pandemic, this audit also reviews the effect of lockdown on maintenance of contact between CMHT and people with SMI.Primary Objective: to compare the current clinical practice with the standards derived from NICE guidelines which include parameters like weight, body-mass index, blood pressure, ECG and blood tests, then compare with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data.Secondary Objective: to monitor amount of contact between healthcare staff and people with SMI on antipsychotics during the three months of Welsh lockdown and compare current clinical practice with the clinical practice achieved in the identical period in 2019.MethodMethod for Primary Objective: Clinical practice on physical health checks were split into 10 standards derived from the NICE guidelines (NICEQS80, Quality Standard 6). Data collection surrounding physical health checks of patients on antipsychotics from 26th June 2019 to 26th June 2020 were collected and compared with the previous three audit cycles, which collected identical data.Method for Secondary Objective: Retrospective data surrounding amount and type of contact between CMHT and people with SMI was collected from 26th March 2020 to 26th June 2020, a period of enforced lockdown in Wales, and compared with the identical period in 2019.ResultThe audit iterates trends over the last 4 cycles (2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019 and 2019/2020). The current audit cycle increased in 2/10 standards and decreased in 8/10 standards, compared with the average compliance in the 3 previous audit cycles. Out of the 10 derived standards, certain standards fared worse than others.There was a 79% increase in the number of staff-patient contact during the lockdown period. The majority of the contact in 2019 was face-to-face (84.31%), however, as expected, in 2020 the majority of the contact was non face-to-face (61.75%). However, this was accompanied by an 85.79%ConclusionDespite being in a pandemic, patient contact was maintained. Physical health monitoring has decreased in the majority of standards, therefore greater attention is needed to address this.

STUDY DESIGN: Diagnosis of MIS-C like disease was pursued after echocardiography showed severely depressed ventricular function and pathological coronary artery dilation in the setting of medically refractory multisystem organ failure and maternal COVID-19 infection. The neonate did not respond to standard medical therapy, and there was no alternative disease that could explain the clinical course. High index of clinical suspicion coupled with low risk of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prompted us to pursue IVIG administration even though the neonate did not meet classic criteria for MIS-C. RESULT: Following treatment with IVIG, there was rapid clinical improvement. Ventricular function improved within 15 hours and coronary artery dilation resolved in 8 days. There was no recurrence of disease during follow-up. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 associated MIS-C like disease has not been well described in neonates. As typical features may be conspicuously absent, a high index of suspicion is warranted in critically ill neonates born to mothers with COVID-19. Echocardiography may provide critical diagnostic information and narrow the differential diagnosis.

This study aimed to explore the mental health of teachers who were forced to telework because of COVID-19, and to analyze the association with sociodemographic, teacher-related, and working conditions. The sample was 278 classroom teachers in Chile who teleworked more than 50% during the 2020 academic year. The participants were mostly women (82%) who entered the teaching profession at age 30 or younger (87%) and worked two or more unpaid overtime hours per day (67%). The dependent variable was mental health measured through the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). The independent variables were sociodemographic, teacher-related, and work conditions. The internal structure of the mental health construct was evaluated using the Rasch model. Crude odds ratios (cORs) and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were estimated using logistic regression models. A high rate of poor mental health was identified in teachers (58%). The variables associated with poor mental health were working in a private–subsidized school (aOR = 2.89;95% CI: 1.16–7.22), working two or more unpaid overtime hours (aOR = 2.25;95% CI: 1.11–4.59), and being absent due to sickness (aOR = 3.82;95% CI: 1.53–9.58).

Method qualitative, explanatory case study. Data were collected from the websites of the Federal Prosecution Service, Regional Labor Court (1st Region), and the Court of Justice of Rio de Janeiro. The inclusion criterion was public civil actions that concerned health care and situations involving the COVID-19 pandemic. Two categories emerged from data analysis. Results four cases were identified. Conclusion the judicialization of health care consists of obtaining assets and rights in the courts. These assets and rights are essential to ensure the health of citizens but have been denied in various instances, often due to the omission of the executive and legislative powers. Analyzing the judicialization of health care amidst the pandemic brings focus and highlights the importance of giving voice and visibility to the enormous contingent of the Brazilian society unassisted by public authorities.","Carvalho, Eloá Carneiro; Souza, Pedro Hugo Dantas de Oliveira; Varella, Thereza Christina Mó y Mó Loureiro; Souza, Norma Valéria Dantas de Oliveira; Farias, Sheila Nascimento Pereira de; Soares, Samira Silva Santos",Rev. latinoam. enferm.

The aims of this study were to describe the diet and its nutritional quality in Spanish households during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave and to compare them with the same period in 2019. Data on monthly foods and beverages household purchases in 2019 and 2020 were obtained from the nationwide Food Consumption Surveys. In April, there was an average increase, compared with 2019, of more than 40% for all food groups, with significant peaks in: alcoholic beverages (75%), appetizers (60%), eggs (59%), sugar and sweets (52%), and vegetables (50%). In March, the greatest peak was for pulses, with a 63% increment. The mean energy value of purchased foods in April was 2801 kcal/person/day, corresponding to an increase of 771 kcal/person/day (+38%), compared to the same month of 2019 (March and May: +520 kcal (+26%), June: +343 kcal (+18%)). Regarding nutrient density, there was a reduction in calcium, iodine, zinc, selenium, riboflavin, vitamins B12, D, A, especially retinol, and an increase in fibre, sodium, folic acid, carotenes and vitamin E. Alcohol content per 1000 kcal increased by more than 20% from April to July. Food purchase patterns in Spanish households changed during lockdown and after it, with no appreciable improvement in the quality of the diet.","Del Pozo de la Calle, Susana; Alonso Ledesma, Isabel; Nuñez, Olivier; Castelló Pastor, Adela; Lope Carvajal, Virginia; Fernández de Larrea Baz, Nerea; Pérez-Gómez, Beatriz; Pollán, Marina; Ruiz Moreno, Emma",Nutrients,205,20

The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally. DESIGN: Patients were enrolled consecutively after signing written informed consent. Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. Based on a National Institute of Health (NIH)-endorsed Protocol to research Patient Experience of COVID-19, we collected longitudinal severity scores of five symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headaches and anosmia) and general unwellness on a four-point ordinal scale modelled on performance status scoring. All data are reported at the patient level. Longitudinal combined normalised symptom scores were statistically compared. RESULTS: Ten consecutive patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose oral famotidine were identified. The most frequently used famotidine regimen was 80 mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5-21 days). Famotidine was well tolerated. All patients reported marked improvements of disease related symptoms after starting famotidine. The combined symptom score improved significantly within 24 hours of starting famotidine and peripheral oxygen saturation (n=2) and device recorded activity (n=1) increased. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series suggest that high-dose oral famotidine is well tolerated and associated with improved patient-reported outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.","Janowitz, Tobias; Gablenz, Eva; Pattinson, David; Wang, Timothy C; Conigliaro, Joseph; Tracey, Kevin; Tuveson, David",Gut,205,1

Current efforts are focused on containment and quarantine of infected individuals. Ultimately, the outbreak could be controlled with a protective vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. While vaccine research should be pursued intensely, there exists today no therapy to treat 2019-nCoV upon infection, despite an urgent need to find options to help these patients and preclude potential death. Herein, I review the potential options to treat 2019-nCoV in patients, with an emphasis on the necessity for speed and timeliness in developing new and effective therapies in this outbreak. I consider the options of drug repurposing, developing neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapy, and an oligonucleotide strategy targeting the viral RNA genome, emphasizing the promise and pitfalls of these approaches. Finally, I advocate for the fastest strategy to develop a treatment now, which could be resistant to any mutations the virus may have in the future. The proposal is a biologic that blocks 2019-nCoV entry using a soluble version of the viral receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), fused to an immunoglobulin Fc domain, providing a neutralizing antibody with maximal breath to avoid any viral escape, while also helping to recruit the immune system to build lasting immunity. The sequence of the ACE2-Fc protein is provided to investigators, allowing its possible use in recombinant protein expression systems to start producing drug today to treat patients under compassionate use, while formal clinical trials are later undertaken. Such a treatment could help infected patients before a protective vaccine is developed and widely available in the coming months to year(s).","Kruse, Robert L",F1000Res,205,23

Our goal is to learn the potential outcome associated with every intervention on every unit (i.e., $N \times D$ causal parameters). Towards this, we present a causal framework, synthetic interventions (SI), to infer these $N \times D$ causal parameters while only observing each of the $N$ units under at most two interventions, independent of $D$. This can be significant as the number of interventions, i.e, level of personalization, grows. Importantly, our estimator also allows for latent confounders that determine how interventions are assigned. Theoretically, under a novel tensor factor model across units, measurements, and interventions, we formally establish an identification result for each of these $N \times D$ causal parameters and establish finite-sample consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimator. The estimator is furnished with a data-driven test to verify its suitability. Empirically, we validate our framework through both experimental and observational case studies; namely, a large-scale A/B test performed on an e-commerce platform, and an evaluation of mobility restriction on morbidity outcomes due to COVID-19. We believe this has important implications for program evaluation and the design of data-efficient RCTs with heterogeneous units and multiple interventions.","Agarwal, Anish; Shah, Devavrat; Shen, Dennis",,205,24

Despite advances in treatment, there remain well-recognised morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification requires the identification and validation of biomarkers, old and new. Hyponatremia has re-emerged as a prognostic marker in CHF patients. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study on 241 CHF patients recruited from King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia (January 2005-December 2016). Their serum sodium and biochemical parameters were measured at baseline, along with 2-D echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular mass and ejection fraction. The primary endpoint was the association between hyponatremia and all-cause mortality (ACM) after a follow-up period of 24 months. Results: Mean age of patients was 60.61 ± 12.63 (SD) years; 65.1% were males, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) was present in 71%. Baseline serum sodium was 138.00 (136, 140) (median and interquartile range). Hyponatremia (<135 meq/L) was present in 14.1%. After follow-up, 46 deaths had occurred. Multivariate Cox-proportional hazard model showed that type 2 DM, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (III-IV vs I-II), age, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were significant and independent predictors of ACM, with HR 3.03 (95% CI; 1.13, 8.16) (P=0.028), HR 2.31 (95% CI; 1.11, 4.82) (P=0.026), HR 1.06 (95% CI; 1.03, 1.09) (P<0.001), and HR 1.01 (95% CI; 1.00, 1.02) (P=0.039), respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was not a significant predictor. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for the analysis of NYHA class and hyponatremia interactions and showed that hyponatremia had an association with poorer survival in patients with NYHA class III-IV rather than I-II (Log-rank test, P= 0.0009). Conclusion: Hyponatremia was a feature in CHF patients, and ACM was predicted by type 2 DM, NYHA class, age, and LVMI. Hyponatremia impact on survival was in patients with more advanced disease.","Alem, Manal M",Int J Gen Med,205,1

Immune reactions against viral infections are closely related to viral and host proteins sequence similarity. Molecular Mimicry has been described for many different viruses; sequence similarities of viral and human tissue proteins may trigger autoimmune reactions after viral infections due to similarities between viral and human structures. With this study, we aimed to investigate the protein sequence similarity of SARS CoV-2 with retinal proteins and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) surface proteins. Retinal proteins involved in autoimmune retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins were analyzed in order to infer their structural similarity to surface glycoprotein (S), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), ORF1ab polyprotein (orf1ab) proteins of SARS CoV-2. Protein similarity comparisons, 3D protein structure prediction, T cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction, B cell epitopes-MHC binding prediction and the evaluation of the antigenicity of peptides assessments were performed. The protein sequence analysis was made using the Pairwise Sequence Alignment and the LALIGN program. 3D protein structure estimates were made using Swiss Model with default settings and analyzed with TM-align web server. T-cell epitope identification was performed using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis (IEDB) resource Tepitool. B cell epitopes based on sequence characteristics of the antigen was performed using amino acid scales and HMMs with the BepiPred 2.0 web server. The predicted peptides/epitopes in terms of antigenicity were examined using the default settings with the VaxiJen v2.0 server. Analyses showed that, there is a meaningful similarities between 6 retinal pigment epithelium surface transport proteins (MRP-4, MRP-5, RFC1, SNAT7, TAUT and MATE) and the SARS CoV-2 E protein. Immunoreactive epitopic sites of these proteins which are similar to protein E epitope can create an immune stimulation on T cytotoxic and T helper cells and 6 of these 9 epitopic sites are also vaxiJen. These result imply that autoimmune cross-reaction is likely between the studied RPE proteins and SARS CoV-2 E protein. The structure of SARS CoV-2, its proteins and immunologic reactions against these proteins remain largely unknown. Understanding the structure of SARS CoV-2 proteins and demonstration of similarity with human proteins are crucial to predict an autoimmune response associated with immunity against host proteins and its clinical manifestations as well as possible adverse effects of vaccination.","Karagöz, Isil Kutlutürk; Munk, Marion R; Kaya, Mücahit; Rückert, René; Yildirim, Mustafa; Karabas, Levent",Exp Eye Res,205,21

Underlying the dissatisfaction were assumptions which need to be clarified for example that mass as being identical to holy communion is considered the only way to fulfill the Sunday’s obligations. In fact, there are a number of religious practices and doctrinal teachings that could serve as better alternatives to the eucharistic celebration on Sundays.

In this context, the so-called hyperinflammation syndrome characterized by a cytokine storm accompanied by a massive increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin(IL)-6, represents such a situation. This case report describes the therapeutic approach of using the IL-6-specific antibody tocilizumab in combination with hemoadsorption therapy (CytoSorb) in a 58-year-old male patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient suffered a massive clinical deterioration with concomitant Horovitz index of 127âmmHg that occurred on the 6th day of ventilation. After combined application of the above-mentioned therapeutic approaches, the patient stabilized rapidly paralleled by a significant increase in the Horovitz index, and the possibility of de-escalating the ventilation regimen, which ultimately enabled successful extubation after only 13 days of ventilation. Moreover, the combined treatment was associated with significant hemodynamic stabilization and a consecutive reduction in vasopressor doses, while hyperinflammation could be kept well under control. The incorporation of the hemoadsorber into the therapeutic regimen proved to be safe and straightforward. In conclusion, the combination of CytoSorb therapy and IL-6 blockade by tocilizumab appeared, at least in this case, to be an effective measure to modulate an overshooting immune response in COVID-19 pneumonia with a concomitant clinical improvement in both respiratory and hemodynamic function, and thus could be used as a potential therapeutic option in this clinical picture.","Kornitzky, F W; Langen, H-J; Held, M",Pneumologie (Stuttg.),205,16

The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs' cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19. They are also critical for VILIs and applicable to future clinical studies.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Preexposure of cultured cells to either dexamethasone or transdehydroandrosterone significantly decreases cellular injuries associated with mechanical ventilation due to their ability to alter the cell mechanics. This is an alternative protective method against VILIs instead of common methods that rely on modification of mechanical ventilator modes.","Al-Ruweidi, Mahmoud Khatib A A; Ali, Fatma Hassan; Shurbaji, Samar; Popelka, Anton; Yalcin, Huseyin C",J Appl Physiol (1985),205,22

We conducted a serosurveillance using antibody testing in an area where official report of COVID-19 infection is not done yet. Blood samples were obtained from 1404 healthcare workers (41 ± 11 years) in our hospital on May 29-31, 2020. First, the potential infection frequency was confirmed using two quantitative antibody tests. In addition, the usefulness of rapid antibody kit testing for COVID-19 serosurveillance was examined. A COVID-19-indected case was defined as showing positive results in both quantitative tests. None of 1404 samples had positive results from the two quantitative tests. The false positive rates were 0.36% and 0.07%, whereas those in rapid antibody kits were 3.3% and 3.0%. In conclusion, as of May, 2020, potential spread mainly by asymptomatic individuals infected with COVID-19 was not found in our local area where there was no official report of COVID-19, even if the PCR testing rate was low.

Key ion channels (mainly the funny channel, HCN4) and Ca2+-handling proteins in the SN are responsible for its function. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression through inhibition or activation and microRNAs (miRs) do this through inhibition. There is high expression of macrophages and mast cells within the SN connective tissue. 'Novel'/unexplored TFs and miRs in the regulation of ion channels and immune cells in the SN are not well understood. Using RNAseq and bioinformatics, the expression profile and predicted interaction of key TFs and cell markers with key miRs in the adult human SN vs. right atrial tissue (RA) were determined. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: 68 and 60â¯TFs significantly more or less expressed in the SN vs. RA respectively. Among those more expressed were ISL1 and TBX3 (involved in embryonic development of the SN) and 'novel' RUNX1-2, CEBPA, GLI1-2 and SOX2. These TFs were predicted to regulate HCN4 expression in the SN. Markers for different cells: fibroblasts (COL1A1), fat (FABP4), macrophages (CSF1R and CD209), natural killer (GZMA) and mast (TPSAB1) were significantly more expressed in the SN vs. RA. Interestingly, RUNX1-3, CEBPA and GLI1 also regulate expression of these cells. MiR-486-3p inhibits HCN4 and markers involved in immune response. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, RUNX1-2, CSF1R, TPSAB1, COL1A1 and HCN4 are highly expressed in the SN but not miR-486-3p. Their complex interactions can be used to treat SN dysfunction such as bradycardia. Interestingly, another research group recently reported miR-486-3p is upregulated in blood samples from severe COVID-19 patients who suffer from bradycardia.","Aminu, Abimbola J; Petkova, Maria; Atkinson, Andrew J; Yanni, Joseph; Morris, Alex D; Simms, Robert T; Chen, Weixuan; Yin, Zeyuan; Kuniewicz, Marcin; Holda, Mateusz K; Kuzmin, Vladislav S; Perde, Filip; Molenaar, Peter; Dobrzynski, Halina",Prog. biophys. mol. biol,205,16

OBJECTIVE: This study examined the adoption of these technologies across the SUD service continuum, acceptance of these technologies among service providers, and intent of providers to use these technologies after the pandemic. Additional analysis using the validated technology acceptance model (TAM) was performed to test the potential applications of these technologies after the pandemic. The study objectives were as follows: (1) to assess the use of telehealth (telephone and video technologies) for different SUD services during COVID-19 in May-June 2020, (2) to assess the intended applications of telehealth for SUD services beyond COVID-19, (3) to evaluate the perceived ease of use and value of telehealth for delivering SUD services, and (4) to assess organizational readiness for the sustained use of telehealth services. METHODS: An online survey on the use of telephonic and video services was distributed between May and August 2020 to measure the current use of these services, perceived organizational readiness to use these services, and the intent to use these services after COVID-19. In total, 8 of 10 regional Addiction Technology Transfer Centers representing 43 states distributed the survey. Individual organizations were the unit of analysis. RESULTS: In total, 457 organizations responded to the survey. Overall, the technology was widely used; >70% (n>335) of organizations reported using telephone or video platforms for most services. The odds of the intent of organizations to use these technologies to deliver services post COVID-19 were significantly greater for all but two services (ie, telephonic residential counseling and buprenorphine therapy; mean odds ratio 3.79, range 1.87-6.98). Clinical users preferred video technologies to telephone technologies for virtually all services. Readiness to use telephone and video technologies was high across numerous factors, though telephonic services were considered more accessible. Consistent with the TAM, perceived usefulness and ease of use influenced the intent to use both telephone and video technologies. CONCLUSIONS: The overall perceived ease of use and usefulness of telephonic and video services suggest promising post-COVID-19 applications of these services. Survey participants consistently preferred video services to telephonic services; however, the availability of telephonic services to those lacking easy access to video technology is an important characteristic of these services. Future studies should review the acceptance of telehealth services and their comparative impact on SUD care outcomes.","Molfenter, Todd; Roget, Nancy; Chaple, Michael; Behlman, Stephanie; Cody, Olivia; Hartzler, Bryan; Johnson, Edward; Nichols, Maureen; Stilen, Patricia; Becker, Sara",JMIR Ment Health,205,25

Recently, vaccination against COVID-19 has begun, but further studies on effective therapeutic agents are still needed. The severity of COVID-19 is attributable to several factors such as the dysfunctional host immune response manifested by uncontrolled viral replication, type I interferon suppression, and release of impaired cytokines by the infected resident and recruited cells. Due to the evolving pathophysiology and direct involvement of the host immune system in COVID-19, the use of immune-modulating drugs is still challenging. For the use of immune-modulating drugs in severe COVID-19, it is important to balance the fight between the aggravated immune system and suppression of immune defense against the virus that causes secondary infection. In addition, the interplaying events that occur during virus-host interactions, such as activation of the host immune system, immune evasion mechanism of the virus, and manifestation of different stages of COVID-19, are disjunctive and require thorough streamlining. This review provides an update on the immunotherapeutic interventions implemented to combat COVID-19 along with the understanding of molecular aspects of the immune evasion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which may provide opportunities to develop more effective and promising therapeutics.","Shah, Masaud; Woo, Hyun Goo",Mol. cells,205,1

The current study, aims to predict theoretical structure for protease of COVID-19 and to explore further whether this protein can serve as a target for protease inhibitor drugs such as remdesivir, nelfinavir, lopinavir, ritonavir and &#945;-ketoamide. While the 3D structure of protease was predicted using SWISS MODEL server, molecular interaction studies between protein and ligands were performed using AutoDock software. The predicted protease model was reasonably good based on reports generated by different validation servers. The study further revealed that all the protease inhibitor drugs got docked with negative dock energy onto the target protein. Molecular interaction studies showed that protease structure had multiple active site residues for remdesivir, while for remaining ligands the structure had only one active site residue each. From the output of multiple sequence alignment, it is evident that ligand binding sites were conserved. The current in silico study thus, provides structural insights about the protease of COVID-19 and also its molecular interactions with some of the known protease inhibitors.","Mothay, Dipti; Ramesh, K V",Virusdisease,205,1

METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively for all transplant patients who attended hospital during the peak of the pandemic and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty percent were treated as outpatients, 59% were admitted to the general ward, and 21% required intensive care. Treatment consisted of reduced immunosuppression, antibiotics for pneumonia or sepsis, and other supportive treatments. Within our cohort, 12 patients died (18%), with an overall mortality of 0.4%. Predictive risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 severity were explored. CONCLUSIONS: Severe disease was associated with lower hemoglobin prior to coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis and lower lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis but not age, sex, ethnicity, or preexisting comorbidities. Lower glomerular filtration rate and higher C-reactive protein were associated with more severe disease.","Sran, K.; Olsburgh, J.; Kasimatis, T.; Clark, K.; Gökmen, R.; Hilton, R.; Shah, S.; Shaw, C.; Farmer, C.; Kilbride, H.; Asgari, E.",Transplant Proc,205,22

This paper explores the drivers of competitiveness in Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) in the knowledge economy, and its further impact on economic welfare, with a particular focus on individuals’ perceived good health and well-being (a good predictor of people’s future use of the healthcare system and mortality risk and a benchmark for sustainable development). The dataset grasps 11 CEECs analyzed during the 2000–2018 lapse of time. The methodological endeavor is based on three econometric procedures encompassing macroeconometric models, structural equation modelling (SEM) and network analysis through Gaussian Graphical Models. Main findings entail that CEECs competitiveness is driven by the key coordinates of the knowledge economy, particularly tertiary education, employment in technology and knowledge-intensive sectors, and additional government financial support dedicated for research and development activities. Moreover, in a further complex setting, competitiveness increases under the impact of education, research, development and innovation leads to significant upwards in GDP per capita levels. However, the further linkages with individuals’ good health and well-being, when considered as a consequence of welfare increase following knowledge-driven competitiveness, or as a direct impact of competitiveness increases, entail a downsized outcome in terms of individuals’ perceived health. Our results provide solid grounds for the development of new tailored policies designed to enhance CEECs knowledge-driven competitiveness in a comprehensive framework, with benefit spillovers on sustainable economic development.

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) - such as hypertension, diabetes, and obstructive lung diseases – are key drivers of this widening gap, because they disproportionately afflict vulnerable populations. Vulnerable populations with non-communicable diseases, in turn, are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 itself – but also at increased risk of poor outcomes from those underlying conditions. Proven strategies for NCD control must be adapted to help vulnerable patients react to these dual threats. We detail six key policy interventions – task shifting, workforce protection, telehealth and mobile services, insurance restructuring and increased funding for NCDs, prescription policies for NCDs and community partnerships - to bridge this care gap. Long-term integration of these care models post-COVID-19 may prevent care shocks during future pandemics, bolstering emerging universal primary care models.","Mobula, Linda M.; Heller, David J.; Commodore-Mensah, Yvonne; Walker Harris, Vanessa; Cooper, Lisa A.",Gates Open Res,205,4

The nanocrystalline Mn–Zn ferrites were synthesized using a solvent-free combustion reaction method. The structural analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern reveals the single-phase of all the samples and the Rietveld refined XRD patterns confirmed the cubic-spinel structure. The calculated crystallite size values increase from 8.5 nm to 19.6 nm with the Zn concentration. The surface morphological analysis using field emission scanning electron microscopy and the transmission electron microscopy confirms the nano size of the prepared ferrites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was used to study the ionic state of the atoms present in the samples. Further, the high-resolution Mn 2p, Zn 2p, Fe 2p, and O 1s spectra of Mn(1-x)Zn(x)Fe(2)O(4) does not result in the appearance of new peaks with Zn content, indicating that the Zn substitution does not change the ionic state of Mn, Zn, Fe, and O present in nanocrystalline Mn(1-x)Zn(x)Fe(2)O(4). The investigated electrical properties show that the dielectric constant, tan δ and ac conductivity gradually decrease with increasing Zn substitution and the sample Mn(0.2)Zn(0.8)Fe(2)O(4) has the lowest value of conductivity at 303 K. The ac conductivity measured at different temperatures shows the semiconducting nature of the ferrites. The impedance spectra analysis shows that the contribution of grain boundary is higher compared with the grain to the resistance. The obtained results suggest that the Zn substituted manganese ferrite nanoparticles can act as a promising candidate for high-frequency electronic devices applications.","Murugesan, C.; Ugendar, K.; Okrasa, L.; Shen, Jun; Chandrasekaran, G.",Ceram Int,205,1

The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed our lives and caused the death of nearly four million people worldwide, as of this writing. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes the disease and has been at the center of scientific research over the past year. Most of the research on the virus is focused on key players during its initial attack and entry into the cellular host; namely the S protein, its glycan shield, and its interactions with the ACE2 receptors of human cells. As cases continue to rise around the globe, and new mutants are identified, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of this virus during different stages of its life cycle. Here, we consider two integral membrane proteins of SARS-CoV-2 known to be important for viral assembly and infectivity. We have used microsecond-long all-atom molecular dynamics to examine the lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions of the membrane (M) and envelope (E) structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in a complex membrane model. We contrast the two proposed protein complexes for each of these proteins, and quantify their effect on their local lipid environment.

Refractory viral infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) represent a major global health issue. In particular, the increasing occurrence of resistance to conventional antiviral drugs make the therapy of such infections even more challenging. For instance, the frequent and long-term use of acyclovir and other nucleoside analogues targeting the viral DNA-polymerase enhance the development of resistant viruses. Particularly, the incidental increase of those strains in immunocompromised patients is alarming and represent a major health concern. Alternative treatment concepts are clearly needed. Natural products such as herbal medicines showed antiherpetic activity in vitro and in vivo and proved to be an excellent source for the discovery and isolation of novel antivirals. By this means, numerous plant-derived compounds with antiviral or antimicrobial activity could be isolated. Natural medicines and their ingredients are well-tolerated and could be a good alternative for treating herpes simplex virus infections. This review provides an overview of the recent status of natural sources such as plants, bacteria, fungi, and their ingredients with antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses. Furthermore, we highlight the most potent herbal medicines and ingredients as promising candidates for clinical investigation and give an overview about the most important drug classes along with their potential antiviral mechanisms.

Objective. Herein, we have demonstrated the clinical manifestations, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of patients with severe Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, as well as measures to ensure early diagnosis and intervention for improving clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. Summary Background Data. The COVID-19 is a new infection caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome- (SARS-) like coronavirus that emerged in China in December 2019 and has claimed millions of lives. Methods. We included 37 severe COVID-19 pneumonia patients who were hospitalized at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center in Zhejiang province from January 17, 2020, to February 18, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory features; imaging characteristics; treatment history; and clinical outcomes of all patients were collected from electronic medical records. Results. The patients' mean age was 54 years (interquartile range, 43−64), with a slightly higher male preponderance (57%). The most common clinical features of COVID-19 pneumonia were fever (29 (78%)), dry cough (28 (76%)), dyspnea (9 (24%)), and fatigue (9 (24%)). Serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 were elevated in 35 (95%) and 19 (51%) patients, respectively. Chest computerized tomography scan revealed bilateral pneumonia in 35 (95%) patients. Early intervention with a combination of methylprednisolone and human immunoglobulin was highly effective in improving the prognosis of these patients. Conclusions. Progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most common cause of death in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia owing to an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Early intervention with methylprednisolone and human immunoglobulin was highly effective in improving their prognosis.","He, Susu; Fang, Lina; Xia, Lingzhen; Lin, Shuangxiang; Ye, Junhui; Luo, Dinghai",Comput Math Methods Med,205,1

Soluble GP ectodomains are unstable and mostly monomeric when not fused to a heterologous trimerization domain. Here, we report structure-based designs of Ebola and Marburg GP trimers based on a stabilizing mutation in the hinge loop in refolding region 1 and substitution of a partially buried charge at the interface of the GP1 and GP2 subunits. The combined substitutions (T577P and K588F) substantially increased trimer expression for Ebola GP proteins. We determined the crystal structure of stabilized GP from the Makona Zaire ebolavirus strain without a trimerization domain or complexed ligand. The structure reveals that the stabilized GP adopts the same trimeric prefusion conformation, provides insight into triggering of GP conformational changes, and should inform future filovirus vaccine development.","Rutten, Lucy; Gilman, Morgan S.A.; Blokland, Sven; Juraszek, Jarek; McLellan, Jason S.; Langedijk, Johannes P.M.",Cell Rep,205,1

However, up to now, no data are available on safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations in RD patients. The possible development of adverse events (AEs), including the flare-up of underlying RD, represents a matter of growing importance. The aim of our study is to assess, in RD patients, the safety profile of different types of approved vaccines and the possible influence of immunosuppressive therapies and clinical or demographic characteristics of RD patients on development of AEs. Participants (n = 185; 30.7%) received anti-COVID-19 vaccinations, 137 with autoimmune/chronic inflammatory RD (Au/cIn-RD) and 48 with nonautoimmune/chronic inflammatory RD (no-Au/cIn-RD). AEs were recorded in 42% of patients after the first dose of vaccine, and in 26% of patients after the second dose. The most common reported AEs after anti-COVID 19 vaccines were site injection pain (17%), headache (12%), fever (12%), myalgia (10%) and fatigue (10%). Relapses of the underlying Au/c-In-RD were recorded in 2.2% of patients after the first dose of vaccine. In Au/c-In-RD the risk of developing AEs after the first dose of vaccine was lower in older patients (OR = 0.95; p = 0.001), and in the group of patients with complete control of RD (OR: 0.2; p = 0.010). A lower percentage of AEs was observed in patients with complete control of their Au/cIn-RD (29%) compared to those with low (57%) or moderate-high disease activity (63%) (p = 0.002 and p = 0.006 respectively). In this study all types of COVID-19 vaccines in use in Italy seemed safe in RD patients. The results of this study might provide reassuring information for Au/cIn RD patients and clinicians and could strengthen the data on vaccine safety to guide the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Au/cIn-RD on immunosuppressive agents.","Rotondo, Cinzia; Cantatore, Francesco Paolo; Fornaro, Marco; Colia, Ripalta; Busto, Giuseppe; Rella, Valeria; Sciacca, Stefania; Lops, Lucia; Cici, Daniela; Maruotti, Nicola; D’Onofrio, Francesca; Iannone, Florenzo; Corrado, Addolorata",Vaccines (Basel),205,3

METHODS: We conducted a cold chain capacity assessment of a simulated country in the WHO African Region. We combined region-specific data regarding immunization, population, healthcare workforce, and cold storage capacity (upper and lower range and quartile values for national and subnational levels). We used seasonal influenza vaccines as proxies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. We evaluated the increase in vaccine doses to be administered, doses administered per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for SARSCoV-2 campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. FINDINGS: Compared to routine immunization, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaign would increase monthly doses administered when targeting risk groups: ≥65 years (29.9%), chronic diseases patients (101.5%), and healthcare workers (1.2%). SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase doses administered per vaccinator for risk groups: ≥65 years (32.5%), chronic diseases patients (110.4%), or healthcare workers (1.4%). Routine vaccine volumes already exceed national level storage capacity for at least 75% of African Region countries, but subnational levels would have sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in all but the lower 25% of African Region countries. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold chain capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would add volume to national level stores already at their limits, but substantial capacity exists at subnational levels for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Immediate attention to strengthening delivery systems is essential to support pandemic vaccine responses in the African Region.

AIMS: This study aims to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and clinical outcome of older adults with atypical presentations of COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of adults ≥ 65 years with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our institution between 1 March and 24 April 2020 was performed. Patients were categorised into typical or atypical groups based on primary presenting complaint in the community. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two patients (mean age 81 ± 8 years; 62 male) were included. Seventy-three (60%) were categorised into the typical group and 49 (40%) into the atypical group. In the atypical group, common presenting complaints were fall in 18 (36%), reduced mobility or generalised weakness in 18 (36%) and delirium in 11 (22%). Further assessment by paramedics and on admission found 32 (65%) to have typical features of COVID-19, fever being the most common, and 22 (44%) were hypoxic. This subset had worse outcomes than those in the typical group with a mortality rate of 50% versus 38%, respectively, although this was not statistically significant (P = 0.27). No significant difference in mortality or length of hospital stay between the groups was demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Older patients with atypical presentation of COVID-19 in the community are equally susceptible to poor outcomes. Early detection may improve outcomes and limit community transmission.

Comprehensive protocols and algorithms have been implemented globally to maximize available bed space, conserve personal protective equipment, and to minimize exposure. This has resulted in a sharp decline in elective spinal surgery and placed an undue burden on the spinal industry. As the landscape of elective surgery changes, this paper looks to analyze the effects the COVID-19 pandemic has and will have on spinal instrumentation companies, surgeons, and the spinal industry. Changes in government policies, patient care, financial markets, and distribution have all presented an unprecedented strain on spinal instrumentation companies.

Dental plaque has the potential to be colonized by respiratory pathogens and this, together with microaspiration of oral bacteria, can lead to pneumonia particularly in the elderly and critically ill. The provision of adequate oral care is therefore essential for the maintenance of good oral health and the prevention of respiratory complications. MAIN BODY: Numerous oral care practices are utilised for intubated patients, with a clear lack of consensus on the best approach for oral care. This narrative review aims to explore the oral-lung connection and discuss in detail current oral care practices to identify shortcomings and offer suggestions for future research. The importance of adequate oral care has been recognised in guideline interventions for the prevention of pneumonia, but practices differ and controversy exists particularly regarding the use of chlorhexidine. The oral health assessment is also an important but often overlooked element of oral care that needs to be considered. Oral care plans should ideally be implemented on the basis of an individual oral health assessment. An oral health assessment prior to provision of oral care should identify patient needs and facilitate targeted oral care interventions. CONCLUSION: Oral health is an important consideration in the management of the critically ill. Studies have suggested benefit in the reduction of respiratory complication such as Ventilator Associated Pneumonia associated with effective oral health care practices. However, at present there is no consensus as to the best way of providing optimal oral health care in the critically ill. Further research is needed to standardise oral health assessment and care practices to enable development of evidenced based personalised oral care for the critically ill.","Winning, Lewis; Lundy, Fionnuala T.; Blackwood, Bronagh; McAuley, Daniel F.; El Karim, Ikhlas",Crit Care,205,18

Patients were immunized with two doses of vaccine and immunogenicity assessed after each dose using the above tests. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were assessed in a subset using flow‐cytometry. A total of 127 patients were enrolled of which 110 provided serum at all time points. A positive anti‐RBD antibody was seen in 5.0% after one dose and 34.5% after two doses. Neutralizing antibody was present in 26.9%. Of note, 28.5% of patients with anti‐RBD did not have neutralizing antibody. T cell responses in a sub‐cohort of 48 patients showed a positive CD4+ T cell response in 47.9%. Of note, in this sub‐cohort, 46.2% of patients with a negative anti‐RBD, still had a positive CD4+ T cell response. The vaccine was safe and well‐tolerated. In summary, immunogenicity of mRNA‐1273 COVID‐19 vaccine was modest, but a subset of patients still develop neutralizing antibody and CD4+T‐ cell responses.

To study the binding mechanism, the absorption, fluorescence, melting temperature and viscosity measurement were carried out. The experimental results indicated that the planar of flavonoids intercalated to the DNA helix. When bound to DNA, flavonoids showed hyperchromic and blue shift in the absorption spectra and fluorescence quenching (>50%) in the fluorescence spectra. Furthermore, the intercalative binding was consistent with the red shift in the position of λ(max) in the fluorescence spectra. It was also found that ionic strength had little or no effect on the binding of flavonoids and DNA. Stern–Volmer plots at 25 and 37 °C showed that the quenching of fluorescence by flavonoids was a combined quenching process. The binding site number n, apparent binding constant K(A) at 25 and 37 °C, and the corresponding thermodynamic parameters ΔG, ΔH, ΔS at 25 °C were obtained. The interaction of flavonoid–metal complexes with DNA was also studied by spectral methods, and the results suggested that the complexes intercalated into DNA.","Sun, Yantao; Bi, Shuyun; Song, Daqian; Qiao, Chunyu; Mu, Dan; Zhang, Hanqi",Sens Actuators B Chem,205,3

METHODS: This prospective study was conducted among adults with ESKD treated with in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) in the United States. Exposure was ascribed on the basis of the presence or absence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, and separately, a history of documented COVID-19 before study entry. Outcomes were assessed after an infection-free period, and were any SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., detected by protocolized PCR tests or during routine clinical surveillance), and clinically manifest COVID-19 (consisting of only the latter). RESULTS: Of 2337 consented participants who met study inclusion criteria, 9.5% were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive at baseline; 3.6% had a history of COVID-19. Over 6679 patient-months of follow-up, 263 participants had evidence of any SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 141 who had clinically manifest COVID-19. Presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (versus its absence) at baseline was associated with lower risk of any SARS-CoV-2 infection (incidence rate ratio, 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.95) and clinically manifest COVID-19 0.21 (95% confidence interval, 0.07 to 0.67). CONCLUSION: Among patients with ESKD, naturally acquired anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity is associated with a 45% lower risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a 79% lower risk of clinically manifest COVID-19. Because natural immunity is incomplete, patients with ESKD should be prioritized for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, independent of their COVID-19 disease history.","Cohen, Dena E; Sibbel, Scott; Marlowe, Gilbert; Bludorn, Kelsey; Miller, Dawn; Kelley, Tara; Connaire, Jeffrey; Young, Amy; Tentori, Francesca; Brunelli, Steven M",J Am Soc Nephrol,205,20

We studied the profile of antibody and cellular immunity in children aged 3-11 years in comparison with adults. Antibody profiles in children were strong with high titres against spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in children strongly boosted antibody responses against seasonal beta-coronaviruses, partly through cross-recognition of the S2 domain, indicating a broad humoral response that was not seen in adults. T cell responses against spike were also >2-fold higher in children compared to adults and displayed a strong Th1 cytokine profile. SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive cellular responses were present in more than half the seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses or sensitization against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, all children retained high antibody titres and cellular responses for more than 6 months after infection whilst relative antibody waning was seen in adults. Children thus distinctly generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection with focussed specificity against spike protein. These observations demonstrate several novel features of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in children and may provide insights into relative clinical protection in this group. Such information on the profile of natural infection will help to guide the introduction of vaccination regimens into the paediatric population.","Dowell, A. C.; Butler, M.

METHODS: Cats ranged from 3.4–73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. RESULTS: Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2–5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3–84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GS-441524 was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for FIP. The optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks.","Pedersen, Niels C; Perron, Michel; Bannasch, Michael; Montgomery, Elizabeth; Murakami, Eisuke; Liepnieks, Molly; Liu, Hongwei",J Feline Med Surg,205,20

The objectives were achieved through tracking of SARS-CoV-2 genetic loadings i.e. ORF1ab, N and S protein genes on 8th and 27th May 2020 along the wastewater treatment plant (106 million liters per day) equipped with UASB system in Ahmedabad, India. PEG method performed better in removing materials inhibiting RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 gene detection from the samples, as evident from constant and lower CT values of control (MS2). Using the PEG method, we found a reduction >1.3 log10 in SARS-CoV-2 RNA abundance during UASB treatment, and the RNA was not detected at all in the final effluent. The study implies that i) conventional wastewater treatment systems is effective in SARS-CoV-2 RNA removal, and ii) UASB system significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 genetic loadings. Finally, PEG method is recommended for better sensitivity and inhibition removal during SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in wastewater.","Kumar, Manish; Kuroda, Keisuke; Patel, Arbind Kumar; Patel, Nidhi; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Joshi, Madhvi; Joshi, Chaitanya G.",Sci Total Environ,205,6

With increasing rates of mortality caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, urban vertical cemeteries are experiencing interments at an unprecedented rate. Corpses interred in the 3rd to 5th layer of vertical urban cemeteries have the potential to contaminate large adjacent regions. The general objective of this manuscript is to analyze the reflectance of altimetry, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) in the urban cemeteries and neighbouring areas of the City of Passo Fundo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. It is assumed that the population residing in the vicinity of these cemeteries may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 contamination through the displacement of microparticles carried by the wind as a corpse is placed in the burial niche or during the first several days of subsequent fluid and gas release through the process of decomposition. The reflectance analyses were performed utilizing Landsat 8 satellite images applied to altimetry, NDVI and LST, for hypothetical examination of possible displacement, transport and subsequent deposition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The results showed that two cemeteries within the city, cemeteries A and B could potentially transport SARS-CoV-2 of nanometric structure to neighboring residential areas through wind action. These two cemeteries are located at high relative altitudes in more densely populated regions of the city. The NDVI, which has been shown to control the proliferation of contaminants, proved to be insufficient in these areas, contributing to high LST values. Based on the results of this study, the formation and implementation of public policies that monitor urban cemeteries is suggested in areas that utilize vertical urban cemeteries in order to reduce the further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Carollo Toscan, Paloma; Neckel, Alcindo; Stolfo Maculan, Laércio; Korcelski, Cleiton; Oliveira, Marcos L.S.; Thaines Bodah, Eliane; William Bodah, Brian; Aniceto Kujawa, Henrique; Celso Gonçalves, Affonso",Geoscience Frontiers,205,5

METHODS: This scoping review searched federal and P/T websites on daily COVID-19 pandemic preparedness strategies between 30 January and 30 April 2020. The PROGRESS-Plus equity-lens framework was used to define priority populations. All definitions, policies and guidelines of PH strategies implemented by the federal and P/T governments to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were included. PH measures were classified using a modified Public Health Agency of Canada Framework for Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. RESULTS: A total of 722 COVID-19 PH measures were issued during the study period. Of these, home quarantine (voluntary) (n=13.0%; 94/722) and retail/commerce restrictions (10.9%; n=79/722) were the most common measures introduced. Many of the PH orders, including physical distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures or retail/commerce restrictions began to be introduced after 11 March 2020. Lifting of some of the PH orders in phases to reopen the economy began in April 2020 (6.5%; n=47/722). The majority (68%, n=491/722) of COVID-19 PH announcements were deemed mandatory, while 32% (n=231/722) were recommendations. Several PH measures (28.0%, n=202/722) targeted a variety of groups at risk of socially produced health inequalities, such as age, religion, occupation and migration status. CONCLUSIONS: Most PH measures centred on limiting contact between people who were not from the same household. PH measures were evolutionary in nature, reflecting new evidence that emerged throughout the pandemic. Although ~30% of all implemented COVID-19 PH measures were tailored towards priority groups, there were still unintended consequences on these populations.","Polisena, Julie; Ospina, Maria; Sanni, Omolara; Matenchuk, Brittany; Livergant, Rachel; Amjad, Sana; Zoric, Igor; Haddad, Nisrine; Morrison, Andra; Wilson, Kumanan; Bogoch, Isaac; Welch, Vivian A",BMJ Open,205,19

STUDY DESIGN: The present descriptive, prospective study was done on 1030 patients and information about presenting symptoms, demographics (age, sex, nationality, residence), contact and travel history, comorbidities etc., were recorded. On the basis of criteria given by Indian Council of Medical Research, patients were divided into suspected (SARS-CoV-2) and non-suspected group. Of the suspected patients, with RT-PCR test positive were classified as confirmed COVID-19 case and negative RT-PCR symptomatic individual were defined as negative COVID-19 case. RESULTS: Out of the total patients, 65.6% were male and 34.4% were females. The mean age was 37.04 years. Fever 49.3%, cough 57.1% and sore throat 43.5% were the main symptoms. Comorbidities were seen in 8.5% patients with hypertension (3.5%) and diabetes mellitus (3.4%). Forty patients were positive. Highly significant correlation (P < 0.01) was found between COVID-19 positive status and in patients without any symptoms, between COVID-19 and cough and sore throat, between COVID-19 and comorbidity (diabetes mellitus), between COVID-19 and high-risk exposures (resident of hot spot and history of contact with confirmed case).

Within a shorter period of time, an unprecedented outbreak of this strain was witnessed over the entire Wuhan city. This novel coronavirus strain was later officially renamed as COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) by the World Health Organization. The mode of transmission was human-to-human contact and hence resulted in a rapid surge across the globe where more than 24 million people have been infected with COVID-19. In the current scenario, finding potent drug candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 has emerged as the most challenging task for clinicians and researchers worldwide. Identification of new drugs and vaccine development may take from a few months to years based on the clinical trial processes. To overcome the several limitations involved in identifying and bringing out potent drug candidates for treating COVID-19, in the present study attempts were made to screen the FDA approved drugs using High Throughput Virtual Screening (HTVS). The COVID-19 main protease (COVID-19 Mpro) was chosen as the drug target for which the FDA approved drugs were initially screened with HTVS. The drug candidates that exhibited favorable docking score, energy, and emodel calculations were further taken for performing Induced Fit Docking (IFD) using Schrodinger’s GLIDE. From the flexible docking results, the following four FDA approved drugs Sincalide, Pentagastrin, Ritonavir, and Phytonadione were identified.

One of the key components of an ICU is the continuous monitoring of patients' vital parameters. However, existing advances in informatics, signal processing, or engineering that could alleviate the burden on ICUs have not yet been applied. This could be due to the lack of user involvement in research and development. OBJECTIVE: This study focused on the satisfaction of ICU staff with current patient monitoring and their suggestions for future improvements. We aimed to identify aspects of monitoring that interrupt patient care, display devices for remote monitoring, use cases for artificial intelligence (AI), and whether ICU staff members are willing to improve their digital literacy or contribute to the improvement of patient monitoring. We further aimed to identify differences in the responses of different professional groups. METHODS: This survey study was performed with ICU staff from 4 ICUs of a German university hospital between November 2019 and January 2020. We developed a web-based 36-item survey questionnaire, by analyzing a preceding qualitative interview study with ICU staff, about the clinical requirements of future patient monitoring. Statistical analyses of questionnaire results included median values with their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals, and chi-square tests to compare the distributions of item responses of the professional groups. RESULTS: In total, 86 of the 270 ICU physicians and nurses completed the survey questionnaire. The majority stated they felt confident using the patient monitoring equipment, but that high rates of false-positive alarms and the many sensor cables interrupted patient care. Regarding future improvements, respondents asked for wireless sensors, a reduction in the number of false-positive alarms, and hospital standard operating procedures for alarm management. Responses to the display devices proposed for remote patient monitoring were divided. Most respondents indicated it would be useful for earlier alerting or when they were responsible for multiple wards. AI for ICUs would be useful for early detection of complications and an increased risk of mortality; in addition, the AI could propose guidelines for therapy and diagnostics. Transparency, interoperability, usability, and staff training were essential to promote the use of AI. The majority wanted to learn more about new technologies for the ICU and required more time for learning. Physicians had fewer reservations than nurses about AI-based intelligent alarm management and using mobile phones for remote monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study of ICU staff revealed key improvements for patient monitoring in intensive care medicine. Hospital providers and medical device manufacturers should focus on reducing false alarms, implementing hospital alarm standard operating procedures, introducing wireless sensors, preparing for the use of AI, and enhancing the digital literacy of ICU staff. Our results may contribute to the user-centered transfer of digital technologies into practice to alleviate challenges in intensive care medicine.

In this study, the toxicity of 17 DBPs typically present in wastewater effluents on three representative microalgae, including Scenedesmus sp. (Chlorophyta), Microcystis aeruginosa (Cyanophyta), and Cyclotella sp. (Bacillariophyta) was investigated. The sensitivities of the three microalgae to DBPs varied greatly from species to species, indicating that DBPs may change the structure of phytoplankton communities. Later, co-cultures of these phytoplankton groups as a proxy of ecological freshwater scenario were conducted to explore the impacts of DBPs on phytoplankton community succession. M. aeruginosa became surprisingly dominant in co-cultures, representing over 50% after dosing with monochloroacetic acid (MCAA, 0.1-10 mg/L). The highest proportion of M. aeruginosa was 70.3% when exposed to 2 mg/L MCAA. Although Scenedesmus sp. dominated in monochloroacetonitrile (MCAN) exposure, M. aeruginosa accounted for no less than 30% even at 40 mg/L MCAN. In this study, DBPs disrupted the original inter-algal relationship in favor of M. aeruginosa, suggesting that DBPs may contribute to the outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms in aquatic ecosystems.","Cui, Huijun; Zhu, Xiaoshan; Zhu, Yanjie; Huang, Yuxiong; Chen, Baiyang",Journal of hazardous materials,205,1

Children infected at baseline were seropositive to 23/24 peptides. No significant association was observed between antibody titers and age or molecular force of infection, suggesting that antibody levels had already reached an equilibrium. There was a strong association between antibody levels to all peptides and protection against P. vivax clinical episodes during the 16 months follow-up.

RW and RPA level of participants and perceived scores of built environments were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of built environment with older people’s RW and RPA. The results showed that two main factors affecting older people’s RW and RPA were residential density and aesthetics. Additionally, access to services was related to RW, and street connectivity was correlated with RPA. The associations of RW with built environment varied slightly with demographic variables included in the regression model. All the results suggested that lower residential density, better aesthetics environment, and higher street connectivity would motivate older people to engage more in RW and RPA. The better access to services encourages only RW, not RPA, in older people. These findings would be helpful for policy decision makers in the urban construction process in Yiwu.

Statistical analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily local COVID-19 confirmed positive cases (LCPC) and both climate characteristics and the daily weather reported by the regional meteorological stations. In this work, the local transmission ratio (LTR) was calculated with the regional LCPC divided by the number of the effective contagion days since regional onset in each state. The results showed a negative association between temperature (mean, max and min) and climate classification with both LCPC and LTR variables. The precipitation associated positively with LCPC and LTR. The associations between the climate classification with LCPC and LTR are statistically significant. The tropical climate (mean temperature around 25.95 °C and mean precipitation around 8.74 mm) delayed the regional onset. However, the regional onset in dry climates emerged earlier as consequence of the lower temperatures and higher precipitations (20.57 °C and 20.87 mm respectively) than the observed in the tropical climate. The fastest regional onsets were observed in tempered climates in states where the lowest temperatures and lowest precipitations were registered (19.65 °C and 8.48 mm respectively). Meteorological factors influenced the trend on the regional outbreaks in Mexican's states likely by the host predisposition and susceptibility during the cold winter season. In Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, etc.) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas, etc.) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos etc.).","Méndez-Arriaga, Fabiola",Sci Total Environ,205,3

This reflects, in part, the frailty and vulnerability of older people living in care homes but has also, in part, been a consequence of the failure to include care homes in the systematic planning of a response to COVID, as well as a measure of neglect of standards and quality improvement in the sector. In response, the EUGMS published a set of medical standards of care developed in consultation with experts across its member national societies in 2015. The standards consisted of seven core principles of medical care for physicians working in nursing homes as a first step in developing a programme of clinical, academic and policy engagement in improving medical care for older people who are living and frequently also dying as residents in nursing homes. The gravity of the concerns arising for nursing home care from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as emerging insights on care improvement in nursing homes indicate that an update of these medical standards is timely. This was performed by the writing group from the original 2015 guidelines and is intended as an interim measure pending a more formal review incorporating a systematic review of emerging literature and a Delphi process.","O’Neill, Desmond; Briggs, Robert; Holmerová, Iva; Samuelsson, Olafur; Gordon, Adam L.; Martin, Finbarr C.",Eur Geriatr Med,205,30

This has been followed by extending Blockchain to span several other industries and applications for its capabilities in verification. With the current trend of pursuing the decentralized Internet, many methods have been proposed to achieve decentralization considering different aspects of the current Internet model ranging from infrastructure and protocols to services and applications. This paper investigates Blockchain’s capacities to provide a robust and secure decentralized model for Internet. The paper conducts a critical review on recent Blockchain-based methods capable for the decentralization of the future Internet. We identify and investigate two research aspects of Blockchain that provides high impact in realizing the decentralized Internet with respect to current Internet and Blockchain challenges while keeping various design in considerations. The first aspect is the consensus algorithms that are vital components for decentralization of the Blockchain. We identify three key consensus algorithms including PoP, Paxos, and PoAH that are more adequate for reaching consensus for such tremendous scale Blockchain-enabled architecture for Internet. The second aspect that we investigated is the compliance of Blockchain with various emerging Internet technologies and the impact of Blockchain on those technologies. Such emerging Internet technologies in combinations with Blockchain would help to overcome Blockchain’s established flaws in a way to be more optimized, efficient and applicable for Internet decentralization.","Zarrin, Javad; Wen Phang, Hao; Babu Saheer, Lakshmi; Zarrin, Bahram",Cluster Comput,205,28

Knowledge on the types and frequency of respiratory viruses affecting school-children is important in determining the role of schools in transmission in the community and identifying targets for interventions. Methods: We conducted a one-year (term-time) surveillance of respiratory viruses in a rural primary school in Kilifi County, coastal Kenya between May 2017 and April 2018. A sample of 60 students with symptoms of ARI were targeted for nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) collection weekly. Swabs were screened for 15 respiratory virus targets using real time PCR diagnostics. Data from respiratory virus surveillance at the local primary healthcare facility was used for comparison. Results: Overall, 469 students aged 2-19 years were followed up for 220 days. A total of 1726 samples were collected from 325 symptomatic students; median age of 7 years (IQR 5-11). At least one virus target was detected in 384 (22%) of the samples with a frequency of 288 (16.7%) for rhinovirus, 47 (2.7%) parainfluenza virus, 35 (2.0%) coronavirus, 15 (0.9%) adenovirus, 11 (0.6%) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 5 (0.3%) influenza virus. The proportion of virus positive samples was higher among lower grades compared to upper grades (25.9% vs 17.5% respectively; χ (2) = 17.2, P -value <0.001). Individual virus target frequencies did not differ by age, sex, grade, school term or class size. Rhinovirus was predominant in both the school and outpatient setting. Conclusion: Multiple respiratory viruses circulated in this rural school population. Rhinovirus was dominant in both the school and outpatient setting and RSV was of notably low frequency in the school. The role of school children in transmitting viruses to the household setting is still unclear and further studies linking molecular data to contact patterns between the school children and their households are required.","Adema, Irene Wangwa; Kamau, Everlyn; Uchi Nyiro, Joyce; Otieno, Grieven P.; Lewa, Clement; Munywoki, Patrick K.; Nokes, D.

There have been more than two million deaths recorded worldwide, with no end in sight until a vaccine is developed. Current research has centred on different aspects of the virus interaction with cell surface receptors, but more needs to be done to further understand its mechanism of action in order to develop a targeted therapy and a method to control the spread of the virus. Lipids play a crucial role throughout the viral life cycle, and viruses are known to exploit lipid signalling and synthesis to affect host cell lipidome. Emerging studies using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches are providing new insight into the host response to COVID-19 infection. Indeed, metabolomic and lipidomic approaches have identified numerous circulating lipids that directly correlate to the severity of the disease, making lipid metabolism a potential therapeutic target. Circulating lipids play a key function in the pathogenesis of the virus and exert an inflammatory response. A better knowledge of lipid metabolism in the host-pathogen interaction will provide valuable insights into viral pathogenesis and to develop novel therapeutic targets.","Casari, Ilaria; Manfredi, Marcello; Metharom, Pat; Falasca, Marco",Prog Lipid Res,205,1

However, systematic investigation of their signatures and applications with alternative biomaterials in osteoarthritis (OA) remains indistinct. METHODS: Herein, we initially took advantage of a small molecule library-mediated programming strategy for hPSC-MSC induction. Then, with the aid of multifaceted analyses such as flow cytometry (FCM), chromosome karyocyte and cell vitality, wound healing and microtubule formation assay and coculturing with T lymphocytes, we systematically evaluated the characterizations of signatures in vitro and the in vivo efficacy of hPSC-MSCs and HA hydrogel composite on rabbit osteoarthritis model. RESULTS: We found the combination of LLY-507 and AZD5153 was sufficient for high-efficiency CD73(+)CD90(+)CD105(+)CD31(−)CD34(−)CD45(−)HLA-DR(−) MSC induction from both hESCs and hiPSCs with stemness (POU5F1/SOX2/NANOG). The programmed hPSC-MSCs revealed conservative transcriptome variations and went through a heterogeneous intermediate-stage with mesenchymal-associated gene expression (NT5E, ENG, VIM and FN1) as well as displayed typical cytomorphology, immunophenotypes and normal karyotyping, multilineage differentiation potential, favorable cell vitality, proangiogenic and immunoregulatory properties in vitro. Meanwhile, the cell population exhibited preferable restorative and ameliorative function on OA rabbits with HA hydrogel in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we established a rapid and convenient procedure for hPSC-MSC generation without redundant manipulations. The fundamental and clinical studies upon osteoarthritis (OA) treatment would benefit tremendously from the combination of the inexhaustible hPSC-MSCs and advantageous biomaterials.","Zhang, Leisheng; Wei, Yimeng; Chi, Ying; Liu, Dengke; Yang, Sijun; Han, Zhongchao; Li, Zongjin",Cell Biosci,205,8

As such, healthcare systems are increasingly focussing on therapeutic approaches to address these challenges. Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) evaluating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues have previously observed significant improvements in major adverse cardiac events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their impact in obese people without T2D is unknown. The SELECT study is the first pharmacotherapy study in obesity powered for cardiovascular superiority and investigates the impact of semaglutide on cardiovascular disease outcomes in overweight and obese people without T2D. The results of this study will potentially redefine obesity management, especially as secondary outcomes of the study will include evaluation of health-related quality of life and incident diabetes rates. In another potentially evolutionary therapeutic step for the incretin class of therapeutic agents, the FLOW study is the first dedicated study to investigate the effects of GLP-1 receptor analogues on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in people with renal impairment and T2D. Post-hoc analyses of GLP-1 analogue CVOTs have demonstrated reduced adverse renal outcomes associated with their use. In this review we discuss the known impact of GLP-1 analogues on cardiovascular, weight and renal outcomes in previous CVOTs. We further discuss the importance of the ongoing SELECT and FLOW studies on shifting the paradigm of obesity pharmacotherapy and in adding to our understanding of renal disease management in people with T2D.","Williams, David M.; Evans, Marc",Diabetes Ther,205,2

We have provided evidence that small extracellular vesicles released by PrCa cells and containing the αVβ3 integrin promote neuroendocrine differentiation of PrCa in vivo and in vitro. Here, we examined αVβ3 integrin expression in three murine models carrying a deletion of PTEN (SKO), PTEN and RB1 (DKO), or PTEN, RB1 and TRP53 (TKO) genes in the prostatic epithelium; of these three models, the DKO and TKO tumors develop NEPrCa with a gene signature comparable to those of human NEPrCa. Immunostaining analysis of SKO, DKO and TKO tumors shows that αVβ3 integrin expression is increased in DKO and TKO primary tumors and metastatic lesions, but absent in SKO primary tumors. On the other hand, SKO tumors show higher levels of a different αV integrin, αVβ6, as compared to DKO and TKO tumors. These results are confirmed by RNA-sequencing analysis. Moreover, TRAMP mice, which carry NEPrCa and adenocarcinoma of the prostate, also have increased levels of αVβ3 in their NEPrCa primary tumors. In contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is only detectable in the adenocarcinoma areas. Finally, analysis of 42 LuCaP patient-derived xenografts and primary adenocarcinoma samples shows a positive correlation between αVβ3, but not αVβ6, and the neuronal marker synaptophysin; it also demonstrates that αVβ3 is absent in prostatic adenocarcinomas. In summary, we demonstrate that αVβ3 integrin is upregulated in NEPrCa primary and metastatic lesions; in contrast, the αVβ6 integrin is confined to adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Our findings suggest that the αVβ3 integrin, but not αVβ6, may promote a shift in lineage plasticity towards a NE phenotype and might serve as an informative biomarker for the early detection of NE differentiation in prostate cancer.","Quaglia, Fabio; Krishn, Shiv Ram; Wang, Yanqing; Goodrich, David W.; McCue, Peter; Kossenkov, Andrew V.; Mandigo, Amy C.; Knudsen, Karen E.; Weinreb, Paul H.; Corey, Eva; Kelly, William K.; Languino, Lucia R.",PLoS One,205,5

Therefore, this study aims to examine the longitudinal associations between meaning in life and psychosocial adjustment to the COVID‐19 outbreak among Chinese people. METHODS: A prospective design was adopted. 154 Chinese college students (Mean age = 20.41 ± 1.45 years) completed two waves of the assessment. Participants reported their meaning in life before the outbreak (Time 1) and their psychosocial adjustment 7 weeks later after the outbreak had occurred (Time 2). RESULTS: Participants’ meaning in life at Time 1 was positively related to life satisfaction and negatively related to depression, anxiety, stress, and negative emotions at Time 2. Additionally, levels of meaning in life at Time 1 were positively associated to COVID‐19‐related behavioural engagement – prosocial behaviour and information addiction at Time 2. Individuals’ perceptions of the outbreak and status of self‐quarantine did not moderate these relationships. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that individuals’ prior level of meaning in life may help them maintain a healthy psychosocial adjustment during disease outbreak, though cautions regarding the possibility to render an addiction to information about the outbreak are warranted.","Lin, Li",Br J Health Psychol,205,1

We aimed to characterise viral load dynamics, duration of viral RNA shedding, and viable virus shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in various body fluids, and to compare SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) viral dynamics. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Europe PubMed Central, medRxiv, and bioRxiv, and the grey literature, for research articles published between Jan 1, 2003, and June 6, 2020. We included case series (with five or more participants), cohort studies, and randomised controlled trials that reported SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, or MERS-CoV infection, and reported viral load kinetics, duration of viral shedding, or viable virus. Two authors independently extracted data from published studies, or contacted authors to request data, and assessed study quality and risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist tools. We calculated the mean duration of viral shedding and 95% CIs for every study included and applied the random-effects model to estimate a pooled effect size. We used a weighted meta-regression with an unrestricted maximum likelihood model to assess the effect of potential moderators on the pooled effect size. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020181914. FINDINGS: 79 studies (5340 individuals) on SARS-CoV-2, eight studies (1858 individuals) on SARS-CoV, and 11 studies (799 individuals) on MERS-CoV were included. Mean duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding was 17·0 days (95% CI 15·5–18·6; 43 studies, 3229 individuals) in upper respiratory tract, 14·6 days (9·3–20·0; seven studies, 260 individuals) in lower respiratory tract, 17·2 days (14·4–20·1; 13 studies, 586 individuals) in stool, and 16·6 days (3·6–29·7; two studies, 108 individuals) in serum samples. Maximum shedding duration was 83 days in the upper respiratory tract, 59 days in the lower respiratory tract, 126 days in stools, and 60 days in serum. Pooled mean SARS-CoV-2 shedding duration was positively associated with age (slope 0·304 [95% CI 0·115–0·493]; p=0·0016). No study detected live virus beyond day 9 of illness, despite persistently high viral loads, which were inferred from cycle threshold values. SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract appeared to peak in the first week of illness, whereas that of SARS-CoV peaked at days 10–14 and that of MERS-CoV peaked at days 7–10. INTERPRETATION: Although SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples can be prolonged, duration of viable virus is relatively short-lived. SARS-CoV-2 titres in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of illness. Early case finding and isolation, and public education on the spectrum of illness and period of infectiousness are key to the effective containment of SARS-CoV-2.

For foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) research, in particular, computational methods for antigen–antibody (Ag–Ab) interaction, and cross-antigenicity characterization and prediction are critical to design engineered vaccines with robust, long-lasting, and wider response against different strains. We integrated existing structural modeling and prediction algorithms to study the surface properties of FMDV Ags and Abs and their interaction. First, we explored four modeling and two Ag–Ab docking methods and implemented a computational pipeline based on a reference Ag–Ab structure for FMDV of serotype C, to be used as a source protocol for the study of unknown interaction pairs of Ag–Ab. Next, we obtained the variable region sequence of two monoclonal IgM and IgG antibodies that recognize and neutralize antigenic site A (AgSA) epitopes from South America serotype A FMDV and developed two peptide ELISAs for their fine epitope mapping. Then, we applied the previous Ag–Ab molecular structure modeling and docking protocol further scored by functional peptide ELISA data. This work highlights a possible different behavior in the immune response of IgG and IgM Ab isotypes. The present method yielded reliable Ab models with differential paratopes and Ag interaction topologies in concordance with their isotype classes. Moreover, it demonstrates the applicability of computational prediction techniques to the interaction phenomena between the FMDV immunodominant AgSA and Abs, and points out their potential utility as a metric for virus-related, massive Ab repertoire analysis or as a starting point for recombinant vaccine design.","Marrero Diaz de Villegas, Ruben; Seki, Cristina; Mattion, Nora M.; König, Guido A.",Front Vet Sci,205,20

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors(1–9), but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID ‘events’ (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease ‘hotspots’). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.","Jones, Kate E.; Patel, Nikkita G.; Levy, Marc A.; Storeygard, Adam; Balk, Deborah; Gittleman, John L.; Daszak, Peter",Nature,205,3

However, whereas developed countries have a high EHR penetration rate, adoption of EHRs in developing countries is lagging behind. Recently, the Korean and Russian governments have been pursuing economic cooperation in the Russian Far East. Thus, since 2009, Russia’s EHR market and healthcare system have been maturing in tandem. OBJECTIVE: To qualitatively investigate and analyze the current status of EHRs in the Russian Far East and derive implementation plans for nationwide EHRs. METHODS: A qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and administrative officers in the Russian Far East was conducted to illuminate the current status of EHRs and to collect various perspectives on barriers and facilitators to implementation. RESULTS: The analysis revealed six major barriers and five major facilitators for implementation of nationwide EHRs in the Russian Far East. The barriers include lack of communications, an insufficient system development environment, poor adoption of standard terminology, poor infrastructure, resistance to a new system, and poor functionality. Facilitators include strategic government planning, centrally managed systems, health information exchange, willingness to use new functions, and well-established work processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study’s results, along with the experiences of developed countries that have already successfully introduced EHRs, will help support successful introduction of EHRs in the Russian Far East.","Jung, Se Young; Lee, Keehyuck; Lee, Ho-Young; Hwang, Hee",Int J Med Inform,205,1

In response to viral infections, host innate responses provide the first line of defense against viruses, which often act even before the establishment of the infection. Host cells sense the presence of viral components through germinal encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The engagement of PRRs with pathogen-associated molecular patterns leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory and interferon productions. Induced antiviral responses play a critical role in the outcome of the infections. In order to improve current strategies for control of viral infections or to advance new strategies aimed against viral infections, a deep understanding of host-virus interaction and induction of antiviral responses is required. In this review, we summarized recent progress in understanding innate antiviral responses in chickens with a focus on the avian influenza virus and infectious bronchitis virus.","Barjesteh, Neda; O'Dowd, Kelsey; Vahedi, Seyed Milad",Cytokine,205,16

MERS-CoV poses a significant risk to public health security because of an absence of currently available effective countermeasures. We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the candidate simian adenovirus-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length spike surface glycoprotein, ChAdOx1 MERS, in humans. METHODS: This dose-escalation, open-label, non-randomised, uncontrolled, phase 1 trial was done at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine (Oxford, UK) and included healthy people aged 18–50 years with negative pre-vaccination tests for HIV antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibodies (and a negative urinary pregnancy test for women). Participants received a single intramuscular injection of ChAdOx1 MERS at three different doses: the low-dose group received 5 × 10(9) viral particles, the intermediate-dose group received 2·5 × 10(10) viral particles, and the high-dose group received 5 × 10(10) viral particles. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by the occurrence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious adverse events after vaccination. The secondary objective was to assess the cellular and humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 MERS, measured by interferon-γ-linked enzyme-linked immunospot, ELISA, and virus neutralising assays after vaccination. Participants were followed up for up to 12 months. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03399578. FINDINGS: Between March 14 and Aug 15, 2018, 24 participants were enrolled: six were assigned to the low-dose group, nine to the intermediate-dose group, and nine to the high-dose group. All participants were available for follow-up at 6 months, but five (one in the low-dose group, one in the intermediate-dose group, and three in the high-dose group) were lost to follow-up at 12 months. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS was safe at doses up to 5 × 10(10) viral particles with no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported by 12 months. One serious adverse event reported was deemed to be not related to ChAdOx1 MERS. 92 (74% [95% CI 66–81]) of 124 solicited adverse events were mild, 31 (25% [18–33]) were moderate, and all were self-limiting. Unsolicited adverse events in the 28 days following vaccination considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to ChAdOx1 MERS were predominantly mild in nature and resolved within the follow-up period of 12 months. The proportion of moderate and severe adverse events was significantly higher in the high-dose group than in the intermediate-dose group (relative risk 5·83 [95% CI 2·11–17·42], p<0·0001) Laboratory adverse events considered to be at least possibly related to the study intervention were self-limiting and predominantly mild in severity. A significant increase from baseline in T-cell (p<0·003) and IgG (p<0·0001) responses to the MERS-CoV spike antigen was observed at all doses. Neutralising antibodies against live MERS-CoV were observed in four (44% [95% CI 19–73]) of nine participants in the high-dose group 28 days after vaccination, and 19 (79% [58–93]) of 24 participants had antibodies capable of neutralisation in a pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 MERS was safe and well tolerated at all tested doses. A single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS-CoV. The results of this first-in-human clinical trial support clinical development progression into field phase 1b and 2 trials.

Analyzing scientific outputs in this topic can represent an overview of publications. For this purpose, this study was conducted to determine status of publishing research works related to COVID-19 and analyzing the all documents published and indexed in Web of Science database and illustrate the co-occurrence and co-authority of hot papers in this documents. METHODOLOGY: Our search strategy was based on using the related key terms including COVID-19, coronavirus, SARS2, etc., to find out all the published scientific works related to coronavirus disease indexed in web of science (WoS) in 2020. We then extracted the all hot papers and especially hot papers in endocrinology category and analyzed them. The data saved and imported in VOSviewer and ScientoPy programs for analysis and illustration of our data. We have shown our analysis in the tables, figures and maps. RESULTS: Totally, 56,402 records and 309 hot papers were retrieved. 3 of these hot papers were in endocrinology category. The most common type of publication was original papers followed by editorial papers in the second rank. The country with the most published documents was the USA followed by China. The journals of “British Medical Journal” and “Journal of Medical Virology” were ranked as the first and second sources, respectively. The “Harvard University” was the top organization with high proportion of scientific publications and “the Lancet” was the top-ranked journal that published highly-cited papers. CONCLUSION: The literature on COVID-19 is increasing with a high and fast growth. In this regard, there is a need to evaluate these publications once in a while and their results should be published to use this information for more effective management of future research works with emphasizes on the gaps of researches and more citable documents and allocation of budgets on more needed research and don’t carry out the duplicates research. This would be helpful for prevention, control, and treatment of COVID-19 that is now among the most common topics in the world.","Atlasi, Rasha; Noroozi Chakoli, Abdolreza; Ramezani, Aboozar; Tabatabaei-Malazy, Ozra; Larijani, Bagher",J Diabetes Metab Disord,205,4

Up to 17 December 2014, it has infected at least 938 people with a fatality rate of about 36% globally. This has resulted in an urgent need to identify antiviral drugs that are active against MERS-CoV. The papain-like protease (PL(pro)) of MERS-CoV represents an important antiviral target as it is not only essential for viral maturation, but also antagonizes interferon stimulation of the host via its deubiquitination activity. Here, we report the discovery that two SARS-CoV PL(pro) inhibitors, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG), as well as the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid, are able to inhibit MERS-CoV PL(pro). Their inhibition mechanisms and mutually binding synergistic effect were also investigated. Our results identify for the first time three inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV PL(pro) and these can now be used as lead compounds for further antiviral drug development.","Cheng, Kai-Wen; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Chen, Wei-Yi; Lin, Min-Han; Chuang, Shang-Ju; Cheng, I-Hsin; Sun, Chiao-Yin; Chou, Chi-Yuan",Antiviral Res,205,24

Hypermobility is associated with reduced physiological and psychological functioning and quality of life and is a known risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder. To date, no evidence-based, targeted treatment for anxiety in the context of hypermobility exists. The present intervention (ADAPT—Altering Dynamics of Autonomic Processing Therapy) is a novel therapy combining bio-behavioural training with cognitive approaches from clinical health psychology targeting the catastrophisation of internal sensations, with aim to improve autonomic trait prediction error. METHOD: Eighty individuals with diagnosed hypermobility will be recruited and the efficacy of ADAPT to treat anxiety will be compared to an Emotion-Focused Supportive Therapy (EFST) comparator therapy in a randomised controlled trial. The primary treatment target will be post therapy score on the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and secondary outcomes will also be considered in relation to interoception, depression, alexithymia, social and work adjustment, panic symptoms and dissociation. Due to COVID restrictions, the intervention will be moved to online delivery and qualitative assessment of treatment tolerance to online therapy will also be assessed. DISCUSSION: Online delivery of an intervention targeting anxiety would improve the quality of life for those experiencing anxiety disorder and help to reduce the £11.7 billion that anxiety disorders cost the UK economy annually.

Hundreds of viral species and subtypes have been associated with these conditions, with influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses being the most frequent and with the highest burden. When considering prevention or treatment of viral respiratory tract infections, potential targets include the causative pathogens themselves but also the immune response, disease transmission, or even just the symptoms. Strategies targeting all these aspects are developing concurrently, and several novel and promising approaches are emerging. In this perspective we overview the entire range of options and highlight some of the most promising approaches, including new antiviral agents, symptomatic or immunomodulatory drugs, the re-emergence of natural remedies, and vaccines and public health policies toward prevention. Wide-scale prevention through immunization appears to be within reach for respiratory syncytial virus and promising for influenza virus, whereas additional effort is needed in regard to rhinovirus, as well as other respiratory tract viruses.","Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Megremis, Spyridon; Kitsioulis, Nikolaos A.; Vangelatou, Olympia; West, Peter; Xepapadaki, Paraskevi",J Allergy Clin Immunol,205,2

Over 95% of deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is estimated that two-thirds of the congenital anomaly health burden could be averted through surgical intervention and that such interventions can be cost-effective. This systematic review aims to evaluate current evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery for congenital anomalies in LMICs. Methods and analysis: A systematic literature review will be conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scielo, Google Scholar, African Journals OnLine and Regional WHO's African Index Medicus databases for articles on the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery for congenital anomalies in LMICs. The following search strings will be used: (1) congenital anomalies; (2) LMICs; and (3) cost-effectiveness of surgical interventions. Articles will be uploaded to Covidence software, duplicates removed and the remaining articles screened by two independent reviewers. Cost information for interventions or procedures will be extracted by country and condition. Outcome measurements by reported unit and cost-effectiveness ratios will be extracted. Methodological quality of each article will be assessed using the Drummond checklist for economic evaluations. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Effective Health Care Program guidance will be followed to assess the grade of the studies. Ethics and dissemination: No ethical approval is required for conducting the systematic review. There will be no direct collection of data from individuals. The finalised article will be published in a scientific journal for dissemination. The protocol has been registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews).
