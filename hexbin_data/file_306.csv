1537,Validation of three geolocation strategies for health-facility attendees for research and public health surveillance in a rural setting in western Kenya,2014-05-01,"Understanding the spatial distribution of disease is critical for effective disease control. Where formal address networks do not exist, tracking spatial patterns of clinical disease is difficult. Geolocation strategies were tested at rural health facilities in western Kenya. Methods included geocoding residence by head of compound, participatory mapping and recording the self-reported nearest landmark. Geocoding was able to locate 72·9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67·7–77·6] of individuals to within 250 m of the true compound location. The participatory mapping exercise was able to correctly locate 82·0% of compounds (95% CI 78·9–84·8) to a 2 × 2·5 km area with a 500 m buffer. The self-reported nearest landmark was able to locate 78·1% (95% CI 73·8–82·1) of compounds to the correct catchment area. These strategies tested provide options for quickly obtaining spatial information on individuals presenting at health facilities.","STRESMAN, G. H.; STEVENSON, J.

2766,Establishing an ICD-10 code based SARI-surveillance in Germany – description of the system and first results from five recent influenza seasons,2017-06-30,"BACKGROUND: Syndromic surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) is important to assess seriousness of disease as recommended by WHO for influenza. In 2015 the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) started to collaborate with a private hospital network to develop a SARI surveillance system using case-based data on ICD-10 codes. This first-time description of the system shows its application to the analysis of five influenza seasons. METHODS: Since week 40/2015, weekly updated anonymized data on discharged patients overall and on patients with respiratory illness including ICD-10 codes of primary and secondary diagnoses are transferred from the network data center to RKI. Retrospective datasets were also provided. Our descriptive analysis is based on data of 47 sentinel hospitals collected between weeks 1/2012 to 20/2016. We applied three different SARI case definitions (CD) based on ICD-10 codes for discharge diagnoses of respiratory tract infections (J09 - J22): basic CD (BCD), using only primary diagnoses; sensitive CD (SCD), using primary and secondary diagnoses; timely CD (TCD), using only primary diagnoses of patients hospitalized up to one week. We compared the CD with regard to severity, age distribution and timeliness and with results from the national primary care sentinel system. RESULTS: The 47 sentinel hospitals covered 3.6% of patients discharged from all German hospitals in 2013. The SCD comprised 2.2 times patients as the BCD, and 3.6 times as many as the TCD. Time course of SARI cases corresponded well to results from primary care surveillance and influenza virus circulation. The patients fulfilling the TCD had been completely reported after 3 weeks, which was fastest among the CD. The proportion of SARI cases among patients was highest in the youngest age group of below 5-year-olds. However, the age group 60 years and above contributed most SARI cases. This was irrespective of the CD used. CONCLUSIONS: In general, available data and the implemented reporting system are appropriate to provide timely and reliable information on SARI in inpatients in Germany. Our ICD-10-based approach proved to be useful for fulfilling requirements for SARI surveillance. The exploratory approach gave valuable insights in data structure and emphasized the advantages of different CD.","Buda, S.; Tolksdorf, K.; Schuler, E.; Kuhlen, R.; Haas, W.",BMC Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493063/,306

14984,Committing to implementation research for health systems to manage and control non-communicable diseases,2020-12-22,"Accumulating evidence suggests that the failing heart reprograms fuel metabolism toward increased utilization of ketone bodies and that increasing cardiac ketone delivery ameliorates cardiac dysfunction. As an initial step toward development of ketone therapies, we investigated the effect of chronic oral ketone ester (KE) supplementation as a prevention or treatment strategy in rodent heart failure models. METHODS: Two independent rodent heart failure models were used for the studies: transverse aortic constriction/myocardial infarction (MI) in mice and post-MI remodeling in rats. Seventy-five mice underwent a prevention treatment strategy with a KE comprised of hexanoyl-hexyl-3-hydroxybutyrate KE (KE-1) diet, and 77 rats were treated in either a prevention or treatment regimen using a commercially available β-hydroxybutyrate-(R)-1,3-butanediol monoester (DeltaG; KE-2) diet. RESULTS: The KE-1 diet in mice elevated β-hydroxybutyrate levels during nocturnal feeding, whereas the KE-2 diet in rats induced ketonemia throughout a 24-hour period. The KE-1 diet preventive strategy attenuated development of left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-transverse aortic constriction/MI (left ventricular ejection fraction±SD, 36±8 in vehicle versus 45±11 in KE-1; P=0.016). The KE-2 diet therapeutic approach also attenuated left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling post-MI (left ventricular ejection fraction, 41±11 in MI-vehicle versus 61±7 in MI-KE-2; P<0.001). In addition, ventricular weight, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, and the expression of ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) were significantly attenuated in the KE-2–treated MI group. However, treatment with KE-2 did not influence cardiac fibrosis post-MI. The myocardial expression of the ketone transporter and 2 ketolytic enzymes was significantly increased in rats fed KE-2 diet along with normalization of myocardial ATP levels to sham values. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic oral supplementation with KE was effective in both prevention and treatment of heart failure in 2 preclinical animal models. In addition, our results indicate that treatment with KE reprogrammed the expression of genes involved in ketone body utilization and normalized myocardial ATP production following MI, consistent with provision of an auxiliary fuel. These findings provide rationale for the assessment of KEs as a treatment for patients with heart failure.","Yurista, Salva R.; Matsuura, Timothy R.; Silljé, Herman H.W.; Nijholt, Kirsten T.; McDaid, Kendra S.; Shewale, Swapnil V.; Leone, Teresa C.; Newman, John C.; Verdin, Eric; van Veldhuisen, Dirk J.; de Boer, Rudolf A.; Kelly, Daniel P.; Westenbrink, B.

39642,The SickleGenAfrica Network,2020-09-21,"Infections by SARS CoV2 - COVID-19 became in a short time a worldwide health emergency. The present SARS-CoV-2 pandemic induced in a short time, an unprecedented impact on public health and on the pre-existing care pathways. In order to appropriately address this epidemiological emergency, urgent solutions were needed, such as remodelling or stopping hospitalization and deferrable clinical activities to avoid spreading the SARS-CoV-2 infection. After the first emergency lockdown phase, care pathways must guarantee healthcare to patients and preserve the safety of the healthcare personnel and of all the other subjects that refer to the cardiological surgeries. Rigorous prescriptive appropriateness of the requested exams with consequent reduction of unnecessary examinations is an essential requirement to preserve prioritized diagnostic and care pathways to patients in need, minimizing the risks connected to the SARS-CoV-2 contagion in hospitals. Telemedicine services represent a valid answer to cardiovascular disease patients’ need for care and assistance, including those in quarantine and voluntary isolation. These services successfully contribute to fight the spread of the virus guaranteeing at the same time therapy and support through remote services that must therefore be considered a resource to be implemented and enhanced. This document has to be used by the healthcare personnel working in hospitals and in district offices, if applicable, and aims at managing patients, in complete safety and considered not suspect/not probable (‘not at risk’) of SARS-CoV-2 infection, eligible for diagnostic activity and subsequent therapy in outpatient surgeries. In particular, this document provides indications for patient evaluation to prevent COVID-19 exposure, gives general indications on managing appointments and waiting rooms, on how to strictly adhere to environmental safety measures, on the proper use of Individual Protective Equipment (IPE).

There is a paucity of research on the relationship between team ability and HA in domestic football leagues and the findings of previous studies are inconclusive. Using longitudinal data from the top four football divisions in England, this study investigates the influence of team ability on the HA of teams. The data collected for this study spans 24 seasons from 1995/96 to 2018/19 and includes 48,864 matches from the English Premier League (n = 9120), the Championship (n = 13,248), League One (n = 13,248) and League Two (n = 13,248). Team ability was interpreted in two ways: (1) the division in which teams play and (2) their league table position within each division. For both the divisional and positional analysis, HA was calculated as the ratio of home points to total points achieved by teams in each season under review. Evidence of a statistically significant HA was found in all four divisions and for teams of all abilities within each division. Small but statistically significant differences in HA were observed between divisions and between high, moderate and low ability teams within divisions.","Ramchandani, Girish; Millar, Robbie; Wilson, Darryl",Ger J Exerc Sport Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8152196/,306
54423,Rotavirus vaccine implementation: evidence to fill the gap?,2021-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Given the existential threat from COVID-19 and the consequent restrictive public health measures it is perhaps unsurprising that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been linked to increases in rates of depression in the general population. Few studies, however have addressed anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the COVID19 pandemic. We aimed to define, in patients with IBD treated with infliximab or vedolizumab and/or an immunomodulator, the prevalence, demographic and disease-related factors associated with depression and the effect of restrictive public health measures on rates of depression. METHODS: CLARITY IBD is a United Kingdom (UK) wide, multicentre, prospective observational cohort study investigating the impact of infliximab and vedolizumab and/or concomitant immunomodulators (thiopurines or methotrexate) on SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, illness, and immunity in patients with IBD. Patients were recruited between 22nd September and 23rd December 2020 and then assessed every 8 weeks. We measured depression using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Secondary outcomes were anxiety and IBD-related quality of life assessed using the General Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7) and IBD-Control questionnaires, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors independently associated with depression at entry to the study. Baseline and paired responses during the third UK government’s stay-at-home lockdown order which commenced on the 4th January 2021 were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The prevalence of depression at entry to the CLARITY study was 26% (1794/6933): 14% patients satisfied criteria for mild, 6% moderate and 5% severe depression. Depression scores were associated with anxiety (Spearman’s rho= 0.78, p<0.0001) and poorer IBD-Control-8 quality of life scores (Spearman’s rho=-0.67, p<0.0001). Multivariable analysis showed that vedolizumab (vs infliximab), steroid use, female sex, younger age, remaining at home, ulcerative colitis, comorbidity and higher income deprivation were associated with depression at entry to the study (Figure 1). Paired depression scores were unchanged between study entry and when assessed during the lockdown period (p=0.91). [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Depression was negatively associated with infliximab therapy and was unchanged during the third UK stay-at-home lockdown. Longitudinal follow up in this cohort will allow us to determine whether COVID-19 vaccination influences depression and whether depression is linked to vaccine hesitancy or impaired serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","Lin, S; Bewshea, C; Chanchlani, N; Chee, D; Pollok, R C; Kennedy, N A; Ahmad, T; Goodhand, J R",J Crohns Colitis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194956/,306

63271,Enhancing the Relevance of Incident Management Systems in Public Health Emergency Preparedness: A Novel Conceptual Framework.,2015,"STUDY DESIGN This is a retrospective case analysis. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to illustrate the numerical effects of regulatory restrictions of elective surgery at an orthopaedic university hospital. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic all over the world places extraordinary demands on health care systems which are forced to ensure structural and personnel capacities. Consequently, hospitals may only perform urgent interventions. Spine patients, however, often need urgent surgery and, moreover, bear an above-average perioperative risk frequently requiring postoperative surveillance on intensive care units (ICUs). Facing this dilemma, we want to share our practice and its unexpected numerical effects. METHODS We compare case statistics during normal operation, directly before and after implementation of regulatory measures. We also analyzed the differences in ICU utilization, complexity and duration of interventions and the patient population. RESULTS Spine surgical interventions have been reduced by 42.7%. Regulatory restriction of ""elective surgeries"" in pandemic situations results in reduced ICU utilization, however in a disproportionate manner. Although other specialized surgeries can be reduced by 59%, surgical spine cases are only diminishable by 24%. The spine surgery-related ICU occupancy has been reduced by 35%. CONCLUSION The disproportionate effect of case reduction needs to be considered while calculating resources released by regulatory limitation of ""elective surgeries"" on a (inter-)national level.","Laux, Christoph J; Bauer, David E; Kohler, Adrian; Uçkay, Ilker; Farshad, Mazda",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000001017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32482971/,306

Postoperative outcomes of interest included incidence of seroma, wound infection, deep-vein thrombosis, bleeding, and hernia recurrence determined via clinical examination. Of the 47 patients included in the study, 25% were classified as having Ventral Hernia Working Group grade 1 risk, 62% as grade 2, 2% as grade 3, and 11% as grade 4; 49% had undergone previous ventral hernia repair. During a mean follow-up of 31 months, 3 patients experienced hernia recurrence, and 9 experienced other postoperative complications: 4 (9%) experienced deep-vein thrombosis; 3 (6%), seroma; 2 (4%), wound infection; and 2 (4%), bleeding. The use of PADM reinforcement following components separation resulted in low rates of postoperative complications and hernia recurrence in this cohort of patients undergoing ventral hernia repair.","Golla, Dinakar; Russo, Carly C",International surgery,https://doi.org/10.9738/intsurg-d-13-00170.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833145/,306
70550,Preparedness activities and research needs in addressing emerging infectious animal and zoonotic diseases.,2017,"PURPOSE Pluripotent cells residing in the periosteum, a bi-layered membrane enveloping all bones, exhibit a remarkable regenerative capacity to fill in critical sized defects of the ovine femur within two weeks of treatment. Harnessing the regenerative power of the periosteum appears to be limited only by the amount of healthy periosteum available. Here we use a substitute periosteum, a delivery device cum implant, to test the hypothesis that directional delivery of endogenous periosteal factors enhances bone defect healing. METHODS Newly adapted surgical protocols were used to create critical sized, middiaphyseal femur defects in four groups of five skeletally mature Swiss alpine sheep. Each group was treated using a periosteum substitute for the controlled addition of periosteal factors including the presence of collagen in the periosteum (Group 1), periosteum derived cells (Group 2), and autogenic periosteal strips (Group 3). Control group animals were treated with an isotropic elastomer membrane alone. We hypothesized that periosteal substitute membranes incorporating the most periosteal factors would show superior defect infilling compared to substitute membranes integrating fewer factors (i.e. Group 3>Group 2>Group 1>Control). RESULTS Based on micro-computed tomography data, bone defects enveloped by substitute periosteum enabling directional delivery of periosteal factors exhibit superior bony bridging compared to those sheathed with isotropic membrane controls (Group 3>Group 2>Group 1, Control). Quantitative histological analysis shows significantly increased de novo tissue generation with delivery of periosteal factors, compared to the substitute periosteum containing a collagen membrane alone (Group 1) as well as compared to the isotropic control membrane. Greatest tissue generation and maximal defect bridging was observed when autologous periosteal transplant strips were included in the periosteum substitute. CONCLUSION Periosteum-derived cells as well as other factors intrinsic to periosteum play a key role for infilling of critical sized defects.","Knothe Tate, Melissa L; Chang, Hana; Moore, Shannon R; Knothe, Ulf R",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0028702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22174873/,306

However, there are few reports on these biological activities in fish. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of baicalin on growth performance, antioxidative status and hepatoprotection in tilapia. The fish were fed on different doses of baicalin (0, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/kg diet). After feeding 60 days, parts of fishes were netted, and the blood, liver, gills and muscle tissues were collected to analyze the antioxidative effect. The remaining fishes were injected with saline or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for challenge test. The results showed that the specific growth rate of fish was slightly increased in three baicalin treatments, and the feed efficiency was clearly improved in 0.4 g/kg baicalin treatment. Meanwhile, the antioxidative capacity in blood, liver and/or gill was enhanced in treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin. After challenge test, the pre-treatments with baicalin effectively alleviated H2O2-induced liver injury. In serum and liver, pre-treatments with 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin suppressed the oxidative damage induced by H2O2, as evidenced by improvement of the levels of SOD, T-AOC and GSH and the decline of MDA level. More important, pre-treatments with 0.4, 0.8 and/or 1.6 g/kg baicalin blocked the upregulation of mRNA levels of tlr1, myd88, irak4, rela, tnf-α and il-1β in H2O2-induced liver injury. In summary, dietary baicalin supplementation could improve feed efficiency, enhance antioxidative ability and alleviate oxidative stress-induced hepatotoxicity in tilapia.","Jia, Rui; Du, Jinliang; Cao, Liping; Feng, Wengrong; Xu, Pao; Yin, Guojun",Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Many countries were forced to a global lockdown with a great socio-economic impact. In Italy, one of the problems was the complex mobility network structure of the Northern regions that made ineffective the attempts to isolate the initial hotspots. In the paper we study a simple model that simulates the epidemic spread on a community network that may exchange population according to a daily mobility rate. In each community the epidemic evolution is provided by a stochastic compartmental model whose parameters are tuned to reproduce the Covid-19 evolution observed in Italy before the global lockdown policies. We initially study the delay in the epidemic spread due to the finite local mobility by proposing a power law relation for the increasing of the infection peak time in each node and the network distance from the initial node where the epidemic starts. We consider two scenarios to study the effectiveness of local lockdown policies: the presence of two clusters weakly connected by the mobility or a homogeneous chain of communities that exchange the population at a fixed rate. In both cases we show the existence of a threshold effect, in a probabilistic sense, for the effectiveness of lockdown policies as a function of the delay time at which such policies are applied, or of the network distance from the outbreak node.","Bazzani, Armando; Lunedei, Enrico; Rambaldi, Sandro",Theoretical biology forum,https://doi.org/10.19272/202011402004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33929002/,306

Exploratory aim was to describe demographic factors that may influence the patients to start and complete PSR. METHODS Retrospective medical charts of all patients seen at a university-affiliated tertiary orofacial pain clinic between July-December 2019 (in person, pre-pandemic) and July-December 2020 (telehealth, during pandemic) were reviewed. Charts were examined for demographic information and to compare the number of patients who started and completed PSR during each study period (chi-squared test). RESULTS Of 248 new patients seen in the clinic during 2019 period, 25 started PSR in-person (10.08%). Of 252 new patients seen during 2020 period, 53 started PSR via telehealth (21.03%). Patients were more likely to start PSR (OR = 6.21, p<.001, CI = 2.499 to 15.435) and more likely to complete all three sessions of PSR (OR = 5.69, p<.001, CI = 2.352 to 13.794) when it was offered via telehealth than in-person. Among those who started PSR via telehealth, patients from metropolitan areas were more likely to start the intervention than those from non-metropolitan areas (p=.045). CONCLUSIONS Offering brief psychological pain interventions via telehealth in tertiary orofacial pain clinics has demonstrated feasibility and may improve willingness to participate in psychological treatments.

Although susceptible to infection, recent evidence indicates mostly asymptomatic or mild presentation of the disease in infants, children, and adolescents. Similar observations were made for acute respiratory infections caused by other coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome). These observations suggest that the immune system behaves differently in children than adults. Recent developments in the field demonstrated fundamental differences in the neonatal immune system as compared with adults, whereby infants respond to microorganisms through biased immune tolerance rather than resistance strategies. Similarly, more frequent/recent vaccinations in children and younger populations may result in trained immunity.

A large linked administrative dataset was utilised. Women were grouped into socioeconomic quintiles using an area-based measure of socioeconomic status. Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the distribution of number of services, out of pocket fees, and government funding by socioeconomic quintile. Needs-adjusted concentration indices (CINA) were utilised to quantify inequity. The mean out of pocket fees for women of least socioeconomic advantage was $1,026 and for women of most socioeconomic advantage the mean was $2,432 (CINA 0.093, 95% CI: 0.088 - 0.098). However, use of many services were higher for women of most socioeconomic advantage: private obstetrician (CINA: 0.035, 95% CI: 0.032 - 0.038), other specialist services (CINA: 0.089, 95%CI: 0.083 - 0.094), and diagnostic and pathology tests (CINA: 0.027, 95%CI: 0.025 - 0.030). Federal government funding through Medicare was distributed towards women of most socioeconomic advantage (CINA: 0.036, 95%CI: 0.033 - 0.039); whereas government public hospital funding was skewed towards women of least socioeconomic advantage (CINA: -0.05, 95%CI: -0.057 - -0.046).

We surveyed electronic dance music (EDM) partygoers-a population known for high levels of drug use-to determine whether their drug use patterns had changed during state-mandated social distancing in New York. Methods: Individuals were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. We surveyed 128 eligible adults and queried, retrospectively, whether their drug use behavior had changed during COVID-19-related social distancing. Results: Most participants reporting past-three-month use reported decreased frequency of use during COVID-19-related social distancing. Specifically, 78.6% reduced frequency of use of cocaine, 71.1% reduced frequency of use of ecstasy/MDMA/Molly, and 68.0% reduced frequency of use of LSD. Although some participants reported increased frequency of use of cocaine (7.1%), ecstasy (7.9%), or LSD (12.0%), 35.0% reported increased frequency of cannabis use. Most (66.7%) of those reporting cocaine use reduced the amount used. The majority of those reporting use of cannabis, ecstasy, cocaine, and/or LSD reported that drug cost (80.0-84.0%) and drug quality (84.2-92.0%) did not change during social distancing. Having a college degree was associated with higher odds for decreasing frequency of cannabis use. Older participants (ages ≥23) were at lower odds for decreasing frequency of cocaine use, as were those earning >$500 per week, and participants who attended EDM events biweekly or more often were at higher odds for decreasing frequency of LSD use. Conclusions: Participants in this sample tended to reduce party drug use during COVID-19-related social distancing.","Palamar, Joseph J; Le, Austin; Acosta, Patricia",Substance use & misuse,https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1857408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317365/,306

METHODS We analyzed the records of 279 patients with normal contralateral kidneys who underwent RAPN or OPN for T1 renal tumors between 2012 and 2014. Volumetric studies to assess the vascularized parenchymal volume of the operated kidney were performed 2 months preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Patient data, including age, body mass index, presence of hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor size, preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate, and tumor complexity using the renal nephrometry score, were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching between groups. RESULTS This cohort included 100 patients who underwent RAPN and 179 who underwent OPN. After matching, 48 patients were included in each group. Mean tumor diameter was 31 mm, and about 14 % were high-complexity tumors (RENAL score 10-12). The RAPN and OPN groups showed no significant differences in the rate of preservation of global renal function (95 vs. 92 %) and parenchymal volume of the operated kidney (84 vs. 79 %). Similarly, urological complications did not significantly differ between groups. Surgical margins were negative in all tumors. Patients who underwent RAPN had lower estimated blood loss (p < 0.0001) and shorter postoperative length of hospital stay (p < 0.0001) than those who underwent OPN. CONCLUSION RAPN can offer acceptable surgical outcomes and precision, compared to OPN, with decreased estimated blood loss and hospital stay.","Takagi, Toshio; Kondo, Tsunenori; Tachibana, Hidekazu; Iizuka, Junpei; Omae, Kenji; Kobayashi, Hirohito; Yoshida, Kazuhiko; Hashimoto, Yasunobu; Tanabe, Kazunari",International urology and nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11255-016-1323-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27262849/,306
133349,Novel technologies applied to the nucleotide sequencing and comparative sequence analysis of the genomes of infectious agents in veterinary medicine.,2016,"CONTEXT People experiencing homelessness are often the first and most severely affected group during disasters. Nonetheless, communities across the United States have frequently failed to adequately address the needs of homeless populations in disaster planning, response, and recovery. Communities must build multisector collaborative relationships and ensure that homeless service providers are adequately resourced. However, constraints in funding and staffing, combined with a lack of guidance about how to achieve an integrated approach to disaster planning for people experiencing homelessness, have hindered communities' ability to accomplish these goals. PROGRAM The US Department of Veterans Affairs, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the US Department of Housing and Urban Development created an interagency workgroup to identify resources to help communities address the disaster needs of homeless populations. This workgroup created a toolkit to address this gap: Disaster Preparedness to Promote Community Resilience.This article describes the development of the toolkit. The toolkit is divided into 3 sections:Section 1 provides guidance to homeless service providers and government entities in identifying collaborative relationships to ensure that services are available to address homeless populations' disaster needs. Section 2 offers nonprofit homeless service providers guidance in creating their disaster response plans. Section 3 aims to ensure that public health officials and health care systems have the capacity to provide health care to homeless populations during disasters. IMPLEMENTATION Efforts are under way to develop a disaster preparedness training manual to assist nonprofit homeless service organizations. DISCUSSION Homeless service providers are vital partners in disaster response. Integrating them into emergency management and ensuring that they are adequately prepared for disasters will effectively enable them to contribute their unique skill sets to community disaster recovery.","Gin, June L; Levine, Cheryl A; Canavan, David; Dobalian, Aram",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001230; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32701792/,306

The aim was to compare the outcomes of NAR and RFA for HCC in patients with three or fewer tumour nodules, each measuring not more than 3 cm in maximum diameter. Methods Eligible patients undergoing NAR or RFA with curative intent between September 2002 and December 2014 were identified. A propensity score-matching analysis was performed to reduce bias, and outcomes in these patients were analysed. Results From a total of 199 patients, 1:1 propensity score matching identified 70 matched pairs. Patients having NAR had a longer hospital stay (median 10 days versus 4 days for those who had RFA; P < 0·001) and a higher morbidity rate (24 versus 10 per cent respectively; P = 0·042). Patients who had NAR had slightly better recurrence-free survival but this failed to reach statistical significance in univariable analysis (P = 0·064). There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (P = 0·475). RFA was identified as an independent risk factor for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1·57; P = 0·041) in multivariable analysis. Local recurrence was significantly more common in patients receiving RFA (23 versus 1 per cent; P < 0·001). Conclusion RFA was an independent risk factor for shorter recurrence-free survival, with a significantly higher local recurrence rate than NAR. Despite these differences, overall survival was not affected.","Kato, Y; Okamura, Y; Omae, K; Sugiura, T; Ito, T; Yamamoto, Y; Ashida, R; Sato, R; Aramaki, T; Uesaka, K",BJS open,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs5.60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30079390/,306

Above a critical concentration, a transient physical network is formed through an association mechanism between hydrophobic end groups, leading to a gel-like behavior. The gel-like polymer solutions were shown to exhibit a peculiar flow behavior, associated with time fluctuation of the transient first normal stress difference, attributed to orientation effects of the stiff charged polymer chains. The viscoelastic behavior was shown to be governed by two pH dependent time scales: a short time scale controlled by the lifetime of the hydrophobic associative junctions and a long time scale corresponding to the network relaxation time. All rheological results show strong evidence that Coulomb interactions, which control both macromolecular chain rigidity and inter-chain interactions, lead to specific pH-tunable properties of great potential interest.","Bossard, Frédéric; Aubry, Thierry; Gotzamanis, Georgios; Tsitsilianis, Constantinos",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b601435f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680247/,306

185088,Factors and determinants of disease emergence.,2004,"Background: Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are associated with a high healthcare burden around the world and there is an urgent need to develop more effective therapies. Natural killer (NK) cells provide the first line of innate defense against IAV by killing infected epithelial cells, by producing antiviral cytokines and affecting adaptive immunity. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that NK cells play a pivotal role in reducing IAV-induced pulmonary infection;however, little is known about the therapeutic potential of adoptively transferred NK cells for IAV infections. Celularity Inc. is developing human placental hematopoietic stem cell-derived allogeneic, off-the-shelf NK cell therapy (CYNK-001) for the treatment of viral infections, including coronavirus disease of 2019. Here, we report the evaluation of antiviral activities of CYNK-001 against IAV infection. Methods: In vitro antiviral activities of CYNK-001 were evaluated using human alveolar epithelial cell line A549, infected with IAV strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at variable multiplicity of infection (MOI). The expression of ligands for NK cell receptors was analyzed on infected A549 cells using Fc-coupled recombinant proteins. CYNK-001 was added to A549 cells 16 hours post infection. CYNK-001 degranulation was measured after 4 hours of coculture, and CYNK-001 cytotoxicity against IAV-infected A549 was measured real-time using impedance-based xCELLigence platform. In vivo antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of CYNK-001 were assessed in A/PR/8/34 (H1N1)-induced severe acute lung injury mouse model. Mice were intranasally infected with 2500 PFU IAV. PBS or 1 x 107 CYNK-001 cells were intravenously administered twice at 1 and 3 days post infection (dpi). At 6 dpi, lungs were collected for the evaluation of viral load by qPCR, lung injury and immune cell profiling by histology. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected at 6 dpi for cytokine analysis by multiplex assays, total protein concentration by ELISA and immune cell profiling by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro, IAV infection corresponded with dose-dependent expression of ligands to NK cell-activating receptors, including NKp44, NKp46 and NKG2D. CYNK-001 cells exhibited increased IFNγ, TNFα and GM-CSF production, and elevated level of degranulation upon coculture with IAV-infected A549 cells. Cytokines in culture supernatant and CD107a expression in CYNK-001 cells were upregulated in a virus dose-dependent manner. Consistent with this finding, CYNK-001 cytotoxicity against IAV-infected A549 cells increased from 35% at 0 MOI to 50%, 60% and 75% at 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 MOI, respectively. These data indicate that CYNK-001 cells recognize virally infected cells, resulting in specific cytotoxic elimination of the source of infection. In vivo, treatment of IAV-infected mice with CYNK-001 reduced weight loss and increased their likelihood of survival. PBS control group developed a severe disease and 37.5% mortality was observed as early as day 4. In the group treated with CYNK-001, disease onset was delayed by 2 days. qPCR analysis of viral RNA showed that CYNK-001-treated mice had lower viral load in the lung than vehicle-treated mice, demonstrating antiviral function of CYNK-001 in vivo. CYNK-001-treated mice had reduced lung injury as assessed by lower total protein concentration in BALF. Moreover, CYNK-001 reduced BALF murine cytokines and chemokines, including IFNγ (p<0.001), IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1 (p<0.05), CXCL2 and CXCL9. Lastly, immunohistochemical analysis of the lung showed that CYNK-001-treated mice had an altered immune response to IAV with higher number of CD68+ macrophages and CD8+ T cells at 6 dpi. Conclusions: Our in vitro and in vivo data show the promising antiviral activities of CYNK-001 against IAV infection. In a severe IAV infection mouse model, CYNK-001 treatment demonstrates lower mortality rate, lower weight loss, lower lung viral load and reduced lung injury along with reduced inflammation. These results support our hypothesis that the adoptive transfer of CYNK-001 cou d reduce the burden of viral infection through the elimination of infected epithelial cells, coordinate a more effective immune response, and result in a clinical benefit in patients with severe viral infection.

The impact posed on verbal and non-verbal communication by masks is yet another challenge to be addressed in clinical care.ObjectivesTo reflect on the consequences of face mask and covering use on communication in the clinical setting, including mental health settings.MethodsPubmed and Google Scholar literature search using terms face mask / face covering and communication / emotion.ResultsThere is a lack of literature on the impact of protective face masks and coverings on communication in clinical settings. Face masks and coverings may have a significant impact on patient-healthcare professional relationship due to disruption of verbal (poorer quality of speech transmission) and non-verbal communication (emotional expression and recognition) with consequences on: 1) clarity of communication with potential for misunderstanding clinical information, advice and prescriptions posing safety issues, 2) emotion perception, expression and reciprocity, 4) perception of healthcare professionals’ empathy and therefore, 3) patient satisfaction, 4) quality of care, and 5) clinical outcomes. Difficulties in communication between the patients´family or other carers and healthcare providers and between healthcare professionals are likewise challenged. People with hearing impairment, children and people with mental illness may be especially vulnerable to these difficulties in communication.ConclusionsProtective face masks and coverings are undoubtedly important in preventing spread of COVID-19, nonetheless mental healthcare professionals should take into account their significant impact on verbal and non-verbal communication in clinical care. Alternative strategies to enhance communication and rapport may be warranted.","Ganhao, I.; Trigo, M.; Paixao, A.",European Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2021.840,306

RPM involves the monitoring of biometrics outside of the hospital or clinic setting with the associated transmission of data to clinicians in a manner that allows actionable insights to improve health outcomes [1]. There are many benefits of RPM for clinicians - ease of access to patient data, the ability to deliver higher-quality care to more patients with a lower risk of burnout - and for healthcare providers - lower costs and higher efficiency, to name just a couple. RPM will be limited in its impact until engagement and adherence can be maximized. We report on our ongoing implementation research with multiple academic and community partners to enhance RPM solutions to increase adherence and patient engagement in diverse patient settings. We demonstrate that RPM solution based on health behavior models and personalized coaching is technically feasible with high adherence rates. This work, however, remains in its infancy. Despite growing interest in remote patient monitoring, substantial gaps in the evidence base needed to be addressed using implementation and behavior science methods to support its ability to improve outcomes. Specifically, questions that remain unresolved include: How effective are RPM devices and associated interventions in changing important clinical outcomes of interest to patients and their clinicians? Which elements of RPM interventions lead to a higher likelihood of lasting success in affecting clinically meaningful outcomes? Which patient populations would benefit most? Rigorous, ongoing evaluation of RPM devices and platforms will be essential for elucidating their value and driving coverage decisions and adoption programs for the most effective solutions. © 2021 IEEE.","Gandy, K.; Schmaderer, M.; Szema, A.; March, C.; Topping, M.; Song, A.; Garcia-Ojeda, M.; Durazo, A.; Domen, J.; Barach, P.","2021 International Conference on Information and Digital Technologies, IDT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/idt52577.2021.9497599,306

Although the etiology of MS is still unknown, many findings point toward a central role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of the disease. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the beneficial effects of immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive therapy on disease activity. Over the past few years, substantial progress has been made in deciphering the immune response in MS. Although animal models have advanced our knowledge of basic mechanisms of immune responses in the CNS, recent studies have also highlighted the differences between MS and its animal equivalent, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. New immunotherapeutic agents have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials. Here, we review current knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of MS and corresponding animal models of disease, and discuss new immunointerventional treatment strategies based on changing pathogenetic concepts.","Hemmer, Bernhard; Nessler, Stefan; Zhou, Dun; Kieseier, Bernd; Hartung, Hans-Peter",Nature clinical practice.

METHODS Subgroups of blood T lymphocytes in 93 patients with SARS were detected by flow cytometer. The results detected in 64 normal subjects and 50 patients with AIDS served as controls. RESULTS The numbers of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes all significantly decreased in acute phase of patients with SARS [(722 +/- 533)/microliter, (438 +/- 353)/microliter, (307 +/- 217)/microliter] compared with those in normal controls [(1527 +/- 470)/microliter, (787 +/- 257)/microliter, (633 +/- 280)/microliter, all P <0.01], which was different from what we observed in patients with AIDS who had decreased CD(4)(+) [(296 +/- 298)/microliter] but increased CD(8)(+) [(818 +/- 566)/microliter] counts. The counts of CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes decreased more apparently in patients with severe SARS. All the five patients who died had CD(4)(+) counts less than 200/microliter. As the patients' condition improved, CD(3)(+), CD(4)(+), and CD(8)(+) counts gradually returned to normal ranges. CONCLUSION The damage of cellular immunity is probably an important mechanism of pathogenesis of SARS.","Tang, Xiaoping; Yin, Chibiao; Zhang, Fuchun; Fu, Yonggui; Chen, Weilie; Chen, Yanqing; Wang, Jian; Jia, Weidong; Xu, Anlong",Chinese medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12877788/,306

The analysis of NK cell-triggering receptor expression has been so far restricted to only NKp46 and NKp30 in Macaca fascicularis. In this study, we extended the molecular and functional characterization to the various NK cell-triggering receptors using PBMC and to the in vitro-derived NK cell populations by cytofluorometry and by cytolytic activity assays. In addition, RT-PCR strategy, cDNA cloning/sequencing, and transient transfections were used to identify and characterize NKp80, NKG2D, CD94/NKG2C, and CD94/NKG2A in M. fascicularis and Macaca mulatta as well as in the signal transducing polypeptide DNAX-activating protein DAP-10. Both M. fascicularis and M. mulatta NK cells express NKp80, NKG2D, and NKG2C molecules, which displayed a high degree of sequence homology with their human counterpart. Analysis of NK cells in simian HIV-infected M. fascicularis revealed reduced surface expression of selected NK cell-triggering receptors associated with a decreased NK cell function only in some animals. Overall surface density of NK cell-triggering receptors on peripheral blood cells and their triggering function on NK cell populations derived in vitro was not decreased compared with uninfected animals. Thus, triggering NK cell receptor monitoring on macaque NK cells is possible and could provide a valuable tool for assessing NK cell function during experimental infections and for exploring possible differences in immune correlates of protection in humans compared with cynomolgus and rhesus macaques undergoing different vaccination strategies.","Biassoni, Roberto; Fogli, Manuela; Cantoni, Claudia; Costa, Paola; Conte, Romana; Koopman, Gerrit; Cafaro, Aurelio; Ensoli, Barbara; Moretta, Alessandro; Moretta, Lorenzo; De Maria, Andrea",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15843571/,306

Most memory (CD44(high)) and some naive (CD44(low)) CD8 T cells are susceptible to IFN-induced attrition, and we show in this study that the IFN-induced attrition of CD8(+)CD44(high) T cells is associated with elevated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. We questioned whether TCR engagement by Ag would render CD8 T cells resistant to attrition. We tested whether a high concentration of Ag (GP33 peptide) would protect lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV)-specific naive CD8 T cells (TCR transgenic P14 cells specific for the GP33 epitope of LCMV) and memory CD8 T cells (GP33-specific LCMV-immune cells) from depletion. Both naive P14 and memory GP33-specific donor CD8 T cells decreased substantially 16 h after inoculation with the Toll receptor agonist and IFN inducer, poly(I:C), regardless of whether a high concentration of GP33 peptide was administered to host mice beforehand. Moreover, donor naive P14 and LCMV-specific memory cells were depleted from day 2 LCMV-infected hosts by 16 h posttransfer. These results indicate that Ag engagement does not protect CD8 T cells from the IFN-induced T cell attrition associated with viral infections. In addition, computer models indicated that early depletion of memory T cells may allow for the generation for a more diverse T cell response to infection by reducing the immunodomination caused by cross-reactive T cells.","Bahl, Kapil; Kim, Sung-Kwon; Calcagno, Claudia; Ghersi, Dario; Puzone, Roberto; Celada, Franco; Selin, Liisa K; Welsh, Raymond M",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16547266/,306
217313,Supply-chain strategies for essential medicines in rural western Kenya during COVID-19,2021,"Introduction In the past decades, there has been an increasing effort to modify traditional learning tools to adopt them with the new demands of students. Equal access to high quality learning opportunities as well as increasing interest in self-paced flexible studying have initiated the use of digital medial technology to produce visual learning tools. These efforts have been accelerated in challenging circumstances, such as the presence of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, the availability of high quality educational videos regarding the human gross anatomy that can match the standards of the medical curriculum is limited. Thus, it is crucial to study the effects of such videos on anatomy education. Objectives The goal of this project is to investigate the role of educational videos and their utilization in medical education with special focus on the anatomy of the human body. Method An educational video was created for learners in professional programs, covering relevant information associated with the peritoneal cavity and its contents. To begin, a cadaver was dissected to clearly expose all the anatomical structures. This process was recorded in a stepwise fashion with proper instructions. The video was edited by the Camtasia 2020 software and different features, such as labels, transitions, and quiz questions, were added to enhance students? learning experience. This video was then uploaded on YouTube and shared with students before their virtual anatomy lab for their viewing. Finally, an online survey was designed and conducted to assess a learner's experience related to this video. Results Students were asked about their purposes of watching the video as well as their opinions regarding the quality of it and the features utilized. The video has 561 views on YouTube from November 2020 to January 2021. Analysis of the data shows that the majority of the participants who completed the online survey found the video and its features enhancing their learning of the anatomy of the peritoneum. More specifically, 92.3% of the participants mentioned their purpose for watching the video to be preparing for their anatomy lab and dissection. 95.7% of the participants reported that the video assisted them in fulfilling their aforementioned purpose. In addition, 92.9% of the participants ranked the overall quality of the video as ?Very Good?. Moreover, the average score (1-5) given by participants to the features added to the video was calculated as 4.57, 4.72, and 4.36 for labelling, transitions, and quiz questions, respectively. Conclusion The feedback received from this survey strongly suggests that using digital media technology in creating educational anatomy videos is beneficial for enhancing the learning experience of students.

It is urgent to conduct prediction research on the development and spread of the epidemic. In this article, a hybrid artificial-intelligence (AI) model is proposed for COVID-19 prediction. First, as traditional epidemic models treat all individuals with coronavirus as having the same infection rate, an improved susceptible-infected (ISI) model is proposed to estimate the variety of the infection rates for analyzing the transmission laws and development trend. Second, considering the effects of prevention and control measures and the increase of the public's prevention awareness, the natural language processing (NLP) module and the long short-term memory (LSTM) network are embedded into the ISI model to build the hybrid AI model for COVID-19 prediction. The experimental results on the epidemic data of several typical provinces and cities in China show that individuals with coronavirus have a higher infection rate within the third to eighth days after they were infected, which is more in line with the actual transmission laws of the epidemic. Moreover, compared with the traditional epidemic models, the proposed hybrid AI model can significantly reduce the errors of the prediction results and obtain the mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) with 0.52%, 0.38%, 0.05%, and 0.86% for the next six days in Wuhan, Beijing, Shanghai, and countrywide, respectively.","Zheng, Nanning; Du, Shaoyi; Wang, Jianji; Zhang, He; Cui, Wenting; Kang, Zijian; Yang, Tao; Lou, Bin; Chi, Yuting; Long, Hong; Ma, Mei; Yuan, Qi; Zhang, Shupei; Zhang, Dong; Ye, Feng; Xin, Jingmin",IEEE Trans Cybern,,306

EY6A Fab binds the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein tightly (KD of 2 nM), and a 2.6-Å-resolution crystal structure of an RBD-EY6A Fab complex identifies the highly conserved epitope, away from the ACE2 receptor binding site. Residues within this footprint are key to stabilizing the pre-fusion spike. Cryo-EM analyses of the pre-fusion spike incubated with EY6A Fab reveal a complex of the intact spike trimer with three Fabs bound and two further multimeric forms comprising the destabilized spike attached to Fab.

347122,Hyperglycemia: An independent accompaniment of COVID -19,2021,"Ecosystem, which consists of the physical environment and all the living organisms, on which we all depend, is declining rapidly because of its destruction caused by humans. It's a two-way relationship between the humans and mother nature. If we destroy the natural environment around us, human life will be seriously affected, and the life of next generation will be endangered unless serious steps are taken. One such effect of human overexploitations has come in the form of coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus, a contagious disease of 2019 known as Covid-19, is the latest swiftly spreading global infection. The aetiology of Covid-19 is different from SARS-CoV which has the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but it has the same host receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The novel coronavirus which is zoonotic (spreading from an animal to a human) and mainly found in the bats and pangolins is a single stranded ribonucleic acid virus of Coronaviridae family.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; The typical structure of 2019-nCoV possessed 'spike protein' in the membrane envelope, also expressed various polyproteins, nucleoproteins and membrane protein. The S protein binds to the receptor cell of host to facilitate the entry of virus in the host. Currently four genera for coronavirus are found a-CoV, ss-CoV, P-CoV, -CoV. SARS-CoV first originated in Wuhan, China and has spread across the globe. World Health Organization (WHO) and public health emergency of international concern declared it as 2019 - 2020 pandemic disease.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; According to WHO report, (7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April 2020) update on this pandemic coronavirus disease, there have been more than 13,65,004 confirmed cases and 76,507 deaths across the world and these figures are rapidly increasing.

Upgrades to the prevention and control of infection have become paramount in order to lower the risk of hospital contagion. Aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation or endoscopic procedures may expose health care workers to a high risk of infection. Moreover, thoracic anaesthesia usually requires highly complex airway management procedures because of the need for one-lung isolation and one-lung ventilation. Therefore, in the current pandemic, providing a fast-track algorithm for scientifically standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment recommendations for patients with lung cancer is urgent.

In this setting, heart failure units have faced an enormous challenge: taking care of their patients while at the same time avoiding patients' visits to the hospital. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a follow-up protocol established in an advanced heart failure unit at a single center in Spain during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: During March and April 2020, a protocolized approach was implemented in our unit to reduce the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions throughout the maximum COVID-19 spread period. We compared emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions, and mortality with those of January and February 2020. RESULTS: When compared to the preceding months, during the COVID pandemic there was a 56.5% reduction in the ER visits and a 46.9% reduction in hospital admissions, without an increase in mortality (9 patients died in both time periods). A total of 18 patients required a visit to the outpatient clinic for decompensation of heart failure or others. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that implementing an active-surveillance protocol in acutely decompensated heart failure units during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can reduce hospital admissions, ER visits and, potentially, viral transmission, in a cohort of especially vulnerable patients.","Jiménez-Blanco Bravo, Marta; Cordero Pereda, David; Sánchez Vega, Diego; Del Prado Díaz, Susana; Monteagudo Ruiz, Juan Manuel; Zamorano Gómez, José Luis; Alonso Salinas, Gonzalo Luis",Cardiology,,306
397966,Faster than warp speed: early attention to COVD-19 by anti-vaccine groups on Facebook,2021,"BACKGROUNDS: Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyzes the essential step in the formation of all four deoxynucleotides. Upregulated activity of RR plays an active role in tumor progression. As the regulatory subunit of RR, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) is regarded as one of the effective therapeutic targets for DNA replication-dependent diseases, such as cancers. Recent studies have revealed that osalmid significantly inhibits the activity of RRM2, but the metabolic profile of osalmid remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to clarify the metabolic profile including metabolites, isoenzymes and metabolic pathways of osalmid. The anti-human hepatocellular carcinoma activity and mechanism of metabolites were further investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) was used for identifying metabolites and for characterizing phase I and phase II metabolic pathways with recombinant enzymes or in human liver microsomes of osalmid. The eHiTS docking system was used for potential RRM2 inhibitor screening among metabolites. Cytotoxicity assays were performed for evaluating cell proliferation inhibitory activity of metabolites. Cell cycle assays and cell apoptosis assays were assessed by flow cytometry. Western blotting analysis of RRM2, cyclin D1, p21, p53, phosphorylated p53, Bcl-2 and Bax was performed to explore the anti-hepatocellular carcinoma mechanism of the active metabolites. RESULTS: Ten metabolites of osalmid were identified, and none of them have been reported previously. Hydroxylation, glucuronidation, sulfonation, acetylation and degradation were recognized as the main metabolic processes of osalmid. Isozymes of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, UGT1A1, UGT1A6, UGT1A9, UGT2B7 and UGT2B15 were involved in phase I and phase II metabolism of osalmid. Metabolites M7, M8 and M10 showed higher binding affinities with the RRM2 active site than osalmid. Metabolite M7 exhibited potent inhibitory activity to hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by both competitive inhibition and down-regulation of RRM2. Moreover, M7 significantly induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic profile of osalmid was identified. M7 significantly inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma progression by inhibiting RRM2 activity. Furthermore, M7 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by activating p53-related signaling pathways.","Wu, Zhe; Zhan, Yaqiong; Wang, Li; Tong, Jiepeng; Zhang, Li; Lin, Mengjia; Jin, Xuehang; Jiang, Lushun; Lou, Yan; Qiu, Yunqing",Biomed Pharmacother,,306

Participants (n = 502), who were United States residents, completed a variety of sociodemographic questions and the following questionnaires: Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10), Whitley Index 7 (WI-7), Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C19-ASS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were negatively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms and that neuroticism, health anxiety and both measures of COVID-19 psychological distress were positively correlated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. We used path analysis to determine the pattern of relationships specified by the theoretical model we proposed. Results showed that health anxiety, COVID-19 anxiety, and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome partially mediated the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms. Specifically, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with the three mediators, which, in turn, were positively associated with generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, with COVID-19 anxiety showing the strongest effect. Conversely, neuroticism and openness were positively associated with COVID-19 anxiety and the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, respectively. These relationships were independent of age, gender, employment status and risk status. The model accounted for a substantial variance of generalised anxiety and depression symptoms (R2 = .75).

However, clinical trials based on its oral administration have failed to provide significant effect on cardiac functionality. The main limitation of CoQ10 is based on its very low oral bioavailability and instability that limit dramatically its effects as a cardioprotective agent. Herein, we loaded CoQ10 in high bioavailable nano-emulsions (NEs) coated with chitosan or chitosan and hyaluronic acid in order to improve its performance. Methods: We tested cardioprotective and hepatoprotective effects of CoQ10-loaded nano-carriers against Doxorubicin and Trastuzumab toxicities in cardiomyocytes and liver cells through analysis of cell viability, lipid peroxidation, expression of leukotrienes, p65/NF-kB and pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in anticancer-induced cardio and hepatotoxicity. Results: Nano-carriers showed high stability and loading ability and increased cell viability both in hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes during anticancer treatments. We observed that these effects are mediated by the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and reduction of the inflammation. CoQ10-loaded nano-emulsions showed also strong anti-inflammatory effects reducing leukotriene B4 and p65/NF-&#954;B expression and Interleukin 1ß and 6 production during anticancer treatments. Discussion: Anthracyclines and Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) inhibitors have shown significant anticancer effects in clinical practice but their use is characterized by cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. Nano-carriers loaded with CoQ10 showed cardio and hepatoprotective properties mediated by reduction of oxidative damages and pro-inflammatory mediators.

We constructed recombinant VSVs specifying either the Indiana or Chandipura virus G glycoprotein and expressing the West Nile virus (WNV) envelope (E) glycoprotein. Mice were intranasally vaccinated using a prime (Indiana)-boost (Chandipura) immunization approach and challenged with the virulent WNV-LSU-AR01. Ninety-percent (9 of 10) of the vaccinated mice survived as compared to 10% of the mock-vaccinated mice after WNV lethal challenge. Histopathological examination of brain tissues revealed neuronal necrosis in mock-vaccinated mice but not in vaccinated mice, and vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed a strong neutralizing antibody response against WNV. Extensive immunological analysis using polychromatic flow cytometry staining revealed that vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed robust cellular immune responses as evidenced by up-regulation of CD4(+) CD154(+) IFNγ(+) T cells in vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice. Similarly, vaccinated mice developed robust E-glycoprotein-specific CD8(+) T cell immune responses as evidenced by the presence of a high percentage of CD8(+) CD62L(low) IFNγ(+) cells. In addition, a sizeable population of CD8(+) CD69(+) cells was detected indicating E-specific activation of mature T cells and CD4(+) CD25(+) CD127(low) T regulatory (T reg) cells were down-regulated.

Recently in 2018, the Saudi ministry of health released that the incidence of HIV in Saudi Arabia is 3 cases of HIV for every 10,000 of the population. Having said that, the surveillance of HIV will face a range of challenges in KSA despite proper medical care, counseling, family planning, diagnostic, evaluation, and the use of effective anti-retroviral therapy. Patients who underwent anti-retroviral therapy showed significant reduction in morbidity as well as mortality.

In this review, we discuss the common co-infections with HIV infections that are reported in KSA, which when compared to international trends, it is similar for both viral hepatitis and tuberculosis. Although those co-infections exist, they are presented in different ratios and percentages when compared to the international reported data. These differences mandates defining and introducing new resilient methods of treatment and preventive measures. In this review, we offer an insight into healthcare policymakers to be compliant with UNAIDS 2020 vision program. We also discuss some of the gaps and recommendations to achieve the WHO 90–90-90 goal.","Al-Mozaini, Maha; Alrahbeni, Tahani; Dirar, Qais; Alotibi, Jawaher; Alrajhi, Abdulrahman",Infect Drug Resist,https://doi.org/10.2147/idr.s270355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500633/,306
682796,Addressing racial inequalities in a pandemic: data limitations and a call for critical analyses,2020-09-15,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a high incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events. The role of anticoagulation (AC) prior to hospital admission and how different types of oral AC influences the outcome of COVID-19 is currently unknown. This observational study compares the outcome in COVID-19 patients with prior use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) or vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and without prior use of AC. We collected the baseline characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients presented to the emergency department of Bernhoven Hospital, the Netherlands. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 30 days and analyzed in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model including age, sex, symptom duration, home medication, and comorbidities. We included 497 patients, including 57 patients with DOAC (11%) and 53 patients with VKA (11%). Patients with AC had a lower body temperature and lower C-reactive protein levels. Comparing the primary outcome in patients with AC (DOAC or VKA) and no AC, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 0.64 (95% CI 0.42–0.96, P = 0.03). Comparing DOAC and no AC, the aHR was 0.53 (95% CI 0.32–0.89, P = 0.02) and comparing VKA and no AC, the aHR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.47–1.27, P = 0.30). In a subgroup analysis of DOAC, all nine patients with prior use of dabigatran survived within 30 days. In this observational study, the prior use of AC is associated with a better survival of COVID-19. DOAC, especially dabigatran, might have additional beneficial effects.","Buenen, A.
