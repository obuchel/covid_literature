CASE PRESENTATION: A 2 1/2 years old girl was diagnosed as having alveolar proteinosis. Whole lung lavages were performed with a new catheter balloon technique, feasible in small sized airways. Because of some interstitial inflammation in the lung biopsy and to further improve the condition, empirical therapy with systemic steroids and azathioprin, and inhaled and subcutaneous GMCSF, were used. Based on clinical measures, total protein and lipid recovered by whole lung lavages, all these treatments were without benefit. Conversely, severe respiratory viral infections and an invasive aspergillosis with aspergilloma formation occurred. Recently the novel homozygous stop mutation p.Ser25X of the GMCSF receptor alpha chain was identified in the patient. This mutation leads to a lack of functional GMCSF receptor and a reduced response to GMCSF stimulation of CD11b expression of mononuclear cells of the patient. Subsequently a very intense treatment with monthly lavages was initiated, resulting for the first time in complete resolution of partial respiratory insufficiency and a significant improvement of the overall somato-psychosocial condition of the child. CONCLUSIONS: The long term management from early childhood into young adolescence of severe alveolar proteinosis due to GMCSF receptor deficiency requires a dedicated specialized team to perform technically demanding whole lung lavages and cope with complications.","Griese, Matthias; Ripper, Jan; Sibbersen, Anke; Lohse, Pia; Lohse, Peter; Brasch, Frank; Schams, Andrea; Pamir, Asli; Schaub, Bianca; Muensterer, Oliver J; Schön, Carola; Glöckner-Pagel, Judith; Nicolai, Thomas; Reiter, Karl; Hector, Andreas",BMC Pediatr,208,1
2082,2082,2082,Deletion of Dystrophin In-Frame Exon 5 Leads to a Severe Phenotype: Guidance for Exon Skipping Strategies,15.127376,8.02642,2016-01-08,"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy severity depends upon the nature and location of the DMD gene lesion and generally correlates with the dystrophin open reading frame. However, there are striking exceptions where an in-frame genomic deletion leads to severe pathology or protein-truncating mutations (nonsense or frame-shifting indels) manifest as mild disease. Exceptions to the dystrophin reading frame rule are usually resolved after molecular diagnosis on muscle RNA. We report a moderate/severe Becker muscular dystrophy patient with an in-frame genomic deletion of DMD exon 5. This mutation has been reported by others as resulting in Duchenne or Intermediate muscular dystrophy, and the loss of this in-frame exon in one patient led to multiple splicing events, including omission of exon 6, that disrupts the open reading frame and is consistent with a severe phenotype. The patient described has a deletion of dystrophin exon 5 that does not compromise recognition of exon 6, and although the deletion does not disrupt the reading frame, his clinical presentation is more severe than would be expected for classical Becker muscular dystrophy. We suggest that the dystrophin isoform lacking the actin-binding sequence encoded by exon 5 is compromised, reflected by the phenotype resulting from induction of this dystrophin isoform in mouse muscle in vivo. Hence, exon skipping to address DMD-causing mutations within DMD exon 5 may not yield an isoform that confers marked clinical benefit. Additional studies will be required to determine whether multi-exon skipping strategies could yield more functional dystrophin isoforms, since some BMD patients with larger in-frame deletions in this region have been reported with mild phenotypes.","Toh, Zhi Yon Charles; Thandar Aung-Htut, May; Pinniger, Gavin; Adams, Abbie M.; Krishnaswarmy, Sudarsan; Wong, Brenda L.; Fletcher, Sue; Wilton, Steve D.",PLoS One,208,1
2777,2777,2777,Cystatin D (CST5): An ultra-early inflammatory biomarker of traumatic brain injury,15.023884,8.176933,2017-07-10,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is set to become the leading cause of neurological disability across all age groups. Currently, no reliable biomarkers exist to help diagnose the severity of TBI to identify patients who are at risk of developing secondary injuries. Thus, the discovery of reliable biomarkers for the management of TBI would improve clinical interventions. Inflammatory markers are particularly suited for biomarker discovery as TBI leads to very early alterations in inflammatory proteins. Using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation assay, we measured in patients that had suffered mild TBI (n = 10) or severe TBI (n = 10) with extra-cranial injury or extracranial injury only (EC) (n = 10), 92 inflammation-associated proteins in serum obtained: <1 hr (within 1-hour), 4–12 hr and 48–72 hr post injury. Changes were compared to healthy volunteers (HV). Our results identified CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL as novel early biomarkers of TBI. CST5 identified patients with severe TBI from all other cohorts and importantly was able to do so within the first hour of injury. AXIN1 and TRAIL were able to discriminate between TBI and HV at <1 hr. We conclude that CST5, AXIN1 and TRAIL are worthy of further study in the context of a pre-hospital or pitch-side test to detect brain injury.","Hill, Lisa J.; Di Pietro, Valentina; Hazeldine, Jon; Davies, David; Toman, Emma; Logan, Ann; Belli, Antonio",Sci Rep,208,1
2897,2897,2897,Targeting Hsp27/eIF4E interaction with phenazine compound: a promising alternative for castration-resistant prostate cancer treatment,14.8072195,7.9082985,2017-08-24,"The actual strategy to improve current therapies in advanced prostate cancer involves targeting genes activated by androgen withdrawal, either to delay or prevent the emergence of the castration-refractory phenotype. However, these genes are often implicated in several physiological processes, and long-term inhibition of survival proteins might be accompanied with cytotoxic effects. To avoid this problem, an alternative therapeutic strategy relies on the identification and use of compounds that disrupt specific protein-protein interactions involved in androgen withdrawal. Specifically, the interaction of the chaperone protein Hsp27 with the initiation factor eIF4E leads to the protection of protein synthesis initiation process and enhances cell survival during cell stress induced by castration or chemotherapy. Thus, in this work we aimed at i) identifying the interaction site of the Hsp27/eIF4E complex and ii) interfere with the relevant protein/protein association mechanism involved in castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. By a combination of experimental and modeling techniques, we proved that eIF4E interacts with the C-terminal part of Hsp27, preferentially when Hsp27 is phosphorylated. We also observed that the loss of this interaction increased cell chemo-and hormone-sensitivity. In order to find a potential inhibitor of Hsp27/eIF4E interaction, BRET assays in combination with molecular simulations identified the phenazine derivative 14 as the compound able to efficiently interfere with this protein/protein interaction, thereby inhibiting cell viability and increasing cell death in chemo- and castration-resistant prostate cancer models in vitro and in vivo.","Ziouziou, Hajer; Andrieu, Claudia; Laurini, Erik; Karaki, Sara; Fermeglia, Maurizio; Oueslati, Ridha; Taieb, David; Camplo, Michel; Siri, Olivier; Pricl, Sabrina; Katsogiannou, Maria; Rocchi, Palma",Oncotarget,208,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Animal models of HTN have shown that gut pathology occurs in HTN, and provides some clues to mechanisms linking the dysbiosis, gut pathology, and HTN. SUMMARY: Circumstantial evidence links gut dysbiosis and HTN. Gut pathology, apparent in animal HTN models, has not been fully investigated in hypertensive patients.

Methods: We searched the public databases up to April 15, 2018. This study analyzed only the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have appeared in more than three studies and assessed the level of evidence by classifying the outcomes according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: The ABCB1 rs1045642 C>T mutation had a protective effect against SONFH in the allelic model (I(2) = 50.2%; OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55–1.00; p = 0.046). The rs2032582 mutation in the ABCB1 gene showed no relationship to SONFH (allelic model: I(2) = 63.4%; OR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.58–1.23; p = 0.382). In ApoB rs693, four models showed that mutations can increase SONFH risk, but the allelic model did not. The ApoB rs1042031 mutation increased SONFH risk in the dominant model (I(2) = 50.3%; OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.49–5.66; p = 0.002). Conclusion: An allelic model of ABCB1 rs1045642 showed that mutations have a protective effect against SONFH at a very low level of evidence. The mutations in ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the SONFH risk with moderate levels of evidence.","Chen, Xiantao; Zhang, Leilei; Liang, Dawei; Li, Jing; Liu, Fenzhi; Ma, Hongxia",Front Physiol,208,1
4020,4020,4020,Simultaneous detection of eleven sexually transmitted agents using multiplexed PCR coupled with MALDI-TOF analysis,15.030286,8.046108,2019-08-28,"PURPOSE: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), representing a major global health problem, are caused by different microbes, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Unfortunately, infections of different sexually transmitted pathogens often present similar clinical symptoms, so it is almost impossible to distinguish them clinically. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a sensitive, multitarget, and high-throughput method that can detect various agents responsible for STIs. METHODS: We developed and tested a 23-plex PCR coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) assay (sexually transmitted infection-mass spectrometry, STI-MS) that simultaneously targets 11 different agents, including 8 most common clinical pathogens related to STIs (HSV-1, HSV-2, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Haemophilus ducreyi) and 3 controversial microorganisms as pathogens (Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum). RESULTS: The results showed that the STI-MS approach can accurately detect the expected agents, without cross-reaction with other organisms. The limit of detection of each STI-MS assay was ranged from 1.739 to 10.009 copies/reaction, using probit analyses. The verification rate for each target organism of the STI-MS ranged from a minimum of 89.3% to a maximum of 100%, using conventional assays and ultrasensitive digital PCR to confirm the STI-MS-positive results. To further evaluate the clinical performance of this assay, 241 clinical specimens (124 urethral/cervical swabs and 117 urine) were tested in parallel using the STI-MS assay and monoplex real-time PCR for each agent. The overall validation parameters of STI-MS were extremely high including sensitivity (from 85.7% to 100%), specificity (from 92.3% to 100%), PPV (from 50% to 100%), and NPV (from 99.1% to 100%) for each target. CONCLUSION: STI-MS is a useful high-throughput screening tool for detecting mixed infections of STIs and has great potential for application in large-scale epidemiological programs for specific microorganisms of STI.","Xiu, Leshan; Zhang, Chi; Li, Yamei; Wang, Feng; Peng, Junping",Infect Drug Resist,208,1
4144,4144,4144,How do we … integrate pathogen reduced platelets into our hospital blood bank inventory?,14.880947,8.124095,2019-03-18,"For more than 50 years there has been an ongoing effort to combat transfusion‐transmitted infections and provide patients with the safest possible blood. This initiative has driven much of the research within the transfusion community. Initial methods included screening donors for travel histories to banned areas and for high‐risk behaviors, but pathogen‐specific assays performed at the collection and manufacturing sites also have become key factors in assuring blood safety. Many of these have focused on donor and laboratory‐based screening for transfusion‐transmitted diseases, as evidenced by the hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus screening in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. More recently, this effort has expanded to develop donor screening assays to identify other blood‐borne pathogens, such as Zika and West Nile viruses and Babesia. Bacterial contamination of units of platelets (PLTs), however, remains a significant concern. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has approved rapid tests to identify bacterially contaminated PLT units in the blood bank before transfusion. Other supplemental methods have been developed, however, that aim to inactivate blood‐borne pathogen(s) present in the blood product, rather than to rely on our ability to identify and interdict contaminated and infected components. Pathogen reduction technology, as this is referred to, provides a proactive way to further reduce the risk posed by transfusion‐transmitted infections.","Rutter, Sara; Snyder, Edward L.",Transfusion,208,1

However, measures of leukocyte function are not routinely available in clinical care. Here we report the development and testing of an inertial microfluidic system for the label-free isolation and downstream functional assessment of leukocytes from 50 μl of peripheral blood. We used the system to assess leukocyte phenotype and function in serial samples from 18 hospitalized patients with sepsis and 10 healthy subjects. The sepsis samples had significantly higher levels of CD16(dim) and CD16(−) neutrophils and CD16(+) ‘intermediate’ monocytes, as well as significantly lower levels of neutrophil-elastase release, O(2)(−) production and phagolysosome formation. Repeated sampling of sepsis patients over 7 days showed that leukocyte activation (measured by isodielectric separation) and leukocyte phenotype and function were significantly more predictive of the clinical course than complete-blood-count parameters. We conclude that the serial assessment of leukocyte function in microlitre blood volumes is feasible and that it provides significantly more prognostic information than leukocyte counting.","Jundi, Bakr; Ryu, Hyunryul; Lee, Do-Hyun; Abdulnour, Raja-Elie E.; Engstrom, Braden D.; Duvall, Melody G.; Higuera, Angelica; Pinilla-Vera, Mayra; Benson, Maura E.; Lee, Jaemyon; Krishnamoorthy, Nandini; Baron, Rebecca M.; Han, Jongyoon; Voldman, Joel; Levy, Bruce D.",Nat Biomed Eng,208,17

The nucleoprotein (N) of VSV protects the viral genomic RNA and plays an essential role in viral transcription and replication, which makes the nucleoprotein an ideal target of host defense. However, whether and how host innate/intrinsic immunity limits VSV infection by targeting the N protein are unknown. In this study, we found that the N protein of VSV (VSV-N) interacted with a ubiquitin E3 ligase, tripartite motif protein 41 (TRIM41). Overexpression of TRIM41 inhibited VSV infection. Conversely, the depletion of TRIM41 increased host susceptibility to VSV. Furthermore, the E3 ligase defective mutant of TRIM41 failed to limit VSV infection, suggesting the requirement of the E3 ligase activity of TRIM41 in viral restriction. Indeed, TRIM41 ubiquitinated VSV-N in cells and in vitro. TRIM41-mediated ubiquitination leads to the degradation of VSV-N through proteasome, thereby limiting VSV infection. Taken together, our study identifies TRIM41 as a new intrinsic immune factor against VSV by targeting the viral nucleoprotein for ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation.","Patil, Girish; Xu, Lingling; Wu, Yakun; Song, Kun; Hao, Wenzhuo; Hua, Fang; Wang, Lingyan; Li, Shitao",Viruses,208,22

The incidence of trauma-induced, moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia, according to the Berlin definition, could be as high as 45%. Its pathophysiology includes the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which propagate tissue injuries by triggering neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs include a DNA backbone coated with cytoplasmic proteins, which drive pulmonary cytotoxic effects. The structure of NETs and many DAMPs includes double-stranded DNA, which prevents their neutralization by plasma. Dornase alfa is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved recombinant DNase, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may therefore break up the backbone of NETs and DAMPs. Aerosolized dornase alfa was shown to reduce trauma-induced lung injury in experimental models and to improve arterial oxygenation in ventilated patients. METHODS: TRAUMADORNASE will be an institution-led, multicentre, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial in ventilated trauma patients. The primary trial objective is to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in severe trauma patients during the first 7 days from 45% to 30% by providing aerosolized dornase alfa as compared to placebo. The secondary objectives are to demonstrate an improvement in lung function and a reduction in morbidity and mortality. Randomization of 250 patients per treatment arm will be carried out through a secure, web-based system. Statistical analyses will include a descriptive step and an inferential step using fully Bayesian techniques. The study was approved by both the Agence Nationale de la Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (ANSM, on 5 October 2018) and a National Institutional Review Board (CPP, on 6 November 2018). Participant recruitment began in March 2019. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed medical journals. DISCUSSION: If early administration of inhaled dornase alfa actually reduces the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypoxaemia in patients with severe trauma, this new therapeutic strategy may be easily implemented in many clinical trauma care settings. This treatment may facilitate ventilator weaning, reduce the burden of trauma-induced lung inflammation and facilitate recovery and rehabilitation in severe trauma patients.

These features constitute major determinants of virion stability in the environment and virion resistance against physical and chemical agents. Reovirus (ReoV) is the general term most commonly used for all virus strains that infect humans and nonhuman animals. Several studies have demonstrated the frequent occurrence of ReoV in wastewaters and natural waters, including surface and ground waters from different geographical areas. Most of these studies have reported higher concentrations of ReoV than any other enteric virus analyzed. They are more commonly isolated in chlorine-disinfected wastewaters than other enteric viruses, and appear to survive longer in water. The ability of ReoV to form large aggregates, even with different types of enteric viruses (e.g., poliovirus) and their ability to undergo mechanisms of gene segment reassortment among different serotypes may also explain their greater stability. Different approaches have been applied for concentration of ReoV from water; however, the recovery efficiency of the filtration methods has not been fully evaluated. Recently, molecular methods for identification of ReoV strains and quantification of virus genome have been developed. Studies have shown that the overall detection sensitivity of ReoV RNA is enhanced through initial replication of infectious virions in cell culture. More studies are needed to specifically address unresolved issues about the fate and distribution of ReoV in the environment since this virus is not commonly included in virological investigations.","Betancourt, Walter Q.; Gerba, Charles P.",Food Environ Virol,208,1

The examination should begin by careful observation of the child’s position of comfort and by noting all vital signs.

In analogy with sepsis, evidence has accumulated of the significance of apoptotic cell death in the systemic manifestations associated with acute pancreatitis. Since we identified apoptosis-inducing activity in pancreatitis-associated ascitic fluid in 1995, a number of investigators, including our group, have reported, through animal experiments, that apoptosis occurred in the parenchymal cells constituting organs, such as alveolar epithelial cells in the lung, renal tubular cells in the kidney, and hepatocytes in the liver, and this apoptosis was involved in organ dysfunction with severe acute pancreatitis. Moreover, through clinical and experimental investigations, apoptosis has been revealed to be involved in the mechanism of infectious complications in acute pancreatitis. Namely, apoptosis in lymphatic tissues and peripherally circulating lymphocytes is involved in the impairment of cellular immunity, and apoptosis in gut epithelial cells is implicated in bacterial translocation. These results suggest that apoptotic cell death may play a considerable role in affecting mortality and morbidity in severe acute pancreatitis. Control of apoptosis could be a potent strategy for improvement of the clinical outcome in severe acute pancreatitis.","Takeyama, Yoshifumi",J Gastroenterol,208,22

There is now convincing evidence that regulated patterns of endothelial cell survival and death, a process known as apoptosis, play a central role in the periodic remodeling of the vasculature, and in the timely evolution and regression of angiogenic responses. In this review we discuss the current evidence suggesting a role for inducers and inhibitors of angiogenesis as well as other mediators that modify endothelial cells functions in the survival and death of endothelial cells. We also discuss how dysregulation of apoptosis can lead to aberrant angiogenesis as demonstrated in the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity and cancer.","Nör, Jacques E.; Polverini, Peter J.",Angiogenesis,208,1

This article reports the negative results of a clinical trial with loratadine, a second-generation antihistamine, in adults in the rhinovirus challenge model. This finding in the highly controlled setting of the challenge model confirms the earlier negative studies with second-generation antihistamines in natural colds. First-generation antihistamines block both histaminic and muscarinic receptors as well as passing the blood-brain barrier. Second-generation antihistamines mainly block histaminic receptors and do not pass the blood-brain barrier. The effectiveness of first-generation antihistamines in blocking sneezing in colds may be due primarily to neuropharmacological manipulation of histaminic and muscarinic receptors in the medulla.","Muether, Philipp S.; Gwaltney, Jack M.",Clin Infect Dis,208,1

The ability to associate a specific gene with a disease can be attributed primarily to the extraordinary progress that has been made in the areas of gene sequencing and information technologies. Selection and validation of novel molecular targets have become of great importance in light of the abundance of new potential therapeutic drug targets that have emerged from human gene sequencing. In response to this revolution within the pharmaceutical industry, the development of high-throughput methods in both biology and chemistry has been necessitated. Further, the successful translation of basic scientific discoveries into clinical experimental medicine and novel therapeutics is an increasing challenge. As such, a new paradigm for drug discovery has emerged. This process involves the integration of clinical, genetic, genomic, and molecular phenotype data partnered with cheminformatics. Central to this process, the data generated are managed, collated, and interpreted with the use of informatics.

METHODS: A novel tracheal suctioning simulator combined with a motion capture system was used to calculate the amount of simulated phlegm suctioned and the biomechanical parameters of the associated suctioning manoeuvre. A laboratory study, including 12 nurses with > 3 years of suctioning experience and 12 nursing students without any clinical suctioning experience, was conducted. The amount of phlegm suctioned, the maximum length of catheter insertion, and the biomechanical parameters of hand movement were calculated. RESULTS: The mean amount of phlegm suctioned per second was significantly larger in the experienced group than in the non-experienced group. The amount of phlegm suctioned correlated positively with the length of the vertical path of motion of the wrist and forearm, and with the angular velocity of thumb rotation in both the groups. CONCLUSION: Greater vertical motion of the wrist and thumb rotation improved the effectiveness of phlegm suctioning and prevented the need for deep suctioning, which is unsafe.","Colley, Noriyo; Mani, Hiroki; Ninomiya, Shinji; Komizunai, Shunsuke; Murata, Eri; Oshita, Hiroka; Taneda, Kenji; Shima, Yusuke; Asaka, Tadayoshi",J Med Biol Eng,208,1

Like other terpenes, ISO is a highly volatile compound that is slightly soluble in water, so its inclusion into cyclodextrins (CDs) is an interesting approach to increase its solubility and bioavailability. Thus, our aim was to evaluate the antiedematogenic and anti-inflammatory activity of isopulegol and a β-cyclodextrin–isopulegol inclusion complex (ISO/β-CD) in rodent models. For the anti-inflammatory activity evaluation, antiedematogenic plethysmometry and acute (peritonitis and pleurisy), as well as chronic (cotton pellet-induced granuloma) anti-inflammatory models, were used. The docking procedure is used to evaluate, analyze, and predict their binding mode of interaction with H1 and Cox-2 receptors. The animals (n = 6) were divided into groups: ISO and ISO/β-CD, negative control (saline), and positive control (indomethacin and promethazine). ISO and ISO/β-CD were able to reduce acute inflammatory activity by decreasing albumin extravasation, leukocyte migration, and MPO concentration, and reducing exudate levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. ISO and ISO/β-CD significantly inhibited edematogenic activity in carrageenan- and dextran-induced paw edema. Moreover, both significantly reduced chronic inflammatory processes, given the lower weight and protein concentration of granulomas in the foreign body granulomatous inflammation model. The results suggest that the inclusion of ISO in β-cyclodextrins improves its pharmacological properties, with the histamine and prostaglandin pathways as probable mechanisms of inhibition, and also reinforces the anti-inflammatory profile of this terpene.","Ramos, Andreza Guedes Barbosa; de Menezes, Irwin Rose Alencar; da Silva, Maria Sanádia Alexandre; Torres Pessoa, Renata; de Lacerda Neto, Luiz Jardelino; Rocha Santos Passos, Fabíola; Melo Coutinho, Henrique Douglas; Iriti, Marcello; Quintans-Júnior, Lucindo José",Foods,208,1

Current therapies suppress HBV but viral rebound occurs on cessation of therapy; novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. To develop a therapeutic HBV vaccine that can induce high magnitude T cells to all major HBV antigens, we have developed a novel HBV vaccine using chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vectors encoding multiple HBV antigens. ChAd vaccine alone generated very high magnitude HBV specific T cell responses to all HBV major antigens. The inclusion of a shark Invariant (SIi) chain genetic adjuvant significantly enhanced the magnitude of T-cells against HBV antigens. Compared to ChAd alone vaccination, ChAd-prime followed by MVA-boost vaccination further enhanced the magnitude and breadth of the vaccine induced T cell response. Intra-cellular cytokine staining study showed that HBV specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were polyfunctional, producing combinations of IFNγ, TNF-α, and IL-2. In summary, we have generated genetically adjuvanted ChAd and MVA vectored HBV vaccines with the potential to induce high-magnitude T cell responses through a prime-boost therapeutic vaccination approach.

This species exhibits very limited adult movement and restriction to soft-bottom habitats but has a moderately long pelagic larval duration. Therefore, if pelagic larval duration is correlated with gene flow between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we expect a reduced level of genetic and morphological differentiation. However, if adult habitat and ecology have more effect on gene flow, we expect the populations in the two bodies of water to be more highly differentiated. We used logistic regression to compare morphological features and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to compare nucleotide sequence data. Gulf of California H. guttulata are different from Pacific populations in morphology and both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences. MtDNA shows reciprocal monophyly, and nuclear sequences from the Gulf of California formed a monophyletic group. Population genetic analyses also suggest further population subdivision within the Pacific and within the Gulf of California.

The scientific evidence indicates that physical activity is the most effective method for preventing falls among seniors. Although public health professionals often use social marketing to design and plan successful interventions, its use to promote physical activity and prevent falls among older people remains low. This article aims to provide a new systematic literature review of social marketing interventions promoting physical activity and targeting people aged 60 and over. METHODS: Following CRD’s guidance and PRISMA guidelines, we searched between January 2008 and July 2019 for relevant articles in five primary databases using predefined search and inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers analysed the selected articles to identify evidence of the seven social marketing benchmark criteria, defined by experts in the field as the common elements that contribute to social marketing success. RESULTS: The final review included nine studies. Of the studies selected, three specifically targeted over 60-year-olds, whereas the others segmented the population into several age-based subcategories, including over 60-year-olds. Eight studies highlighted positive results for the participants with an increase in participation or an increase in physical activity level. None of the nine studies selected for this systematic review implemented the entire social marketing approach. CONCLUSION: Few published interventions use the seven social marketing criteria. Further research is required to encourage uptake and inclusion in successful social marketing interventions to increase program effectiveness in this target population.","Goethals, Luc; Barth, Nathalie; Hupin, David; Mulvey, Michael S.; Roche, Frederic; Gallopel-Morvan, Karine; Bongue, Bienvenu",BMC Public Health,208,1

We assessed the clinical use of a new mobile health (mHealth) app that uses a smartphone to teach patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea–hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) to perform oropharyngeal exercises. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a pilot randomized trial to evaluate the effects of the app in patients with severe OSAHS. METHODS: Forty patients with severe OSAHS (apnea–hypoxia index [AHI]>30) were enrolled prospectively and randomized into an intervention group that used the app for 90 sessions or a control group. Anthropometric measures, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (0-24), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (0-21), Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) scores, and oxygen desaturation index were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, 28 patients remained. No significant changes were observed in the control group; however, the intervention group showed significant improvements in most metrics. AHI decreased by 53.4% from 44.7 (range 33.8-55.6) to 20.88 (14.02-27.7) events/hour (P<.001). The oxygen desaturation index decreased by 46.5% from 36.31 (27.19-43.43) to 19.4 (12.9-25.98) events/hour (P=.003). The IOPI maximum tongue score increased from 39.83 (35.32-45.2) to 59.06 (54.74-64.00) kPa (P<.001), and the IOPI maximum lip score increased from 27.89 (24.16-32.47) to 44.11 (39.5-48.8) kPa (P<.001). The AHI correlated significantly with IOPI tongue and lip improvements (Pearson correlation coefficient −0.56 and −0.46, respectively; both P<.001).

We present a health system–based intervention with diverse patient populations using readily available smartphone technology. This intervention is designed to empower patients and create partnerships between patients and their provider team to promote hypertension control. OBJECTIVE: The mGlide randomized controlled trial is a National Institutes of Health–funded study, evaluating whether a mobile health (mHealth)-based intervention that is an active partnership between interprofessional health care teams and patients results in better hypertension control rates than a state-of-clinical care comparison. METHODS: We are recruiting 450 participants including stroke survivors and primary care patients with elevated cardiovascular disease risk from diverse health systems. These systems include an acute stroke service (n=100), an academic medical center (n=150), and community medical centers including Federally Qualified Health Centers serving low-income and minority (Latino, Hmong, African American, Somali) patients (n=200). The primary aim tests the clinical effectiveness of the 6-month mHealth intervention versus standard of care. Secondary aims evaluate sustained hypertension control rates at 12 months; describe provider experiences of system usability and satisfaction; examine patient experiences, including medication adherence and medication use self-efficacy, self-rated health and quality of life, and adverse event rates; and complete a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: To date, we have randomized 107 participants (54 intervention, 53 control).

Data on SCID from developing countries are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and laboratory features of SCID diagnosed at immunology centers across India. METHODS: A detailed case proforma in an Excel format was prepared by one of the authors (PV) and was sent to centers in India that care for patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases. We collated clinical, laboratory, and molecular details of patients with clinical profile suggestive of SCID and their outcomes. Twelve (12) centers provided necessary details which were then compiled and analyzed. Diagnosis of SCID/combined immune deficiency (CID) was based on 2018 European Society for Immunodeficiencies working definition for SCID. RESULTS: We obtained data on 277 children; 254 were categorized as SCID and 23 as CID. Male-female ratio was 196:81. Median (inter-quartile range) age of onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis was 2.5 months (1, 5) and 5 months (3.5, 8), respectively.

Only 23 children (8.3%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Of these, 11 are doing well post-HSCT. Mortality was recorded in 210 children (75.8%). CONCLUSION: We document an exponential rise in number of cases diagnosed to have SCID over the last 10 years, probably as a result of increasing awareness and improvement in diagnostic facilities at various centers in India.

Unfortunately, CEnCs are not able to proliferate in vivo in the case of trauma or dystrophy. Visually impaired patients with corneal endothelial deficiencies that are waiting for transplantation due to massive global shortage of cadaveric corneal transplants are in a great need of help. In this study, our goal was to develop a defined, clinically applicable protocol for direct differentiation of CEnCs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). To produce feeder-free hPSC-CEnCs, we used small molecule induction with transforming growth factor (TGF) beta receptor inhibitor SB431542, GSK-3-specific inhibitor CHIR99021 and retinoic acid to guide differentiation through the neural crest and periocular mesenchyme (POM). Cells were characterized by the morphology and expression of human (h)CEnC markers with immunocytochemistry and RT-qPCR. After one week of induction, we observed the upregulation of POM markers paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) and Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) and polygonal-shaped cells expressing CEnC-associated markers Zona Occludens-1 (ZO-1), sodium-potassium (Na(+)/K(+))-ATPase, CD166, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (SLC4A4), aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and N-cadherin (NCAD). Furthermore, we showed that retinoic acid induced a dome formation in the cell culture, with a possible indication of fluid transport by the differentiated cells. Thus, we successfully generated CEnC-like cells from hPSCs with a defined, simple and fast differentiation method.","Grönroos, Pyry; Ilmarinen, Tanja; Skottman, Heli",Cells,208,1

The main aim of the research was to decipher the different sources of the particles. The methodology involved the ex situ sequential analysis of individual particles by three analytical techniques: scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy (MRS). The microanalysis was performed on samples of total suspended particles. Different morphologies were observed for particles rich in the same element, including prismatic, spherical, spheroidal, and irregular morphologies. The sequential microanalysis by SEM-EDS/PLM/MRS revealed that Fe-rich particles with spherical and irregular morphologies were derived from anthopogenic sources, such as emissions from the metallurgical industry and the wear of automobile parts, respectively. In contrast, Fe-rich particles with prismatic morphologies were associated with natural sources. In relation to carbon (C), the methodology was able to distinguish between the C-rich particles that came from different anthopogenic sources—such as the burning of fossil fuels, biomass, or charcoal—and the metallurgical industry. The optical properties of the Si-rich particles depended, to a greater extent, on their chemical composition than on their morphology, which made it possible to quickly and accurately differentiate aluminosilicates from quartz. The methodology demonstrated in this study was useful for performing the speciation of the particles rich in different elements. This differentiation helped to assign their possible emission sources.","Longoria-Rodríguez, Francisco E.; González, Lucy T.; Mancilla, Yasmany; Acuña-Askar, Karim; Arizpe-Zapata, Jesús Alejandro; González, Jessica; Kharissova, Oxana V.; Mendoza, Alberto",Toxics,208,1

In this work, the natural R in Sophora japonica was extracted and purified to prepare fluorescent-responding sensor systems intended to recognize copper ions with both strong selectivity as well as appropriate sensitivity. Results showed that neat R had no obvious fluorescent emission peak in PBS buffer solution. However, when R and (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (CD) were introduced within buffer solution, fluorescent emission intensity was significantly increased due to the resultant R-CD inclusion complex. In addition, the formed R-CD inclusion complex was shown to behave as the aforementioned fluorescent sensor for copper ions through a mechanism of quenched fluorescent emission intensity when R-CD became bound with copper ions. The binding constant value for R-CD with copper ions was 1.33 × 10(6), allowing for quantification of copper ions between the concentration range of 1.0 × 10(–7)–4.2 × 10(–6)mol⋅L(–1). Furthermore, the minimum detection limit was found to be 3.5 × 10(–8)mol⋅L(–1). This work showed the prepared R-CD inclusion complex was both highly selective and strongly sensitive toward copper ions, indicating that this system could be applied into various fields where copper ions are of concern.","Yang, Shilong; Sun, Lu; Song, Zhiwen; Xu, Li",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,208,1

Identifying potential drug leads that bind to SOD1 and characterizing their interactions by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is complicated by the fact that SOD1 is a homodimer. Creating a monomeric version of SOD1 could alleviate these issues. A specially designed monomeric form of human superoxide dismutase (T2M4SOD1) was cloned into E. coli and its expression significantly enhanced using a number of novel DNA sequence, leader peptide and growth condition optimizations. Uniformly (15)N-labeled T2M4SOD1 was prepared from minimal media using (15)NH(4)Cl as the (15)N source. The T2M4SOD1 monomer (both (15)N labeled and unlabeled) was correctly folded as confirmed by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy and active as confirmed by an in-gel enzymatic assay. To demonstrate the utility of this new SOD1 expression system for NMR-based drug screening, eight pyrimidine compounds were tested for binding to T2M4SOD1 by monitoring changes in their (1)H NMR and/or (19)F-NMR spectra. Weak binding to 5-fluorouridine (FUrd) was observed via line broadening, but very minimal spectral changes were seen with uridine, 5-bromouridine or trifluridine. On the other hand, (1)H-NMR spectra of T2M4SOD1 with uracil or three halogenated derivatives of uracil changed dramatically suggesting that the pyrimidine moiety is the crucial binding component of FUrd. Interestingly, no change in tryptophan 32 (Trp32), the putative receptor for FUrd, was detected in the (15)N-NMR spectra of (15)N-T2M4SOD1 when mixed with these uracil analogs. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) studies indicate that interaction with Trp32 of SOD1 is predicted to be weak and that there was hydrogen bonding with the nearby aspartate (Asp96), potentiating the Trp32-uracil interaction. These studies demonstrate that monomeric T2M4SOD1 can be readily used to explore small molecule interactions via NMR.","LeVatte, Marcia; Lipfert, Matthias; Roy, Dipankar; Kovalenko, Andriy; Wishart, David Scott",PLoS One,208,12

The electrospinning process was carried out by changing the concentration of the polymer solution, the needle diameter, and the electrospinning processing time at two rotation speeds. The average diameters of the micro- and nanofibers of the filter media produced ranged from 3.25 μm to 0.65 μm and it was possible to conclude that, as the size of the fibers decreased, the mechanical strength increased from 3.2 to 4.5 MPa. In filtration tests, a collection efficiency of up to 99% with low-pressure drops (19.4 Pa) was obtained for nanoparticles, demonstrating high quality factor filter media, which could be applicable in gas filtration.","Bonfim, Daniela P.

Therefore, the detection of C. trachomatis as well as the antimicrobial susceptibility testing becomes a priority, and, along the years, several methods have been recommended, like cell culture and direct immunofluorescence (DFA) on cell cultures. Herein, we described the application of In-Cell Western assay (ICW) via Odyssey CLx as a fast, more accessible, and high-throughput platform for the quantification of C. trachomatis and the screening of anti-chlamydial drugs. As a first step, we set up a standard curve by infecting cell monolayers with 2-fold serial dilutions of C. trachomatis Elementary Body (EB) suspension. Then, different unknown C. trachomatis EB suspensions were quantified and the chlamydial susceptibility testing to erythromycin was performed, using the DFA as comparison. Our results showed a very high concordance between these two assays, as evidenced by the enumeration of chlamydial IFUs as well as the determination of erythromycin Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC).

Hence, it is necessary to establish the causal link between vitamin C levels and PD, and further develop effective therapies or prevention. METHODS: We selected 11 newly identified plasma vitamin C genetic variants from a large-scale plasma vitamin C GWAS dataset (n = 52,018) as the effective instrumental variables, and extracted their corresponding GWAS summary statistics from PD (33,674 PD cases and 449,056 controls) and PD age at onset (AAO) (n = 28,568). We then performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to evaluate the causal association of plasma vitamin C levels with PD and PD AAO using inverse-variance weighted (IVW), the weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO test. RESULTS: We did not observe any significant association between genetically increased vitamin C levels and PD. Interestingly, we found a reduced trend of PD AAO (1.134 years) with 1 SD genetically increased vitamin C levels using IVW (beta = − 1.134, 95% CI: [− 2.515, 0.248], P = 0.108). Importantly, this trend was further successfully verified using both weighted median and MR-Egger. Each 1 SD genetically increased vitamin C levels could reduce PD AAO 1.75 and 2.592 years using weighted median (beta = − 1.750, 95% CI: [− 3.396, − 0.105], P = 0.037) and MR-Egger (beta = − 2.592, 95% CI: [− 4.623, − 0.560], P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the causal association between genetically increased plasma vitamin C levels and reduced PD AAO in people of European descent. Randomized controlled trials are required to clarify whether diet intake or supplement, or both could reduce the AAO of PD.","Liu, Haijie; Zhang, Yan; Zhang, Haihua; Wang, Longcai; Wang, Tao; Han, Zhifa; Wu, Liyong; Liu, Guiyou",J Transl Med,208,1

In this work, we further characterized the immunomodulatory activities of L. salivarius strains from wakame-fed pigs by evaluating their ability to modulate TLR3- and TLR4-mediated innate immune responses in PIE cells. Two strains with a remarkable immunomodulatory potential were selected: L. salivarius FFIG35 and FFIG58. Both strains improved IFN-β, IFN-λ and antiviral factors expression in PIE cells after TLR3 activation, which correlated with an enhanced resistance to rotavirus infection. Moreover, a model of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)/rotavirus superinfection in PIE cells was developed. Cells were more susceptible to rotavirus infection when the challenge occurred in conjunction with ETEC compared to the virus alone. However, L. salivarius FFIG35 and FFIG58 maintained their ability to enhance IFN-β, IFN-λ and antiviral factors expression in PIE cells, and to reduce rotavirus replication in the context of superinfection. We also demonstrated that FFIG35 and FFIG58 strains regulated the immune response of PIE cells to rotavirus challenge or ETEC/rotavirus superinfection through the modulation of negative regulators of the TLR signaling pathway. In vivo studies performed in mice models confirmed the ability of L. salivarius FFIG58 to beneficially modulate the innate immune response and protect against ETEC infection. The results of this work contribute to the understanding of beneficial lactobacilli interactions with epithelial cells and allow us to hypothesize that the FFIG35 or FFIG58 strains could be used for the development of highly efficient functional feed to improve immune health status and reduce the severity of intestinal infections and superinfections in weaned piglets.","Indo, Yuhki; Kitahara, Shugo; Tomokiyo, Mikado; Araki, Shota; Islam, Md.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with those diseases will most probably lead to novel therapeutics. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the Hsp90 inhibitor AUY-922 in the major inflammatory pathways of mouse lungs. Mice were treated with LPS (1.6 mg/kg) via intratracheal instillation for 24 h and were then post-treated intraperitoneally with AUY-922 (10 mg/kg). The animals were examined 48 h after AUY-922 injection. LPS activated the TLR4-mediated signaling pathways, which in turn induced the release of different inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. AUY-922 suppressed the LPS-induced inflammation by inhibiting major pro-inflammatory pathways (e.g., JAK2/STAT3, MAPKs), and downregulated the IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1 and TNFα. The expression levels of the redox regulator APE1/Ref1, as well as the DNA-damage inducible kinases ATM and ATR, were also increased after LPS treatment. Those effects were counteracted by AUY-922. Interestingly, this Hsp90 inhibitor abolished the LPS-induced pIRE1α suppression, a major component of the unfolded protein response.

However, shortcomings including health disparities persist particularly with a rapidly aging population. This has resulted in a shift in the disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases such as dementia, cancer, and diabetes. These medical conditions require long-term care, which causes an accelerating crisis for the health sector and society. The current health care system in Vietnam is unlikely to cope with these challenges. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to explore the opportunities, challenges, and necessary conditions for Vietnam in transforming toward a patient-centered care model to produce better health for people and reduce health care costs. METHODS: We examine the applicability of a personalized and integrated Bespoke Health Care System (BHS) for Vietnam using a strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat analysis and examining the successes or failures of digital health care innovations in Vietnam. We then make suggestions for successful adoption of the BHS model in Vietnam. RESULTS: The BHS model of patient-centered care empowers patients to become active participants in their own health care. Vietnam’s current policy, social, technological, and economic environment favors the transition of its health care system toward the BHS model. Nevertheless, the country is in an early stage of health care digitalization. The legal and regulatory system to protect patient privacy and information security is still lacking. The readiness to implement electronic medical records, a core element of the BHS, varies across health providers and clinical practices. The scarcity of empirical evidence and evaluation regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiatives is an obstacle to the Vietnamese government in policymaking, development, and implementation of health care digitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing a personalized and integrated health care system may help Vietnam to address health care needs, reduce pressure on the health care system and society, improve health care delivery, and promote health equity. However, in order to adopt the patient-centered care system and digitalized health care, a whole-system approach in transformation and operation with a co-design in the whole span of a digital health initiative developing process are necessary.","Dang, Thu Ha; Nguyen, Tuan Anh; Hoang Van, Minh; Santin, Olinda; Tran, Oanh Mai Thi; Schofield, Penelope",J Med Internet Res,208,1

ETEC infections in newborn, suckling, and especially in post-weaning piglets are associated with reduced growth rate, morbidity, and mortality. ETEC express virulence factors as adhesin and enterotoxins that play a central role in the pathogenic process. Adhesins associated with pigs are of diverse type being either fimbrial or non-fimbrial. Enterotoxins belong to two groups: heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST). Heterogeneity of ETEC strains encompass expression of various fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F18, and F41) and enterotoxins (LT, STa, STb, and EAST1). In the late years, attempts to immunize animals against neonatal and post-weaning diarrhea were focused on the development of anti-adhesin strategies as this is the initial step of ETEC pathogenesis. Although those vaccines demonstrated some protection against ETEC infections, as enterotoxins are pivotal to the virulence of ETEC, a new generation of vaccinal molecules, which include adhesin and one or more enterotoxins, were recently tested. Some of these newly developed chimeric fusion proteins are intended to control as well human diarrhea as enterotoxins are more or less common with the ones found in pigs. As these could not be tested in the natural host (human), either a mouse or pig model was substituted to evaluate the protection efficacy. For the advancement of pig vaccine, mice were sometimes used for preliminary testing.

After removing the effect of the synchronization of East-West sun progression with the calling activity, we used two closely related approaches to heuristically compute the chronotypes of the individuals in the dataset, to identify them as morning persons or “larks” and evening persons or “owls”. Using the computed chronotypes we showed how the chronotype is largely dependent on age with younger cohorts being more likely to be owls than older cohorts. Moreover, our analysis showed how on average females have distinctly different chronotypes from males. Younger females are more larkish than males while older females are more owlish. Finally, we also studied the period of low calling activity for each of the users which is considered as a marker of their sleep period during the night. We found that while “extreme larks” tend to sleep more than “extreme owls” on the weekends, we do not observe much variation between them on weekdays.

The myopathy in LOPD can be reversed by Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT), but might benefit from a concomitant low carbohydrate - high protein diet and aerobic exercise treatment. From 65 Late onset Pompe cases, we were able to obtain in 58 a self-reported evaluation, most of them gave a positive efficacy evaluation of Enzyme Replacement Therapy and they were classified by a self-administered scale as Responders or non-Responders. A cooperative study of a clinical group on LOPD monitored age, sex, BMI, Gardner-Medwin-Walton scale and six minute walking test (6MWT). The only clinical parameters that were significantly associated with a Responder category were the pre-ERT walking distance (p<0.035) and the use of regular diet, exercise or both (p<0.029).

The sputum fluid phase has several candidate proteins including mucins which have the potential of being therapeutic targets, but has not yet been explored in-depth. This study aimed at exploring the profile of sputum proteins in various airway diseases. METHODS: Sputum from thirty-one patients with various airway diseases was collected and the fluid phase analyzed by LC-MS/MS and subsequently by sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragments ion spectra (SWATH) (n = 15) for protein quantitation. Hierarchical clustering and functional grouping were performed. RESULTS: A total of 185 proteins were quantitated by SWATH of which 21 proteins were identified which could distinguish between the clinical phenotypes by hierarchical clustering. Functional protein clustering revealed 4 groups: those that are inflammation related, oxidative stress related, mucin related and a cytoskeletal and calcium related group. The levels of eight proteins (Azurocidin1, Neutrophil defensin 3, Lactotransferrin, Calmodulin 3, Coronin1A, Mucin 5B, Mucin 5AC and BPI fold containing family B1) were significantly altered (relative to mean) in exacerbator prone subjects compared to nonexacerbators. Another simple but useful metric which emerged from this study was total protein concentration in sputum which was significantly higher in frequent exacerbators. CONCLUSION: Sputum proteins can detect the various airway disease clinical phenotypes. Total protein concentration and eight other proteins are biomarkers for frequent exacerbators. The clinical and therapeutic implications of the functional groups of proteins need further evaluation.","Dasgupta, Angira; Chakraborty, Rahul; Saha, Bodhisattwa; Suri, Himanshi; Singh, Praveen; Raj, Anurag; Taneja, Bhupesh; Dash, Debasis; Sengupta, Shantanu; Agrawal, Anurag",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,208,1

The aim of this study is to assess the water quality parameters of basic water services in Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia as well as the role and importance of local managerial committees in ensuring basic water functionality. METHODS: This mixed methods research, conducted in January-June 2019, sampled 22 districts from food-insecure areas in the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia. From the 22 districts, which represent nearly one third of all districts in each region, 111 water services classified as “basic” were randomly selected. For each selected water service, research included: water quality sample testing, visual observation of water services, interviews and focus group discussions with the associated water managerial committee members. Descriptive statistics frequency, percent, mean, median, standard deviations, normal tables, cross-tables and graphs are used to present the data. RESULTS: Although the international water standard for thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels is 0 CFU/100ml, in our sample of 111 water services, the maximum TTC counts were 71 CFU/100 ml and the mean was 4 CFU/100 ml. Thermotolerant coliform counts were above the permissible standard values for nearly 40% (n = 111) of the basic water services. TTC was detected in 44 (39.64%) (n = 111) basic water services. Of these, 38 (34.23%) were operationally functional while 6 (5.41%) were not functional. Approximately one third of the basic water services sampled, deemed “functional” by international standards, do not provide potable water due to thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings from the Amhara and Afar regions of Ethiopia demonstrate that water quality parameters are not currently considered in classifying basic water services. This suggests that international efforts to address SDG 6 should incorporate water quality as a key parameter to better track international progress toward “clean water and sanitation” efforts. We discuss two potential pathways for stronger inclusion of water quality parameters in international definitions: (1) to mandate water quality within “functional” and “non-functional” definitions or (2) to add a ladder rung titled “safe basic water services” to the international drinking water ladder. Our findings from Ethiopia suggest that additional research should be undertaken in development contexts to assess whether or not “functional” basic water services provide safe drinking water to users.","Gemeda, Shibabaw Tadesse; Springer, Emily; Gari, Sirak Robele; Birhan, Solomon Melake; Bedane, Hailu Tolasa",PLoS One,208,1

It causes termination of drug candidates in clinical trials and also the retractions of approved drugs from the market. Thus, it is essential to identify hepatotoxic compounds in the initial stages of drug development process. The purpose of this study is to construct quantitative structure activity relationship models using machine learning algorithms and systematical feature selection methods for molecular descriptor sets. The models were built from a large and diverse set of 1253 drug compounds and were validated internally with 10-fold cross-validation. In this study, we applied a variety of feature selection techniques to extract the optimal subset of descriptors as modeling features to improve the prediction performance. Experimental results suggested that the support vector machine-based classifier had achieved a better classification accuracy with reduced molecular descriptors. The final optimal model provides an accuracy of 0.811, a sensitivity of 0.840, a specificity of 0.783 and Mathew’s correlation coefficient of 0.623 with an internal validation set. Furthermore, this model outperformed the prior studies while evaluated in both the internal and external test sets.

As well as antithrombotic effects, anti-inflammatory effects may contribute to this beneficial clinical outcome. Here we aimed to identify potential anti-inflammatory effects of P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers on monocytes and macrophages. Using flow cytometry, migration assays, flow chambers and RNA microarrays, we investigated the effects of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers on blood monocytes, THP-1 monocytes and THP-1 monocytes after differentiation to macrophages. P(2)Y(12) -expressing platelets can form aggregates with monocytes in circulating blood. Mediated by platelets, ADP results in activation of the integrin receptor Mac-1 on blood monocytes, as detected by the conformation-specific single-chain antibody MAN-1. Via the same association with platelets, THP-1 monocyte adhesion to the endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is induced by ADP. P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers prevent these ADP effects on monocytes. Interestingly, in contrast to THP-1 monocytes, THP-1 monocytes, after differentiation to macrophages, directly expressed the P(2)Y(12) receptor and consequently ADP was found to be a potent chemoattractant. Again, P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers antagonised this effect. Accordingly, stimulation of THP-1 macrophages with ADP caused a substantial change in gene expression pattern and upregulation of several genes associated with inflammation and atherogenesis. These data establish novel anti-inflammatory effects of P(2)Y(12) receptor blockers on monocytes and macrophages, which are expected to contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction.","Siegel, Patrick M.; Sander, Laura; Fricke, Alba; Stamm, Johannes; Wang, Xiaowei; Sharma, Prerna; Bassler, Nicole; Ying, Ya-Lan; Olivier, Christoph B.; Eisenhardt, Steffen U.; Bode, Christoph; Ahrens, Ingo; Diehl, Philipp; Peter, Karlheinz",Sci Rep,208,1

METHODS: Twenty-four adults visited the laboratory twice to quantify this early phase of desaturation during vascular occlusion tests (VOT) while in a rested state. The second visit included a sustained handgrip task at 25% of maximal muscular strength until task failure. At failure, a post-task VOT was initiated. Muscle desaturation was defined as StO(2) and collected by a near-infrared spectroscopy device. The muscle size and adipose thickness were determined via ultrasonography. Linear regression was used to quantify the rates of desaturation during the VOTs as well as during the fatiguing handgrip. RESULTS: There were sex differences in the rate of desaturation pre- and post-handgrip, such that independent of fatigue, the men (p < 0.001) desaturated more rapidly than the women (pre: b = − 0.208 vs. − 0.123%∙s(−1); post: − 0.079 vs. − 0.070%∙s(−1)). During the fatiguing handgrip, the transformed StO(2) values indicated that the males desaturated more rapidly than the females (b = − 0.070 vs. − 0.015). The matched pairs exhibited the same responses as the total sample. CONCLUSION: Overall, muscle size and strength as well as adipose tissue were likely not the primary cause of the differences in rates of muscle desaturation. We hypothesized that differences in fiber type and mitochondria were the principle mechanisms provoking the differences in muscle oxygenation.","Keller, Joshua L.; Kennedy, Katie G.",Eur J Appl Physiol,208,1

In terms of size, Bogura is equivalent to most of the major cities in Bangladesh, yet no thermal and ecological assessment has ever been conducted here. This study uses multitemporal Landsat satellite images between 2001 and 2020 to investigate the thermal and ecological conditions of Bogura Sadar (sub-district). Land surface temperature (LST) is obtained from Landsat images using the widely used radiative transfer equation. The thermal and ecological conditions are evaluated by computing urban heat island (UHI) and urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) from LST data. The influence of vegetation, built-area, water-body, and bare soil on LST are examined using land cover indices through pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis. According to the findings of this sub-district-scale (urban and rural areas) study, the mean LST has increased by 0.62 °C in the last 20 years. As per local administrative-wise findings, LST has increased in most areas, regardless of their urban or rural function. The difference between the urban area and the rest of the surroundings was significant (1.74 °C) in 2020. In 2001, UHI affected area was 5.65 km(2), which expanded to 8.84 km(2) in 2020. Thermal and ecological conditions are worse in urban areas than its surrounding areas. The regression models of the LST and land cover indices could explain more than half (R(2): 0.66 to 0.73) of LST variation over the years. Land cover could explain the LST in 2020 to the least extent implying that anthropogenic activities have greater influence than earlier. Land cover could explain less than half of the LST variation in the urban area.","Abir, Farhan Asaf; Ahmmed, Sabbir; Sarker, Soykot Hossain; Fahim, Ashraf Uddin",Heliyon,208,1

However, transforming the data in a way that preserves the privacy of subjects while maintaining a high degree of data quality is challenging and particularly difficult when processing complex datasets that contain a high number of attributes. In this article we present how we extended the open source software ARX to improve its support for high-dimensional, biomedical datasets. FINDINGS: For improving ARX's capability to find optimal transformations when processing high-dimensional data, we implement 2 novel search algorithms. The first is a greedy top-down approach and is oriented on a formally implemented bottom-up search. The second is based on a genetic algorithm. We evaluated the algorithms with different datasets, transformation methods, and privacy models. The novel algorithms mostly outperformed the previously implemented bottom-up search. In addition, we extended the GUI to provide a high degree of usability and performance when working with high-dimensional datasets. CONCLUSION: With our additions we have significantly enhanced ARX's ability to handle high-dimensional data in terms of processing performance as well as usability and thus can further facilitate data sharing.","Meurers, Thierry; Bild, Raffael; Do, Kieu-Mi; Prasser, Fabian",Gigascience,208,1

In this study, we designed a novel multi-antigen subunit vaccine which can induce innate, humoral and cellular immune responses. Alpha hemolysin, enterotoxins A and B were selected as protective antigens for combining into a triple antigen chimeric protein (HAB). Immunoinformatics analysis predicted HAB protein as a suitable vaccine candidate for inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Tertiary structure of the HAB protein was predicted and validated through computational approaches. Docking studies were performed between the HAB protein and mice TLR2 receptor. Furthermore, we constructed and generated recombinant HAB (r-HAB) protein in E. coli and studied its toxicity, immunogenicity and protective efficacy in a mouse model. Triple antigen chimeric protein (r-HAB) was found to be highly immunogenic in mouse as the anti-r-HAB hyperimmune serum was strongly reactive to all three native exotoxins on Western blot. In vitro toxin neutralization assay using anti-r-HAB antibodies demonstrated > 75% neutralization of toxins on RAW 264.7 cell line. Active immunization with r-HAB toxoid gave ~ 83% protection against 2 × lethal dosage of secreted exotoxins. The protection was mediated by induction of strong antibody responses that neutralized the toxins. Passive immunization with anti-r-HAB antibodies gave ~ 50% protection from lethal challenge. In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo testing of r-HAB found the molecule to be nontoxic, highly immunogenic and induced excellent protection towards native toxins in actively immunized and partial protection to passively immunized mice groups. KEY POINTS: • HAB protein was computationally designed to induce humoral and cellular responses. • r-HAB protein was found to be nontoxic, immunogenic and protective in mouse model. • r-HAB conferred protection against lethal challenge in active and passive immunization.","Kota, Rohini Krishna; Kolla, Harish Babu; Reddy, Prakash Narayana; Kalagatur, Naveen Kumar; Samudrala, Siva Kumar",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,208,1

The cumulative incidence of pulmonary problems after childhood cancer increases with time since diagnosis, as with other late-effects, suggesting that survivors are at an elevated risk of developing later-onset pulmonary morbidities as they age.","Henderson, Tara O.",Handbook of Long Term Care of The Childhood Cancer Survivor,208,19

Fungal pathogens are proved to be a common and popular contaminant of agroecosystem that approximately causes 70–80% of total microbial crop loss. To meet the proper global increasing need of food products as a result of population explosion, managing agricultural system in an eco-friendly and profitable manner is the prime target; thus the word “sustainable agriculture” plays it part, and this package is highly effective when coupled with nature-derived fungicidal products that can minimize the event of fungal infections in agrarian ecosystem. Present study enlists the most common and effective natural products that might be of plant or microbial origin, their mode of action, day-by-day development of phytopathogenic resistance against the prevailing fungicides, and also their role in maintenance of sustainability of agricultural practices with special emphasis on their acceptance over the synthetic or chemical one. A large number of bioactive compounds ranging from direct plant (both cryptogams algae and moss and phanerogams)-derived natural extracts, essential oil of aromatic plants, and low-molecular-weight antimicrobial compounds known as phytoalexins to secondary metabolites that are both volatile and nonvolatile organic compounds of microbes (fungal and actinobacterial members) residing inside the host tissue, called endophyte, are widely used as agricultural bioweapons. The rhizospheric partners of plant, mycorrhizae, are also a prime agent of this chemical warfare and protect their green partners from fungal invaders and emphasize the concept of “sustainable agriculture.”","Santra, Hiran Kanti; Banerjee, Debdulal",Natural Bioactive Products in Sustainable Agriculture,208,31

To document these healthcare professionals’ experiences during the pandemic, we used social media and professional networks to disseminate an electronic survey with closed- and open-ended questions to a convenience sample of long-term care staff from May 11 through June 4, 2020. Four investigators identified themes from qualitative responses for 152 nursing home staff respondents from 32 states. Key themes included: constraints on personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing; burdensome regulations and guidance; concern for self, family, and residents; workforce burnout; organizational communication and teamwork; and public lack of recognition. Respondents described ongoing constraints on testing, and reliance on crisis standards for extended use and reuse of PPE. Administrators discussed implementing sometimes confusing or contradictory guidance from numerous agencies. Direct-care staff expressed fears of infecting themselves and their families, and expressed empathy and concern for their residents. They described burnout due to increased workloads and the emotional burden of caring for residents facing isolation, illness, and death. Respondents cited the presence or lack of organizational communication and teamwork as factors influencing their ability to work under challenging circumstances. They also described the demoralizing impact of negative media coverage of nursing homes, contrasting this with the heroic public recognition given to hospital staff. These challenges added significant burden to an already strained workforce and are likely to contribute to increased burnout, turnover, and staff shortages in the long-term.","White, Elizabeth; Wetle, Terrie; Reddy, Ann; Baier, Rosa",Innov Aging,208,5

The goal of this narrative review is a critical reappraisal of the present knowledge of microcirculation monitoring, mainly focused on the videomicroscopic evaluation of sublingual microcirculation in critically ill patients. We discuss the technological developments in handheld videomicroscopy, which have resulted in adequate tools for the bedside monitoring of microcirculation. By means of these techniques, a large body of evidence has been acquired about the role of microcirculation in the pathophysiological mechanisms of shock, especially septic shock. We review the characteristics of sublingual microcirculation in septic shock, which mainly consist in a decrease in the perfused vascular density secondary to a reduction in the proportion of perfused vessels along with a high heterogeneity in perfusion. Even in patients with high cardiac output, red blood cell velocity is decreased. Thus, hyperdynamic flow is absent in the septic microcirculation. We also discuss the dissociation between microcirculation and systemic hemodynamics, particularly after shock resuscitation, and the different behavior among microvascular beds. In addition, we briefly comment the effects of some treatments on microcirculation. Despite the fact that sublingual microcirculation arises as a valuable goal for the resuscitation in critically ill patients, significant barriers remain present for its clinical application. Most of them are related to difficulties in video acquisition and analysis. We comprehensively analyzed these shortcomings. Unfortunately, a simpler approach, such as the central venous minus arterial PCO(2) difference, is a misleading surrogate for sublingual microcirculation. As conclusion, the monitoring of sublingual microcirculation is an appealing method for monitoring critically ill patients. Nevertheless, the lack of controlled studies showing benefits in terms of outcome, as well as technical limitations for its clinical implementation, render this technique mainly as a research tool.","Dubin, Arnaldo; Kanoore Edul, Vanina Siham; Caminos Eguillor, Juan Francisco; Ferrara, Gonzalo",Vasc Health Risk Manag,208,20

Passenger-specific area (PSA) is used as a QoS measure which is determined by considering passenger activities separately. As passengers perform various activities on the same platform space, there is a need to evaluate BRT platform QoS by considering the activities collectively. When evaluating transit station platforms, many researchers calculated PSA for the whole platform area, while very few researchers highlighted the importance of evaluating the platform as small, partitioned areas. By considering these findings and gaps in the literature, this study evaluates QoS of the platform on a cell by cell basis using PSA. We use time–space analysis and passenger-minutes of each activity to develop a methodology to determine PSA, by considering stationary passengers, circulating passengers, and passengers overall. To evaluate platform QoS, we define threshold service levels using passenger-minutes of activities and Fruin’s QoS criteria. For the case study BRT station, we find that PSA varies significantly between platform cells. It is evident from the results that it is important to identify highly congested areas in the platform and apply measures to improve platform QoS.","Jayatilake, Sewmini; Bunker, Jonathan M.; Bhaskar, Ashish; Miska, Marc",Public Transp,208,22

For example, is populism a monolithic phenomenon, or does the label cover multiple kinds of political movements which share some common elements, perhaps only superficially? Is populism an essential element of democracies, even sometimes a virtue of such governments, or does its invocation of a monolithic demos (‘the people’) signify a fundamentally anti-democratic worldview? And what about the interaction between truth, democracy, and journalistic integrity in the context of populist politics? While the history of anti-democratic advocacy (famously illustrated by Plato) has often highlighted the tendency of democratic politics to prioritize popularity over truth, the development of social media—and evolving norms of journalistic communication and public political discourse—raise these worries in new forms. Are democracies even any more effective than other forms of government at revealing truth or effectively addressing its implications through policies?

Crises in the last decade which affected the Union and its citizens concerned, inter alia, public finance (the financial crisis, 2008), migration (2014), public health (the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020) and the rule of law crisis (2018). This paper focus on the latter. It has been noted that some Member States have been happy to receive the benefits of EU membership, specifically the financial ones, while their commitment to European values, including the rule of law (Article 2 TEU), has been lacking. Since many instruments applied by EU institutions to improve this situation have proved rather insufficient, halting transfers of EU funds to these recalcitrant Member States has been touted as the way that might solve this crisis. Accordingly, a draft regulation was put on the table that authorised the EU institutions to suspend EU funds if a Member State is found to be in breach of the rule of law. This draft aimed to make the transfer of EU funds to the Member States conditional upon their continuous respect for the rule of law (and therefore became known as ‘the rule of law conditionality’). This paper comments on this draft as first proposed by the Commission in 2018 (Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the Union budget in the event of generalized gaps in the rule of law in the Member States [COM (2018) 324 final).], amended in 2019 by the European Parliament [European Parliament legislative resolution of 4 April 2019 on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of the Union's budget in case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States (COM(2018)0324–C8-0178/2018–2018/0136(COD)); https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/seance_pleniere/textes_adoptes/provisoire/2019/04-04/0349/P8_TA-PROV(2019)0349_EN.pdf.

The global economy of knowledge is structured around epistemic inequalities, hegemonies, and dominations. A clear division of scientific practices has developed among academic “peripheries,” “semi-peripheries,” and “core.” The question of epistemic injustice, which includes the indigenization of knowledge, was posed very early in the twentieth century in China, Japan, and Korea without being linked to coloniality, which was the case in Indian sociology. Based on the production of an epistemology shared with Chinese sociologists, we proposed a Post-Western sociology to enable a dialogue—on a level footing—addressing common concepts. This sociology also addresses concepts situated in European and Asian theories that consider the modes of creating continuities and discontinuities as well as the conjunctions and disjunctions between the knowledge spaces situated in different social contexts. We aim to fill the gaps between these social contexts. We will describe an ecology of knowledge in the Western-West, the non-Western-West, the semi-Western West, the Western East, the Eastern East, and the re-Easternized East situated on an epistemological continuum. While Chinese sociology has constantly oscillated between indigenization and universalism, and while epistemic autonomies are diverse, Chinese sociologists agree that Western sociologies should not be considered hostile to Chinese sociology. We will offer a definition of Post-Western sociology and demonstrate how it can be theoretically and methodologically applied. We will then identify some transnational theories, theoretical discontinuities and continuities, and common knowledge situated in Western and non-Western contexts.","Roulleau-Berger, Laurence",J,208,0

This issue has become increasingly prominent in the context of a global lockdown resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. This paper examines the dilemma through the lens of the “bond” between seafarers and the shipping companies they service, a term used to reflect the need to recognise, consent and integrate into management systems, safety culture, and organizational values. The value of this bond concept is investigated in a survey of Chinese crews (N = 318). The paper aims to reveal the features and underlying factors of the bond, and its influence on needs, perceptions and seafaring careers in foreign shipping companies. The study finds that the majority of respondents do not have a bond with their shipping company, but typically do wish to develop one. Furthermore, this form of attachment appears to be closely related to career satisfaction and retention. To address the shortage of junior seafarers in China, we call for the development of mutual trust, respect and shared values between global seafarers and international shipping companies.

With regard to gene expression profiles, no differences between the cell models were observed concerning metal homeostasis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, confirming the known MoA of CuO NP, i.e., endocytotic particle uptake, intracellular particle dissolution within lysosomes with subsequent metal ion deliberation, increased oxidative stress, and genotoxicity. However, applying a co-culture of epithelial and macrophage-like cells, CuO NP additionally provoked a pro-inflammatory response involving NLRP3 inflammasome and pro-inflammatory transcription factor activation. This study demonstrates that the application of this easy-to-use advanced in vitro model is able to extend the detection of cellular effects provoked by nanomaterials by an immunological response and emphasizes the use of such models to address a more comprehensive MoA.","Hufnagel, Matthias; Neuberger, Ronja; Wall, Johanna; Link, Martin; Friesen, Alexandra; Hartwig, Andrea",Int J Mol Sci,208,22

To prepare the conductive specimens, PU nanofiber-web, 1 wt% of AgNW dispersion in ethanol, and two types of PDMS precursors were used. A total of four specimens were prepared: Specimen A (The AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), Specimen AH (The heat-treated AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), Specimen AP (The PDMS-coated AgNW/PU nanofiber-web), and Specimen AHP (The heat-treated AgNW/PDMS/PU nanofiber-web). The specimen was rinsed and dehydrated after laundering under the conditions according to ISO 6330. To investigate the changes of porosity after a single washing cycle, mean pore diameter and pore size distribution were measured. Linear electrical resistance and microscopic surface view of the specimen were evaluated. As a result, many micro-pores were distributed in Specimen AH because of the heat treatment. After laundering, Specimen AH still had the micro-pores, and thus, the heat treatment improved the durability to laundering. Also, the electrical resistance of Specimen AH was only changed slightly even after laundering, which was because the heat treatment strengthened the bonding between the nanofibers and the silver nanowires, thus the silver nanowires sufficiently remained on the specimen surface even after laundering. And, Specimen AH showed that the silver nanowires formed a network even after laundering and were evenly covered with silver nanowires onto the specimen surface. This result affected the aforementioned electrical performance, and in fact, the electrical resistance of Specimen AH was the lowest regardless of laundering. However, it was impossible to measure the porosity of Specimen AP and Specimen AHP due to the PDMS coating. Therefore, the heat treatment affected the durability to laundering as well as the electrical conductivity to increase, but PDMS coating blocked the micro-pores of the nanofiber-web and enabled higher initial resistance.","Lee, Eugene; Cha, Sujin; Cho, Gilsoo",Fibers Polym,208,16

In the setting of a systemic infection these features can induce misleading surgical diagnostics. Our aim was to investigate characteristics of abdominal pain in COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and liver injury. METHODS: Data of all COVID-19 hospitalized patients over 16 years old were retrieved from the beginning of the epidemic in Switzerland until end of June 2020. Patients admitted exclusively for other pathologies (including surgical abdominal conditions) and/or recovered from COVID-19, and pregnant women were excluded. Abdominal pain was linked to COVID-19 only after evident alternative diagnostic exclusion. Five times the upper limit of transaminases was considered as liver injury. RESULTS: Among the 1026 patients who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 199 (19.4%) exhibited spontaneous abdominal pain and 165 (16.2%) after abdomen palpation. Systematized abdominal pain was most frequently localized in the epigastric (39.8%) and upper right quadrant (23.7%). Considering baseline ALT levels, 7.14% of patients with epigastric pain had pathological ALT value versus 0.29% of patients without symptoms (p = 0.008). When taking the 30days maximal transaminases value, this reached respectively 16.3% versus 2.7% (p < 0.001) and 20% versus 3.8% (p < 0.001) for respectively AST and ALT. With logistic regression we demonstrated that baseline pathological AST value was associated with hospital mortality and/or admission to intensive/intermediate care unit with an odds ratio of 13.9 (CI 1.5-124.7, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that COVID-19-induced abdominal pain is associated with liver injury which could predict poor evolution of disease.","Balaphas, A; Gkoufa, K; Colucci, N; Perdikis, K -C; Gaudet-Blavignac, C; Lovis, C; Goossens, N; Toso, C",Br J Surg,208,31

It is a function of myriad factors – death rate, cases requiring hospitalization, quality of care, and discharge policies, among others. India’s recovery rate is growing steadily from an earlier low of 10% to 11%. It is imperative to understand the determinants of recovery rate in a country to enable improvements in the same. MATERIAL AND METHODS: COVID-19 data have been compiled from several sources, including the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, National Disaster Management Authority, and Indian Council of Medical Research and demographic and health data from Census of India, 2011, National Health Profile, 2019, and were used. The study uses linear regression to understand the relationship between recovery rate and development indicators in India. RESULTS: Our analysis emphasizes the beneficial impacts of the health system and better economy on the recovery rate. Investment in health, urban stay, non-slum and non-poor population, and effective governance is instrumental in improving recovery rate. CONCLUSION: Scaling up health facilities and medical infrastructure, slum decongestion, focus on economically weaker sections, capacity building of health workers and ameliorating long-term investments in health, health research, and better quality of living are also essential to address recovery of COVID-19.","Singh, Akancha; Chattopadhyay, Aparajita",Indian J Med Sci,208,22

Recent promising work has demonstrated patient-physician racial concordance in populations of colour as a potential area of focus for addressing health inequities for diverse communities. The impact of shared cultural experiences and cultural competency leads to mutual respect, trust, and improved communication between patients and physicians guiding their care. This approach is dependent on the availability of physicians of colour and similarly other healthcare providers. The Temerty Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto has attempted to address the deficit in its own community through a two-pronged approach: mentorship through the Community of Support (COS) and the Summer Mentorship Program (SMP), and the implementation of the Black Student Application Program (BSAP). These initiatives have significantly increased Black medical student representation and continue to have considerable impact on Black communities in the surrounding area. Through partnerships with community organizations that support the ethos of these programs, the vision of a more culturally diverse physician workforce in Canada has been reinforced. The adoption of similar programs across Canadian medical schools can lead to better representation within medicine and help contribute to a necessary culture shift within the ranks of medical institutions. These are critical steps in laying the foundation for a medical education grounded in equity, excellence, and strength in diversity, and a healthcare system that truly provides patient-centred care.","Saddler, Nelson; Adams, Seana; Robinson, Lisa A.; Okafor, Ike",Can,208,1

SUMMARY ANSWER: High levels of psychological distress among infertile patients have been found during the COVID-19 pandemic, greater than that reported in the general population. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Preliminary research on the negative consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health evidenced heightened levels of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress in some clinical populations as well as in community samples. However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on psychological distress of infertile patients who have been forced to suspend infertility treatment and postpone parenthood goals during the pandemic. The aim of this meta-analytic review is to summarize extant literature on the prevalence of psychological distress symptoms in infertile patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines on PsycInfo, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, MedRxiv from March 2020 to mid-December 2020. Study inclusion criteria were specified according to the PICOS guideline. All naturalistic or RCT studies published in 2020 that examined infertility as the primary diagnosis and had a quantitative measurement of distress, were eligible. The primary outcomes were symptoms of psychological distress and secondary outcomes were indicators of psychological health. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The database search identified 144 papers. Two reviewers independently screened potential studies by title and abstracts based on the inclusion criteria. The full texts were then screened for eligibility. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to judge the methodological quality of the studies. In order to estimate the pooled prevalence of distress, Odds Ratios with 95% Confidence Interval were calculated as the effect size by using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was tested using I(2) statistics. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were summarized for the systematic review (N = 6473). Only six studies did not include males although, in the surveys, females made up 92% of the total sample. Ten studies adopted a cross-sectional study design. 100% gathered data through an online survey. Nine studies showed a high risk of bias, and five had a moderate risk. Review results showed that 56,4% of patients wished to resume treatment; participants were mostly worried about the delay in treatment because of their age (>35 years) or diminished ovarian reserve, or money constraints and low education level. Only five studies examined the role of protective factors such as social support, coping, optimism trait and intolerance of uncertainty. Nine studies were included for meta-analysis. The prevalence of psychological distress was 0.58 (95% CI 0.32÷0.84). The pooled point estimates of prevalence for anxiety (N = 6) were 0.56 (95% CI 0.24÷0.88), whereas the prevalence for depression (N = 5) was 0.46 (95% CI 0.15÷0.77). There was significant heterogeneity among studies to estimate the prevalence (I² ranging from 99% to 100%). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results are preliminary, given the small number of studies and their cross-sectional data. The risk of bias was high or moderate across studies. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Infertile couples reported high levels of distress due to cancellation of their diagnostic procedures or treatment; they would benefit from information, appropriate support and advice from healthcare professionals, with an important role in maintaining the wishes of infertile couples to continue their parenthood goals.

Imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a multiplex imaging method recently introduced, can measure up to 100 markers simultaneously in one tissue section by using a high-resolution laser with a mass cytometer. However, due to its high resolution and large number of channels, how to process and interpret the image data from IMC remains a key challenge to its further applications. Accurate and reliable single cell segmentation is the first and a critical step to process IMC image data. Unfortunately, existing segmentation pipelines either produce inaccurate cell segmentation results or require manual annotation, which is very time consuming. Here, we developed Dice-XMBD, a Deep learnIng-based Cell sEgmentation algorithm for tissue multiplexed imaging data. In comparison with other state-of-the-art cell segmentation methods currently used for IMC images, Dice-XMBD generates more accurate single cell masks efficiently on IMC images produced with different nuclear, membrane, and cytoplasm markers.

Insulin resistance is a metabolic disorder that was regarded as an indicator of chronic systemic inflammation. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of insulin resistance on the occurrence of R-DWILs in ICH. Methods Patients with primary ICH within 14 days after onset were prospectively enrolled from November 2017 to October 2019. R-DWILs was defined as remote focal hyperintensity from the hematoma in DWI, with corresponding hypointensity in apparent diffusion coefficient. The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used for insulin resistance estimation and calculated as fasting insulin (μU/ml) × fasting glucose (mmol/L)/22.5. Patients in our cohort were divided into four groups according to HOMA-IR index quartiles. Logistic regression analysis and smoothing plots were used to evaluate the association of HOMA-IR with R-DWIL occurrence. Sensitivity analysis was performed in non-diabetic patients, non-obese patients, hypertensive ICH patients, and patients 60 years and older separately. The association between HOMA-IR and systemic inflammatory immune indices neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) was examined with multiple linear regression analysis. Results Among the 345 patients, 54 (15.7%) had R-DWILs. Both the third and fourth quartiles of HOMA-IR index were robustly associated with an increased risk of R-DWIL occurrence (adjusted OR 3.58, 95% CI 1.33-9.65; adjusted OR 3.91, 95%CI 1.47-10.41) when compared with the first quartile. The association was consistent in non-diabetic, non-obese, hypertensive ICH patients, as well as in patients 60 years and older. Furthermore, both NLR and MLR were independently associated with HOMA-IR. Conclusions Our study suggested that insulin resistance evaluated with HOMA-IR index was independently associated with the presence of R-DWILs in patients with acute and subacute primary ICH. It may provide new insights into the metabolism-related brain injury after ICH ictus.","Ye, Xiang-Hua; Zhang, Jian-Li; Jin, Yu-Jia; Shen, Dan; Hao, Xiao-di; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhong, Jia-Wei; Jin, Lu-Hang; Tong, Lu-Sha; Gao, Feng",Frontiers in immunology,208,19

METHODS The participants in this study were 200 consecutive patients who underwent RARP. These patients were categorized into unilateral and bilateral NS groups and the non-NS group. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life (QOL) index, frequency-volume chart, uroflowmetry, 1-h pad test, and the 5-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire were evaluated before and after RARP. RESULTS The total IPSS score was significantly lower in the unilateral (P = 0.03) and bilateral NS groups (P = 0.03) than in the non-NS group after RARP. Diurnal maximum voided volume (MVV) values were significantly greater in the bilateral NS group than in the non-NS group after RARP (P = 0.002). Nocturnal frequency was significantly decreased in the unilateral NS group than in the non-NS group after RARP (3 months P = 0.01, 12 months P = 0.01). Erectile function was significantly better in both the unilateral NS group (P < 0.0001) and the bilateral NS group (P = 0.02) than in the non-NS group 12 months after RARP. CONCLUSIONS The NS procedure in RARP has the possibility to improve not only erectile function, but also LUTS, owing to both the increase of MVV and the decrease of nocturia. Therefore, the NS procedure is also recommended from the viewpoint of early improvement of LUTS and lower urinary tract dysfunction after RARP.","Haga, Nobuhiro; Hata, Junya; Matsuoka, Kanako; Koguchi, Tomoyuki; Akaihata, Hidenori; Kataoka, Masao; Sato, Yuichi; Ogawa, Soichiro; Ishibashi, Kei; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",Neurourology and urodynamics,208,8

Given that psychological therapies, such as mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), are often delivered in conjunction with concomitant analgesic drug therapies (CADTs), this systematic scoping review examines the evidence for any interactions between MBIs and CADTs. The protocol for this review has been published and registered. MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched until July 2019. We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy of MBIs for the treatment of chronic pain. A total of 40 randomized controlled trials (2978 participants) were included. Thirty-nine of 40 (97.5%) included mindfulness-based clinical trials allowed the use of CADTs. However, only 6 of these 39 (15.4%) trials provided adequate details of what these CADTs were, and only 4 (10.3%) trials controlled for CADTs. Of great relevance to this review, none of the included trials analyzed the interactions between MBIs and the CADTs to determine whether they have an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effect on chronic pain. Adverse events were inconsistently reported, and no judgment could be made about safety. Future trials assessing the interactions between MBIs and CADTs, with better harms reporting, are needed to better define the role of MBIs in the management of chronic pain.","Park, Rex; Mohiuddin, Mohammed; Poulin, Patricia A; Salomons, Tim; Edwards, Robert; Nathan, Howard; Haley, Chris; Gilron, Ian",Pain reports,208,1

To evaluate the effect of overexpression of chemokines on RABV infection, chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), RANTES, and IP-10 were individually cloned into the genome of attenuated RABV strain HEP-Flury. These recombinant RABVs were characterized in vitro for growth properties and expression of chemokines. It was found that all the recombinant viruses grew as well as the parent virus, and each of the viruses expressed the intended chemokine in a dose-dependent manner. When these viruses were evaluated for pathogenicity in the mouse model, it was found that overexpression of MIP-1alpha further decreased RABV pathogenicity by inducing a transient innate immune response. In contrast, overexpression of RANTES or IP-10 increased RABV pathogenicity by causing neurological diseases, which is due to persistent and high-level expression of chemokines, excessive infiltration and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the central nervous system, and severe enhancement of blood-brain barrier permeability. These studies indicate that overexpression of chemokines, although important in controlling virus infection, may not always be beneficial to the host.","Zhao, Ling; Toriumi, Harufusa; Kuang, Yi; Chen, Huanchun; Fu, Zhen F",Journal of virology,208,31

In this paper, we present MommiNet-v2, with improved network architecture and performance. Novel high-resolution network (HRNet)-based architectures are proposed to learn the symmetry and geometry constraints, to fully aggregate the information from all views for accurate mass detection.

In this review, we highlight what is known about the risk of transmission within healthcare facilities and discuss interventions to halt its transmission within healthcare. RECENT FINDINGS MERS-CoV causes a wide range of infections from asymptomatic infections, mild or moderately symptomatic cases, to fatal disease. Two years after the initial reported case, MERS-CoV has caused limited disease outside the Arabian Peninsula with several cases in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Epidemiologically, these infections are linked to exposures from the region and their diagnosis outside is related to travel. Several reported clusters of disease report multiple transmissions of MERS-CoV within healthcare settings that have been attributed to poor compliance with the basic infection control measures. Factors contributing to the spread and control of MERS-CoV within healthcare settings have not been elucidated so far. Data suggest the overcrowding, late recognition of MERS-CoV cases, and inadequate infection control practices contribute significantly to the transmission. SUMMARY Understanding factors contributing to the spread and the dynamic of MERS-CoV transmission within healthcare settings would further enhance the control of the disease in and outside the healthcare setting.","Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Perl, Trish M",Current opinion in infectious diseases,208,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Over a 7-month period, 109 subjects (28 men and 81 women; mean age, 58.6 y) scheduled to undergo single-lumen implantable venous port insertion for chemotherapy were randomly assigned to skin closure with either octyl cyanoacrylate skin adhesive or absorbable subcuticular suture after suturing the deep dermal layer. Subjects were followed for episodes of infection or dehiscence within 3 months of port implantation. At 3 months, photographs of the healed incision were obtained and reviewed by a plastic surgeon in a blinded fashion who rated cosmetic scar appearance based on a validated 10-point cosmesis score. RESULTS Of subjects, 54 were randomly assigned to skin adhesive, and 55 were randomly assigned to subcuticular suture. No subjects had incision dehiscence. Infection rates at 3 months were similar between groups (2.1% vs 4.0%; P = 1.0). The mean cosmesis scores were 4.40 for skin adhesive and 4.46 for subcuticular suture (P = .898). The superficial skin closure time was 8.6 minutes for suture versus 1.4 minutes for skin adhesive (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Scar cosmesis and patient outcomes did not significantly vary between skin adhesive versus subcuticular suture, although skin closure time was significantly less with skin adhesive.","Martin, Jonathan G; Hollenbeck, Scott T; Janas, Gemini; Makar, Ryan A; Pabon-Ramos, Waleska M; Suhocki, Paul V; Miller, Michael J; Sopko, David R; Smith, Tony P; Kim, Charles Y",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,208,26

Their main disadvantage, toxicity, can be mitigated by increasing the length of their alkyl chain. The objective was to assess the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo biocompatibility in hernia repair of CAs currently used in clinical practice (Glubran(n-butyl) and Ifabond(n-hexyl)) and a longer-chain CA (OCA(n-octyl)), that has never been used in the medical field. METHODS Formaldehyde release and cytotoxicity of unpolymerized(UCAs) and polymerized CAs(PCAs) were evaluated by macroscopic visual assessment, flow cytometry and Alamar Blue assays. In the preclinical evaluation, partial defects were created in the rabbit abdominal wall and repaired by fixing polypropylene prostheses using the CAs. At 14 days post-surgery, animals were euthanized for morphology, macrophage response and cell damage analyses. RESULTS Formaldehyde release was lower as the molecular weight of the monomer increased. The longest side-chain CA(OCA) showed the highest cytotoxicity in the UCA condition. However, after polymerization, was the one that showed better behavior on most occasions. In vivo, all CAs promoted optimal mesh fixation without displacements or detachments. Seroma was evident with the use of Glubran, (four of six animals: 4/6) and Ifabond (2/6), but it was reduced with the use of OCA (1/6). Significantly greater macrophage responses were observed in groups where Glubran and Ifabond were used vs. sutures and OCA. TUNEL-positive cells were significantly higher in the Glubran and OCA groups vs. the suture group. CONCLUSIONS Although mild formaldehyde release occurred, OCA was the most cytotoxic during polymerization but the least once cured. The CAs promoted proper mesh fixation and have potential to replace traditional suturing techniques in hernia repair; the CAs exhibited good tissue integration and effective short-term biocompatibility, with the slightest seroma and macrophage response induced by OCA.","Pascual, Gemma; Sotomayor, Sandra; Rodríguez, Marta; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Kühnhardt, Andreé; Fernández-Gutiérrez, Mar; San Román, Julio; Bellón, Juan Manuel",PloS one,208,15

The occurrence of recent pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 caused by lethal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is one such example. Rapid research and development of drugs for the treatment and management of these diseases has been an incredibly challenging task for the pharmaceutical industry. Although, substantial focus has been made in the discovery of therapeutic compounds from natural sources having significant medicinal potential, their synthesis has shown a slow progress. Hence, the discovery of new targets by the application of the latest biotechnological and synthetic biology approaches is very much the need of the hour. Polyketides (PKs) and non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) found in bacteria, fungi and plants are a large diverse family of natural products synthesized by two classes of enzymes: polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). These enzymes possess immense biomedical potential due to their simple architecture, catalytic capacity, as well as diversity. With the advent of latest in-silico and in-vitro strategies, these enzymes and their related metabolic pathways, if targeted, can contribute highly towards the biosynthesis of an array of potentially natural drug leads that have antagonist effects on biopolymers associated with various human diseases. In the face of the rising threat from the multidrug-resistant pathogens, this will further open new avenues for the discovery of novel and improved drugs by combining the natural and the synthetic approaches. This review discusses the relevance of polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides and the improvement strategies for the development of their derivatives and scaffolds, and how they will be beneficial to the future bioprospecting and drug discovery.","Girija, Aiswarya; Vijayanathan, Mallika; Sreekumar, Sweda; Basheer, Jasim; Menon, Tara G; Krishnankutty, Radhakrishnan Edayileveetil; Soniya, Eppurathu Vasudevan",Current molecular pharmacology,208,31

Seven healthy males performed a 2-min maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the elbow flexors or knee extensors on four separate days. Electromyographic responses were elicited by nerve stimulation (maximal M-wave) in all sessions and by transcranial magnetic stimulation (motor-evoked potential; silent period) and spinal tract stimulation (cervicomedullary or thoracic motor-evoked potentials; silent period) in one session each per limb. During sustained maximal voluntary contractions, motor-evoked potential area normalised to M-waves increased from baseline in biceps brachii (155 ± 55%) and rectus femoris (151 ± 44%) (both p ≤ 0.045). At the end of maximal voluntary contractions, spinal tract motor-evoked potential area normalised to M-waves was smaller than baseline in biceps brachii (74 ± 23%; p = 0.012) but not rectus femoris (108 ± 40%; p = 0.999). The ratio of motor-evoked potential to spinal tract-evoked potential areas increased dramatically from 90 to 115 s in biceps brachii (p = 0.001) but not in rectus femoris (p = 0.999). Silent period durations increased similarly in both muscles (p ≤ 0.008) after transcranial and spinal stimulation. Sustained maximal contractions elicit different neurophysiological adjustments in upper- and lower-limb muscles. Specifically, motoneuronal excitability was reduced in biceps brachii, but not in rectus femoris, and this reduction required greater compensatory adjustments from the motor cortex. Therefore, changes in cortical and spinal excitability during sustained maximal exercise are likely specific to the muscle performing the task.","Temesi, John; Vernillo, Gianluca; Martin, Matthieu; Krüger, Renata L; McNeil, Chris J; Millet, Guillaume Y",Neuroscience,208,13

Materials and Methods The main aim of ablation therapies like microwave ablation (MWA) is to eradicate all malignant cells in a minimally invasive technique under imaging guidance while preserving the healthy tissue with a sufficient safety margin (at least 5 mm) surrounding the ablated lesion. Results Ablation therapy can be performed via a percutaneous, laparoscopic or intraoperative approach under ultrasound, MRI or CT guidance for adequate localization and monitoring of the ablation process. Conclusion Ablation is the method of choice for oligonodular HCCs ≤ 3 cm. The technical success rate varies from 88 % to 98 % and progression-free survival (PFS) at 3 years from 27 % to 91.7 %. The same criteria apply to the therapy of liver metastases. Key Points · Careful selection of patients proves to be essential for optimum results of MWA. · Interventionists should be familiar with all aspects of complication and rapid assessment of imaging methods in order to evaluate induced damage by thermal ablation. · MWA seems to have some advantages over radiofrequency ablation, like shorter ablation time, less pain, less heat sink effect; however, scientific proof is needed.

A recently-reported association between intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression and postoperative delirium might be mediated in some patients by a heightened sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included 618 elective surgery patients with planned intensive care unit admission, who also received intraoperative electroencephalogram monitoring and had delirium assessments documented in the medical record. Sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics was assessed using a mixed effects model predicting the likelihood of electroencephalogram suppression at each time point based on the current end-tidal anaesthetic concentration. Patients with a random intercept above the population median (electroencephalogram suppression at lower anaesthetic concentrations) were classified as having heightened sensitivity to volatile anaesthetics. Delirium was defined as a positive Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit assessment anytime in the first five postoperative days. RESULTS Postoperative delirium was observed in 162 of 618 patients (26%). Patients who experienced electroencephalogram suppression at lower volatile anaesthetic concentrations had a higher incidence of postoperative delirium [109/309 (35%)] than other patients [53/309 (17%)] [unadjusted odds ratio 2.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.81-3.84, P<0.001]. This association remained significant after adjusting for patient characteristics, surgical variables, and duration of electroencephalogram suppression (adjusted odds ratio 2.13; 95% CI 1.24-3.65, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS These data support the hypothesis that patients with electroencephalogram suppression at lower volatile anaesthetic concentrations have an increased incidence of postoperative delirium. Such patients appear to exhibit a phenotype of anaesthetic sensitivity, which might predispose them to adverse cognitive outcomes.","Fritz, B A; Maybrier, H R; Avidan, M S",British journal of anaesthesia,208,1

When cytosolic DNA is sensed, a signal is relayed via the cGAS-STING pathway: this involves the activation of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGMP-AMP) synthase (cGAS) and generation of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, followed by the induction of stimulator of interferon genes (STING). The cGAS-STING pathway responds to viral, bacterial, and self-DNA. Whereas it generally mediates immune surveillance and is often neuroprotective, excessive engagement of the system can be deleterious.

METHODS We conducted a case-matched retrospective review of 20 patients who underwent single-site laparoscopic procedures for inflammatory bowel disease compared with 20 matched patients undergoing multiport laparoscopic procedures. Data regarding these patients were tabulated in the following categories: demographic characteristics, operative parameters, and perioperative outcomes. RESULTS A wide range of cases were completed: 9 ileocolic resections, 7 cases of proctocolectomy with end ileostomy or ileal pouch anal anastomosis, 2 cases of proctectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and 2 total abdominal colectomies with end ileostomy were all matched to equivalent multiport laparoscopic cases. No single-incision cases were converted to multiport laparoscopy, and 2 single-incision cases (10%) were converted to an open approach. For single-incision cases, the mean length of stay was 7.7 days, the mean time to oral intake was 3.3 days, and the mean period of intravenous analgesic use was 5.0 days. There were no statistically significant differences between single-site and multiport cases. CONCLUSIONS Single-site laparoscopic surgery is technically feasible in inflammatory bowel disease. The length of stay and period of intravenous analgesic use (in days) appear to be higher than those in comparable series examining outcomes of single-site laparoscopic colorectal surgery, and the outcomes are comparable with those of multiport laparoscopy. This may be because of the nature of inflammatory bowel disease, limiting the benefits of a single-site approach in this population.","Olson, Craig H; Bedros, Nicole; Hakiman, Hekmat; Araghizadeh, Farshid Y",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,208,28

For reasons of tilted and long linear staple line of rectal stump, circular anastomotic plane can make multiple intersections. The present study was designed to assess whether multiple intersections after double stapling technique is the risk factor of anastomotic complication in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 128 consecutive left colon and rectal cancer patients who underwent laparoscopic rectal resection with double stapling technique were enrolled in this study. In all cases, operator tried to reduce intersections by inversion and invagination techniques. They were subdivided into 3 groups: 58 patients with no intersection of staple lines (group A), 62 patients with 1 point of intersection (group B) and 8 patients with 2 points of intersection (group C). Intraoperative air leakage, incomplete cut ring, postoperative bleeding, anastomotic stenosis, and leakage were compared between the 3 groups. RESULTS Clinical anastomotic leakage was identified in 1 (group C) of 128 patients (0.7%). Overall anastomotic leakage rate was 0% (0/58) in group A, 0% (0/62) in group B, and 12.5% (1/8) in group C (P=0.001). In univariate analysis, intersections of staple lines were associated with anastomotic complications. There were no statistically significant differences between the 3 groups in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS The number of intersections of staple lines is associated with anastomotic leakage, and the inversion technique is a useful method for avoiding anastomotic leakage. Using an appropriate technique by skilled operator, double stapling technique for laparoscopic anterior resection is safe and feasible.","Lee, SeungHun; Ahn, ByungKwon; Lee, SeungHyun","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",208,23

Evidence detailing the factors that affect patient participation in undergraduate medical education is limited. This study examines how patients regard their participation in teaching consultations in primary care. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey in four GP practices. We tested the relationship between variables of interest and willingness to participate, using hierarchical logistic regression. RESULTS We analysed 525 questionnaires. 88% of respondents were willing to have students take part in their consultation, and 72% were willing to see a student alone before seeing the doctor. Older patients and those with less sensitive clinical problems were more likely to participate. Willingness to participate was also associated with patients' perceptions of certain costs and benefits of participation. Respondents had poor knowledge about medical education, and a sizeable minority perceived a lack of autonomy about the presence of students in their encounters. More than one-third of respondents expressed the presence of a clinician as a precondition for approval of students' performing some active roles. DISCUSSION The findings have identified potential interventions to enhance patient involvement including patient education, respecting patient autonomy, and ensuring appropriate student supervision.","Alao, Adedoyin; Burford, Bryan; Alberti, Hugh; Barton, Roger; Moloney, Susan; Vance, Gillian",Medical teacher,208,1

A critical aspect of developing a new tool is exploring users' experience. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to examine users' experience, obstacles and challenges, and their views and concerns in the applicability of a new tool for determining genetic risk in Slovenia's primary care. METHODS We used a qualitative approach. The participants completed a risk assessment software questionnaire that calculates users' likelihood of developing familial diseases. Audio-taped semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted to evaluate their experience. There were 21 participants, and analyses using the constant comparative method were employed. RESULTS We identified 3 main themes: obstacles/key issues, suggestions for improvements, and coping. The participants were poorly satisfied with the clarity of instructions, technical usability problems, and issues with the entry of relatives' data. They expressed satisfaction with some of the characteristics of the FHQ (e.g., straightforward and friendly format, easy entry, and comprehension). They suggested simpler language, that the disease risk should be targeted toward the disease, that the FHQ should include patient-specific recommendations, and that it should be part of the electronic medical records. When discussing what would they do with the results of the FHQ, the participants used different coping strategies: active (e.g., seeking information) or passive (e.g., avoidance). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION User experience was shown to be a synthesis of obstacles, overcoming them with suggestions for improvements, and exploration of various coping mechanisms that may emerge from dealing with the stressor of ""being at risk.""","Miroševič, Špela; Krajc, Kaja; Klemenc-Ketiš, Zalika; Selič-Zupančič, Polona",Public health genomics,208,1

SUBJECTS AND METHODS In all, 10 surgeons with varying operative experience were assigned to beginner (BG), combined competent and proficient (CPG), and expert (EG) groups based on the Dreyfus model. The participants performed tasks for basic, intermediate and advanced skills on the da Vinci Surgical System. Participant performance was assessed using both tool-based and cognitive metrics. RESULTS Tool-based metrics showed significant differences between the BG vs CPG and the BG vs EG, in basic skills. While performing intermediate skills, there were significant differences only on the instrument-to-instrument collisions between the BG vs CPG (2.0 vs 0.2, P = 0.028), and the BG vs EG (2.0 vs 0.1, P = 0.018). There were no significant differences between the CPG and EG for both basic and intermediate skills. However, using cognitive metrics, there were significant differences between all groups for the basic and intermediate skills. In advanced skills, there were no significant differences between the CPG and the EG except time (1116 vs 599.6 s), using tool-based metrics. However, cognitive metrics revealed significant differences between both groups. CONCLUSION Cognitive assessment of surgeons may aid in defining levels of expertise performing complex surgical tasks once competence is achieved. Cognitive assessment may be used as an adjunct to the traditional methods for skill assessment during RAS.","Guru, Khurshid A; Esfahani, Ehsan T; Raza, Syed J; Bhat, Rohit; Wang, Katy; Hammond, Yana; Wilding, Gregory; Peabody, James O; Chowriappa, Ashirwad J",BJU international,208,33

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate both objective and patient-centred outcomes in relation to ready-made and custom-made MAAs s. Biomedical electronic databases, clinical trials registers and Grey literature were searched to January 2017, for randomised controlled trials. Meta-analyses of clinical trials were conducted for a range of objective (apnea-hypopnea index, treatment response) and subjective scales (daytime sleepiness; quality of life; patient preference and adherence). The review included three randomised controlled trials, which revealed low risk of bias. Custom-made MAAs s achieved a significant mean difference in the apnea-hypopnea index (-3.2; 95% confidence interval -5.18, -1.22; p = .004), daytime sleepiness (-0.98; 95% confidence interval -1.97, 0.01; p = .05), observed mean difference in Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire scores (0.76; 95% confidence interval 0.14, 1.38; p = .02), self-reported adherence (6.4-7 nights per week and 5-6.3 hr per night) and expressed preference (p ≤ .001) when compared with the ready-made MAAs s.

We compare endoscopic suturing versus anchoring with a novel over-the-scope clip (Padlock) to fix esophageal stents. Additionally, the first clinical case of Padlock stent fixation is reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS A fully covered esophageal stent was placed in 11 pigs and fixed with one figure-of-eight suture (n = 5) or with a Padlock (n = 4) or not fixed (controls; n = 2). The force required to mobilize the stent was recorded. CLINICAL CASE an esophageal stent was fixed with a Padlock and endoscopically removed 1 month later, in an 82-year-old patient. RESULTS Mean force (newton) to mobilize the stent was similar after suturing and Padlock fixation (23.99 ± 14.91 vs. 19.97 ± 7.62; p = 0.32). In controls was 7 and 11 Newtons. Suturing time (seconds) was longer than Padlock application (455.4 ± 144.83 vs. 155 ± 12.9; p = 0.002). CLINICAL CASE stent fixation was feasible and uncomplicated. Removal was easy, and only mild bleeding occurred. CONCLUSIONS Padlock is faster than endoscopic suturing and achieves similar stent fixation.

Preliminary series have shown good safety and efficacy. The WEB Clinical Assessment of Intrasaccular Aneurysm Therapy (WEBCAST) trial is a prospective European trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of WEB in wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms. METHODS Patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms for which WEB treatment was indicated were included in this multicentergood clinical practices study. Clinical data including adverse events and clinical status at 1 and 6 months were collected and independently analyzed by a medical monitor. Six-month follow-up digital subtraction angiography was also performed and independently analyzed by a core laboratory. Success was defined at 6 months as complete occlusion or stable neck remnant, no worsening in angiographic appearance from postprocedure, and no retreatment performed or planned. RESULTS Ten European neurointerventional centers enrolled 51 patients with 51 aneurysms. Treatment with WEB was achieved in 48 of 51 aneurysms (94.1%). Adjunctive implants (coils/stents) were used in 4 of 48 aneurysms (8.3%). Thromboembolic events were observed in 9 of 51 patients (17.6%), resulting in a permanent deficit (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] Score 1) in 1 patient (2.0%). Intraoperative rupture was not observed. Morbidity (mRS score > 2) and mortality were 2.0% (1 of 51 patients, related to rupture status on entry to study) and 0.0% at 1 month, respectively. Success was achieved at 6 months in 85.4% of patients treated with WEB: 23 of 41 patients (56.1%) had complete occlusion, 12 of 41 (29.3%) had a neck remnant, and 6 of 41 (14.6%) had an aneurysm remnant.

Patients with high-grade glioma (HGG) are believed to be in a vulnerable category. The aim of this study was to describe the experience of a hub cancer center and the measures that were put in place for treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma. METHODS To prevent in-hospital contagion and preserve the safety of health professionals and patients, specific protocols and strict regulations were introduced. Physical distancing, use of surgical masks, and diligent hand hygiene were adopted. Each case was discussed in a multidisciplinary board meeting before treatment. All patient candidates for surgical procedures were tested for SARS-CoV-2 with a nasopharyngeal swab and a chest CT scan. Indications for surgery were the radiological suspicion of HGG in patients with a good performance status and/or the rapid and progressive occurrence of neurological deficits. Adjuvant treatments were performed only in cases of HGG. This therapy consisted of conventional fractional radiotherapy (RT; 60 Gy/30 fractions) with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy (TMZCHT) in younger patients; in elderly patients, a short course of RT was employed (40.5 Gy/15 fractions). For recurrent HGG, treatments were assessed after a careful evaluation of the patient's general condition, neurological status, and risk of early impairment in neurological status if not treated. During simulation CT for the RT plan, each patient underwent a chest CT study. In cases in which an imaging study was suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia, the patient was immediately isolated and rapidly underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing. RESULTS Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, 23 HGGs were treated, and these cases are included in the present evaluation. Fifteen patients harboring newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) underwent resection followed by a regimen of chemotherapy and RT, and 3 patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma underwent surgery followed by adjuvant RT. Five patients were treated for recurrent GBM, and they received surgery plus adjuvant RT. One patient in whom the simulation CT study was suspicious for COVID pneumonia was tested with a nasopharyngeal swab, which proved positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. No patients contracted COVID-19 during hospitalization for surgery or during RT treatment. Corticosteroid therapy was administered to all patients beginning on the 1st day of RT. CONCLUSIONS The authors' experience during the COVID-19 pandemic showed that patients with HGG can be treated in the most effective manner without a compromise in safety. Careful selection criteria and a multidisciplinary evaluation are pivotal to assessing the optimal therapeutic strategy.","Pessina, Federico; Navarria, Pierina; Bellu, Luisa; Clerici, Elena; Politi, Letterio Salvatore; Tropeano, Maria Pia; Simonelli, Matteo; Fornari, Maurizio; Scorsetti, Marta",Neurosurgical focus,208,1

PURPOSE To describe an approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) strategy development at a school of pharmacy aimed at stakeholder investment and infrastructure that can address systemic challenges in various healthcare settings. SUMMARY The UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy utilized an organizational approach focused on infrastructure to produce a diverse and inclusive school community. The Office of Organizational Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) established vision and mission statements to represent the school's commitment and conducted a comprehensive environmental scan to compose a shared vision. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni participated in a series of retreats, symposiums, and focus groups to identify opportunities to cultivate a diverse and inclusive school community. A working group comprised of key leaders in the school developed and launched a 3-year DEI Strategic Plan along with initiatives and metrics for year 1. The plan's 3 priorities were (1) to recruit and retain diverse talent, (2) to prepare culturally intelligent professionals, and (3) to build an inclusive community. The ODI collaborated with internal and external stakeholders, which included students, faculty, staff, postdocs, alumni, and partners from health systems, industry, and other institutions and organizations, to initiate, implement, and monitor progress through an organizational approach to establish accountability and greater commitment. CONCLUSION An organizational approach to DEI strategy through stakeholder engagement and infrastructure increased commitment and shared ownership among members of the school community. Applications in an organizational approach can be adapted to multiple healthcare settings to contribute to the cultural transformation necessary to develop a diverse and inclusive healthcare workforce.","White, Carla Y; Patel, Ami; Cossari, Dominique",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,208,27

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of CR is still largely unknown. This study was designed to explore the bioactive components and the mechanism of CR in treating SCI based on a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation. Methods First, the active compounds and related target genes in CR were screened from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. Subsequently, the corresponding target genes of SCI were collected by the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and GeneCards database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database. Furthermore, GO function and KEGG enrichment analysis of the targets were analyzed using DAVID tools. Subsequently, the AutoDock software for molecular docking was adopted to verify the above network pharmacology analysis results between the active components and key targets. Finally, an SCI rat model animal validation experiment was assessed to verify the reliability of the network pharmacology results. Results There were 7 active ingredients identified in CR and 246 SCI-related targets were collected. Then, 4 core nodes (ALB, AKT1, MAPK1, and EGFR) were discerned via construction of a PPI network of 111 common targets. The KEGG enrichment analysis results indicated that the Ras signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway were enriched in the development of SCI. The results of molecular docking demonstrated that the effects of CR have a strong affinity with the 4 pivotal targets. Experimental validation in a rat model showed that CR could effectively improve the recovery of motor function and mechanical pain threshold after SCI. Conclusions In summary, it revealed the mechanism of CR treatment for SCI involve active ingredients, targets and signaling pathways, providing a scientific basis for future investigations into the mechanism underlying CR treating for SCI.","Tao, Bo; Wang, Qi; Cao, Jiangang; Yasen, Yimingjiang; Ma, Lei; Sun, Chao; Shang, Jun; Feng, Shiqing",Annals of translational medicine,208,1

Past studies on adjuvant radiotherapy (aRT) for higher-risk features have had conflicting results. Through the collaborative conversations of the global radiation oncology Twitter-based journal club (#RadOnc #JC), we explored this complex topic to share recent advances, better understand what the global radiation oncology community felt was important and inspire next steps. Methods We selected the recent publication of a landmark international randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing immediate and salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer, RADICALS-RT, for discussion over the weekend of January 16 to 17, 2021. Coordination included open access to the article and an asynchronous portion to decrease barriers to participation, cooperation of study authors (CP, MS) who participated to share deeper insights including a live hour, and curation of related resources and tweet content through a blog post and Wakelet journal club summary. Discussion of Results Our conversations created 2,370,104 impressions over 599 tweets with 51 participants spanning 11 countries and 5 continents. A quarter of the participants were from the US (13/51) followed by 10% from the UK (5/51). Clinical or Radiation Oncologists comprised 59% of active participants (16/27) with 62% (18/29) reporting giving aRT within the last 5 years. Discussion was interdisciplinary with three urologists (11%), three trainees (11%), and two physiotherapists (7%). Four months after the journal club its article Altmetric score had increased by 7% (214 to 229). Thematic analysis of tweet content suggested participants wanted clarification on definitions of adjuvant (aRT) and salvage radiotherapy (sRT) including indications, timing, and decision-making tools including guidelines; more interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration including with patients for study design including survivorship and meaningful outcomes; more effective knowledge translation including faster clinical trials; and more data including mature results of current trials, particular high-risk features (Gleason Group 4+, pT4b+, and margin-positive disease), implications of newer technologies such as PSMA-PET and genomic classifiers, and better explanations for practice pattern variations including underutilization of radiotherapy. This was further explored in the context of relevant literature. Conclusion Together, this global collaborative review on the postoperative management of prostate cancer suggested a stronger signal for the uptake of early salvage radiation treatment with careful PSA monitoring, more sensitive PSA triggers, and expected access to radiotherapy. Questions still remain on potential exceptions and barriers to use. These require better decision-making tools for all practice settings, consideration of newer technologies, more pragmatic trials, and better use of social media for knowledge translation.","Yun Ooi, Kai; Pereira, Ian; Nagar, Himanshu; Simcock, Richard; Katz, Matthew S; Parker, Christopher C; Lawton, Colleen; Saeed, Hina",Clinical and translational radiation oncology,208,1

The objective of this study was to study the composition and characteristics of the soil microbial communities that had been exposed to long-term selection pressure caused by the industrial production of penicillin G. Soil samples from four sites among the penicillin G production plant were analysed using 16S rRNA profiling via Illumina MiSeq platform and were compared with the control samples from four sites outside the plant. Total metagenomic DNA from the impacted soil was also used for the preparation of E. coli T1R-based fosmid library which was consequently qualitatively tested for the presence of penicillin G acylase (PGA)-encoding genes using the method of sequence homology. Analyses of alpha diversity revealed that the long-term antibiotic presence in the soil significantly increased the microbial diversity and richness in terms of Shannon diversity index (p = 0.002) and Chao estimates (p = 0.004). Principal component analysis showed that the two types of communities (on-site and control) could be separated at the phylum, class and genus level. The on-site soil was enriched in Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Acidobacteria and Planctomycetia, while a significant decrease in Actinobacteria was observed. Metagenomic fosmid library revealed high hit rates in identifying PGAs (14 different genes identified) and confirmed the biotechnological potential of soils impacted by anthropogenic activity. This study offers new insights into the changes in microbial communities of soils exposed to anthropogenic activity as well as indicates that those soils may represent a hotspot for biotechnologically interesting targets.","Borčinová, Martina; Pitkina, Anastasiya; Marešová, Helena; Štěpánek, Václav; Palyzová, Andrea; Kyslík, Pavel",Folia microbiologica,208,14

In this study we are aiming to validate an experimental model for the induction of uniform temperature elevation in osteolytic bone tumours, using the natural acoustic window provided by the cortical breakthrough. MATERIALS AND METHODS Experiments were conducted on ex vivo lamb shank by mimicking osteolytic bone tumours. The cortical breakthrough was exploited to induce hyperthermia inside the medullar cavity by delivering acoustic energy from a phased array HIFU transducer. MR thermometry data was acquired intra-operatory using the proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS) method. Active temperature control was achieved via a closed-loop predictive controller set at 6 °C above the baseline. Several beam geometries with respect to the cortical breakthrough were investigated. Numerical simulations were used to further explain the observed phenomena. Thermal safety of bone heating was assessed by cross-correlating MR thermometry data with the measurements from a fluoroptic temperature sensor inserted in the cortical bone. RESULTS Numerical simulations and MR thermometry confirmed the feasibility of spatio-temporal uniform hyperthermia (± 0.5 °C) inside the medullar cavity using a fixed focal point sonication. This result was obtained by the combination of several factors: an optimal positioning of the focal spot in the plane of the cortical breakthrough, the direct absorption of the HIFU beam at the focal spot, the ""acoustic oven effect"" yielded by the beam interaction with the bone, and a predictive temperature controller. The fluoroptical sensor data revealed no heating risks for the bone and adjacent tissues and were in good agreement with the PRFS thermometry from measurable voxels adjacent to the periosteum. CONCLUSION To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of MR-guided focused ultrasound hyperthermia inside the medullar cavity of bones affected by osteolytic tumours. Our results are considered a promising step for combining adjuvant mild hyperthermia to external beam radiation therapy for sustained pain relief in patients with symptomatic bone metastases.","Guillemin, Pauline C; Gui, Laura; Lorton, Orane; Zilli, Thomas; Crowe, Lindsey A; Desgranges, Stéphane; Montet, Xavier; Terraz, Sylvain; Miralbell, Raymond; Salomir, Rares; Boudabbous, Sana",Journal of translational medicine,208,1

The bulk chemical composition of the concretions has been determined by SF-ICP-MS. Mg and Al are the major elements measured with concentrations of a few hundred mg g-1. Ca and S are also found at concentrations in the range of mg g-1. Among the measured trace elements there is a specific interest in As and V because of environmental concerns pointed out by regulation authorities. Their concentrations are of tens to thousands μg g-1, respectively. Concentrations of the other elements are in the range of a few ng g-1 to few hundreds μg g-1. In order to constrain the dispersion of particles in the environment and to understand how chemical elements can be scavenged from or released to seawater, the size distribution of particles composing the concretions has been measured by settling rate experiments and, for each size class of particles, their chemical composition has been determined. For example, As and V are mainly associated to particles with mean diameters between 15.6 and 63 μm and settling rates around 96 m d-1.

METHODS Assessment of 739 colorectal lesions >or=6 mm detected prospectively at CTC screening in 479 patients was performed. By-polyp PPV was analyzed according to small (6-9 mm) versus large (>or=10 mm) size; morphology (sessile/pedunculated/flat); diagnostic confidence level (3 = most confident, 1 = least confident); and histology. By-patient PPV was analyzed at various polyp size thresholds. RESULTS By-polyp PPV for CTC-detected lesions >or=6 mm, 6-9 mm, and >or=10 mm was 91.6% (677/739), 90.1% (410/451), and 92.7% (267/288), respectively (p = 0.4). By-polyp PPV according to sessile, pedunculated, flat, and mass-like morphology was 92.5% (441/477), 96.5% (139/144), 77.7% (73/94), and 97.6% (40/41), respectively (p < 0.0001 for flat versus polypoid morphology). By-polyp PPV according to diagnostic confidence level was 94.7% (554/585) for highest (= level 3), 83.5% (106/127) for intermediate (= level 2), and 63.0% (17/27) for lowest (= level 1) confidence (p < 0.0001 for levels-2/3 versus level-1).

In a publicly-funded HIV clinic, we aimed to evaluate a pre-visit phone-based planning intervention to address anticipated barriers to telemedicine. METHODS We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial of patients scheduled for a phone-based HIV primary care visit at the Ward 86 HIV clinic in San Francisco from 15 April to 15 May 2020. Once reached by phone, patients were randomized to either have a structured pre-visit planning intervention to address barriers to an upcoming telemedicine visit versus a standard reminder call. The primary outcome was telemedicine visit attendance. RESULTS Of 476 scheduled telemedicine visits, 280 patients were reached by a pre-visit call to offer enrollment. Patients were less likely to be reached if virally unsuppressed (odds ratio (OR) 0.11, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.03-0.48), CD4 < 200 (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.85), or were homeless (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.87). There was no difference between intervention and control in scheduled visit attendance (83% v. 78%, OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.67-2.81). CONCLUSIONS A structured phone-based planning call to address barriers to telemedicine in a public HIV clinic was less likely to reach patients with poorly-controlled HIV and patients experiencing homelessness, suggesting additional interventions may be needed in this population to ensure access to telemedicine-based care. Among patients reachable by phone, telemedicine visit attendance was high and not improved with a structured pre-visit intervention, suggesting that standard reminders may be adequate in this population.","Hickey, Matthew D; Sergi, Francesco; Zhang, Kevin; Spinelli, Matthew A; Black, Douglas; Sola, Cyril; Blaz, Vanessa; Nguyen, Janet Q; Oskarsson, Jon; Gandhi, Monica; Havlir, Diane V",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,208,16

In this paper, we propose a dynamic model that incorporates individuals' behavior change in social interactions at different stages of the epidemics. We fit our model to the data in Ontario, Canada and calculate the effective reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_t$ within each stage. Results show that $\mathcal{R}_t$ > 1 if the public's awareness to practice physical distancing is rela-tively low and $\mathcal{R}_t$ < 1 otherwise. Simulations show that a reduced contact rate between the susceptible and asymptomatic/unreported symptomatic individuals is effective in mitigating the disease spread. Moreover, sensitivity analysis indicates that an increasing contact rate may lead to a second wave of disease outbreak. We also investigate the effectiveness of disease intervention strategies. Simulations demonstrate that enlarging the testing capacity and motivating infected individuals to test for an early diagnosis may facilitate mitigating the disease spread in a relatively short time. Results also indicate a significantly faster decline of confirmed positive cases if individuals practice strict physical distancing even if restricted measures are lifted.","Wang, Xiaoying",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,208,31

The aim of the study was to systematically investigate the effectiveness of coil retrieval with a stent retriever in an animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 148 coils of various types and sizes were placed into arteries of varying diameters in a porcine in vivo model. Coil retrieval was performed by placing a Trevo ProVue stent retriever over the coil and trying to trap a part of the platinum coil within the stent mesh by advancing the microcatheter over the stent or simply by retrieving the stent without trying to trap the coil by advancing the microcatheter. RESULTS Coil retrieval was successful in 101 of 102 cases (99%), in which trapping of the coil within the stent retriever by advancing the microcathter was applied. When we only pulled back the stent without trapping the coil, retrieval was successful in only 5 of 46 cases (11%). Coil type, coil structure (2D versus 3D), actual coil shape in the affected vessel, investigator experience, aspiration, coil localization, and vessel diameter had no significant influence on retrieval outcome. There was no case of vessel perforation.

This phase II study (J-CLASSIC-PII) was undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of XELOX in Japanese patients with resected gastric cancer. METHODS Patients with stage II or III gastric cancer who underwent curative D2 gastrectomy received adjuvant XELOX (eight 3-week cycles of oral capecitabine, 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14, plus intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on day 1). The primary endpoint was dose intensity. Secondary endpoints were safety, proportion of patients completing treatment, and 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate. RESULTS One hundred patients were enrolled, 76 of whom completed the study as planned. The mean dose intensity was 67.2 % (95 % CI, 61.9-72.5 %) for capecitabine and 73.4 % (95 % CI, 68.4-78.4 %) for oxaliplatin, which were higher than the predefined age-adjusted threshold values of 63.4 % and 69.4 %, respectively, and the study therefore met its primary endpoint. The 1-year DFS rate was 86 % (95 % CI, 77-91 %). No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of adjuvant XELOX in Japanese patients with resected gastric cancer is similar to that observed in South Korean, Chinese, and Taiwanese patients in the Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin Adjuvant Study in Stomach Cancer (CLASSIC) study. Based on findings from this study and the CLASSIC study, the XELOX regimen can be considered an adjuvant treatment option for Japanese gastric cancer patients who have undergone curative resection.","Fuse, Nozomu; Bando, Hideaki; Chin, Keisho; Ito, Seiji; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Tsuburaya, Akira; Terashima, Masanori; Kawashima, Yoshiyuki; Fukunaga, Tetsu; Gotoh, Masahiro; Emi, Yasunori; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Oki, Eiji; Takahashi, Seiji; Kuriki, Hiroshi; Sato, Kumi; Sasako, Mitsuru",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,208,1

Results Fourteen residents (58% response rate) completed all aspects of the study including both surveys and participation in the educational intervention. Confidence levels in conducting telemedicine visits increased in three of five domains: (1) virtual physical exam ( P=.04), (2) visit documentation (P=.03), and (3) virtually staffing with an attending ( P=.04). Resident interest in using telemedicine after residency also increased following the educational intervention. Conclusion Telemedicine requires a unique skill set. Formal education on best practices improves resident confidence levels and interest in practicing telemedicine. Primary care residency programs should incorporate telemedicine training to adequately prepare their graduates for clinical practice.","Ha, Emmeline; Zwicky, Kristen; Yu, Grace; Schechtman, Andrew",PRiMER,208,5

Operative time is shorter when using a self-gripping mesh than with conventional Lichtenstein repair. However, these meshes can be difficult to handle because they fix to undesired structures. The aim of this report is to describe a new technique to avoid this problem. TECHNIQUE Inguinal hernia dissection is made as usual. Once dissection is finished, a Parietex ProGrip(®) (Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) flat sheet mesh is cut depending on the size needed. A small split is made between the lower and medium third of the mesh to mark where the split for the spermatic cord will be. Using this mark, the upper third of the mesh is folded over the medium third, hiding the microgrips that make this a self-gripping mesh. In this way, only the lower third of the mesh has the microgrips exposed and the mesh can be fixed to the pubic bone and inguinal ligament without fixation to undesired structures. Once the lower third of the mesh is fixed, the split for the spermatic cord is completed and the upper part of the mesh is passed below the spermatic cord. Then, the mesh is unfolded to expose the microgrips again and the medium and upper third of the mesh are descended to its final position. CONCLUSION This proposed technique for inguinal hernia repair with self-gripping mesh makes the surgery easier, avoiding mesh fixation to undesired structures.","Porrero, J L; Cano-Valderrama, O; Castillo, M J; Alonso, M T",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,208,31

It is perceived to be a key component of a learning health care system. Despite its increasing implementation worldwide, it remains uncertain why the effect of CDS varies and which factors make CDS more effective. OBJECTIVE To examine which factors make CDS strategies more effective on a number of outcomes, including adherence to recommended practice, patient outcome measures, economic measures, provider or patient satisfaction, and medical decision quality. METHODS We identified randomised controlled trials, non-randomised trials, and controlled before-and-after studies that directly compared CDS implementation with a given factor to CDS without that factor by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL and checking reference lists of relevant studies. We considered CDS with any objective for any condition in any healthcare setting. We included CDS interventions that were either displayed on screen or provided on paper and that were directed at healthcare professionals or targeted at both professionals and patients. The reviewers screened the potentially relevant studies in duplicate. They extracted data and assessed risk of bias in independent pairs or individually followed by a double check by another reviewer. We summarised results using medians and interquartile ranges and rated our certainty in the evidence using the GRADE system. RESULTS We identified 66 head-to-head trials that we synthesised across 14 comparisons of CDS intervention factors. Providing CDS automatically versus on demand led to large improvements in adherence. Displaying CDS on-screen versus on paper led to moderate improvements and making CDS more versus less patient-specific improved adherence modestly. When CDS interventions were combined with professional-oriented strategies, combined with patient-oriented strategies, or combined with staff-oriented strategies, then adherence improved slightly. Providing CDS to patients slightly increased adherence versus CDS aimed at the healthcare provider only. Making CDS advice more explicit and requiring users to respond to the advice made little or no difference. The CDS intervention factors made little or no difference to patient outcomes. The results for economic outcomes and satisfaction outcomes were sparse. CONCLUSION Multiple factors may affect the success of CDS interventions. CDS may be more effective when the advice is provided automatically and displayed on-screen and when the suggestions are more patient-specific. CDS interventions combined with other strategies probably also improves adherence. Providing CDS directly to patients may also positively affect adherence. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate for all factors.

Although it is well established that the spatial progression of infection is largely attributable to human mobility, difficulty obtaining real-time information on human movement has limited its incorporation into existing infectious disease forecasting techniques. In this study, we develop and validate an ensemble forecast system for predicting the spatiotemporal spread of influenza that uses readily accessible human mobility data and a metapopulation model. In retrospective state-level forecasts for 35 US states, the system accurately predicts local influenza outbreak onset,-i.e., spatial spread, defined as the week that local incidence increases above a baseline threshold-up to 6 wk in advance of this event. In addition, the metapopulation prediction system forecasts influenza outbreak onset, peak timing, and peak intensity more accurately than isolated location-specific forecasts. The proposed framework could be applied to emergent respiratory viruses and, with appropriate modifications, other infectious diseases.","Pei, Sen; Kandula, Sasikiran; Yang, Wan; Shaman, Jeffrey",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,1

Strategies for cholera control include improving water, sanitation, and hygiene; providing early and effective treatment; and deploying oral cholera vaccine (OCV). This last strategy is relatively new, and countries considering its introduction are interested in knowing the potential cost not only of the vaccine, but also the cost of introduction. This paper describes the costing of OCV introduction in LMICs using a publicly available Excel-based tool known as the CholTool. It includes estimates of delivery cost categories which cover not only the service delivery costs (e.g. vaccine procurement, handling, storage, and transport; vaccination administration, monitoring supervision, and field support), but also the programmatic costs associated with introducing a new vaccine (i.e. microplanning, communication and training materials development, sensitization/social mobilization, and personnel training) to ensure that a comprehensive estimate is provided with health payer perspective. CholTool takes the user through a structured sequence of interlinked modules containing input parameter cells (assumptions), decision cells (variable selections), and formulas (calculations) to produce customized cost estimates based on standardized methods. The tool provides both financial and economic cost estimates, to ensure that both costs are available for consideration. Four examples of applications of CholTool are presented in three countries- one in Ethiopia, two in Malawi and one in Nepal. The estimates of economic delivery cost per dose (including service delivery and programmatic costs) were (in USD 2016): $2.89 in Ethiopia, $3.04 in Malawi1, $3.35 in Malawi2 and $3.06 in Nepal. A cost projection conducted before the campaign using the tool and a retrospective costing using the tool in Nepal resulted in no significant difference between economic delivery costs per dose.","Morgan, Winthrop; Levin, Ann; Hutubessy, Raymond Cw; Mogasale, Vittal",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,208,8

METHODS Self-administration, drug discrimination, and repeat-dose two week dependence liability studies were conducted to compare hydrocodone to the prototypical opiates, morphine and oxycodone. RESULTS Hydrocodone was self-administered, produced an opiate-like subjective discriminative generalization profile and produced a significant discontinuation syndrome following abrupt treatment cessation that was quantitatively and qualitatively similar to morphine and/or oxycodone.

China and Japan.,14.910782,8.251295,2016,"BACKGROUND Meta-analyses are widely used to strengthen available evidence and obtain more precise estimates of treatment effect than any individual trial. Paradoxically, multiplication of meta-analyses on the same topic can lead to confusion as practitioners no longer benefit from a rapid and synthetic response. This phenomenon may appear disproportionate when the number of published meta-analyses exceeds the number of original studies. OBJECTIVES To describe an example of redundant meta-analyses published in the same area with the same randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS A systematic review was performed to identify all published meta-analyses of original RCTs that compared DOACs to LMWHs in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Forest plots were used to represent the meta-analyses results for efficacy (VTE recurrence) and safety (major bleeding) endpoints. An authors' network was constructed to explore the links between the authors of the published meta-analyses. RESULTS In the past 3 years, four original RCTs were the subject of 20 published meta-analyses by 142 authors: 5, 4 and 11 meta-analyses pooled the data of 2, 3 and 4 RCTs, respectively. The results of meta-analyses were similar regarding the risks of VTE recurrence and major bleeding. The 11 meta-analyses of 4 RCTs were published within 6 months of the publication of the last RCT. CONCLUSIONS The epidemic proportions of such redundant literature and authorship could be moderated by developing 'living' meta-analyses and encouraging authors of new RCTs to update the corresponding meta-analysis in the same paper as their original research.","Chapelle, Céline; Ollier, Edouard; Girard, Philippe; Frere, Corinne; Mismetti, Patrick; Cucherat, Michel; Laporte, Silvy",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,208,16

However, the length of RNA packaged in the virus-like particles with high efficiency is usually less than 500 bases. In this study, we describe a method for producing armored L-RNA. Armored L-RNA is a complex of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein and RNA produced in Escherichia coli by the induction of a two-plasmid coexpression system in which the coat protein and maturase are expressed from one plasmid and the target RNA sequence with modified MS2 stem-loop (pac site) is transcribed from another plasmid. A 3V armored L-RNA of 2,248 bases containing six gene fragments-hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and SARS-CoV3), avian influenza virus matrix gene (M300), and H5N1 avian influenza virus (HA300)-was successfully expressed by the two-plasmid coexpression system and was demonstrated to have all of the characteristics of armored RNA. We evaluated the 3V armored L-RNA as a calibrator for multiple virus assays. We used the WHO International Standard for HCV RNA (NIBSC 96/790) to calibrate the chimeric armored L-RNA, which was diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions to obtain samples containing 10(6) to 10(2) copies. In conclusion, the approach we used for armored L-RNA preparation is practical and could reduce the labor and cost of quality control in multiplex RNA virus assays. Furthermore, we can assign the chimeric armored RNA with an international unit for quantitative detection.","Wei, Yuxiang; Yang, Changmei; Wei, Baojun; Huang, Jie; Wang, Lunan; Meng, Shuang; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Journal of clinical microbiology,208,1

METHODS The reduction in asthma treatment costs was assessed using Massachusetts claims data from one Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) in the north east that included all costs between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016. The data was used to determine asthma-related utilization cost reductions between 1 year pre- and 1, 2 and 3 years post-intervention. The cost reductions for 45 CAI patients and 45 cost-matched comparison patients were measured. Return on investment (ROI) was computed as the difference in cost reduction for CAI patients and a cost-matched comparison population divided by CAI program cost. RESULTS The excess reduction in per patient asthma-related utilization costs among CAI patients compared to the comparison population was $806 (p = 0.047), $1,253 (p = 0.01) and $1,549 (p = 0.005) between 1 year pre- and 1, 2 and 3 years post-intervention. These yielded adjusted ROI's of 0.31, 0.78 and 1.37 after 1, 2 and 3 years post-CAI intervention.

There are very few studies assessing stress among medical teachers. With landmark policy changes, disruption and ongoing pandemic, looking at the mental health of medical teachers assumes greater importance. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in the teaching faculty of medical, dental, nursing, and physiotherapy colleges affiliated within a rural medical university in western Maharashtra. A convenience sample of 100 teachers was taken and a self-report questionnaire was used to collect data from the teachers. Stress was measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. Results Low stress scores (0-13) were seen in 43% of teachers, 55% had moderate stress scores (14-26), and 2% had high stress scores (27-40). Teaching was reported as a stressor by only 8%, whereas administrative work, lifestyle, family responsibilities, finances, patient care, professional jealousy, competition, and frequently changing norms were more commonly reported stressors. The overt focus on entrance test preparation, over-reliance on mobile phones, short attention span, poor listening skills, lack of interpersonal skills, lack of initiative to acquire clinical skills, lack of punctuality, and transactional nature toward learning were some of the perceived faults in the attitude of medical students as reported by the teachers.

PRESENTATION OF CASE A 21-year-old woman presented with periumbilical discharge and pain on urination. Contrast enhanced CT and MRI showed an abscess in the umbilical region that was connected to the bladder via a long tube-like structure. It was diagnosed as an infected urachal sinus. Partial excision of the umbilical fossa followed by dissection of the urachal remnant was easily performed using the abdominal wall-lift laparoscopy from the umbilicus down to the bladder without pneumoperitoneum or additional trocar placement. A Pfannenstiel incision was made above the pubis to get access to the junction between the urachal remnant and the bladder. Under direct vision, we succeeded in accurately dividing the remnant tract, and we adequately closed the bladder opening with absorbable sutures. This method has the advantage of easily closing peritoneal defects after excision of the urachal remnant with direct sutures under a laparoscopic view from the umbilicus. Cosmetic satisfaction was obtained postoperatively.

This open-label trial was designed to collect preliminary data regarding the feasibility, tolerability, and efficacy of deep propofol anesthesia for treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants with moderate-to-severe medication-resistant depression (age 18-45 years and otherwise healthy) each received a series of 10 propofol infusions. Propofol was dosed to strongly suppress electroencephalographic activity for 15 minutes. The primary depression outcome was the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Self-rated depression scores were compared with a group of 20 patients who received electroconvulsive therapy. Results Propofol treatments were well tolerated by all subjects. No serious adverse events occurred. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores remained stable. Hamilton scores decreased by a mean of 20 points (range 0-45 points), corresponding to a mean 58% improvement from baseline (range 0-100%). Six of the 10 subjects met the criteria for response (>50% improvement). Self-rated depression improved similarly in the propofol group and electroconvulsive therapy group. Five of the 6 propofol responders remained well for at least 3 months. In posthoc analyses, electroencephalographic measures predicted clinical response to propofol. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that high-dose propofol treatment is feasible and well tolerated by individuals with treatment-resistant depression who are otherwise healthy. Propofol may trigger rapid, durable antidepressant effects similar to electroconvulsive therapy but with fewer side effects. Controlled studies are warranted to further evaluate propofol's antidepressant efficacy and mechanisms of action.

Of these, 115 patients (58.1%) underwent bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 104 of whom were tested for respiratory viruses by BAL fluid reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Nasopharyngeal specimen RT-PCR was performed in 159 patients (84.1%). Seventy-one patients (35.9%) had a bacterial infection, and 72 patients (36.4%) had a viral infection. Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (23.6%), followed by parainfluenza virus (20.8%), human metapneumovirus (18.1%), influenza virus (16.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (13.9%). Respiratory syncytial virus was significantly more common in the CAP group (CAP, 10.9%; HCAP, 2.2%; P = 0.01). The mortalities of patients with bacterial infections, viral infections, and bacterial-viral coinfections were not significantly different (25.5, 26.5, and 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS Viruses are frequently found in the airway of patients with pneumonia requiring ICU admission and may cause severe forms of pneumonia. Patients with viral infection and bacterial infection had comparable mortality rates.","Choi, Sang-Ho; Hong, Sang-Bum; Ko, Gwang-Beom; Lee, Yumi; Park, Hyun Jung; Park, So-Youn; Moon, Song Mi; Cho, Oh-Hyun; Park, Ki-Ho; Chong, Yong Pil; Kim, Sung-Han; Huh, Jin Won; Sung, Heungsup; Do, Kyung-Hyun; Lee, Sang-Oh; Kim, Mi-Na; Jeong, Jin-Yong; Lim, Chae-Man; Kim, Yang Soo; Woo, Jun Hee; Koh, Younsuck",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,208,24

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study (1996-2016). ANIMALS Fourteen Holstein cattle. METHODS Medical records of cows treated at 3 academic surgical referral centers with duodenoduodenostomy for duodenal obstruction secondary to adhesions associated with the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum were reviewed. Data that were collected included signalment, physical examination results, laboratory results, diagnostic findings, treatments, and survival to discharge. Owners were contacted for follow-up information. RESULTS Affected cattle ranged in age from 4 months to 5 years. Electrolyte abnormalities, including severe hypochloremia, were present in all cases. Abnormalities included cranial duodenal distension without concurrent distension of the descending duodenum and palpable focal adhesions in the region of the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum. Duodenoduodenostomy involved a stapled (n = 11) or sutured (n = 3) side-to-side anastomosis between the cranial duodenum and descending duodenum. Thirteen of 14 cattle that were treated with duodenoduodenostomy survived to hospital discharge. Long-term follow-up was available in 8 cows, and 7 of those 8 survived for at least 1 year. CONCLUSION Short- and long-term survival were favorable after duodenoduodenostomy in cattle with adhesions associated with the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Duodenoduodenostomy results in acceptable survival and future productivity in cows with obstruction at the sigmoid flexure of the duodenum.","Hackett, Eileen S; Lang, Hayley M; Desrochers, Andre; Nichols, Sylvain; Fubini, Susan Lawson",Veterinary surgery : VS,208,19

At this early stage, the mechanisms underpinning COVID-19 are still subject to intense scrutiny and the long-term mental health consequences as a result of the disease are unknown. Here we discuss the hypothesis that patients who survive severe COVID-19 and who experience significant activation of the immune system, are at greater risk of developing depression. We posit that a phenomenon known as cytokine storm dramatically activates the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), resulting in the increase in kynurenine metabolites. Kynurenine is metabolized by IDO-1 in the brain, producing chemokines, in which a prolonged exposure may result long-term brain impairment. In this article, we also propose the possibility that a SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion increases the local levels of angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 down-regulation. Thereby, angiotensin II could increase kynurenine metabolites producing pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory effects, resulting in impairment of cognitive function, enhanced oxidative stress and decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor. It is our premise that patients who experience such a cytokine storm may be at increased risk of long-term mental illness, such as depression.","Bouças, Ana P; Rheinheimer, Jakeline; Lagopoulos, Jim","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",208,11

METHODS This was a post hoc analysis of the Recovery by Endovascular Salvage for Cerebral Ultra-acute Embolism Japan Registry 2. Among 2420 patients in the registry, we evaluated patients with isolated M2 occlusion and those with functional independence before the stroke. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate and compare clinical outcomes between EVT and medical treatment. Additional propensity score-matched (PSM) analyses were performed. We performed subgroup analyses of the primary outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 at 90 days) using forest plots of treatment effects. RESULTS Overall, 372 patients with M2 occlusion (n=184 EVT; n=188, medical treatment) were evaluated. The EVT group had a higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (median (IQR), 15 [9-19] vs 10 [5-16]) and earlier onset to hospital door time (110 [50-258] vs 150 [60-343] min) than the medical treatment group. After adjustment, EVT was significantly associated with higher odds of primary outcome (adjusted OR=2.09; 95% CI 1.26 to 3.47) and lower odds of mortality at 90 days (adjusted OR= 0.27; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93). After PSM analyses (184 patients were 1:1 matched with each group), EVT was effective and safe relative to medical treatment. Effects favoring EVT were present in several subgroups of interest. CONCLUSION In patients with M2 occlusion, our registry suggests that EVT is effective and safe.","Miura, Masatomo; Yoshimura, Shinichi; Sakai, Nobuyuki; Yamagami, Hiroshi; Uchida, Kazutaka; Nagao, Yoichiro; Morimoto, Takeshi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,208,26

DESIGN Multicenter observational cohort study. SETTING Seven ICUs in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, one region across Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany. PATIENTS Consecutive COVID-19 patients supported in the ICU during the first pandemic wave. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory values, and outcome data were retrieved after ethical approval and data-sharing agreements. Descriptive statistics were performed to investigate country-related practice variation. From March 2, 2020, to August 12, 2020, 551 patients were admitted. Mean age was 65.4 ± 11.2 years, and 29% were female. At admission, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were 15.0 ± 5.5, 16.8 ± 5.5, and 15.8 ± 5.3 (p = 0.002), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 4.4 ± 2.7, 7.4 ± 2.2, and 7.7 ± 3.2 (p < 0.001) in the Belgian, Dutch, and German parts of Euregio, respectively. The ICU mortality rate was 22%, 42%, and 44%, respectively (p < 0.001). Large differences were observed in the frequency of organ support, antimicrobial/inflammatory therapy application, and ICU capacity. Mixed-multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that differences in ICU mortality were independent of age, sex, disease severity, comorbidities, support strategies, therapies, and complications. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs within one region, the Euregio Meuse-Rhine, differed significantly in general characteristics, applied interventions, and outcomes despite presumed genetic and socioeconomic background, admission diagnosis, access to international literature, and data collection are similar. Variances in healthcare systems' organization, particularly ICU capacity and admission criteria, combined with a rapidly spreading pandemic might be important drivers for the observed differences.

When POC TTE is performed by the hepatologist or intensivist in the intensive care unit (ICU), and interpreted remotely by a cardiologist, it can rule out cardiovascular conditions that may be contributing to undifferentiated shock, such as diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, regional wall motion abnormalities and pulmonary embolism. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a delay in seeking medical treatment, reduced invasive interventions and deferment in referrals leading to ""collateral damage"" in critically ill patients with liver disease. Thus, the use of telemedicine in the ICU (Tele-ICU) has integrated cardiology, intensive care, and hepatology practices across the spectrum of ICU, operating room, and transplant healthcare. Telecardiology tools have improved bedside diagnosis when introduced as part of COVID-19 care by remote supervision and interpretation of POCUS and echocardiographic data. In this review, we present the contemporary approach of using POC echocardiography and offer a practical guide for primary care hepatologists and gastroenterologists for cardiac assessment in critically ill patients with cirrhosis and ACLF. Evidenced based use of Tele-ICU can prevent delay in cardiac diagnosis, optimize safe use of expert resources and ensure timely care in the setting of critically ill cirrhosis, ACLF and liver transplantation in the COVID-19 era.","Premkumar, Madhumita; Kajal, Kamal; Kulkarni, Anand V; Gupta, Ankur; Divyaveer, Smita",Journal of intensive care medicine,208,1

Thromboembolic events have a higher incidence among patients with COVID-19, but there are few reports on the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. The objectives of this meta-analysis were to explore the relationship between the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and thromboembolic events. MATERIALS AND METHODS Medline (PubMed), the Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for case-control studies that included data on vein thrombosis in patients with COVID-19 and were published in English, between January 1 and July 25, 2020. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the included data were confirmed, the prognoses of patients with and without concurrent thromboembolic events were compared, and the odds ratio (OR) was used as the effect size. RESULTS Eighteen studies (2,030 patients) were included. Thromboembolic events complicated a total of 609 COVID-19 patients. The combined OR of the mortality of COVID-19 patients with thromboembolic events was 1.93 (95% CI: 1.13-3.27), that of ICU treatment rate was 2.63 (95% CI: 1.49-4.67), and that of treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation was 3.14 (95% CI: 1.97-5.02). CONCLUSIONS As compared with COVID-19 patients with and without thromboembolism, the mortality, ICU treatment rate, and invasive mechanical ventilation treatment rate of COVID-19 patients with thromboembolism were found to be increased significantly, and the prognosis was worse.","Wang, C; Zhang, H; Zhou, M; Cheng, Y; Ye, L; Chen, J; Wang, M; Feng, Z",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,208,1

AIM The aim of this audit was to assess the utility of our end-of-life care plan, and specifically the effectiveness of our standardised end-of-life care treatment algorithms, in dying patients with COVID-19. DESIGN The audit primarily involved data extraction from the end-of-life care plan, which includes four hourly nursing (ward nurses) assessments of specific problems: patients with problems were managed according to standardised treatment algorithms, and the intervention was deemed to be effective if the problem was not present at subsequent assessments. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS This audit was undertaken at a general hospital in England, covered the 8 weeks from 16 March to 11 May 2020 and included all inpatients with COVID-19 who had an end-of-life care plan (and died). RESULTS Sixty-one patients met the audit criteria: the commonest problem was shortness of breath (57.5%), which was generally controlled with conservative doses of morphine (10-20 mg/24 h via a syringe pump). Cough and audible respiratory secretions were relatively uncommon. The second most common problem was agitation/delirium (55.5%), which was generally controlled with standard pharmacological interventions. The cumulative number of patients with shortness of breath, agitation and audible respiratory secretions increased over the last 72 h of life, but most patients were symptom controlled at the point of death. CONCLUSION Patients dying of COVID-19 experience similar end-of-life problems to other groups of patients. Moreover, they generally respond to standard interventions for these end-of-life problems.","Alderman, Bryony; Webber, Katherine; Davies, Andrew",Palliative medicine,208,11

Their uniqueness begs for stratified analyses, but this has largely been precluded by their rarity. We sought to summarize the anatomic, presentation, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes of patients with these lesions. METHODS We reviewed our prospectively maintained institutional database to identify patients diagnosed with ethmoidal dAVFs from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2015. We evaluated demographic, presentation, angiographic, treatment, and follow-up data. RESULTS In total, 27 patients with ethmoidal dAVFs underwent endovascular and/or surgical treatment. Mean patient age was 62 years old and there was a male sex predilection (67% men; 2:1 male-female ratio). All dAVFs exhibited direct cortical venous drainage; venous ectasia was present in 59% of cases. Of the dAVFs, 30% drained posteriorly into the basal vein of Rosenthal or the sylvian veins. Embolization with casting of the draining vein was successful in 2 of 9 cases (22%), including 1 successful transvenous case. There were no clinical or permanent complications from embolization; specifically, no patients experienced visual loss after treatment. Surgical treatment with successful dAVF obliteration was carried out in 24 of 24 patients (100%). One patient declined surgical treatment after attempted endovascular embolization. There were no permanent complications after surgical treatment and no cases of wound infection or cerebrospinal fluid leakage. CONCLUSIONS Surgical disconnection remains the gold standard in the treatment of ethmoidal dAVFs. Embolization is a consideration for well-selected cases with favorable arterial or venous access anatomy.","Gross, Bradley A; Moon, Karam; Kalani, M Yashar S; Albuquerque, Felipe C; McDougall, Cameron G; Nakaji, Peter; Zabramski, Joseph M; Spetzler, Robert F",World neurosurgery,208,27

Estimates of the burden of PLP have provided conflicting data. To obtain a robust estimate of the burden of PLP, we gathered and critically appraised the literature on the prevalence and risk factors associated with PLP in people with limb amputations. METHODS Articles published between 1980 and July 2019 were identified through a systematic search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Academic Search Premier. Grey literature was searched on databases for preprints. Two reviewers independently conducted the screening of articles, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The meta-analyses were conducted using the random effects model. A statistically significant level for the analyses was set at p<0.05. RESULTS The pooling of all studies demonstrated a prevalence estimate of 64% [95% CI: 60.01-68.05] with high heterogeneity [I2 = 95.95% (95% CI: 95.10-96.60)]. The prevalence of PLP was significantly lower in developing countries compared to developed countries [53.98% vs 66.55%; p = 0.03]. Persistent pre-operative pain, proximal site of amputation, stump pain, lower limb amputation and phantom sensations were identified as risk factors for PLP. CONCLUSION This systematic review and meta-analysis estimates that six of every 10 people with an amputation report PLP-a high and important prevalence of PLP.

Objectives To determine the pattern of injuries amongst tennis players in Accra. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 142 male and female participants selected from tennis clubs in Accra and the Accra sports stadium. A standardised tennis injury report form was used to obtain data from participants. Data on the parts of the body mostly injured and the types of injury mostly sustained by the players were summarised and presented appropriately with the use of graphs and pie charts. Assessment of the causes underlying the prevailing injuries to tennis players was also tabulated and comparisons made. Results Out of a total of 170 injuries recorded, knee (39 [27.5%]) and shoulder (31 [21.1%]) injuries were the most commonly sustained. Most (80 [56.3%]) tennis injuries occurred during training. Other injuries (26 [18.3%]) occurred during competitions or tournaments whilst 26 (18.3%) occurred during social play. About 10 (7.0%) participants were not certain of the type of activity at the time of injury. The majority (35 [24.65%]) of the players received no treatment for their injuries. However, few of the injuries (20 [14.08%], 14 [9.86%], 6 [4.23%]) sustained were treated by medical personnel, physiotherapists or nurses respectively. There was no association between warm-up before play and cause of injury (p = 0.375). There was also no association between shoe type and cause of injury (p = 0.253). Conclusion The majority of the injuries occurred in the upper and lower limbs. Most of these injuries occurred during training with overuse and overexertion being the most common cause.

By the assessment of conventionally relevant parameters of cardiac function obtained through our numerical simulations, we propose a computational model to effectively reveal the interactions between the cardiac and pulmonary functions in virtual subjects with normal and impaired cardiac function at baseline affected by mild or severe COVID-19.","Dedè, Luca; Regazzoni, Francesco; Vergara, Christian; Zunino, Paolo; Guglielmo, Marco; Scrofani, Roberto; Fusini, Laura; Cogliati, Chiara; Pontone, Gianluca; Quarteroni, Alfio",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,208,17

Here, we report 33 distinct 8-mer/9-mer peptides that are identical between SARS-CoV-2 and the human reference proteome. We benchmark this observation against other viral-human 8-mer/9-mer peptide identity, which suggests generally similar extents of molecular mimicry for SARS-CoV-2 and many other human viruses. Interestingly, 20 novel human peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 have not been observed in any previous coronavirus strains (HCoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS). Furthermore, four of the human 8-mer/9-mer peptides mimicked by SARS-CoV-2 map onto HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*40:02, and HLA-B*35:01 binding peptides from human PAM, ANXA7, PGD, and ALOX5AP proteins. This mimicry of multiple human proteins by SARS-CoV-2 is made salient by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analysis that shows the targeted genes significantly expressed in human lungs and arteries; tissues implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, HLA-A*03 restricted 8-mer peptides are found to be shared broadly by human and coronaviridae helicases in functional hotspots, with potential implications for nucleic acid unwinding upon initial infection. This study presents the first scan of human peptide mimicry by SARS-CoV-2, and via its benchmarking against human-viral mimicry more broadly, presents a computational framework for follow-up studies to assay how evolutionary tinkering may relate to zoonosis and herd immunity.","Venkatakrishnan, A J; Kayal, Nikhil; Anand, Praveen; Badley, Andrew D; Church, George M; Soundararajan, Venky",Cell death discovery,208,1

An in-depth investigation of the amino acid substitutions in the genomic signature of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is highly essential for understanding its host adaptation and infection biology. A total of 9587 SARS-CoV-2 structural protein sequences collected from 49 different countries are used to characterize protein-wise variants, substitution patterns (type and location), and major substitution changes. The majority of the substitutions are distinct, mostly in a particular location, and leads to a change in amino acid's biochemical properties. In terms of mutational changes, Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) proteins are relatively stable than Nucleocapsid (N) and Spike (S) proteins. Several co-occurrence substitutions are observed, particularly in S and N proteins. Substitution specific to active sub-domains reveals that Heptapeptide Repeat, Fusion peptides, Transmembrane in S protein, and N-terminal and C-terminal domains in N protein are remarkably mutated. We also observe a few deleterious mutations in the above domains. The overall study on non-synonymous mutation in structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 at early in the pandemic indicates a diversity amongst virus sequences.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Roy, Swarup",Genome,208,1

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of viral and intracellular respiratory pathogens in children with SCD presenting with fever and/or ACS. MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, prospective, single-centre cohort study with nested case-control analysis was conducted on children with SCD admitted from October 2016 to October 2017 for fever and/or ACS to the paediatric department of Robert Debré university hospital, Paris, France. They were screened for 20 respiratory pathogens by a multiplex PCR in the nasopharynx (FilmArray). RESULTS We included 101 children. M/F sex ratio of 0.45. The median age was 3.2 years (IQR: 1.4-8.2). At least one pathogen was isolated in 67 patients (67%). The most frequent viruses were as follows: rhinovirus (n=33), adenovirus (n=14), respiratory syncytial virus (n=13) and parainfluenza viruses (n=11). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was detected in one case. Twenty-three (23%) presented with or developed ACS. A nested case-control analysis was performed, after pairing ACS with non-ACS children for age and inclusion period. There was no statistical association between any viral detection or multiple viral infection, and ACS (p=0.51) even though parainfluenza viruses were twice as common in ACS. CONCLUSIONS Viral detection in febrile children with SCD is frequent, but its association with ACS was not demonstrated. In this study, M. pneumoniae was rare in young children with SCD experiencing ACS.","Ploton, Marie-Caroline; Sommet, Julie; Koehl, Bérengère; Gaschignard, Jean; Holvoet, Laurent; Mariani-Kurkdjian, Patricia; Benkerrou, Malika; Le Roux, Enora; Bonacorsi, Stephane; Faye, Albert",Archives of disease in childhood,208,1

In addition to an antitumor effect, IFNs show antiangiogenic activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of IFN-α and IFN-β on human micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells in vitro [human micro vascular lung endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) and human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC)]. By immunohistochemical staining and quantitative reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction, we studied expression of type I IFN receptors. We evaluated the effects of IFN-α and IFN-β on the proliferation (DNA content), apoptosis (DNA fragmentation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and cell cycle distribution (flow-cytometric analysis) of endothelial cells. HUVEC and HMVEC-L cells show comparable expression level of the distinct IFN receptor subtypes. Proliferation of HMVEC-L and HUVEC was inhibited by IFN-β (the half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 60 and 90 IU/mL, respectively), but not by IFN-α at a dose up to 1,000 IU/mL. An interesting and unexpected observation was an inhibition of apoptosis by IFN-β. After 72 h of treatment with IFN-β. Cell cycle inhibition occurs in late S-phase in both cell lines. In conclusion, only IFN-β, not IFN-α (10-1,000 IU/mL), has an inhibitory activity on endothelial cell proliferation. Surprisingly, apoptosis was decreased by IFN treatment, whereas inhibition of proliferation is caused by cell cycle arrest in late S-phase.","Erdmann, Joris; Vitale, Giovanni; van Koetsveld, Peter M; Croze, Ed; Sprij-Mooij, Diane M; Hofland, Leo J; van Eijck, Casper H J",Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,208,1

Virus infection induces the remodeling of intracellular membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentration of the components that are required for replication and provide a scaffold for tethering the replicase complexes. However, the mechanisms underlying virus-induced membrane remodeling are poorly understood. RNA replication of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a positive-strand RNA plant virus, is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and ER morphology is perturbed in RCNMV-infected cells. Here, we identified ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in the affinity-purified RCNMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fraction. Arf1 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, small GTPase that is implicated in the formation of the coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles on Golgi membranes. Using in vitro pulldown and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, we showed that Arf1 interacted with the viral p27 replication protein within the virus-induced large punctate structures of the ER membrane. We found that inhibition of the nucleotide exchange activity of Arf1 using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the assembly of the viral replicase complex and p27-mediated ER remodeling. We also showed that BFA treatment and the expression of dominant negative Arf1 mutants compromised RCNMV RNA replication in protoplasts. Interestingly, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1, a key regulator of the biogenesis of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites, also compromised RCNMV RNA replication. These results suggest that the replication of RCNMV depends on the host membrane traffic machinery.","Hyodo, Kiwamu; Mine, Akira; Taniguchi, Takako; Kaido, Masanori; Mise, Kazuyuki; Taniguchi, Hisaaki; Okuno, Tetsuro",Journal of virology,208,5

In adults, high sodium intake is associated with elevated blood pressure. In children, experimental studies have shown that reducing sodium intake can reduce blood pressure. However, their external validity is limited, notably because the sodium reduction was substantial and not applicable in a real-life setting. Observational studies, on the other hand, allow assess the association between blood pressure and sodium intake across usual levels of consumption. There is also evidence that the association differs between subgroups of children according to age and body weight. Our objective is to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of experimental and observational studies on the association between sodium intake and blood pressure in children and adolescents and to assess whether the association differs according to age and body weight. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and CENTRAL databases will be conducted and supplemented by a manual search of bibliographies and unpublished studies. Experimental and observational studies involving children or adolescents between 0 and 18 years of age will be included. The exposure will be dietary sodium intake, estimated using different methods including urinary sodium excretion. The outcomes will be systolic and diastolic blood pressure, elevated blood pressure and hypertension. If appropriate, meta-analyses will be performed by pooling data across all studies together and separately for experimental and observational studies. Subgroup meta-analyses by age and body weight will be also conducted. Moreover, separate meta-analyses for different sodium intake levels will be conducted to investigate the dose-response relationship. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION This systematic review and meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

A cross-sectional ecological study was performed in which the units of analysis were the country's Health Regions. Data were obtained from Brazilian Health Informatics Department - DATASUS (National Registry of Healthcare Establishments - 2019, Mortality Information Systems - 2017, and Population Projections - 2017). We calculated the disease group-specific mortality rates for hypertension, neoplasms, diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases and the rates of total ICU beds, private ICU beds, ICU beds in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS), and ventilators in the SUS, per 100,000 inhabitants. The mortality profile was determined by latent profiles analysis, and the cluster analysis of ICU beds and ventilators used the spatial scan method. Kernel maps were constructed for the data's visualization. Level of significance was set at 5%. Four latent mortality profiles were observed. The Health Regions with the highest mean mortality rates were located in regions with shortages of ICU beds and ventilators, especially in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, and South of Brazil.

Public health initiatives endeavor to raise public awareness about acute stroke to improve triage for emergency treatment, and the medical community is working to develop stroke services at community and academic medical centers throughout the United States. There is an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–approved pathway for training in endovascular surgical neuroradiology, the specialty designed to train physicians specifically to treat cerebrovascular diseases. Primary and comprehensive stroke center designations have been defined, yet questions remain about the best delivery model. Telemedicine is available to help community medical centers cope with the complexity of stroke triage and treatment. Should comprehensive care be provided at every community center, or should patients with complex medical needs be triaged to major stroke centers with high-level surgical,intensive care, and endovascular capabilities? Although the answers to these and other questions about stroke care delivery remain unanswered owing to the paucity of empirical data, we are convinced that stroke care regionalization is crucial for delivery of high-quality comprehensive ischemic stroke treatment. A stroke team available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week requires specialty skills in stroke neurology, endovascular surgical neuroradiology, neurosurgery, neurointensive care, anesthesiology, nursing, and technical support for optimal success. Several physician groups with divergent training backgrounds (i.e., interventional neuroradiology, neurosurgery,neurology, peripheral interventional radiology, and cardiology) lay claim to the treatment of stroke patients,particularly the endovascular or interventional methods. Few would challenge neurologists over the responsibility for emergency evaluation and triage of stroke victims for intra intravenous fibrinolysis, even though emergency physicians are most commonly the first to evaluate these patients. There are many unanswered questions about the role of imaging in defining best treatment. Perfusion imaging with CT or MRI appears to have relevance even though its role remains undefined and is the subject of ongoing research. Meanwhile, investigators are exploring new, and perhaps more specific,imaging methods with cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and cellular acid-base imbalance. There are currently 6 ongoing trials of stroke intervention, many with proprietary technologies and private funding, competing for the same patient population as multicenter trials funded by the NIH. At the same time, much of the interventional stroke treatment currently occurs outside of trials in the community and academic settings without the collection of much-needed data. Market forces will certainly shape future stroke therapy, but it is unclear whether the current combination of private and public funding for these endeavors is the best method of development.","Meyers, Philip M; Schumacher, H Christian; Connolly, E Sander; Heyer, Eric J; Gray, William A; Higashida, Randall T",Circulation,208,30

Those with recent cancer diagnosis were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection (aOR, 7.14 [95% CI, 6.91-7.39]; P < .001), with the strongest association for recently diagnosed leukemia (aOR, 12.16 [95% CI, 11.03-13.40]; P < .001), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 8.54 [95% CI, 7.80-9.36]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 7.66 [95% CI, 7.07-8.29]; P < .001) and weakest for thyroid cancer (aOR, 3.10 [95% CI, 2.47-3.87]; P < .001). Among patients with recent cancer diagnosis, African Americans had a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 infection than White patients; this racial disparity was largest for breast cancer (aOR, 5.44 [95% CI, 4.69-6.31]; P < .001), followed by prostate cancer (aOR, 5.10 [95% CI, 4.34-5.98]; P < .001), colorectal cancer (aOR, 3.30 [95% CI, 2.55-4.26]; P < .001), and lung cancer (aOR, 2.53 [95% CI, 2.10-3.06]; P < .001). Patients with cancer and COVID-19 had significantly worse outcomes (hospitalization, 47.46%; death, 14.93%) than patients with COVID-19 without cancer (hospitalization, 24.26%; death, 5.26%) (P < .001) and patients with cancer without COVID-19 (hospitalization, 12.39%; death, 4.03%) (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance In this case-control study, patients with cancer were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 infection and worse outcomes, which was further exacerbated among African Americans. These findings highlight the need to protect and monitor patients with cancer as part of the strategy to control the pandemic.","Wang, QuanQiu; Berger, Nathan A; Xu, Rong",JAMA oncology,208,20

We identified and characterized EVs from Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite and a human pathogen. Conditioned medium from amebic parasites contained particles consistent with the expected size and morphology of EVs. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the EV proteome and showed that it was enriched in common exosome marker proteins including proteins associated with vesicle formation, cell-signaling, metabolism, and cytoskeletal proteins. Additionally, the EVs were found to selectively package small RNAs (sRNA), which were protected within the vesicles against RNase treatment. Sequencing analysis of the sRNA contained in EVs revealed that the majority were 27nt in size and represented a subset of the cellular antisense small RNA population that has previously been characterized in Entamoeba RNAi pathway proteins, including Argonaute were also present in amebic EVs. Interestingly, we found that the amebic EVs impact inter-cellular communication between parasites and altered encystation efficiency. EVs isolated from encysting parasites promoted encystation in other parasites whereas EVs from metabolically active trophozoites impeded encystation. Overall, the data reveals that Entamoeba secrete EVs that are similar in size and shape to previously characterized exosomes from other organisms and that these EVs contain a defined protein and small RNA cargo and have roles in intercellular communication amongst parasites and influence growth kinetics.","Sharma, Manu; Morgado, Pedro; Zhang, Hanbang; Ehrenkaufer, Gretchen; Manna, Dipak; Singh, Upinder",Infection and immunity,208,20

This systemic review summarizes and synthesizes findings from studies relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and stroke risk, severity, and outcome; potential mechanisms explaining such a relationship; and outcomes from vitamin D supplementation. The literature shows that vitamin D deficiency is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, with sun exposure, sex, age, race, diabetes, and genetics playing a role as well. Stroke severity and short- and long-term outcomes also worsen with vitamin D deficiency. The neuroprotective mechanisms by which vitamin D operates to mitigate stroke onset and outcomes have yet to be fully studied, but researchers have proposed several pathways, including promotion of certain neuroprotective growth factors, reduction of arterial pressure through vasodilation, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation could lower stroke risk and improve recovery, though outcomes can also be negligible or negative. Although results are mixed and the limitations of vitamin D supplementation merit some caution, vitamin D overall plays a significant role in stroke health. Future research should further develop understanding of the neuroprotective mechanisms of vitamin D and study how supplementation could be administered effectively in stroke treatment.","Yarlagadda, Keerthi; Ma, Nicholas; Doré, Sylvain",Frontiers in neurology,208,16

We sought to investigate whether these genetic susceptibility variants could be replicated in the Chinese Han population. METHODS We genotyped 38 independent loci in 495 Chinese sporadic PD patients and 470 unrelated controls and performed allelic and genotypic association test using chi-square tests or Armitage test for trend. Polygenic risk score (PRS) models were built to evaluate the cumulative effects of the selected SNPs. RESULTS We found that the rs11610045 of FBRSL1(p=0.02, OR=0.63, allele model), rs76116224 of KCNS3 (p<0.01, OR=0.09, allele model), and the rs2248244 of DYRK1A (p=0.02, OR=1.35, allele model) were significantly associated with PD. The PRS model of cumulative effects of the SNPs associated with PD in our study had the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.61. CONCLUSIONS Our study revealed that rs11610045 of FBRSL1, rs76116224 of KCNS3 and rs2248244 of DYRK1A showed an impact on the risk of PD, and the GWAS-derived PRS models we built had predictive value for PD risk in the Chinese population. Further studies are needed to explore the pathogenesis of these potentially risk-associated variants.","Zheng, Ran; Qiao, Song; Chen, Ying; Jin, Chongyao; Fang, Yi; Lin, Zhihao; Xue, Naijia; Yan, Yiqun; Gu, Luyan; Gao, Ting; Tian, Jun; Yan, Yaping; Yin, Xinzhen; Pu, Jiali; Zhang, Baorong",Neuroscience letters,208,31

This case represents an extraordinarily rare primary hyperfunctioning NET of the appendix with a clinical presentation of symptomatic hypoglycemia in an otherwise healthy man. CASE PRESENTATION A previously healthy 34-year-old man was found to be symptomatically hypoglycemic in early 2018. After the workup, the apparent explanation was a tumor in his midappendix, for which he was referred to our surgical oncology service for resection. The patient's clinical course is described in detail, including imaging, as well as surgical and pathologic descriptions of the appendiceal NET. DISCUSSION A literature review demonstrates no other case series or reports of a primary hyperfunctioning NET of the appendix presenting with hypoglycemic crisis. The symptoms of tumor-induced hypoglycemia more typically arise with islet cell tumors, such as pancreatic NETs or insulinomas. We believe this case represents a nonislet cell tumor-induced hypoglycemia. This patient's elevated serum proinsulin level preoperatively implies secretion of proinsulin by the tumor. However, tumor-induced hypoglycemia caused by proinsulin has been described previously only in pancreatic tumors. This unique case adds knowledge to the possible glycemic endocrine effects of nonpancreatic NETs, specifically those that arise primarily in the appendix.","Layman, Peter F; Davis-Merritt, Deborah; Neff, Phillip",The Permanente journal,208,7

IgG4-RD in the stomach is rare, and occasionally diagnosed as gastric subepithelial tumor (SET) by endoscopy or computed tomography scan. Two female patients in the age group of 40-50 years were diagnosed with 4 cm sized gastric SET. One underwent laparoscopic gastric wedge resection. Another one had a history of subtotal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with oral steroids administration. She underwent a completion total gastrectomy with splenectomy for the gastric SET and ITP. The pathology showed storiform fibrosis, and IgG4 was positive in immunohistochemistry (IHC) stain. IgG4-RD is known as a medical disease that could be treated with oral steroids. The difficulty in preoperative diagnosis of the disease occasionally causes unnecessary gastric resection.

Although studies analyzing humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 were available rather early during the pandemic, cellular immunity came into focus of investigations just recently. For the present work, we have adapted a protocol designed for the detection of rare neoantigen-specific memory T cells in cancer patients for studying cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected after 6 d of in vitro expansion using overlapping peptide libraries representing the whole viral protein. The assay readout was an intracellular cytokine staining and flow cytometric analysis detecting four functional markers simultaneously (CD154, TNF, IL-2, and IFN-γ). We were able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 10 of 10 COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. All patients had reactive T cells against at least 1 of 12 analyzed viral Ags, and all patients had Spike-specific T cells. Although some Ags were detected by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, VME1 was mainly recognized by CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we were not able to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in 18 unexposed healthy individuals. When we stimulated the same samples overnight, we measured significant numbers of cytokine-producing cells even in unexposed individuals. Our comparison showed that the stimulation conditions can profoundly impact the activation readout in unexposed individuals. We are presenting a highly specific diagnostic tool for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells.","Zelba, Henning; Worbs, David; Harter, Johannes; Pieper, Natalia; Kyzirakos-Feger, Christina; Kayser, Simone; Seibold, Marcel; Bartsch, Oliver; Ködding, Jiri; Biskup, Saskia",Journal of immunology,208,33

Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) variants in Brazil were isolated during 2010-2015 for epidemiological and molecular analysis to characterise the different variants and perform a bioinformatic analysis to compare with sequences of variants collected over the previous 40 years. 2. Of the 453 samples examined, 61.4% were positive for IBV and 75.9% of these were considered to have the BR-I genotype and were detected in birds of all ages distributed in all five Brazilian regions. 3. The ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), i.e. dN/dS, revealed a predominance of codons with non-synonymous substitutions in the first third of the S1 gene and a dN/dS ratio of 0.67. Additionally, prediction of N-glycosylation sites showed that most of the BR-I variants (from 2003 to early 2014) had an extra site at amino acid position 20, whereas the newest variants lacked this extra site. 4. These results suggest that Brazilian IBV variants probably underwent drastic mutations at various points between 1983 and 2003 and that the selection processes became silent after achieving a sufficiently effective antigenic structure for invasion and replication in their hosts. Brazilian IBV genotype BR-I is currently the predominant genotype circulating in Brazil and South America.","Carranza, Claudia; Astolfi-Ferreira, Claudete S; Santander Parra, Silvana H; Nuñez, Luis F N; Penzes, Zoltan; Chacón, Jorge L; Sesti, Luiz; Chacón, Ruy D; Piantino Ferreira, Antonio J",British poultry science,208,16

AIM OF THE STUDY To report the remodeling of the Vascular Surgery Department of San Raffaele Hospital as regards the strategies of preparation, escalation, and return to normal activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. PREPARATION, ESCALATION, DE-ESCALATION The Regional Authority of Lombardy remodeled the hospitalization system to allocate appropriate resources to treat patients with COVID-19 and to identify ""Hub/Spoke"" hospitals for highly specialized medical activities. The Hubs hospitals were required to guarantee full-time evaluation of all patients presenting with cardiovascular diseases with an independent pathway for patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection. San Raffaele Hospital was identified as Hub for cardiovascular emergencies and the Vascular Surgery Department was remodeled to face this epidemic situation. Surgical treatment was reserved only to symptomatic, urgent, or emergent cases. Large areas of the hospital were simultaneously reorganized to assist patients with COVID-19. RESULTS During this period, 135 patients were referred to San Raffaele Vascular Surgery Department. COVID-19 was diagnosed in 24 patients and, among them, acute limb ischemia was the most common cause of admission. At this time, the COVID-19 trend is in decline in Italy, and the local authorities reorganized the healthcare system to return to normal activities avoiding new escalations of COVID-19 cases. The COVID-19 pandemic will be remembered in Lombardy as a cataclysm. Nevertheless, the HUB/spoke system has proven to be a valid model in the management of ischemic emergencies. Continuous surveillance, cooperation, coordination, and communication to effectively respond to COVID-19 pandemic is crucial because COVID-19 reference centers could face similar issues in the near future.","Chiesa, Roberto; Kahlberg, Andrea; Rinaldi, Enrico; Mascia, Daniele",Journal of cardiac surgery,208,1

We investigated the impact of dexmedetomidine on tourniquet-induced systemic effects in total knee arthroplasty. Methods Eighty patients were randomly assigned to either control (CON) or dexmedetomidine (DEX) group. The DEX group received an intravenous loading dose of 0.5 μg/kg DEX over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/h from 10 minutes before the start of surgery until completion. The CON group received the same calculated volume of normal saline. Pain outcomes and metabolic and coagulative changes after tourniquet application and after tourniquet release were investigated. Results The frequency of fentanyl administration postoperatively, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) volume at 24 hours postoperatively, total PCA volume consumed in 48 hours postoperatively, and VAS score for pain at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the CON group. Ten minutes after the tourniquet release, the DEX group showed significantly higher pH and lower lactate level than those in the CON group. Antithrombin III activity and body temperature 10 minutes after tourniquet release were significantly lower in the DEX group than in the CON group. Ca2+, K+, HCO3 -, base excess, and PCO2 levels 10 minutes after tourniquet release were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion We showed that DEX attenuated pain and hemodynamic, metabolic, and coagulative effects induced by the tourniquet. However, these metabolic and coagulative changes were within normal limits. Therefore, DEX could be used as an analgesic adjuvant, but should not be considered for routine use to prevent the systemic effects induced by tourniquet use.","Lee, Cheol; Lee, Cheolhyeong; So, Cheolhwan; Lee, Jiheui; Choi, Insung; Ma, Xiao; Hwang, Jihyo",BioMed research international,208,19

AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY Based on these observations, speculations raised the concerns that ACEIs/ARBs users would be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and would be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 disease and death. Therefore, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of the association between prior use of ACEIs and ARBs and mortality due to COVID-19 disease. DATA SOURCES A comprehensive search of several databases from November 2019 to June 18, 2020 was conducted. The databases included Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, and Scopus. Medrxiv.org was also searched for unpublished data. THERAPEUTIC ADVANCES Nine studies with a total of 18,833 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 met our eligibility criteria. Prior use of ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with reduced mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk (aRR) from 6 studies of 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.42-0.94) (I = 65%). Three studies reported separately on ACEIs or ARBs and their association with survival among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with a pooled adjusted relative risk of 0.78, 95% CI (0.58-1.04) (I = 0%) and 0.97, 95% CI (0.73-1.30) (I = 0%) respectively. The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main analysis. CONCLUSION Our meta-analysis suggests that use of ACEIs/ARBs is associated with a decreased risk of death among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. This finding provides a reassurance to the public not to stop prescribed ACEIs/ARBs because of fear of severe COVID-19.","Kashour, Tarek; Bin Abdulhak, Aref A; Tlayjeh, Haytham; Hassett, Leslie C; Noman, Anas; Mohsen, Ala; Al-Mallah, Mouaz H; Tleyjeh, Imad M",American journal of therapeutics,208,16

As the devices evolve, so too must the techniques. The current generation of stent retriever thrombectomy devices requires five minutes of dwell time, regardless of the particularities of the case. We have noticed the presence of flow through the stent immediately prior to removal portends a lower chance of successful thrombus retrieval than when no flow is seen, regardless of dwell time. We hypothesize that interventionalists can use the presence or absence of flow to predict adequacy of seating time and decrease the number of deployments per case. This could significantly decrease time to recanalization by avoiding time-consuming, unsuccessful pulls. This is a technical report of a few cases of stent retriever thrombectomy.

It offers the option of a one-stage procedure and is felt to have benefits in cosmetic outcome but the medium and long-term outcomes are unknown. METHODS All cases where ADM was used in a breast reconstructive procedure in the Edinburgh Breast Unit from its initial use on 7/7/2008 to 31/7/2012 were reviewed retrospectively. Follow up was completed to 30/11/2012. RESULTS 147 patients received 232 sheets of ADM (156 Strattice, 73 Permacol and 3 Alloderm). Mean follow up was 687 days. In 40 cases unplanned implant explantation occurred (17.2% or 27.2% of patients). 7 of 27 (25.9%) patients requiring adjuvant therapy had this delayed due to problems with the reconstruction. 30 of 80 patients (37.5%) undergoing unilateral surgery have undergone contralateral surgery. Implant loss varied significantly with smoking (34.6% loss rate in smokers vs 13.2% in non-smokers, p = 0.001), with radiotherapy (28.1% loss rate vs 13.8% with no radiotherapy, p = 0.001) and with incision type. There was no statistically significant variation by operating surgeon, type of ADM used, chemotherapy use, patient weight, breast weight or nipple preservation. Patients underwent a mean of 1.54 further operations (range 0-7). CONCLUSIONS While offering potential cosmetic and financial benefits, the use of ADM with implant-based reconstructions has a significant rate of implant loss, further surgery and potential delay in adjuvant therapy. These must be considered when planning treatment and consenting patients.","Barber, M D; Williams, L; Anderson, E D C; Neades, G T; Raine, C; Young, O; Kulkarni, D; Young, I; Dixon, J M",European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology,208,1

A total of 45 cases were divided into three groups based on the drugs used for anesthesia. Before anesthetic induction, BIS and AEP monitors were initiated. Anesthesia was induced through intravenous injection (IV) as follows: MP (n = 15) group, midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV); TP (n = 15) group, thiopental (4 mg/kg IV); and KP (n = 15) group, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV). After loss of response (LOR), an infusion of 3 μg/ml propofol via a target-controlled infusion was initiated in all groups. AepEX and BIS were measured in the waking state (baseline) and at LOR (1 min after LOR), pre-intubation (1 min after previous intubation) and post-intubation (1 min after tracheal intubation finished). The value of aepEX significantly decreased in all groups with LOR and that of BIS also decreased except of KP group. No significant difference were observed in BIS values between baseline and LOR in the KS group. The aepEX might be more useful than BIS for hypnosis monitoring during anesthetic induction, particularly when drugs such as ketamine are used.","Matsushita, Sachiko; Oda, Shinya; Otaki, Kei; Nakane, Masaki; Kawamae, Kaneyuki",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,208,20

However, there has not been enough scientific evidence to prove whether the result is just a profibrotic response or not. We aimed to find the optimal skin rejuvenation device that shows true neocollagenesis. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated dermal collagen thickness and gene expression of procollagen type 1, 3, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) resulting from different energy-based devices in a rat model in vivo. The wound-healing response was evaluated histologically and by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at immediate, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, and 12th week after the initial procedure. RESULTS At the 12th week, the most relevant changes of the dermal thickness were found in specimens after treatment with electrosurgical unit, fractional CO2 and 1064 nm Q-switched Nd:YAG. Procollagen 1 and 3 were also found to be the highest in electrosurgical unit, fractional CO2 , and microneedle radiofrequency. Dramatic changes of MMP-3 and TGF-β were remarkable at the early observation but went back to normal level at 12th week. The ratio of procollagen 1 and 3 was found to be the lowest with Q-Switched Nd:YAG 1064 nm and fractional CO2 . CONCLUSION Electrosurgical unit resulted in most significant changes, but due to irreversible thermal damage and extremely high procollagen results it is considered as a profibrotic response.

Co-occurring mobility issues and vision loss are prevalent in older adults. Vision loss can cause ambulation difficulties and falls. Community-dwelling older adults frequently require mobility-aids assessment by occupational therapists. However, therapists often lack access to medical documentation on vision or training in vision assessment to ensure that clients have adequate vision for safe mobility-aid use. PURPOSE. This study aimed to identify screening and assessment approaches to identify functional vision loss to guide mobility-aid prescription. METHOD. A scoping review following Arksey and O'Malley's five stages was undertaken using Medline and CINAHL databases. A data-charting form was used for extraction of information about each article, including the population, vision diagnosis, and the methodology for vision screening. The data regarding vision loss and mobility of older adults were summarized for each article. FINDINGS. Twenty-three papers were included in the study, describing screening questions and questionnaires or assessment tools to screen for vision loss in community settings. IMPLICATIONS. The various tools identified can better prepare therapists to prescribe mobility aids appropriate for seniors' level of functional vision and to refer clients for further assessment and intervention if warranted.","Petty, Linda S; Foster, Julia E G; Rigby, Patty",Canadian journal of occupational therapy.

METHODS International multicenter review of MIS total nephrectomies for WT between 2006 and 2018. Medical records of confirmed WT were retrospectively assessed for demographic, imaging, treatment, pathology, and oncological outcome data. RESULTS Fifty patients, with a median age of 38 months (6-181), were included in 10 centers. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as per SIOP protocol. Median tumor volume post-chemotherapy was 673 mL (18-3331), 16 tumors crossed the lateral border of the spine, and three crossed the midline. Six patients with tumors that crossed the lateral border of the spine (tumor volumes 1560 mL [299-2480]) were converted to an open approach. There was no intraoperative tumor rupture. Overall, MIS was completed in 19% of the 195 nephrectomies for WT presenting during the study period. Tumor was stage I in 29, II in 16, and III in 5, and histology was reported as low in three, intermediate in 42, and high risk in five. Three patients had positive tumor margins. After a median follow-up of 34 months (2-138), there were two local recurrences (both stage I, intermediate risk, 7 and 9 months after surgery) and one metastatic relapse (stage III, high risk, four months after surgery). The three-year event-free survival was 94%. CONCLUSION MIS is feasible in 20% of WT, with oncological outcomes comparable with open surgery, no intraoperative rupture, and a low rate of local relapse. Ongoing surveillance is, however, needed to evaluate this technique as it becomes widespread.","Bouty, Aurore; Blanc, Thomas; Leclair, Marc David; Lavrand, Frederic; Faure, Alice; Binet, Aurelien; Rod, Julien; O'Brien, Mike; Sarnacki, Sabine; Nightingale, Michael; Heloury, Yves; Varlet, Francois; Scalabre, Aurelien",Pediatric blood & cancer,208,19

DESIGN Prospective study. SETTING Hokkaido University Hospital. PATIENTS Forty-two consecutive Japanese patients who had been treated for a total of 48 clefts according to a strict clinical protocol. Mean age at bone grafting was 6 years 11 months. INTERVENTIONS Bone grafting was performed by harvesting lateral cortical bone plates from the symphysis and/or body and then placing them on the labial and palatal openings of the alveolar process defect. No particulate bone grafts were packed into the bony cavity. Mean follow-up after bone grafting was 37 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Status of the grafted area and eruption of cleft-adjacent teeth were assessed prospectively using computed tomography and periapical radiography. RESULTS At 6 months postoperatively, computed tomography showed sufficient bone bridge formation at the cleft site in 85.4% of clefts. Periapical radiography showed ≥75% of the root surfaces of cleft-adjacent teeth were covered with spanning bone in 83.3% of clefts. In 92.6% of clefts in which the cleft-adjacent canine was uncovered with bone during follow-up, the canines erupted spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS Monocortical mandibular bone grafting appears extremely effective for sufficient bone bridge formation and facilitation of cleft-adjacent teeth eruption. The procedure is advantageous in that the quantity of bone required per unit volume of cleft defect is relatively reduced, and larger clefts can thus be treated.","Mikoya, Tadashi; Inoue, Nobuo; Matsuzawa, Yusuke; Totsuka, Yasunori; Kajii, Takashi S; Hirosawa, Tomoyuki",The Cleft palate-craniofacial journal : official publication of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association,208,2

Mass media campaigns have been used in several countries to reduce this trend. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify, critically appraise and synthesise the findings, including the barriers and enablers, of mass media campaigns directed at lay people to reduce unnecessary CS. Methods We included any study design that reported health communication mass media campaigns directed at lay people with the specific objective of reducing unnecessary CS, created by any agent, in any format. We searched seven electronic databases without language restrictions, from inception to February 2019. Experts in the field were contacted. Results The search yielded 14 320 citations; 50 were selected for full-text reading; and one was included. Six other reports were included. The seven campaigns were conducted in 2009-2017, mostly in Latin America. Most campaigns were independent efforts by non-governmental or activist organisations. Only one campaign conducted formative research and pretested the intervention. All campaigns used indirect communication, mostly through internet channels; two campaigns also used direct communication with the public. None assessed their effects on CS rates. Only two campaigns measured their impacts on participants' knowledge, attitudes and birth preferences but only in the short term. The main barriers were lack of financial and human resources. The main enablers were the enthusiasm of volunteers, the participation of famous persons/celebrities and the involvement of communication professionals. Conclusions There are few mass media campaigns directed at lay people to reduce CS. Most campaigns did not use key principles recommended for the creation and implementation of health communication interventions, and none assessed their effects in reducing CS rates. If media campaigns can play a role in modifying population views towards CS, there is a need for more rigorous studies including impact assessment.

Three alternative polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA: amorphous PHA and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), P(3HB)) production scenarios were considered to assess its environmental impact: Scenario A - Production of mcl-PHA/P(3HB) from crude vegetable oil; Scenario B - Production of P(3HB) with biodiesel by-product; Scenario C - Production of mcl-PHA/P(3HB) from used vegetable oil. Subject to the scenario considered, it was shown that the environmental efficiency of PHA production is highly dependent on carbon sources used, and it is strongly supporting production of mcl-PHA instead of P(3HB). As LCA study shows, due to low yield of P(3HB) in comparison to mcl-PHA production in considered processes, all the P(3HB) production scenarios have higher impacts than the production of mcl-PHA. Production processes based on bacterial fermentation had its impacts related mostly to the raw materials used and to its separation phase. Additionally, using secondary materials instead of raw ones, namely used oil instead of virgin oil, gives significant improvement with regard to environmental impact. The resource efficiency is also the identified as the key factor with sensitivity analysis that indicates the possible increase of biopolymer yield as the most beneficial factor. Biobased polymers have big environmental potential but still need significant improvement with regard to their manufacturing processes in order to become more economically benign. Preferably production of these microbial polymers should be integrated into biorefinery blocks, where such waste stream arises (e.g. biodiesel production plant).","Nitkiewicz, Tomasz; Wojnarowska, Magdalena; Sołtysik, Mariusz; Kaczmarski, Adam; Witko, Tomasz; Ingrao, Carlo; Guzik, Maciej",The Science of the total environment,208,19

The objective of this review is to discuss the practical aspects that can reduce complications after endoscopic procedures, and their management. The review is based on the personal experience of more than 2000 neuroendoscopic procedures performed by the senior author. Topic search was made on PubMed using Neuroendoscopy, complications and neuroendoscopy, complication avoidance and neuroendoscopy, endoscopic neurosurgery, and minimally invasive neurosurgery. Relevant articles were selected after analyzing abstracts and/or topics. Endoscopic procedures are also associated with limitations such as obstruction in instruments manipulation, steep learning curve, blind area, difficulty in visualization, disorientation, loss of stereoscopic image and others. Neuroendoscopy is distinct from microsurgery and the surgeon has to learn endoscopic skills in addition to microsurgical techniques. Difficulties in controlling bleeding, working in a limited area, higher complication rate during the initial learning curve and longer operative time are some of the limitations. Attending live workshops, practicing on models, and hands on cadaveric workshops can reduce the learning curve. Proper case selection, multidisciplinary team approach, watching operative video, visiting other departments, observing a skillful endoscopic surgeon, lab training, and simulators can improve results and shorten the learning curve. Limitations of this review are that the search is limited to the English literature and personal experience of a single surgeon that may create some bias. Although neuroendoscopic techniques are associated with improved results in some indications, they have many limitations. Neuroendoscopic skills need to be learned to improve results.","Yadav, Yad Ram; Bajaj, Jitin; Parihar, Vijay; Ratre, Shailendra; Pateriya, Anurag",Turkish neurosurgery,208,1

It is not known if different treatment modalities are associated with more profound growth impairment. Our aim was to compare differences in weight gain at 36 weeks' corrected gestational age (CGA) in premature infants that received medical, surgical or conservative management for PDA. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed notes of 208 infants born under 30 weeks' gestation with a diagnosis of PDA. Gestational age (GA) at birth, birth weight z-score, CGA and weight z-score at 36 weeks' CGA were collected. In our cohort, surgical closure was performed in infants who remained symptomatic after medical or conservative management. RESULTS Ninety-four infants had medical, 56 surgical and 58 conservative management. Surgically managed infants had a lower median (IQR) GA [24.4 (24.0-26.1) weeks'] than medically [25.4 (24.6-26.5) weeks'] or conservatively managed [26.4 (25.4-28.1) weeks', p < 0.001] infants. There was no difference in birth weight z-scores across the groups. Surgically managed infants demonstrated a greater decrease in weight z-score [-2.24 (-2.89 to -1.53)] compared to medically [-1.79 (-2.45 to -1.35)] and conservatively [-1.57 (-1.99 to -1.28), p < 0.001] managed infants between birth and 36 weeks' CGA. After adjusting for GA at birth, definitive treatment modality was significantly related to change in weight z-score from birth to 36 weeks' CGA (adjusted p = 0.022). CONCLUSION Premature infants with PDA who were managed surgically had a greater degree of faltering growth compared to those who were treated medically or conservatively.","Babla, Kunal; Dassios, Theodore; Pushparajah, Kuberan; Hickey, Ann; Greenough, Anne",Pediatrics and neonatology,208,5

Here, we devise a metabolic platform capable of producing industrially important C3-C5 diols from amino acids. The presented platform combines the natural catabolism of charged amino acids with a catalytically efficient and thermodynamically favorable diol formation pathway, created by expanding the substrate scope of the carboxylic acid reductase toward noncognate ω-hydroxylic acids. Using the established platform as gateways, seven different diol-convertible amino acids are converted to diols including 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, and 1,5-pentanediol. Particularly, we afford to optimize the production of 1,4-butanediol and demonstrate the de novo production of 1,5-pentanediol from glucose, with titers reaching 1.41 and 0.97 g l-1, respectively. Our work presents a metabolic platform that enriches the pathway repertoire for nonnatural diols with feedstock flexibility to both sugar and protein hydrolysates.","Wang, Jian; Li, Chenyi; Zou, Yusong; Yan, Yajun",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,29

There is evidence to suggest that the ISUP grade group 4 is a heterogeneous entity regarding prognosis. Our aim was to systematically examine the existing evidence to determine if outcome differences exist within the ISUP grade group 4. A systematic search of the literature for all studies examining the heterogeneity of the ISUP grade group 4 was conducted. Available studies were combined with meta-analysis to evaluate prognostic differences within the ISUP grade group 4 measured by all-cause mortality (ACM) and the prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Eight studies were identified and utilised a variety of outcome measures to answer the question of heterogeneity within the ISUP grade group 4. Four of these studies examined prognosis using both ACM and PCSM. These were combined into a meta-analysis. The combined group of 5 + 3/3 + 5 had statistically significant higher ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23, 95% confidence internal [Cl] 1.08-1.41) when compared to the 4 + 4 group. There was no difference in the PCSM between the two groups (HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.89-2.01). However, heterogeneity was high for this analysis secondary to a range of methodological differences. Our meta-analysis showed that Gleason grade 3 + 5/5 + 3 had higher ACM than Gleason grade group 4 + 4. Measures of PCSM were statistically insignificant, although heterogeneity was high. Evidence suggests that heterogeneity is likely, although inconclusive.

COVID-19 leads to a mild to severe respiratory disease and affects different organs and has become a global concern since December 2019. Meanwhile, molecular biology and diagnostic laboratories played an essential role in diagnosis of the disease by introducing serological and molecular tests. Molecular-based techniques are reliable detection tools for SARS-CoV-2 and used for diagnosis of patients especially in the early stage of the disease. While, serological assays are considered as additional tools to verify the asymptomatic infections, tracing previous contacts of individuals, vaccine efficacy, and study the seroprevalance. The average time of the appearance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the patient's serum is 3-6 days after the onset of symptoms for both IgM and IgA and 10-18 days for IgG. Following the outbreak of COVID-19, FDA has approved and authorized a series of serological laboratory tests for early diagnosis. Serological assays have low-cost and provide fast results but have poor sensitivity in the early stage of the viral infection. Although the serological tests may not play an important role in the active case of COVID-19, it could be effective to determine the immunity of health care workers, and confirm late COVID-19 cases during the outbreak.

On March 11th 2020, the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation was characterized as a pandemic by the WHO. Much attention has been drawn to the origin of SARS-CoV-2, a virus which is related to the lineage B betacoronavirus SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses found in bat species. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a bat coronavirus named RaTG13 (BatCoV-RaTG13). Early characterizations of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed the existence of a distinct 4 amino acid insert (underlined, SPRRAR↓S), found within the spike (S) protein, at a position termed the S1/S2 site located at the interface between the S1 receptor binding subunit and the S2 fusion subunit. Notably, this S1/S2 insert appears to be distinguishing feature among SARS-related sequences and introduces a potential cleavage site for the protease furin. Here, we investigate the potential role of this novel S1/S2 cleavage site and present direct biochemical evidence for proteolytic processing by a variety of proteases, including furin, trypsin-like proteases and cathepsins. We discuss these findings in the broader context of the origin of SARS-CoV-2, viral stability and transmission.

However, the optimal dose of intravenous alteplase remains unknown in centers where bridging therapy is actively performed. The optimal dose for eventual recanalization and positive clinical outcomes in patients receiving bridging therapy also remains unknown. METHODS In this prospective Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) sub-study, we explored the outcomes following treatment with two different doses (low- [0.6 mg/kg] or standard-dose [0.9 mg/kg]) of intravenous alteplase across 12 Korean centers where EVT is actively performed. The primary endpoint was a favorable outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale scores 0 to 1). Secondary endpoints included symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in all patients, and the recanalization rate and favorable outcome in patients who underwent cerebral angiography for EVT (ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01422616). RESULTS Of 351 patients, the primary outcome occurred in 46% of patients in both the standard-(80/173) and low-dose (81/178) groups (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.81; P=0.582), although ICHs tended to occur more frequently in the standard-dose group (8% vs. 3%, P=0.056).

However, most studies included a heterogeneous sample with variances in social disruption policies and did not focus on a local profile with homogeneous prevention policies. OBJECTIVES Thus, the present study's purpose was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and sleep quality in a specific region in South of Brazil with similar culture and social distance policies adopted by the local governments. METHODS This study was conducted with 327 individuals aged 18-72 years, living in ""Vale do Taquari"", Brazil. We assessed sociodemographic variables and depression, anxiety, stress symptoms (DASS-21), sleep quality (The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. RESULTS Our results showed that sleep dysfunction moderated the effects of age on psychological symptoms, indicating that younger participants who had a lower sleep quality presented worse mental health. Further, the participants with more perceived stress during the pandemic and more sleep dysfunction reported more anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSION Psychological symptoms were not related to social isolation duration but to the subjective perception that the pandemic interfered with life and generated stressful situations. These results may help governments make important decisions about protection and isolation measures in the future waves of COVID-19 infection.","Bücker, Joana; Rosa, Adriane Ribeiro; Czepielewski, Letícia Sanguinetti",Trends in psychiatry and psychotherapy,208,1

We find precise thresholds for 23 systems using a single-cluster growth algorithm. Site percolation on lattices with compact neighborhoods of connected sites can be mapped to problems of lattice percolation of extended objects of a given shape, such as disks and spheres, and the thresholds can be related to the continuum thresholds η_{c} for objects of those shapes. This mapping implies zp_{c}∼4η_{c}=4.51235 in two dimensions and zp_{c}∼8η_{c}=2.7351 in three dimensions for large z for circular and spherical neighborhoods, respectively, where z is the coordination number. Fitting our data for compact neighborhoods to the form p_{c}=c/(z+b) we find good agreement with this prediction, c=2^{d}η_{c}, with the constant b representing a finite-z correction term.

Tea tree oil (TTO) has been demonstrated to exhibit a wide range of pharmacological actions that can effectively inhibit the activity of bacteria. In this context, we evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial effects of TTO on S. mutans both during planktonic growth and in biofilms compared with 0.2% CHX. We determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) using the microdilution method, the bacteriostatic rate using an MTT assay, and the antimicrobial time using a time-kill assay. Then, we explored the effects of TTO on acid production and cell integrity. Furthermore, the effects of TTO on the biomass and bacterial activity of S. mutans biofilms were studied. Finally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were used to investigate the structure and activity of biofilms. The MIC and MBC values were 0.125% and 0.25%, and the bacterial inhibition rate was concentration dependent. TTO can effectively inhibit bacterial acid production and destroy the integrity of the cell membrane. Electron micrographs revealed a reduction in bacterial aggregation, inhibited biofilm formation, and reduced biofilm thickness. The effect of TTO was the same as that of 0.2% CHX at a specific concentration.

However, exerting self-control, which is essential for successful abstinence from drug addiction, can cause ego depletion. This study experimentally investigated the effect of ego depletion on interpersonal trust and examined possible changes in the ego depletion effect across different abstinence periods. This study employed a 2 (ego depletion: high vs. low) × 2 (partners: non-SUD vs. SUD) mixed factorial design. The participants were 273 male individuals with SUD and with periods of drug abstinence ranging from several days to 2 years, who resided in a compulsory drug rehabilitation center. The participants were first asked to complete an ego depletion task, followed by a decision-making task in a trust game, first with a non-SUD stranger, and then with a SUD stranger. Ego depletion was not related to trust in non-SUD strangers. However, ego depleted participants were more likely to trust SUD strangers than non-ego depleted participants. Moreover, this ego depletion effect fluctuated near the end of SUD treatment. This study highlights the importance to ensure follow-up outpatient care and offer social support services for individuals with SUD after compulsory SUD treatment.","Liu, Chang-Jiang; Hao, Fang",Journal of psychoactive drugs,208,16

BACKGROUND t-PBM with NIR light is a new treatment for MDD. NIR light is absorbed by mitochondria; it boosts cerebral metabolism, promotes neuroplasticity, and modulates endogenous opioids, while decreasing inflammation and oxidative stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a double-blind, sham-controlled study on the safety and efficacy (change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D17] total score at end-point) of adjunct t-PBM NIR [823 nm; continuous wave (CW); 28.7 × 2 cm2; 36.2 mW/cm2; up to 65.2 J/cm2; 20-30 min/session], delivered to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally and simultaneously, twice a week, for 8 weeks, in subjects with MDD. Baseline observation carried forward (BOCF), last observation carried forward (LOCF), and completers analyses were performed. RESULTS The effect size for the antidepressant effect of t-PBM, based on change in HAM-D17 total score at end-point, was 0.90, 0.75, and 1.5 (Cohen's d), respectively for BOCF (n = 21), LOCF (n = 19), and completers (n = 13). Further, t-PBM was fairly well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS t-PBM with NIR light demonstrated antidepressant properties with a medium to large effect size in patients with MDD. Replication is warranted, especially in consideration of the small sample size.","Cassano, Paolo; Petrie, Samuel R; Mischoulon, David; Cusin, Cristina; Katnani, Husam; Yeung, Albert; De Taboada, Luis; Archibald, Abigal; Bui, Eric; Baer, Lee; Chang, Trina; Chen, Justin; Pedrelli, Paola; Fisher, Lauren; Farabaugh, Amy; Hamblin, Michael R; Alpert, Jonathan E; Fava, Maurizio; Iosifescu, Dan V",Photomedicine and laser surgery,208,16

Although the use of SILS is becoming widespread, technical difficulty has delayed its adoption for laparoscopic liver resection. Recently, advances in laparoscopic liver resection have been made in tandem with advances in surgical skill and devices. The main driver in conventional laparoscopic liver resection's evolution to become less surgically invasive seems to be single-incision laparoscopic liver resection (SILLR). To date, most reports on SILLR have been single case reports or case series. Only a few cohort studies on conventional laparoscopic surgery and SILLR have been conducted. Recent reports have described the use of SILLR for well-localized lesions and solitary tumors located in the anterolateral segments of the liver or left liver lobe, but its application remains limited to partial resection and left lateral sectionectomy. The feasibility and safety of SILLR have been demonstrated, but additional work is needed for standardization of the procedure.","Ban, Daisuke; Kudo, Atsushi; Irie, Takumi; Ochiai, Takanori; Aihara, Arihiro; Matsumura, Satoshi; Tanaka, Shinji; Tanabe, Minoru",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,208,1

Previously published reference values for circulating vitamin D3 (25OHD3; 55.7 ± 34.2 ng/ml) were based upon samples from free-ranging black rhinoceros in Africa. Recent research in human medicine has highlighted the importance of subclinical vitamin D deficiency, with links to increased risks for developing various health conditions. Serum samples collected opportunistically from two captive Eastern black rhinoceros ( Diceros bicornis michaeli) housed with seasonal access outdoors in a North American zoo were tested for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels over a 3-yr period. A commercially prepared pelleted diet containing vitamin D3 was fed to both rhinos. This study correlates environmental ultraviolet (UV) index, dietary supplementation, and seasonal serum 25OHD levels to compare with known 25OHD3 levels in free-ranging African black rhinoceros. Results in these two individuals suggest that D. bicornis spp. are dependent upon sunlight or UVB for measurable circulating 25OHD, and that current vitamin D3 supplementation levels may have little effect for Diceros spp. in human care housed in northern latitudes.","Olds, June; Oltman, Wes; Makowski, Andrew J; Householder, Hilary; Keeley, Lou L",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,208,16

We aimed to assess admission BT in a heterogeneous medical critically ill patient population admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) as new prognostic parameter for intra-ICU and long-term mortality. METHODS A total of 6514 medical patients (64 ± 15 years) admitted to a German ICU between 2004 and 2009 were included. Follow-up of patients was performed retrospectively. Association of admission BT and both intra-ICU and long-term mortality were investigated by logistic regression respectively. RESULTS Patients with hypothermia (<36°C BT) were clinically sicker and had more pronounced signs of multi-organ failure. Admission BT was associated with adverse overall outcome, with a 2-fold increase for hyperthermia (mortality 12%; OR 1.80 95%CI 1.43-2.26; p<0.001) and a 4-fold increase in risk for hypothermia (mortality 24%; OR 4.05 95%CI 3.38-4.85; p<0.001) with respect to intra-ICU and long-term mortality. Moreover, hypothermia was even more harmful as hyperthermia and both were strongly associated with intra-ICU mortality, especially in patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (hypothermia: (HR 6.12 95%CI 4.12-9.11; p<0.001; hyperthermia: OR 2.70 95% CI 1.52-4.79; p<0.001). CONCLUSION Admission BT is an independent risk predictor for both overall intra-ICU and long-term mortality in critically ill patients admitted to an ICU. Therefore, BT at admission might not only constitute as a parameter for individual risk stratification but can also influence individual therapeutic decision making.","Erkens, Ralf; Wernly, Bernhard; Masyuk, Maryna; Muessig, Johanna; Franz, Marcus; Schulze, Paul C; Lichtenauer, Michael; Kelm, Malte; Jung, Christian","Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",208,1

METHODS From January 2003 to June 2009, 94 SPA (65 women and 29 men, mean age of 12.4 years) were performed in children with appendicitis. Sixty-five of these patients were found to have normal weight, whereas 29 were obese. Patients' records were evaluated regarding operative time, intra- and post-operative complications, initiation of oral intake and histopathological findings. RESULTS There was no significant difference in operative time between obese and normal weight patients. In the obese group, one wound healing disturbance was documented. In the normal weight group, there were one post-operative bleeding and one wound infection. There was no difference with regards to the introduction of feeds following appendectomy between the groups. Histological examinations revealed 15 normal, 32 acute, 21 phlegmonous, 20 chronic and two perforated cases of appendicitis, three neurogenic appendicopathies and one case of enterobius vermicularis related appendicitis. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that the advantages of single-port appendectomy in the evaluation of the peritoneal cavity, the minimal rate of intra-operative incidents with this technique and superior cosmetics validate this alternative approach of minimal access appendectomy in obese children.","Petnehazy, Thomas; Saxena, A K; Ainoedhofer, H; Hoellwarth, Michael E; Schalamon, J",Acta paediatrica,208,17

In this article, we included newly developed clinical practices that are relatively common among Japanese experts in this field, although all of their statements are not associated with a high level of evidence, but these practices are likely to be incorporated into guidelines in the future. To write this article, coauthors from different institutions drafted the content and then critically reviewed each other's work. The revised content was then critically reviewed by the Board of Directors and the Planning and Public Relations Committee of JSH before publication to confirm the consensus statements and recommendations. The consensus statements and recommendations presented in this report represent measures actually being conducted at the highest-level HCC treatment centers in Japan. We hope this article provides insight into the actual situation of HCC practice in Japan, thereby affecting the global practice pattern in the management of HCC.","Kudo, Masatoshi; Kawamura, Yusuke; Hasegawa, Kiyoshi; Tateishi, Ryosuke; Kariyama, Kazuya; Shiina, Shuichiro; Toyoda, Hidenori; Imai, Yasuharu; Hiraoka, Atsushi; Ikeda, Masafumi; Izumi, Namiki; Moriguchi, Michihisa; Ogasawara, Sadahisa; Minami, Yasunori; Ueshima, Kazuomi; Murakami, Takamichi; Miyayama, Shiro; Nakashima, Osamu; Yano, Hirohisa; Sakamoto, Michiie; Hatano, Etsuro; Shimada, Mitsuo; Kokudo, Norihiro; Mochida, Satoshi; Takehara, Tetsuo",Liver cancer,208,29

We have analyzed the rate of discovery of pathogenic viruses, the preeminent source of newly discovered causes of human disease, from 1897 through 2010. The rate was highest during 1950-1969, after which it moderated. This general picture masks two distinct trends: for arthropod-borne viruses, which comprised 39% of pathogenic viruses, the discovery rate peaked at three per year during 1960-1969, but subsequently fell nearly to zero by 1980; however, the rate of discovery of nonarboviruses remained stable at about two per year from 1950 through 2010. The period of highest arbovirus discovery coincided with a comprehensive program supported by The Rockefeller Foundation of isolating viruses from humans, animals, and arthropod vectors at field stations in Latin America, Africa, and India. The productivity of this strategy illustrates the importance of location, approach, long-term commitment, and sponsorship in the discovery of emerging pathogens.","Rosenberg, Ronald; Johansson, Michael A; Powers, Ann M; Miller, Barry R",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,16

Here, dihydropyrrolidones (DHPs), the products of an efficient multi-components reaction, were found to possess good activities against influenza A virus (IAV). Primary structure-activity relationship indicated that the activities of DHPs were greatly influenced by substituents and four of them had IC50 values lower than 10 μM (DHPs 5-2, 8, 14 and 19: IC50 = 3.11-9.23 μM). The activities against multiple IAV strains and mechanism of DHPs were further investigated by using 5-2 (IC50 = 3.11 μM). It was found that 5-2 possessed antiviral effects against all the investigated subtypes of IAVs with the IC50 values from 3.11 to 7.13 μM. Moreover, 5-2 showed very low cytotoxicity with CC50 > 400 μM. Results of mechanism study indicated that 5-2 could efficiently inhibit replication of IAV, up-regulate the expression of key antiviral cytokines IFN-β and antiviral protein MxA, and suppress the production of the NDAPH oxidase NOX1 in MDCK cells. These results indicated that 5-2 could be used as a potential inhibitor against wide subtypes of IAVs.","Liu, Teng; Dai, Chenshu; Sang, Huiting; Chen, Fangzhao; Huang, Yingna; Liao, Hui; Liu, Shuwen; Zhu, Qiuhua; Yang, Jie",European journal of medicinal chemistry,208,1

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure with important advantages that allows the reduction of the intussusception and the resection of the polyp. This case report contributes to the medical literature by describing the advantages of this surgical technique that warrant its consideration as a treatment of choice in similar cases. CASE PRESENTATION We report a case of a 19-year-old Greek woman who complained about intermittent, non-specific abdominal pain in her left lateral abdomen. She had been admitted to the hospital because of incomplete obstructive ileus. Ultrasound and computed tomography were carried out, which revealed an intussusception of the small bowel. This pathogenic situation was treated by single-incision laparoscopic surgery. Her pathology report revealed a benign, hamartomatous excised polyp of the Peutz-Jeghers type. The patient had a quick recovery without any post-operative complications. CONCLUSION We recommend single-incision laparoscopic surgery for the safe excision of solitary hamartomatous polyps and the management of their complications, as it represents a potential advance in minimally invasive approaches.","Pitiakoudis, Michael; Romanidis, Konstantinos; Giatromanolaki, Alexandra; Courcoutsakis, Nikos; Nagorni, Eleni-Aikaterini; Foutzitzi, Soultana; Tsaroucha, Alexandra; Zezos, Petros; Kouklakis, Georgios",Journal of medical case reports,208,29

Both are known to individually suppress the immune system of humans and mice. In order to determine their potential interactive and combined immunosuppressive effects, we examined murine bone marrow (BM) immune progenitor cells' responses following combined oral exposures at very low levels of exposure to As(+3) and DBC. Oral 5-day exposure to DBC at 1 mg/kg (cumulative dose) was found to suppress mouse BM lymphoid progenitor cells, but not the myeloid progenitors. Previously established no-effect doses of As(+3) in drinking water (19 and 75 ppb for 30 days) produced more lymphoid suppression in the bone marrow when mice were concomitantly fed a low dose of DBC during the last 5 days. The lower dose (19 ppb) As(+3) had a stronger suppressive effect with DBC than the higher dose (75 ppb). Thus, the interactive toxicity of As(+3) and DBC in vivo could be As(+3) dose dependent. In vitro, the suppressive interaction of As(+3) and DBC was also evident at low concentrations (0.5 nM), but not at higher concentrations (5 nM) of As(+3). These studies show potentially important interactions between As(+3) and DBC on mouse BM at extremely low levels of exposure in vivo and in vitro.","Ezeh, Peace C; Lauer, Fredine T; Liu, Ke Jian; Hudson, Laurie G; Burchiel, Scott W",Biological trace element research,208,1

DESIGN/SETTING Technical and nontechnical skill multiple mini-interviews (MMIs) were performed virtually and assessed for 109 applicants during virtual general surgery interviews over 2 days at a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS We demonstrate the feasibility of virtually assessing general surgery residency applicants' technical and non-technical skills. Using a virtual MMI format during general surgery interviews, we assessed communication, emotional intelligence, anatomical knowledge, interpretation of medical tests, knot tying, and suturing. Four tasks (communication, emotional intelligence , anatomical knowledge, and interpretation of tests) were assessed synchronously by trained general surgery interns. Applicants submitted a recording of themselves performing knot tying and suturing tasks, which were asynchronously assessed after the interview day. Applicants rated the MMI experience highly (4.3/5) via postinterview day survey and the majority of applicants felt that station objectives were met in the virtual format. CONCLUSIONS We report a successful experience implementing technical and nontechnical virtual MMIs with capacity for 120 applicants during general surgery residency interviews. In the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to assess surgical leaners virtually is essential. Virtual skills assessments may provide a more comprehensive picture of applicants and enable residency programs to better assess residents when gathering in person is not feasible.","Lund, Sarah; Shaikh, Nizamuddin; Yeh, Vicky J-H; Baloul, Mohamed; de Azevedo, Rafael; Peña, Alvaro; Becknell, Mark; Que, Florencia; Stulak, John; Rivera, Mariela",Journal of surgical education,208,1

However, percutaneous repair has been demonstrated to lead to improved function and patient satisfaction but greater complications than open repair. In the current economic climate, it is reasonable to consider the financial cost of rupture management for both the patient and the provider. The cost-effectiveness of operative treatment of ruptures of the Achilles tendon was determined based upon theatre occupancy, clinic attendance and cast changes, operative complications and functional assessment score. METHODS The cost-effectiveness of the surgical management of Achilles tendon ruptures between 2005 and 2011 in our unit was audited by comparing 49 patients receiving percutaneous repair to 35 patients whom had open repairs. RESULTS There was no significant difference in complications between the two surgical techniques: (Open vs. Percutaneous) overall rates 14.3 versus 10.4 %: infection; 2.7 versus 2.0 %, transient sural nerve damage: 5.6 versus 8.1 %, wound breakdown: 2.8 versus 0.0 %, re-rupture: 2.8 versus 2.0 %.

Theatre occupancy (P < 0.00) and hospital stay (P < 0.00) were significantly longer with open repair [43 min (26-70) and 2.9 days (0-4)] compared to percutaneous repair [15 min (12-43) and 1.2 days (0-2)]. Excluding the costs of running the operating theatre, we have estimated the costs of surgery for open repair to be £ 935 and percutaneous repair to be £ 574. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that percutaneous repair of the Achilles tendon resulted in reduced costs and yet had comparable outcome and complications rates to open repair in surgical management of the Achilles tendon. Percutaneous repair should be considered as the primary method of cost-effective surgical management of Achilles tendon rupture.","Carmont, M R; Heaver, C; Pradhan, A; Mei-Dan, O; Gravare Silbernagel, K","Knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy : official journal of the ESSKA",208,5

Methods: During February 5(th) to 10(th) , 2020, a national anonymous survey was conducted using an online questionnaire among PLHIV at least 18 years of age and had started antiretroviral treatment (ART) to collect the information on COVID-19 prevention, HIV-related health services and the needs on psychosocial support. Current status and needs of people living with HIV were analyzed in Hubei and other regions. Results: A total of 1 014 valid questionnaires were collected, with PLHIV respondents cross the country. The survey revealed that 93.79% of the respondents could obtain information regarding the prevention of COVID-19 from their communities or villages. Respondents were concerned with HIV-specific protective measures and personal protective equipment shortage. 32.64% of all respondents were not carrying sufficient antiretroviral medicines (ARVs) to meet the needs under traffic and travel restrictions, and some could face stock-outs in the coming month. In Hubei province where 53 respondents needed ARV refill, 64.15% reported difficulty accessing ARV due to the ""blockage"". 28.93% respondents were in need of sociopsychological support, and 85.31% anticipated further improvement of the out-of-town ARV refill process from the government. Conclusion: PLHIV wants to know HIV-specific protective measures against COVID-19 outbreak. PLHIV who returned to their home-towns and affected by the lock-downs reported challenges with refills. We should undertake a more systematic study on impacts of the COVID-19 on PLHIV to develop preparedness capacity for future public health emergency.","Guo, W; Weng, H L; Bai, H; Liu, J; Wei, X N; Zhou, K; Sande, A",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,208,1

Methods Combining two cases in our hospital and other literature, a solution about the procedure and necessary preventive and protective measures for MRI examination of COVID-19 patients is proposed for peer reference with the help of experts from our hospital infection-control department. The solution that meets the hospital infection-control regulations covers five aspects including the layout requirements for the MRI room in the radiology department, preparation before admission, preparation of medical staff, preparation of patients, and terminal disinfection after MRI examination. Radiology personnel should strictly abide by the regulations on infection prevention and control. MRI technicians who have been in close contact with COVID-19 patients should receive strict medical observation for two weeks. Each step should be performed carefully to minimize the risk of hospital infection. Results A solution that includes five aspects was formulated to prevent the potential contamination during the MRI scan for COVID-19 patients. These five aspects are layout requirements in the MRI room, preparation before admission, preparation of medical staff, preparation of patients, and terminal disinfection after an examination. MRI technicians who have been in close contact with COVID-19 patients should receive strict medical observation for two weeks. Conclusions To prevent and control the potential hospital infection during the MRI examination for COVID-19 patients, a solution including five aspects was initially proposed.","Shen, Xiaoyong; Meng, Jinwen; Wang, Qidong; Ni, Lingmei; Zhong, Zifeng; Hu, Shaohua; Chen, Feng",Annals of translational medicine,208,7

METHODS This study involves assessment of NK-92 line NK cell cytotoxic activity against JEG-3 line cells, in presence of cytokines. We also assessed the effect of secretory placenta products on NK cell cytotoxic activity toward JEG-3 line cells. RESULTS Uteroplacental contact zone cytokines are able to enhance trophoblast mortality both by themselves in case of IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, IL-4, TGFβ, bFGF, and also through increasing the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in case of IL-1β, IFNγ, IL-8, TGFβ, and GM-CSF. PLGF decreases NK cell cytotoxicity for trophoblasts. Secretory products of first trimester placenta enhance NK cell cytotoxic potential for trophoblasts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a scoping review on PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, clinical trial register, and grey literature repository databases to identify reports on viral transmission via surgical smoke or aerosolization. A systematic review of all available national and international guidelines was also performed to report their recommendations. Additionally, a worldwide transdisciplinary survey was performed to capture the actual compliance to dedicated guidelines and their impact on minimally invasive surgical activity. RESULTS Based on a selection of 17 studies, there is no evidence to support the concerns of an intraoperative viral transmission via pneumoperitoneum aerosolization. Most national surgical and urologic societies either did address this topic or referred to international guidelines. The guidelines of the American College of Surgery, the Royal College of Surgeons and the European Association of Urology Robotic Urology Section recommended an avoidance of MIS due to an increased risk of intraoperative aerosol-enhanced transmission. The results of the survey completed by 334 respondents, from different surgical abdominal specialties, suggested a lack of compliance with the guidelines. CONCLUSION There seems to be a dissonance between contemporary guidelines and ongoing surgical activity, possibly due to the perceived lack of evidence. Recommendations regarding changes in clinical practice should be based on the best available research evidence and experience. A scoping review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms together with a survey showed that laparoscopic procedures do not seem to increase the risk of viral transmission. Nevertheless, the low number of publications and low quality of existing evidence limits the validity of the review.","Mun, Dong-Ho; Pradere, Benjamin; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Remzi, Mesut",BJU international,208,28

METHODS Prospective cross-sectional study investigating non-mydriatic fundus photography as a new diagnostic test in two tertiary Australian EDs. Consecutive adult patients were enrolled if they presented with headache, focal neurological deficit, visual disturbance or diastolic BP >120 mmHg. Diagnostic agreement was determined using kappa statistics and sensitivity and specificity using a reference standard consensus ophthalmology review. RESULTS A total of 345 consecutive patients were enrolled among whom 56 (16%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13-21) had urgent fundus pathology. Agreement between emergency physician and ophthalmic assessment of fundus photographs was 74% (kappa = 0.196, P = 0.001). Emergency physicians had 40% sensitivity (95% CI 27-54) and 82% specificity (95% CI 76-86) for detecting urgent pathology on photographs.

However, specific TRIMs that contribute to TLR3-mediated antiviral defense have not been identified. We show here that TRIM56 is a positive regulator of TLR3 signaling. Overexpression of TRIM56 substantially potentiated extracellular dsRNA-induced expression of interferon (IFN)-β and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), while knockdown of TRIM56 greatly impaired activation of IRF3, induction of IFN-β and ISGs, and establishment of an antiviral state by TLR3 ligand and severely compromised TLR3-mediated chemokine induction following infection by hepatitis C virus. The ability to promote TLR3 signaling was independent of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM56. Rather, it correlated with a physical interaction between TRIM56 and TRIF. Deletion of the C-terminal portion of TRIM56 abrogated the TRIM56-TRIF interaction as well as the augmentation of TLR3-mediated IFN response. Together, our data demonstrate TRIM56 is an essential component of the TLR3 antiviral signaling pathway and reveal a novel role for TRIM56 in innate antiviral immunity.","Shen, Yang; Li, Nan L; Wang, Jie; Liu, Baoming; Lester, Sandra; Li, Kui",The Journal of biological chemistry,208,8

In this paper, we present the protocol for two systematic reviews of parameters for estimating the number of deaths and disability-adjusted life years from depression attributable to exposure to long working hours, to inform the development of the WHO/ILO joint methodology. OBJECTIVES We aim to systematically review studies on occupational exposure to long working hours (Systematic Review 1) and systematically review and meta-analyse estimates of the effect of long working hours on depression (Systematic Review 2), applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology as an organizing framework, conducting both systematic reviews in tandem and in a harmonized way. DATA SOURCES Separately for Systematic Reviews 1 and 2, we will search electronic academic databases for potentially relevant records from published and unpublished studies, including Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CISDOC and PsycINFO. We will also search electronic grey literature databases, Internet search engines and organizational websites; hand search reference list of previous systematic reviews and included study records; and consult additional experts. STUDY ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA We will include working-age (≥15 years) participants in the formal and informal economy in any WHO and/or ILO Member State, but exclude child workers (<15 years) and unpaid domestic workers. For Systematic Review 1, we will include quantitative prevalence studies of relevant levels of occupational exposure to long working hours (i.e. 35-40, 41-48, 49-54 and ≥55 h/week) stratified by country, sex, age and industrial sector or occupation, in the years 2005-2018. For Systematic Review 2, we will include randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies and other non-randomized intervention studies with an estimate of the relative effect of relevant level(s) of long working hours on the incidence of or mortality due to depression, compared with the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (i.e. 35-40 h/week). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS At least two review authors will independently screen titles and abstracts against the eligibility criteria at a first stage and full texts of potentially eligible records at a second stage, followed by extraction of data from qualifying studies. At least two review authors will assess risk of bias and the quality of evidence, using the most suited tools currently available. For Systematic Review 2, if feasible, we will combine relative risks using meta-analysis. We will report results using the guidelines for accurate and transparent health estimates reporting (GATHER) for Systematic Review 1 and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA) for Systematic Review 2.

The patient had previously undergone right radical maxillofacial surgery with orbital exenteration 14 years before the present operation to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the right maxillary sinus, with tumour invasion to the orbital floor. An anaesthesiologist encountered difficulty in performing mask ventilation during the induction of anaesthesia in the patient, despite a good mask fit on the face, because the adhesive tape around the orbit had moved. Urgent endotracheal intubation was successful without desaturation. A postoperative examination revealed that a communication between the nasal cavity and the orbit was visible on computed tomograms obtained nine years before the surgery. The patient felt the air leakage around the adhesive tape. The anaesthesiologist should have removed the adhesive tape to directly observe the lesion and should have realised that the communication might cause difficulty in mask ventilation. Careful examination of the airways using computed tomography and precise interviews may improve the understanding of patients' airways and may help avoid similar events.","Horishita, Reiko; Kayashima, Kenji",Turkish journal of anaesthesiology and reanimation,208,7

METHODS In this pilot study, 10 sexually mature ewes were subjected to laparotomy and total abdominal hysterectomy with oophorectomy to procure uterus allografts. The cold ischemic time was 60 min. End-to-end vascular anastomosis was performed using continuous, non-interlocking sutures. Complete tissue reperfusion was achieved in all animals within 30 s after the vascular re-anastomosis, without any evidence of arterial or venous thrombosis. The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and methylprednisolone tablets. Graft viability was assessed by transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively. RESULTS Viable uterine tissue and vascular patency were observed on transrectal ultrasonography and second-look laparotomy. Histological analysis of the graft tissue (performed in one ewe) revealed normal tissue architecture with a very subtle inflammatory reaction but no edema or stasis. CONCLUSION We have developed a modified procedure that allowed us to successfully perform orthotopic, allogeneic, uterine transplantation in sheep, whose uterine and vascular anatomy (apart from the bicornuate uterus) is similar to the human anatomy, making the ovine model excellent for human uterine transplant research.","Wei, Li; Xue, Tao; Yang, Hong; Zhao, Guang-Yue; Zhang, Geng; Lu, Zhi-Hong; Huang, Yan-Hong; Ma, Xiang-Dong; Liu, Hai-Xia; Liang, Sheng-Ru; Yang, Fang; Chen, Bi-Liang",PloS one,208,1

We examined the modelled surge because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that was used to inform the early hospital-level response against cases as they transpired. METHODS To estimate hospital-level surge in March and April 2020, we simulated a range of scenarios of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada, using the best available data at the time. We applied outputs to hospital-specific data to estimate surge over 6 weeks at 2 hospitals (St. Michael's Hospital and St. Joseph's Health Centre). We examined multiple scenarios, wherein the default (R0 = 2.4) resembled the early trajectory (to Mar. 25, 2020), and compared the default model projections with observed COVID-19 admissions in each hospital from Mar. 25 to May 6, 2020. RESULTS For the hospitals to remain below non-ICU bed capacity, the default pessimistic scenario required a reduction in non-COVID-19 inpatient care by 38% and 28%, respectively, with St. Michael's Hospital requiring 40 new ICU beds and St. Joseph's Health Centre reducing its ICU beds for non-COVID-19 care by 6%. The absolute difference between default-projected and observed census of inpatients with COVID-19 at each hospital was less than 20 from Mar. 25 to Apr. 11; projected and observed cases diverged widely thereafter. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. INTERPRETATION Scenario-based analyses were reliable in estimating short-term cases, but would require frequent re-analyses. Distribution of the city's surge was expected to vary across hospitals, and community-level strategies were key to mitigating each hospital's surge.","Mishra, Sharmistha; Wang, Linwei; Ma, Huiting; Yiu, Kristy C Y; Paterson, J Michael; Kim, Eliane; Schull, Michael J; Pequegnat, Victoria; Lee, Anthea; Ishiguro, Lisa; Coomes, Eric; Chan, Adrienne; Downing, Mark; Landsman, David; Straus, Sharon; Muller, Matthew",CMAJ open,208,1

The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.

This is one reason why it is very important to assess all barriers to end-of-life care and to provide safe and quality services to patients. This study was aimed at describing nurses' attitudes in providing end-of-life care and exploring barriers and facilitating behaviors of nurses in multi-profile hospitals in Eastern Europe. METHODS A descriptive, correlational design was applied in this study, using a cross-sectional survey of 1320 registered nurses within 7 hospitals in Lithuania. RESULTS Registered nurses working in the three different profiles emphasized safe and effective care and the importance of meeting the patient's spiritual needs at the end of life. The main barriers assigned by nurses caring for patients at the end of life were angry family members, inadequate understanding of nursing care by the patient's relatives; lack of time to talk to patients, lack of nursing knowledge to deal with the bereaved patient's family, lack of evaluation of nurses' opinions, and the evasion by physicians to talk about the diagnosis and their over-optimistic view of the situation. The main facilitating behaviors to improve nursing care were end-of-life training, volunteering, and family involvement. CONCLUSIONS Spiritual needs were identified by nurses as the primary needs of patients at the end of life. Family-related barriers remain one of the main barriers to end-of-life care. Also, the behavior of physicians and their relationship with nurses remains one of the most sensitive issues in end-of-life care.","Blaževičienė, Aurelija; Laurs, Lina; Newland, Jamesetta A",BMC palliative care,208,1

The objective of this study was to assess the validity of self-reported recall of early life anthropometric measures. A systematic review was conducted by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, ProQuest, EMBASE, and MEDLINE). Studies were eligible if they evaluated the validity or reliability of self-reported recall by adults of their own body mass index, height, and/or weight during earlier life periods. Meta-analyses were conducted to pool correlation coefficients and mean differences. There were 15 studies included with a total of 17 477 participants. The mean pooled difference between self-reported recall of BMI compared with prospective measures was 0.06 kg/m2 (95% CI, -0.62 to 0.73), and the pooled correlation coefficient was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65-0.79). Self-reported weight was also strongly correlated with reference standard measures (pooled r = 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90) with a small mean difference (0.87 kg; 95% CI, 0.19-1.56; I2 = 91%). Despite significant heterogeneity, the findings from this review suggest self-reported recall of early life body mass index, height, and weight may be valid measures. This evidence may inform life-course epidemiology studies considering the use of retrospective assessment of self-reported anthropometry.","De Rubeis, Vanessa; Bayat, Sawila; Griffith, Lauren E; Smith, Brendan T; Anderson, Laura N",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,208,16

Recently, this technique has been applied to colorectal disease. However, there have been few reports about its application to Crohn's disease (CD) in the literature. The aim of this study is to describe our early experience with SILS for 11 patients with CD and make comparisons with the conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery. METHODS We reviewed all patients with CD who underwent laparoscopic surgery for the presence of ileocolic strictures at our institution between January 2006 and March 2011. Data from consecutive patients undergoing SILS were analyzed and compared with those from conventional multiport laparoscopic surgeries. RESULTS During the study period, 11 patients underwent SILS. All surgeries were completed with SILS. Operative time, blood loss and conversions were not significantly different between the two groups. Postoperative complications and length of hospital stay also had no significant difference. CONCLUSION In conclusion, SILS for CD may be safe and feasible in selected patients, and have better cosmetic results than conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery. Further studies are needed to evaluate the outcome of SILS compared to that of conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Maeda, K; Noda, E; Nagahara, H; Inoue, T; Takii, M; Watanabe, K; Yamagami, H; Sogawa, M; Kamata, N; Hirakawa, K",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,208,24

Such biomarkers could allow for individualized treatment selection, reducing time spent on ineffective treatments and the burden of MDD. In search of such a biomarker, multisite pretreatment and early-treatment (1 week into treatment) structural magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired from 184 patients with MDD randomized to an 8-week trial of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline or placebo. This study represents a large, multisite, placebo-controlled effort to examine the association between pretreatment differences or early-treatment changes in cortical thickness and treatment-specific outcomes. For standardization, a novel, robust site harmonization procedure was applied to structural measures in a priori regions (rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, lateral orbitofrontal, rostral middle frontal, and hippocampus), chosen based on previously published reports. Pretreatment cortical thickness or volume did not significantly associate with SSRI response. Thickening of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex in the first week of treatment was associated with better 8-week responses to SSRI (p = 0.010). These findings indicate that frontal lobe structural alterations in the first week of treatment may be associated with long-term treatment efficacy. While these associational findings may help to elucidate the specific neural targets of SSRIs, the predictive accuracy of pretreatment or early-treatment structural alterations in classifying treatment remitters from nonremitters was limited to 63.9%. Therefore, in this large sample of adults with MDD, structural MR imaging measures were not found to be clinically translatable biomarkers of treatment response to SSRI or placebo.","Bartlett, Elizabeth A; DeLorenzo, Christine; Sharma, Priya; Yang, Jie; Zhang, Mengru; Petkova, Eva; Weissman, Myrna; McGrath, Patrick J; Fava, Maurizio; Ogden, R Todd; Kurian, Benji T; Malchow, Ashley; Cooper, Crystal M; Trombello, Joseph M; McInnis, Melvin; Adams, Phillip; Oquendo, Maria A; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Trivedi, Madhukar; Parsey, Ramin V",Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,208,32

OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of LAA occlusion for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF compared with long-term warfarin therapy. METHODS This randomized trial further assessed the efficacy and safety of the Watchman device. Patients with NVAF who had a CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75 years, diabetes mellitus, and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack) score ≥2 or 1 and another risk factor were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to undergo LAA occlusion and subsequent discontinuation of warfarin (intervention group, n = 269) or receive chronic warfarin therapy (control group, n = 138). Two efficacy and 1 safety coprimary endpoints were assessed. RESULTS At 18 months, the rate of the first coprimary efficacy endpoint (composite of stroke, systemic embolism [SE], and cardiovascular/unexplained death) was 0.064 in the device group versus 0.063 in the control group (rate ratio 1.07 [95% credible interval (CrI): 0.57 to 1.89]) and did not achieve the prespecified criteria noninferiority (upper boundary of 95% CrI ≥1.75). The rate for the second coprimary efficacy endpoint (stroke or SE >7 days' postrandomization) was 0.0253 versus 0.0200 (risk difference 0.0053 [95% CrI: -0.0190 to 0.0273]), achieving noninferiority. Early safety events occurred in 2.2% of the Watchman arm, significantly lower than in PROTECT AF, satisfying the pre-specified safety performance goal. Using a broader, more inclusive definition of adverse effects, these still were lower in PREVAIL (Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long Term Warfarin Therapy) trial than in PROTECT AF (4.2% vs. 8.7%; p = 0.004). Pericardial effusions requiring surgical repair decreased from 1.6% to 0.4% (p = 0.027), and those requiring pericardiocentesis decreased from 2.9% to 1.5% (p = 0.36), although the number of events was small. CONCLUSIONS In this trial, LAA occlusion was noninferior to warfarin for ischemic stroke prevention or SE >7 days' post-procedure. Although noninferiority was not achieved for overall efficacy, event rates were low and numerically comparable in both arms. Procedural safety has significantly improved. This trial provides additional data that LAA occlusion is a reasonable alternative to warfarin therapy for stroke prevention in patients with NVAF who do not have an absolute contraindication to short-term warfarin therapy.","Holmes, David R; Kar, Saibal; Price, Matthew J; Whisenant, Brian; Sievert, Horst; Doshi, Shephal K; Huber, Kenneth; Reddy, Vivek Y",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,208,30

Vitamin D is thought to play a role in many chronic diseases as it may possess immunomodulatory properties. This article will review the role of vitamin D regulation on the immune system and its potential implication in the pathophysiology of asthma. RECENT FINDINGS vitamin D receptors are present on many cells in the body, specifically peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Vitamin D has been shown to regulate the balance of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the immune system. Studies have suggested that prenatal vitamin D intake has an effect on childhood wheezing and asthma. Additionally, vitamin D may play a role in asthma exacerbations, and recent evidence also suggests its importance in steroid resistant asthma. SUMMARY vitamin D has a complex role on the immune system and its regulation of various aspects of immunity has allowed speculation on its potential role in asthma. However, the net effect of vitamin D on the immune system and its role in asthma still remains unanswered. More research needs to address the diagnostic and therapeutic implications vitamin D may have in the future of asthma management.","Mak, Garbo; Hanania, Nicola A",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,208,17

Imaging localization of single-gland disease allows for a focused operation. We sought to determine the accuracy of imaging for localizing a solitary parathyroid adenoma. METHODS A single-institution retrospective review was performed of adult patients with PHP undergoing parathyroidectomy from January 2017 through December 2018. Surgeon-performed ultrasound (US), four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), and sestamibi were assessed for localization of a parathyroid adenoma yielding a single-gland parathyroidectomy. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each imaging modality. RESULTS One hundred fifty-four patients underwent parathyroidectomy for PHP during the study period, with 100 patients meeting inclusion criteria with a mean age of 61.1 (SD 10) y and 80% women. Mean calcium was 11.1 mg/dL (SD 0.7) and mean PTH was 116 pg/mL (SD 66). All 100 patients had surgeon-performed US with 17 localized, 51 patients had 4DCT with 41 (80%) localized, and 69 patients had sestamibi with 53 (77%) localized. Eighty-two patients underwent successful unilateral parathyroidectomy, 18 required bilateral neck exploration. US was the most specific imaging modality at 94%. Accuracy of imaging localization was 32% for US, 70% for sestamibi, and 86% for 4DCT. CONCLUSIONS Surgeon-performed US is a highly specific imaging modality for preoperative localization of solitary parathyroid adenoma in patients with PHP. 4DCT is the most accurate imaging localization study and should be considered for patients with a nonlocalized US.","Eller, Michael; Dave, Atman; Johnson, Craig; Fingeret, Abbey L",The Journal of surgical research,208,1

METHOD We analyzed data from 13 schizophrenia and 20 normal control subjects. Responses were obtained in a paired-stimulus paradigm, in which an auditory stimulus S(1) is followed by an identical S(2). The amplitude and latency of the P50 and N100 components in response to the S(1) and S(2) stimuli were measured in each single trial and used as features to classify the responses into two groups. Several methods were used for classification, while their performance was quantified in a 10-fold stratified cross-validation approach. RESULTS We found that normal controls tended to respond earlier and their individual responses had significantly higher amplitude (p<0.01) and significantly less latency variability (p<0.01) compared to schizophrenia patients. The S(1) latency was the most significant discriminatory feature (p<0.01) followed by S(2) latency (p<0.01). The S(2) amplitude, though relatively larger in normal subjects (p<0.05), was the least discriminatory feature. Classification based on single-trial analysis yielded 100% accuracy, while the classical ensemble averaging yielded only a maximum of 76% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate that single-trial analysis can accurately separate schizophrenia patients from normal controls and suggest that inter-trial variability plays a significant role in information processing in the human brain.

As preliminary evidence, our event-study analysis indicates that cases and deaths in counties with in-person or hybrid opening relative to those with remote opening substantially increased after the school opening date, especially for counties without any mask mandate for staff. Our main analysis uses a dynamic panel data model for case and death growth rates, where we control for dynamically evolving mitigation policies, past infection levels, and additive county-level and state-week ""fixed"" effects. This analysis shows that an increase in visits to both K-12 schools and colleges is associated with a subsequent increase in case and death growth rates. The estimates indicate that fully opening K-12 schools with in-person learning is associated with a 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase in the growth rate of cases. We also find that the association of K-12 school visits or in-person school openings with case growth is stronger for counties that do not require staff to wear masks at schools. These findings support policies that promote masking and other precautionary measures at schools and giving vaccine priority to education workers.","Chernozhukov, Victor; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Schrimpf, Paul",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,16

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from 14 Cuban universities of medical sciences (n=200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as the cut-off point the centre of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale. RESULTS The average age of the sample was 23.30± 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25±5.404). When applying the cut-off point ≥25, only two students had high rates of perceived stress. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument (α=0.755). The cut-off point ≥20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress. CONCLUSIONS In Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and healthcare support, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point ≥20 as a reference of high stress perceived.","Hernández-García, Frank; Góngora Gómez, Onelis; González-Velázquez, Victor Ernesto; Pedraza-Rodríguez, Elys María; Zamora-Fung, Rolando; Lazo Herrera, Luis Alberto",Revista Colombiana de psiquiatria,208,24

The purpose of this study was to determine the financial impact of these changes on arthroplasty surgeons. METHODS We queried data for 35 arthroplasty surgeons within our practice from 10/2019 to 10/2020 and captured all office and arthroplasty-related surgical procedure codes. We compared the difference in both work relative value units (RVUs) and Medicare reimbursement by surgeon based on the current 2020 PFS to the 2021 changes. We also estimated the impact of several proposals to include office increases to the global surgical package for each code. RESULTS While the mean per surgeon RVU amount for primary arthroplasty procedures will decrease (6267 vs 6,088, P = .78), the mean office work RVU (2755 vs 3,220, P = .16) will increase in 2021. However, the reduction in surgical reimbursement ($530,076 in 2020 to $464,414 in 2021) far exceeds the gains from the office ($99,456 vs $107,374), leading to an overall decrease in reimbursement ($629,532 vs $571,788), a reduction of 9%. The passage of the coronavirus disease 2019 relief bill delays many of the PFS cuts and will result in an overall reduction in reimbursement of 2.4% ($629,532 vs $612,475, P = .61). CONCLUSION Arthroplasty surgeons are projected to lose 2.4% of Medicare reimbursement in 2021 with the changes in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services PFS. Further study is needed to determine whether these cuts will limit access to care for Medicare patients.","Krueger, Chad A; Courtney, P Maxwell",The Journal of arthroplasty,208,1

Little is known about the effects of case volume on the safety and efficacy of RFA or about the presence or contour of learning curves for this procedure. METHODS We collected data from the US RFA Patient Registry (from 148 institutions) for patients who underwent RFA for BE from July 2007 to July 2011. We analyzed the effects of the number of patients treated by individual endoscopists and individual centers on safety and efficacy outcomes of RFA. Outcomes, including stricture, bleeding, hospitalization, and complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CEIM), were assessed using logistic regression. The effects of center and investigator experience on numbers of treatment sessions to achieve CEIM were examined using linear regression. RESULTS After we controlled for potential confounders, we found that as the experience of endoscopists and centers increased with cases, the numbers of treatment sessions required to achieve CEIM decreased. This relationship persisted after adjusting for patient age, sex, race, length of BE, and presence of pretreatment dysplasia (P < .01). Center experience was not significantly associated with overall rates of CEIM or complete eradication of dysplasia. We did not observe any learning curve with regard to risks of stricture, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, or hospitalization (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS Based on analysis of a large multicenter registry, efficiency of the treatment, as measured by number of sessions needed to achieve CEIM, increased with case volume, indicating a learning curve effect. This trend began to disappear after treatment of approximately 30 patients by the center or individual endoscopist. However, there was no significant association between safety or efficacy outcomes and previous case volume.","Pasricha, Sarina; Cotton, Cary; Hathorn, Kelly E; Li, Nan; Bulsiewicz, William J; Wolf, W Asher; Muthusamy, V Raman; Komanduri, Srinadh; Wolfsen, Herbert C; Pruitt, Ron E; Ertan, Atilla; Chmielewski, Gary W; Shaheen, Nicholas J",Gastroenterology,208,33

There are many suggested ways to improve pain after rotator cuff surgery, but the effects of adopting a pathway that includes formal patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and extensive multimodal analgesia are unclear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Does adoption of a clinical pathway incorporating patient education, a long-acting nerve block, and preemptive multimodal analgesia reduce the worst pain during the first 48 hours after surgery compared with current standard institutional practices? (2) Does adoption of the pathway reduce opioid use? (3) Does adoption of the pathway reduce side effects and improve patient-oriented outcomes? METHODS From September 2018 to January 2020, 281 patients scheduled for arthroscopic ambulatory rotator cuff surgery were identified for this paired sequential prospective cohort study. Among patients in the control group, 177 were identified, 33% (58) were not eligible, for 11% (20) staff was not available, 56% (99) were approached, 16% (29) declined, 40% (70) enrolled, and 40% (70) were analyzed (2% [4] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). For patients in the pathway cohort, 104 were identified, 17% (18) were not eligible, for 11% (11) staff was not available, 72% (75) were approached, 5% (5) declined, 67% (70) enrolled, and 67% (70) were analyzed (3% [3] lost to follow-up for secondary outcomes after postoperative day 2). No patients were lost to follow-up for primary outcome; for secondary outcomes, four were lost in the control group and three in the pathway group after postoperative day 2 (p = 0.70). The initial 70 patients enrolled received routine care (control group), and in a subsequent cohort, 70 patients received care guided by a pathway (pathway group). Of the 205 eligible patients, 68% (140) were included in the analysis. This was not a study comparing two tightly defined protocols but rather a study to determine whether adoption of a pathway would alter patient outcomes. For this reason, we used a pragmatic (real-world) study design that did not specify how control patients would be treated, and it did not require that all pathway patients receive all components of the pathway. We developed the pathway in coordination with a group of surgeons and anesthesiologists who agreed to apply the pathway as much as was viewed practical for each individual patient. Patients in both groups received a brachial plexus nerve block with sedation. Major differences between the pathway and control groups were: detailed patient education regarding reasonable pain expectations with a goal of reducing opioid use (no formal educational presentation was given to the control), a long-acting nerve block using bupivacaine with dexamethasone (control patients often received shorter-acting local anesthetic without perineural dexamethasone), and preemptive multimodal analgesia including intraoperative ketamine, postoperative acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and gabapentin at bedtime, with opioids as needed (control patients received postoperative opioids but most did not get postoperative NSAIDS and no controls received gabapentin or separate prescriptions for acetaminophen). The primary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) worst pain with movement 0 to 48 hours after block placement. The NRS pain score ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible). The minimum clinically important difference (MCID) [12] for NRS that was used for calculation of the study sample size was 1.3 [18], although some authors suggest 1 [13] or 2 [5] are appropriate; if we had used an MCID of 2, the sample size would have been smaller. Secondary outcomes included NRS pain scores at rest, daily opioid use (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), block duration, patient-oriented pain questions (postoperative day 1, 2, 7, 14), and patient and physician adherence to pathway. RESULTS On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had lower worst pain with movement (3.3 ± 3.1) compared with control patients (5.6 ± 3.0, mean difference -2.7 [95% CI -3.7 to -1.7]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for pain at rest (1.9 ± 2.3 versus 4.0 ± 2.9, mean difference -2.0 [95% CI -2.8 to -1.3]; p < 0.001). Cumulative postoperative opioid use (0-48 hours) was reduced (pathway oral morphine equivalent use was 23 ± 28 mg versus 44 ± 35 mg, mean difference 21 [95% CI 10 to 32]; p < 0.01). The greatest difference in opioid use was in the first 24 hours after surgery (pathway 7 ± 12 mg versus control 21 ± 21 mg, mean difference -14 [95% CI -19 to -10]; p < 0.01). On postoperative day 1, pathway patients had less interference with staying asleep compared with control patients (0.5 ± 1.6 versus 2.6 ± 3.3, mean difference -2.2 [95% CI -3.3 to -1.1]; p < 0.001); lower scores were also seen for interference with activities (0.9 ± 2.3 versus 1.9 ± 2.9, mean difference -1.1 [95% CI -2 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). Satisfaction with pain treatment on postoperative day 1 was higher among pathway patients compared with control patients (9.2 ± 1.7 versus 8.2 ± 2.5, mean difference 1.0 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.8]; p < 0.001). On postoperative day 2, pathway patients had lower nausea scores compared with control patients (0.3 ± 1.1 versus 1 ± 2.1, mean difference -0.7 [95% CI -1.2 to -0.1]; p = 0.02); lower scores were also seen for drowsiness on postoperative day 1 (1.7 ± 2.7 versus 2.6 ± 2.6, mean difference -0.9 [95% CI - 1.7 to -0.1]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Adoption of the pathway was associated with improvement in the primary outcome (pain with movement) that exceeded the MCID. Patients in the pathway group had improved patient-oriented outcomes and fewer side effects. This pathway uses multiple analgesic drugs, which may pose risks to elderly patients, in particular. Therefore, in evaluating whether to use this pathway, clinicians should weigh the effect sizes against the potential risks that may emerge with large scale use, consider the difficulties involved in adapting a pathway to local practice so that pathway will persist, and recognize that this study only enrolled patients among surgeons and the anesthesiologists that advocated for the pathway; results may have been different with less enthusiastic clinicians. This pathway, based on a long-lasting nerve block, multimodal analgesia, and patient education can be considered for adoption.

A Swedish nationwide analysis.,14.938806,8.171878,2020-12-11,"OBJECTIVES To determine imaging features of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in different stages, and to provide foundations for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS All 187 patients' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or ""white lung"". The CT imaging features in 185 cases (98.9%) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis. The imaging features of 6 times of lung CT examination in one case showed continuous progress. The original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed, but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of CT scanning. The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics. The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT. Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes. Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.","Zhong, Zheng; Hu, Ying; Yu, Qizhi; Li, Yuxin; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei; Liu, Jingui; Liu, Jun; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhao, Wei",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

The opportunity to influence clinical outcomes through hypertension management is therefore paramount. Despite adherence to multiple available medical therapies, a significant proportion of patients have persistent blood pressure elevation, a condition termed resistant hypertension. Recent recognition of the importance of the renal sympathetic and somatic nerves in modulating blood pressure and the development of a novel procedure that selectively removes these contributors to resistant hypertension represents an opportunity to provide clinically meaningful benefit across wide and varied patient populations. Early clinical evaluation with catheter-based, selective renal sympathetic denervation in patients with resistant hypertension has mechanistically correlated sympathetic efferent denervation with decreased renal norepinephrine spillover and renin activity, increased renal plasma flow, and has demonstrated clinically significant, sustained reductions in blood pressure. The SYMPLICITY HTN-3 Trial is a pivotal study designed as a prospective, randomized, masked procedure, single-blind trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of catheter-based bilateral renal denervation for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension despite compliance with at least 3 antihypertensive medications of different classes (at least one of which is a diuretic) at maximal tolerable doses. The primary effectiveness endpoint is measured as the change in office-based systolic blood pressure from baseline to 6 months.

Institutional responses to the demand for patient care reduced the time many residents have to pursue clinical electives, scholarship projects, and other experiences meant to clarify and advance their personal and professional goals. Moreover, many academic medical centers experienced profound fiscal losses that require thoughtful revisions to budgets and curricula. In this article, the authors recommend strategies for residency programs to mitigate these losses and capitalize on growth in virtual education, scholarship opportunities, and relationships arising from the pandemic. Drawing from career development guidelines from the National Career Development Association and existing literature about factors associated with positive career outcomes, the authors suggest leadership roles, curricula, and events that training programs can quickly and inexpensively implement to help residents grow as professionals, achieve personal training goals, produce scholarship, and attain future employment. To help trainees manage their careers, the authors recommend structured mentorship and education in career pathways and the preparation of job application materials. To foster attainment of specific knowledge and cultivate lifelong learning, the authors recommend leveraging existing resources to provide time, funding, academic coaching, and skills training for scholarship projects. To promote development of effective work relationships and community, the authors recommend appointment of a faculty champion for career advancement, scholarship showcases, attendance at virtual journal clubs, and networking through social media outlets. These recommendations for supporting career advancement may apply to early career faculty development as well as undergraduate and postgraduate medical education beyond the pandemic era.

This study evaluates LAARP management for intermediate type rectovestibular fistula (IRVF) in the female patient with ARM. METHODS Twelve patients with IRVF (aged 3-5 months) underwent LAARP from 2017 to 2019 in our institute. LAARP was performed for mobilization of the rectum, visualization and enlargement of the center of the sphincter muscle complex (SMC) from pelvic and perineal aspects, intra-fistula mucosectomy and rectal pull-through in the SMC with the fourchette and the perineal body unattached. RESULTS LARRP was performed in all patients without conversion to open procedure. No patient suffered from wound infection, vaginal injury, recurrent fistula and anal stenosis. The parents were satisfied with the appearance of the wound. Rectal prolapse developed in one patient and needed surgical correction. The patients were followed up for a mean of 19.7 months (ranged from 12 to 35 months). CONCLUSION Our preliminary experience shows that LAARP offers an alternative method of correction for the IRVF with good visualization of the SMC and may diminish the risks of wound dehiscence and vaginal injury.","Li, Long; Ren, Xianghai; Ming, Anxiao; Zhou, Yan; Xu, Hang; Liu, Xuelai; Li, Qi; Xie, Xianghui; Diao, Mei",Pediatric surgery international,208,1

However, some have stated that they do not wish to have gene therapy either now or in the future. AIM This sub-study, part of the larger Exigency programme, assesses the attitudes, views and understanding of those who do not wish to undergo gene therapy. METHODS Participants were approached via social media and word of mouth referral and invited to participate in a focus group or individual interview to discuss their views. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. RESULTS Ten adult men with severe haemophilia (eight haemophilia A and two haemophilia B), mean age 34.3 years, participated in a 1-h focus group (n = 9) or interview (n = 1). All were on prophylaxis. None reported significant treatment burden, and all had annual bleeding rates of less than five in the previous 12 months. Four major themes emerged: self-identity and its loss, lack of long-term safety and efficacy data, ongoing concerns about past viral infection, and lack of current treatment burden. CONCLUSION There are many concerns about gene therapy, including eligibility, effectiveness and safety, which may result in individuals declining it as a therapy. These concerns may recede as more data are published. This study reveals a psychological dynamic around self-identity and belonging for PwH. The nature of this dynamic is poorly understood and needs exploration to facilitate support for those making decisions about gene therapy.","Fletcher, Simon; Jenner, Kathryn; Holland, Michael; Chaplin, Steve; Khair, Kate",Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia,208,5

Our results indicate a strong positive relationship between livestock-processing plants and local community transmission of COVID-19, suggesting that these plants may act as transmission vectors into the surrounding population and accelerate the spread of the virus beyond what would be predicted solely by population risk characteristics. We estimate the total excess COVID-19 cases and deaths associated with proximity to livestock plants to be 236,000 to 310,000 (6 to 8% of all US cases) and 4,300 to 5,200 (3 to 4% of all US deaths), respectively, as of July 21, 2020, with the vast majority likely related to community spread outside these plants. The association is found primarily among large processing facilities and large meatpacking companies. In addition, we find evidence that plant closures attenuated county-wide cases and that plants that received permission from the US Department of Agriculture to increase their production-line speeds saw more county-wide cases. Ensuring both public health and robust essential supply chains may require an increase in meatpacking oversight and potentially a shift toward more decentralized, smaller-scale meat production.","Taylor, Charles A; Boulos, Christopher; Almond, Douglas",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,16

ECOPD also represent the largest component of the socioeconomic burden of COPD. ECOPDs are currently defined as acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that require additional therapy. Definitions that require worsening of dyspnoea and sputum volume/purulence assume that acute infections, especially respiratory viral infections, and/or exposure to pollutants are the main cause of ECOPD. But other factors may contribute to ECOPD, such as the exacerbation of other respiratory diseases and non-respiratory diseases (e.g., heart failure, thromboembolism). The complexity of worsening dyspnoea has suggested a need to improve the definition of ECOPD using objective measurements such as blood counts and C-reactive protein to improve accuracy of diagnosis and a personalized approach to management. There are three time points when we can intervene to improve outcomes: acutely, to attenuate the length and severity of an established exacerbation; in the aftermath, to prevent early recurrence and readmission, which are common, and in the long-term, establishing preventative measures that reduce the risk of future events. Acute management includes interventions such as corticosteroids or antibiotics and measures to support the respiratory system, including non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Current therapies are broad and better understanding of clinical phenotypes and biomarkers may help to establish a more tailored approach, for example in relation to antibiotic prescription. Other unmet needs include effective treatment for viruses, which commonly cause exacerbations. Preventing early recurrence and readmission to hospital is important and the benefits of interventions such as antibiotics or anti-inflammatories in this period are not established. Domiciliary NIV in those patients who are persistently hypercapnic following discharge and pulmonary rehabilitation can have a positive impact. For long-term prevention, inhaled therapy is key. Dual bronchodilators reduce exacerbation frequency but in patients with continuing exacerbations, triple therapy should be considered, especially if blood eosinophils are elevated. Other options include phosphodiesterase inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics. ECOPD are a key component of the assessment of COPD severity and future outcomes (quality of life, hospitalisations, health care resource utilization, mortality) and are a central component in pharmacological management decisions. Targeted therapies directed towards specific pathways of inflammation are being explored in exacerbation prevention, and this is a promising avenue for future research.","MacLeod, Mairi; Papi, Alberto; Contoli, Marco; Beghé, Bianca; Celli, Bartolome R; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A; Fabbri, Leonardo M",Respirology,208,1

This condition, whereby motor control of the hand during previously highly trained movements on the instrument is lost, is termed focal hand dystonia. It is widely considered to be a consequence of prolonged repetitive daily practice, often in combination with exposure to a range of other risk factors. Current literature recommends retraining as a promising treatment intervention, although only scant scientific evidence exists on which components should be included in a retraining program, and how these may be best administered. METHODS A progressive muscle activation and movement exercise program was devised by one of the authors applying a series of anatomy-based off-instrument movement tasks. This series of fine motor control exercises, was used to both assess and retrain focal hand dystonia in a population of musicians. The standardized approach aimed to provide a systematic method of retraining musically relevant muscular synergies that could later be applied to the instrument, while still allowing individual modifications. Retraining sessions were mostly run online as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, although some early sessions were also able to be undertaken face to face. Both qualitative and quantitative measures were used in this case series to evaluate program efficacy, due to the typical heterogeneity of the focal hand dystonia participants. This included: blinded external neurological evaluation of video footage using the Tubiana grading system, written subjective feedback, exercise progressions, and performance outcomes. RESULTS Pilot testing of 4 patients indicated the utility of the program over approximately a 12- month time period. All subjects improved, 2 of whom have returned to pre-dystonia performance levels. These patients reported the importance of patience and persistence with daily exercise sessions in their recovery. CONCLUSION Using off-instrument playing-relevant exercises to enhance fine motor control and muscle activation can be effective in retraining focal hand dystonia, regardless of additional treatments or level of performance. They should be regularly practiced and progressed in order for effects to be best progressed to instrumental applications. Further research may elucidate whether there are optimal outcomes with single or particular combinations of treatment approaches.","Ackermann, Bronwen; Altenmüller, Eckart",Journal of hand therapy : official journal of the American Society of Hand Therapists,208,16

METHODS We searched the Cochrane Review on Mechanical Methods for Induction of Labour, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase via Ovid, Ovid Emcare, CINAHL Plus, ClinicalTrials.gov and Scopus from inception to April 2019, for randomized controlled trials comparing Foley catheter to oral misoprostol for IOL in viable singleton gestations. Co-primary outcomes were vaginal birth, a composite of adverse perinatal outcome, and a composite of adverse maternal outcome. The quality of included RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach. We used two-stage random-effects model for the meta-analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle and assessed interactions between treatment and baseline characteristics. RESULTS From seven eligible studies, four shared individual participant data for a total of 2815 participants, of which 1399 women were assigned to Foley catheter and 1416 to oral misoprostol. Compared with oral misoprostol, Foley catheter recipients had a slightly decreased chance of having a vaginal birth (4 trials, 2815 women, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99, I2 2.0%, moderate-certainty evidence). Foley catheter may lead to fewer adverse perinatal outcomes in comparison with oral misoprostol (4 trials, 2815 women, risk ratio [RR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.48-1.05, I2 14.9%, low-certainty evidence). Adverse maternal outcome did not differ (4 trials, 2815 women, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03, I2 0%, moderate-certainty evidence). Meta-analyses of effect-modifications did not show significant interactions between interventions, parity and gestational age on primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS For women undergoing IOL Foley catheter is less effective than oral misoprostol as it was associated with fewer vaginal births. However, while we found no significant difference in maternal safety, Foley catheter induction may reduce adverse perinatal outcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

The primary objective of this study was to determine the clinical value of fluorine-18 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/MRI for surveillance and restaging of patients with muscle-invasive, locally advanced, and metastatic bladder cancer compared to conventional imaging methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study enrolled patients with muscle-invasive, locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer in a single institute evaluated with 18F-FDG PET/MRI. All patients also underwent conventional imaging with CT. Additional imaging may also have included 18F-FDG PET/CT (18F-FDG PET), or sodium fluoride (NaF) PET/CT in some patients. Images were reviewed by a diagnostic radiologist/nuclear medicine physician. Number of lesions and sites of disease were captured and compared between 18F-FDG PET/MRI and conventional imaging. Lesions were confirmed by sequential imaging or lesion biopsy. All patients were followed for survival. RESULTS Fifteen patients (4 for surveillance; 11 for restaging) underwent 34 18F-FDG PET/MRI scans. Each patient received a corresponding conventional CT around the time of the 18F-FDG PET/MRI (median 6 days). The 15 patients (11 male; 4 female) had a median age of 61.5 years (range 37-73) and histologies of urothelial carcinoma (n = 13) and small-cell carcinoma of the bladder (n = 2) diagnosed as stage 4 (n = 13), stage 3 (n = 1), or stage 2 (n = 1). 18F-FDG PET/MRI detected 82 metastatic malignant lesions involving lymph nodes (n = 22), liver (n = 10), lung (n = 34), soft tissue (n = 12), adrenal glands (n = 1), prostate (n = 1), and bone (n = 2) with a resultant advantage of 36% for lesion visibility in comparison with CT. Serial imaging or biopsy confirmed these lesions as malignant. CONCLUSION 18F-FDG PET/MRI can detect metastatic lesions which cannot be identified on conventional CT, and this can allow for better treatment planning and improved disease monitoring during therapy.","Civelek, Ali Cahid; Niglio, Scot A; Malayeri, Ashkan A; Lin, Jeffrey; Gurram, Sandeep; Chalfin, Heather J; Turkbey, Baris; Valera, Vladimir; Steinberg, Seth M; Apolo, Andrea B",Urologic oncology,208,1

Interests here mainly focus on possible jeopardized organ perfusion and in particular brain oxygenation with possible adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the intraoperative effects of CO2 gas PP on cerebral oxygenation during laparoscopic surgery for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in young infants. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this single-center prospective observational study, we investigated brain oxygenation in 12 young infants receiving laparoscopic pyloromyotomy with CO2 PP, with a pressure of 8 mm Hg and a flow rate of 5 L/minute. Intraoperative hemodynamic parameters and transcranial near-infrared spectroscopy to assess regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) were monitored continuously during the whole procedure. Parameters were analyzed in four intervals: before insufflation (T0), during (start [T1] and end [T2]), and after cessation (T3) of the CO2 PP. RESULTS Blood pressure and end-tidal CO2 (etCO2) increased during the procedure: mean arterial pressure, 35±5 mm Hg at T0 to 43±9 mm Hg at T2; etCO2, 35±4 mm Hg at T0 to 40±3 mm Hg at T3. The rScO2 remained stable throughout the whole anesthetic period. In none of the patients did the rScO2 drop below the safety threshold of 55% (rScO2, 68±14% at T0 to 71±9% at T3). CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that a laparoscopic procedure with a CO2 PP of 8 mm Hg can be performed under safe anesthetic conditions in the presence of gradually increasing blood pressure and etCO2 without altering regional brain oxygenation levels.","Tytgat, Stefaan H A J; Stolwijk, Lisanne J; Keunen, Kristin; Milstein, Dan M J; Lemmers, Petra M A; van der Zee, David C",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

METHODS Fifteen female pigs (32.8-37.2 kg) were randomly assigned to undergo TV NOTES (n=5), TR NOTES (n=5), or conventional laparoscopic nephrectomy (n=5). Postoperatively, all animals were observed for global health status during the recovery from anesthesia. Variable laboratory parameters and inflammatory cytokines were compared among the groups during the entire experimental period. Postmortem examination was performed 1 week after operation for assessment of abdominal complications and cultures for microorganisms. RESULTS All experiments were completed successfully without insertion of an extra port or conversion to laparoscopic or open surgery. Although mean operative times were longer in TV and TR NOTES groups than in the conventional laparoscopy group (61 vs 84 vs 24 min, P<0.001), there were no signs of visceral injury or peritonitis on postmortem examination. None of the laboratory parameters, including white blood cell count, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 differed among the groups during the entire experimental period. CONCLUSIONS TV and TR NOTES nephrectomy could be completed successfully with similar physiologic influence to those of conventional laparoscopic nephrectomy in a porcine survival model.","Park, Yong Hyun; Kim, Kwang Taek; Bae, Jung-Bum; Kim, Hyeon Hoe",Journal of endourology,208,11

This is cause for concern with regard to bioethics and good clinical practice. The evidence for the efficacy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine is currently derived from open label trials and cell culture studies with no conclusive evidence available from randomised clinical trials. Hydroxychloroquine also carries contraindications in the case of conditions such as maculopathy, retinopathy and QTc prolongation and should be used with caution in vulnerable populations such as children, pregnancy, lactation and the elderly. Despite this, there has been a rush to procure and self-medicate with hydroxychloroquine, which has been addressed by the National Task Force. The WHO and the FDA have not found adequate evidence to recommend any specific medication for the treatment of Covid-19. While further evidence is awaited, including from trials registered with the FDA and the ICMR, it is recommended that the administration of hydroxychloroquine for chemo-prophylaxis be considered on a case by case basis with monitoring by a registered medical practitioner including electrocardiography (ECG). The potential for retinal and cardiac toxicity must also be borne in mind. It is further recommended that a public advisory regarding the need for caution in chemo-prophylaxis be made available in the public domain.

The purpose of this study is to review the use and implementation of behaviour change theories in dietary interventions for people after cancer and assess their effects on the reported outcomes. METHODS The search strategy from a Cochrane review on dietary interventions for cancer survivors was expanded to incorporate an additional criterion on the use of behaviour change theory and updated to September 2020. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) testing a dietary intervention compared to the control were included. Standard Cochrane methodological procedures were used. RESULTS Nineteen RCTs, with 6261 participants (age range 44.6 to 73.1 years), were included in the review. The Social Cognitive Theory was the most frequently used theory (15 studies, 79%). Studies included between 4 to 17 behaviour change techniques. Due to limited information on the mediators of intervention and large heterogeneity between studies, no meta-analyses was conducted to assess which theoretical components of the interventions are effective. CONCLUSIONS Whilst researchers have incorporated behaviour change theories into dietary interventions for cancer survivors, due to inconsistencies in design, evaluation and reporting, the effect of theories on survivors' outcomes remains unclear.","Sremanakova, Jana; Sowerbutts, Anne Marie; Todd, Chris; Cooke, Richard; Burden, Sorrel",Nutrients,208,16

Our aim was to study whether intra-arterial treatment in patients with prior antiplatelet treatment is safe and whether prior antiplatelet treatment modifies treatment effect. Methods All 500 MR CLEAN patients were included. We estimated the effect of intra-arterial treatment with ordinal logistic regression analysis, and tested for interaction of antiplatelet treatment with intra-arterial treatment on outcome. Furthermore, safety parameters and serious adverse events were analyzed. Results The 144 patients (29%) on antiplatelet treatment were older, more often male, and had more vascular comorbidity. Intra-arterial treatment effect size after adjustments in antiplatelet treatment patients was 1.7 (95% confidence interval 0.9-3.2), and in no antiplatelet treatment patients 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.2-2.6). There was no statistically or clinically significant interaction between prior antiplatelet treatment and the relative effect of intra-arterial treatment ( p = 0.78). However, in patients on antiplatelet treatment, the effect of successful reperfusion on functional outcome in the intervention arm of the trial was doubled: the absolute risk difference for favorable outcome after successful reperfusion in patients on prior antiplatelet treatment was 39% versus 18% in patients not on prior antiplatelet treatment (Pinteraction = 0.025). Patients on antiplatelet treatment more frequently had a symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (15%) compared to patients without antiplatelet treatment (4%), without differences between the control and intervention arm. Conclusions Prior treatment with antiplatelet agents did not modify the effect of intra-arterial treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting with an intracranial large vessel occlusion. There were no safety concerns. In patients with reperfusion, antiplatelet agents may improve functional outcome.","Mulder, Maxim Jhl; Berkhemer, Olvert A; Fransen, Puck Ss; van den Berg, Lucie A; Lingsma, Hester F; den Hertog, Heleen M; Staals, Julie; Jenniskens, Sjoerd Fm; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; van Zwam, Wim H; Majoie, Charles Blm; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik Wj",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,208,26

METHODS The clinical data of patients who underwent thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection were analysed. A total of 197 consecutive male patients from January 2012 to December 2014, and 72 female patients from June 2013 to December 2014 were included retrospectively. Of the males, 65 received a transareolar single-port procedure (TASP Group) and 132 received a standard two-port procedure (Standard Group A). Among the females, 18 were treated with a subxiphoid single-port procedure (SXSP Group), and 54 were treated with the standard procedure (Standard Group B). The general clinical materials and surgical outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS All patients underwent total thoracoscopic wedge resection successfully, and no severe complications were observed. In men, there were no significant differences in operation time, blood loss, postoperative drainage amount, chest drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay or pain score on the first postoperative day (P = 0.827; 0.423; 0.174; 0.440; 0.115; 0.159, respectively). The pain scores of the TASP Group on the day before and after removal of the chest tube were lower (P = 0.006; 0.023, respectively) than those of Standard Group A, and the incision-associated paraesthesia in the third and sixth month after operation was reduced (P = 0.041; 0.026, respectively). The incision satisfaction degree was significantly improved in the TASP Group (P = 0.001). In women, there were no significant differences in blood loss, drainage amount, chest drainage duration or postoperative hospital stay (P = 0.680; 0.757; 0.651; 0.608, respectively). The operation time of the SXSP Group was longer (P = 0.000), and the pain scores on the first postoperative day and the days before and after removal were all significantly lower (P = 0.000; 0.000; 0.000, respectively) than those of the Standard Group B. Furthermore, the incision paraesthesia 3 and 6 months after surgery was greatly reduced (P = 0.001; 0.001, respectively), although the patients were not very satisfied with the cosmetic results (P = 0.577). CONCLUSIONS In single-port thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection, we performed 'individualized' procedures based on gender, namely, the transareolar approach in males and the subxiphoid approach in females. These procedures were considered feasible and safe, and showed superiority in reducing postoperative pain. However, the cosmetic results of the subxiphoid approach require further improvement.","Xu, Kai; Bian, Wen; Xie, Hongya; Ma, Haitao; Ni, Bin",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,208,20

METHODS Second-year (D2) and fourth-year (D4) dental students, postgraduate orthodontic students (OS), and periodontology students (PS) were presented with an anonymous survey of 10 cases, each with five choices of diagnosis and seven therapeutic approaches. The cases included a patient summary, photographs, radiographs, periodontal charting, and ranged from health to periodontitis. Consensus diagnosis, used as a gold standard, was established between two experienced periodontists. Diagnosis and treatment choices for each case were compared across educational groups using Fisher's exact test. The level of agreement among educational groups was assessed using a multirater kappa coefficient. RESULTS The survey was completed in 2020 with a 72.4% overall response rate (57-D2, 45-D4, 17-OS, and 12-PS). The overall level of agreement on diagnosis was fair (κ = 0.24, p <.0001) with PS showing the most agreement (κ = 0.55, p <.0001). There were tendencies to prioritize stage over grade and extent in assigning diagnoses and to overdiagnose disease severity and underdiagnose localized periodontitis. Nonsurgical periodontal therapies had the highest overall agreement (κ = 0.63 for scaling/root planing and κ = 0.44 for maintenance, p <.0001). Response distribution per case and per level of education indicated that PS more consistently agreed with the gold standard than any other group. CONCLUSIONS OS, D2, and D4 students demonstrated inferior agreement levels compared to PS, successfully recognized health from disease, suggested appropriate treatment plans, and tended to overdiagnose milder periodontal conditions.","Abou-Arraj, Ramzi V; Kaur, Maninder; Alkhoury, Shadi; Swain, Thomas A; Geurs, Nicolaas C; Souccar, Nada M",Journal of dental education,208,16

In so doing, interrelation among anxiety, which surfaced because of Covid-19 pandemic, coping style with stress of individuals and compulsive purchase behavior has been explored. Based on these interrelations, a structural model was suggested. Findings of the research indicated that anxiety has high effect on the helpless approach dimension, which is one of the coping styles with stress; and that helpless approach alone has an effect on compulsive buying behavior. Besides, another objective of the study was to evaluate the mediating effect of intolerance of uncertainty between coping style with stress and compulsive buying behavior. That analysis evidenced that intolerance of uncertainty in such an interrelation had a partial mediating effect.","Çelik, Samet; Köse, Gözde Güsan",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,208,16

The enhancement of seed mineral content via genetic improvement is considered as the most promising and cost-effective approach compared alternative means for meeting the dietary needs. The overall objective of this study was to perform a GWAS of mineral content (Ca, K, P and S) in seeds of a core set of 137 soybean lines that are representative of the diversity of early maturing soybeans cultivated in Canada (maturity groups 000-II). RESULTS This panel of 137 soybean lines was grown in five environments (in total) and the seed mineral content was measured using a portable x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer. The association analyses were carried out using three statistical models and a set of 2.2 million SNPs obtained from a combined dataset of genotyping-by-sequencing and whole-genome sequencing. Eight QTLs significantly associated with the Ca, K, P and S content were identified by at least two of the three statistical models used (in two environments) contributing each from 17 to 31% of the phenotypic variation. A strong reproducibility of the effect of seven out these eight QTLs was observed in three other environments. In total, three candidate genes were identified involved in transport and assimilation of these mineral elements. CONCLUSIONS There have been very few GWAS studies to identify QTLs associated with the mineral element content of soybean seeds.

However, the relative contribution of each virus-encoded innate immune antagonist has not been fully studied in the context of RV infection in vivo Here, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence that the host IFN-inducible 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and ribonuclease L (RNase L) pathway effectively suppresses the replication of heterologous RV strains. VP3 from homologous RVs relies on its 2'-5'-phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain to counteract RNase L mediated antiviral signaling. Using a RV reverse genetics system, we show that compared to the parental strain, VP3 PDE mutant RVs replicated at a lower level in the small intestine and shed less in the feces of wild-type mice and such defects were rescued in Rnasel -/- suckling mice. Collectively, these findings highlight an important role of VP3 in promoting viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo in addition to its well characterized function as the viral RNA capping enzyme.ImportanceRotaviruses are significant human pathogens that result in diarrhea, dehydration, and deaths in many children around the world. Rotavirus vaccines have suboptimal efficacy in low to middle income countries, where the burden of the diseases is the most severe. With the ultimate goal to improve current vaccines, we aim to better understand how rotavirus interacts with the host innate immune system in the small intestine.

In addition, virus encoded VP3 antagonizes RNase L activity both in vitro and in vivo These studies highlight an ever-evolving arms race between antiviral factors and viral pathogens and provide a new means of targeted attenuation for the next-generation rotavirus vaccine design.","Song, Yanhua; Feng, Ningguo; Sanchez-Tacuba, Liliana; Yasukawa, Linda L; Ren, Lili; Silverman, Robert H; Ding, Siyuan; Greenberg, Harry B",Journal of virology,208,16

Experimental data have suggested the use of levosimendan to limit ischemia-reperfusion injury by improving cerebral microcirculation. However, recent studies have questioned this effect. The present study aimed to investigate the influence on hemodynamic parameters, cerebral perfusion and oxygenation following cardiac arrest by ventricular fibrillation in juvenile male pigs. Following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), animals were randomly assigned to levosimendan (12 µg/kg, followed by 0.3 µg/kg/min) or vehicle treatment for 6 h. Levosimendan-treated animals showed significantly higher brain PbtO2 levels. This effect was not accompanied by changes in cardiac output, preload and afterload, arterial blood pressure, or cerebral microcirculation indicating a local effect. Cerebral oxygenation is key to minimizing damage, and thus, current concepts are aimed at improving impaired cardiac output or cerebral perfusion. In the present study, we showed that NIRS does not reliably detect low PbtO2 levels and that levosimendan increases brain oxygen content. Thus, levosimendan may present a promising therapeutic approach to rescue brain tissue at risk following cardiac arrest or ischemic events such as stroke or traumatic brain injury.","García-Bardon, Andreas; Kamuf, Jens; Ziebart, Alexander; Liu, Tanghua; Krebs, Nadia; Dünges, Bastian; Kelm, Robert F; Morsbach, Svenja; Mohr, Kristin; Heimann, Axel; Hartmann, Erik K; Thal, Serge C",Scientific reports,208,31

The diagnostic utility of these tests was evaluated at a 95% sensitivity, with the outcome measure being the number of OFCs required. RESULTS Twenty-seven patients (64%) were diagnosed with SFA. Ses i 1-IgE differed significantly between allergic and tolerant patients (p=0.0001). ROC curve analysis for Ses i 1-IgE yielded an AUC of 0.88 ±0.05. Levels of Ses i1-IgE correlated to induced CD63+ expression on basophils (p =0.0001). Ses i1-IgE was not sufficiently robust as a single step for diagnosis. Used concurrently, BAT and Ses i 1-IgE, yielded correct positive classifications for 25 of 27 sesame allergic patients with two false positives (93% PPV). Both tests were negative in 5 nonallergic patients. Patients with divergent Ses i 1-IgE and BAT results required OFC (n=10, 24% of patients). Alternatively, sequential use of BAT, ruling in SFA followed by Ses i 1-IgE diagnosing nonallergic patients, yielded a 89% PPV, with 19% requiring OFC. CONCLUSION Ses i1-IgE and BAT used together, can decrease the need for OFC in most SFA patients. A prospective cohort trial is necessary to validate these results.","Goldberg, Michael R; Appel, Michael Y; Nachshon, Liat; Holmqvist, Marie; Epstein-Rigbi, Naama; Levy, Michael B; Lidholm, Jonas; Elizur, Arnon",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,208,1

However, as a pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery, LSC is problematic because it requires specific techniques and it takes a comparatively longer operative time. In this study, we present our surgical techniques of LSC and their effectiveness for shortening operative times and raising safety. Methods Thirty-four women with stage 2 or greater POP who underwent LSC in our hospital between September 2014 and October 2015 were enrolled in this study. The notable points of our operative procedures are as follows: (1) fixing the sigmoid colon to the left lateral abdominal wall for a clearer visualization of the sacral promontory, (2) making a retroperitoneal tunnel (not opening the peritoneum) from the sacral promontory to the Douglas pouch, (3) dissection of the vaginal wall after transvaginal hydrodissection, (4) fixation of mesh to the vaginal wall by using absorbable tacks, and (5) limiting usage of posterior mesh for the patients with posterior vaginal wall descent. Results The median operative time was 140 (range, 90-255) minutes, and blood loss was 50 (range, 10-1600) mL. The operative time decreased as the surgical techniques improved through experience. No major intra- or postoperative complications occurred. The mean follow-up period was 4 (range, 1 -14) months, and only one patient presented a recurrent grade 2 cystocele. Conclusion Our unique procedures will help shorten operative times and reduce complications of LSC.","Hoshino, Kaori; Yoshimura, Kazuaki; Nishimura, Kazuaki; Hachisuga, Toru",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,208,1

We have integrated multiple modules, including ""Genomics,"" ""Diagnosis,"" ""Immunotherapy,"" and ""Drug Designing"" to understand the holistic view of this pandemic medical disaster. The genomics module provides genomic information of different strains of this virus to understand genomic level alterations. The diagnosis module includes detailed information on currently-in-use diagnostics tests as well as five novel universal primer sets predicted using in silico tools. The Immunotherapy module provides information on epitope-based potential vaccine candidates (e.g., LQLPQGTTLPKGFYA, VILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKK, EITVATSRTLS, GKGQQQQGQTV, SELVIGAVILR) predicted using state-of-the-art software and resources in the field of immune informatics. These epitopes have the potential to activate both adaptive (e.g., B cell and T cell) and innate (e.g., vaccine adjuvants) immune systems as well as suitable for all strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we have also predicted potential candidates for siRNA-based therapy and RNA-based vaccine adjuvants. The drug designing module maintains information about potential drug targets, tertiary structures, and potential drug molecules. These potential drug molecules were identified from FDA-approved drugs using the docking-based approach. We also compiled information from the literature and Internet on potential drugs, repurposing drugs, and monoclonal antibodies.

METHODS Patients with M1-middle cerebral artery occlusions were prospectively included in this multicenter study. Regional analysis was performed for each patient within Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score regions M2 to M6. Regional pial vessel filling was assessed on mCTA in 3 ways: (1) Washout of contrast within pial vessels; (2) Extent of maximal pial vessel enhancement compared with contralateral hemisphere; (3) Delay in maximal pial vessel enhancement compared with contralateral hemisphere. Cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, and Tmax data were extracted within these Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score regions. Twenty-four- to 36-hour magnetic resonance imaging/CT was assessed for infarct in each Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score region (defined as >20% infarction within that region). Mixed effects logistic regression models were used to compare mCTA and CTP parameters when predicting brain infarction. Area under the receiver operating characteristics was used to assess discriminative value of statistical models. RESULTS Seventy-seven patients were included. mCTA parameter washout and CTP parameter Tmax were significantly associated with follow-up infarction in all models (P<0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic for mCTA models ranged from 92% to 94% and was not different compared with all CTP models (P>0.05). Mean Tmax and cerebral blood volume values were significantly different between each washout score (P<0.01) and each delay score category (P<0.01). Mean Tmax, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume values were significantly different between each extent score category (P<0.05).

APPROACH CSDs were reliably induced in awake non-transgenic mice using optogenetic methods. High-fidelity DC-coupled electrophysiological mapping of propagating CSDs were obtained using flexible arrays of graphene soultion-gated field-effect transistors (gSGFETs). MAIN RESULTS Viral vectors targetted channelrhopsin expression to neurons of the motor cortex resulting in ≥1mm3 trandsuction volume. 5-10s of continous blue light stimulation induced CSD that propagated across the cortex at a velocity of 3.0 ± 0.1mm/min. Graphene micro-transistor arrays enabled high-density mapping of infraslow activity correlated with neuronal activity suppression across multiple frequency bands during both CSD initiation and propagation. Localized differences in CSD waveform could be detected and categorized into distinct clusters demonstrating the spatial resolution advantages of DC-coupled recordings. We exploited the reliable and repeatable induction of CSDs using this preparation to perform proof-of-principle pharmacological interrogation studies using NMDA antagonists. MK801 (3mg/kg) suppressed CSD induction and propagation, an effect mirrored albeit transiently by ketamine (15mg/kg), thus demonstrating this models' applicability as a preclinical drug screening platform. Finally, we report that CSDs could be detected through skull using graphene micro-transistors, highlighting additional advantages and future applications of this technology. SIGNIFICANCE CSD is thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases. CSD research will benefit from technological advances that permit high density electrophysiological mapping of CSD waveform and propagation across the cortex. We report an in vivo assay that permits minimally invasive optogenetic induction, combined with multichannel DC-coupled recordings enabled by gSGFETs in awake brain. Adoption of this technological approach could facilitate and transform preclinical investigations of CSD in disease relevant models.","Masvidal Codina, Eduard; Smith, Martin; Rathore, Daman; Gao, Yunan; Illa, Xavi; Prats-Alfonso, Elisabet; Del Corro, Elena; Bonaccini, Andrea; Rius, Gemma; Martin-Fernandez, Iñigo; Guger, Christoph; Reitner, Patrick; Villa, Rosa; Garrido, Jose A; Guimera, Anton; Wykes, Rob C",Journal of neural engineering,208,1

Here, we use a modelling approach to reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 8, 2020 across five periods marked by events and interventions based on 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We estimate 87% (lower bound 53%) of the infections before March 8 were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases; and a basic reproduction number R0 of 3.54 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.40-3.67) in the early outbreak, much higher than for SARS and MERS4,5. We observe that multi-pronged interventions had considerable positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 (0.23-0.33) and by projection reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0% as of March 8. We furthermore explore the probability of resurgence following lifting of all interventions after 14 days of no ascertained infections, estimating it at 0.32 and 0.06 based on models with 87% and 53% unascertained infections, respectively, highlighting the risk posed by unascertained cases in changing intervention strategies. These results provide important implications for continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain COVID-19 outbreaks.","Hao, Xingjie; Cheng, Shanshan; Wu, Degang; Wu, Tangchun; Lin, Xihong; Wang, Chaolong",Nature,208,16

Nevertheless, aging also affects the ability of the auditory system to process temporal parameters of the sound stimulus. To explore the precision and reliability of auditory temporal processing during aging, responses to several types of sound stimuli were recorded from neurons of the auditory cortex (AC) of young and aged anaesthetized Fischer 344 rats. In response to broad-band noise bursts, the aged rats exhibited larger response magnitudes, a higher proportion of monotonic units, and also a larger variability of response magnitudes, suggesting a lower stability of the rate code. Of primary interest were the responses to temporally structured stimuli (amplitude-modulated (AM) noise, frequency-modulated (FM) tones, and click trains) recorded separately in the right and left AC. Significant differences of temporal processing were already found between the neuronal responses in the left and right AC in the young animals: for the click trains, the left hemisphere exhibited a greater responsiveness to higher repetition rates, lower vector strength values, and a lower similarity of responses. The two hemispheres were also affected differently by aging. In the right hemisphere, neurons in the aged animals displayed worse synchronization with the AM noise and clicks, but better synchronization with the FM tone. In the left hemisphere, neuronal synchronization with the stimulus modulation improved at a higher age for all three stimuli. The results show that the ability of the aging auditory system to process temporal parameters of the stimulus strongly depends on the stimulus type and on laterality. Furthermore, the commonly reported age-related decline in the temporal processing ability cannot be regarded as general as, at least at the neuronal level in the AC, objective measures of the temporal representation often exhibit age-related improvement instead of deterioration.","Bureš, Zbyněk; Pysanenko, Kateryna; Syka, Josef",Hearing research,208,1

AIMS To model the effect of vaccination on the course of the pandemic in Germany taking into account observational data and the appearance of viral mutant B.1.1.7. MATERIALS AND METHODS An effect model based on the Batman-SIZ algorithm was developed, taking into account both the parent and the B.1.1.7 mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and using input parameters obtained from observational data for January - March 2021. RESULTS Effect-modelling using 3 different vaccination scenarios with different rates of vaccination involving 67 million persons (priority groups 1 - 5) and completed within 134 days compared to 318 days beginning February 24, 2021, showed a reduction in the number of infected persons from ca. 12.5 million to ca. 4.5 million with quantitively similar benefits regarding the occupancy and a critical burden on ICU facilities. CONCLUSION The effect of vaccination in reducing the daily number of new infections, the total number of infections and the occupancy of intensive-care facilities in hospitals is proportional to the speed with which the target population are vaccinated.","Braun, Peter; Braun, Julian; Woodcock, Barry G",International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,208,17

To achieve optimal effect, the LCIG dose is individually titrated, traditionally conducted during hospitalization in Sweden. However, dose adjustment depends on surrounding conditions, physical activity, and emotional stress, which is why titration at home could be beneficial. Telemedicine (TM) using a video communication system offers alternative titration procedures, allowing LCIG initiation at home. OBJECTIVE Study objectives were to show the feasibility of TM for LCIG home titration, evaluate resource use, and assess patient, neurologist, and nurse satisfaction. METHODS Four clinics enrolled 15 patients to observe efficiency and feasibility of TM-based monitoring. RESULTS Patient median (range) age was 67 (52-73) years and time since diagnosis was 10 (7-23) years. Median time between LCIG initiation and end of TM-assisted titration was 2.8 (2.0-13.8) days. Median time required for home titration by neurologists, nurses, and patients was (hours:minutes) 1 : 14 (0 : 29-1 : 52), 5 : 49 (2 : 46-10 : 3), and 8 : 53 (4 : 11-14 : 11), respectively. Neurologists and nurses considered this to be less time than required for hospital titration. TM allowed patients 92% free time from start to end of titration. Technical problems associated with TM contacts were rare, mostly related to digital link, and quickly resolved. Patients, neurologists, and nurses were satisfied using TM. No serious adverse events were reported; there was one device complaint (tube occlusion). CONCLUSIONS In this study, TM-assisted LCIG titration at home was resource-efficient, technically feasible, well-accepted and was deemed satisfactory by patients, neurologists, and nurses.","Willows, Thomas; Dizdar, Nil; Nyholm, Dag; Widner, Håkan; Grenholm, Peter; Schmiauke, Ursula; Urbom, Anna; Groth, Kristina; Larsson, Jörgen; Permert, Johan; Kjellander, Susanna",Journal of Parkinson's disease,208,16

However, the relationship between cytokines and clinical outcomes in severe lung cancer patients was unclear. IL-6 as an important cytokine in inflammation, expression level in severe lung cancer patients was unknown. METHODS A cohort of 55 severe lung cancer patients were enrolled retrospectively in this study. The clinical characteristics, including performance status (PS), therapeutic effect, and patients' adverse effects, were recorded. The association of cytokines and the concerned clinical outcomes were assessed by logistic regression analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) was assessed to evaluate the strength of prediction. RESULTS The mean age of the patients was 59.8, and 42 patents were males. Increased IL-6 levels were associated with worse PS. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that higher IL-6 was associated with an increased risk of progressive disease (PD) (OR =1.03, 95% CI: 1.0-1.06). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the model used for predicting PD was 0.821. CONCLUSIONS Increased IL-6 levels are correlated with worse PS and are an essential predictor for PD in severe lung cancer patients.

METHODS Eight electronic databases were searched from January 1, 1992 to March 12, 2017. Gray literature was searched, reference lists scanned, and relevant journals hand-searched. Agreement for inclusion was reached by consensus by two reviewers. A standardized data extraction tool was used to document study design, population, and key findings. Questionnaire items were linked as concepts to the corresponding second-level category of the ICF. Quality of studies was not assessed, as review was exploratory. RESULTS Five outcome measures met the inclusion criteria, including the Perceived Quality of Life Scale, EuroQoL-5 dimensions, Quality of Life after Brain Injury, WHOQOL-100, and WHOQOL-BREF. A total of 373 concepts were extracted. 34 questions were linked to activities and participation (50.7%), 16 questions (23.9%) referred to body functions, and 17 questions (25.4%) were related to the environment. CONCLUSIONS The wide range of concepts covered by different outcome measures demonstrates the complexity of recovery post-concussion and a lack of universal agreement in terms of what should be measured in this population. A working conceptual model of HRQOL post-concussion is proposed.

Drivers of burnout include the expectation that we as physicians place our patients first, ahead of our own self-care; that seeking help is a sign of weakness in the culture of medicine; practice inefficiencies, including those imposed by electronic medical records; and a lack of personal resilience suffered by many physicians. The costs of burnout are high, including a decrement in the quality of care, increased turnover, and physician suicide. Changes in the culture of medicine and practice efficiency will rely on excellent leadership. On the other hand, we are individually responsible for our personal resilience. We can enhance our resilience with a variety of tools, including meditation and mindfulness practice. Fortunately, these practices are becoming more mainstream and readily available to us. This article will briefly review the problem of burnout, including drivers and costs, and then focus on meditation and mindfulness practices that we may embrace in order to become more resilient.","Hammer, Gregory B",Paediatric anaesthesia,208,20

Drawing on a cumulative disadvantage framework, this study investigates how parental addictions, parental mental illness, and exposure to domestic violence, both individually and cumulatively, are associated with childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Two waves of regionally representative data were analyzed. Bivariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted using the 2010 Brief Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) (n = 9,241 men, n = 13,627 women) and replicated using the 2012 BRFSS (n = 11,656 men, n = 18,145 women). The 2010 data indicated that 8.5 percent of men who had endured all three childhood adversities reported that they had experienced CSA, compared with 0.6 percent of men who did not experience any of these adversities. Levels of CSA for women in 2010 were 28.7 percent for those experiencing all three risk indicators, and 2.1 percent for women with no risk indicators. Results were similar in the BRFSS 2012. Those with two or more risk factors had between five- and eightfold higher odds of CSA. Social workers may be able to decrease false positives if they screen for CSA based on the presence of two or more risk factors.","Fuller-Thomson, Esme; Agbeyaka, Senyo",Social work,208,15

However, the influence of different foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response has not been comprehensively characterized. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of foods or food ingredients on the ppTG response. PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant acute (<24-h) randomized controlled trials published up to September 2018. Based on our selection criteria, 179 relevant trials (366 comparisons) were identified and systematically compiled into distinct food or food ingredient categories. A ppTG-lowering effect was noted for soluble fiber (Hedges' giAUC = -0.72; 95% CI: -1.33, -0.11), sodium bicarbonate mineral water (Hedges' gAUC = -0.42; 95% CI: -0.79, -0.04), diacylglycerol oil (Hedges' giAUC = -0.38; 95% CI: -0.75, -0.00), and whey protein when it was contrasted with other proteins. The fats group showed significant but opposite effects depending on the outcome measure used (Hedges' giAUC = -0.32; 95% CI: -0.61, -0.03; and Hedges' gAUC = 0.16; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.26). Data for other important food groups (nuts, vegetables, and polyphenols) were also assessed but of limited availability. Assessing for oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) recommendation compliance, most trials were ≥4 h long but lacked a sufficiently high fat challenge. iAUC and AUC were more common measures of ppTG. Overall, our analyses indicate that the effects on ppTG by different food groups are diverse, largely influenced by the type of food or food ingredient within the same group. The type of ppTG measurement can also influence the response.","Lee, Delia Pei Shan; Low, Jasmine Hui Min; Chen, Jacklyn Ruilin; Zimmermann, Diane; Actis-Goretta, Lucas; Kim, Jung Eun",Advances in nutrition,208,8

DESIGN Case-control study. ANIMALS 30 dogs with naturally acquired idiopathic conjunctivitis and a control population of 30 dogs without ocular disease. PROCEDURES Complete physical and ophthalmic examinations were performed for each dog. Conjunctival swab specimens were analyzed by use of virus isolation and PCR assays for the following viruses: canine adenovirus-2 (CAV-2), canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1), canine parainfuenza virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, infuenza A virus, and West Nile virus. Signalment, clinical, and historical information was recorded and compared between study groups. RESULTS Viruses were detected by either virus isolation or PCR methods significantly more frequently in conjunctival samples from dogs with conjunctivitis (7/30 [23.3%]) than dogs without conjunctivitis (0/30 [0%]). Canine herpesvirus-1 was isolated from 2 conjunctival samples and detected by use of PCR assay in 5 conjunctival samples. Canine adenovirus-2 was isolated from 1 conjunctival sample and detected by use of PCR assay in 2 conjunctiva samples. Sexually intact dogs and frequent exposure to dogs outside the household were positively associated with viral detection in the conjunctivitis group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that CHV-1 and CAV-2 are common etiologic agents of conjunctivitis in domestic dogs.

This suggested that the mobilization of adaptive immunity by administered MAbs is key for the success in the long term for the MAb-based passive immunotherapy of chronic viral infections. We have addressed here whether the anti-FrCas(E) protective endogenous immunity is the mere consequence of viral propagation blunting, which would simply give time to the immune system to react, and/or to actual immunomodulation by the MAb during the treatment. To this aim, we have compared viral replication, disease progression, and antiviral immune responses between different groups of infected mice: (i) mice treated with either the 667 MAb, its F(ab')(2) fragment, or an IgM (672) with epitopic specificity similar to that of 667 but displaying different effector functions, and (ii) mice receiving no treatment but infected with a low viral inoculum reproducing the initial viral expansion observed in their infected/667 MAb-treated counterparts. Our data show that the reduction of FrCas(E) propagation is insufficient on its own to induce protective immunity and support a direct immunomodulatory action of the 667 MAb. Interestingly, they also point to sequential actions of the administered MAb. In a first step, viral propagation is exclusively controlled by 667 neutralizing activity, and in a second one, this action is complemented by FcgammaR-binding-dependent mechanisms, which most likely combine infected cell cytolysis and the modulation of the antiviral endogenous immune response. Such complementary effects of administered MAbs must be taken into consideration for the improvement of future antiviral MAb-based immunotherapies.","Nasser, Roudaina; Pelegrin, Mireia; Michaud, Henri-Alexandre; Plays, Marc; Piechaczyk, Marc; Gros, Laurent",Journal of virology,208,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Silicone discs were exposed to bacterial urine suspension for 168 hours. The antimicrobial activities were assessed in the medium, and the inhibition zone diameters were measured. The weight of the silicones was measured for biofilm growth assessment before and after the experiment, and confocal microscopy images were taken. RESULTS Although the inhibition zone diameters of silver nitrate silicones were larger than those of pure silicone (PS), MR, and NF silicones, biofilm formation could not be prevented (P < .05). MR and NF silicones were superior to PS in terms of antimicrobial efficacy and prevention of biofilm formation (P < .05). In terms of biofilm prevention, no differences were detected between NF and MR silicones apart from a slightly superior ability of MR silicones to inhibit Escherichia coli (P > .05). Biofilm formation occurred on all silicone discs. CONCLUSION In short-term urinary catheter utilization, antimicrobial efficacy and biofilm formation prevention were superior in coated silicones, regardless of the type of antibiotic used, compared with the control group (PS). As the study was conducted in an in vitro setting, the findings should be substantiated with in vivo studies on the grounds that different results may be obtained in these settings.","Salvarci, Ahmet; Koroglu, Mehmet; Erayman, Berna",Urology,208,1

Nursing staff are known to be at risk of developing back disorders, where low back pain has a prevalence from 16% to 60% in the world. This study aims to determine the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain among nurses who working in a Roman hospital. METHODS Cross sectional study was carried out in an Italian hospital and the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire-IRSST was administered to 256 registered nurses. Logistic regression analyses were performed to understand risk factors associated with pain. RESULTS Nurses reported different locations of pain related to musculoskeletal disorders. The prevalence of low back pain was 90.2% during life, 80% during the last year and 44.5% during the last week.

The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of listening to music tuned to 440 Hz and music tuned to 432 Hz on sleep in patients with spinal cord injuries. METHODS Double-blind cross-over pilot study in a single Italian Spinal Unit. 12 patients with spinal injuries were provided with mp3 players loaded with their favourite music tuned to 440 Hz or 432 Hz. They were invited to listen to music for 30 minutes each day, in the two periods of the study.

RESULTS The participants were eight males (mean age =58.12, SD ±13.62), and four females (mean age =56.25, SD ±14.17). Five were quadriplegics and seven were paraplegics. Listening times and wash-out periods were variable. The stress decreased, but not significantly, with listening to music at both frequencies. After listening to music at 432 Hz there was a significant improvement in sleep scores (+3.6, p=0.02), while there was no improvement in sleep scores listening to music at 440 Hz (-1.50, p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that further studies on music interventions at 432 Hz should be performed.

All practicing urologists in Indonesia were sent an e-questionnaire link via E-mail, WhatsApp Messenger application, and/or short message service, and the chief of residents in each urology centre distributed the e-questionnaire to urology residents. RESULTS The response rate was 369/485 (76%) among urologists and 220/220 (100%) among urology residents. Less than 10 percent of the responses in each section were incomplete. There are 35/369 (9.5%) of urologists and 59/220 (26.8%) of urology residents had been suspected as COVID-19 patients, of whom seven of them were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. The majority of urologists (66%) preferred to continue face-to-face consultations with a limited number of patients, and more than 60% of urologists preferred to postpone the majority (66%) or all elective surgery. Most urologists also chose to postpone elective surgery in patient with COVID-19-related symptoms and patient who required post-operative ICU-care. Urologist and urology residents reported high rates of using personal protective equipment, except for medical gowns and N95 masks, which were in short supply.

This review introduces GWAS of PD, followed by a discussion about the limitations of GWAS and the major challenges facing geneticists in the post-GWAS era. Alternative strategies to address these challenges are then proposed, such as epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and rare variant association studies (RVAS) using next-generation sequencing. To date, however, few reports have described these analyses, and the evidence remains insufficient to confidently identify or exclude rare variants or epigenetic changes in PD.

METHODS We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Chinese databases Sinomed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify studies reporting pharmacist interventions and pharmacy services for PD patients using a predefined search strategy. The search period was from inception to March 2019. We also manually searched the reference list of included studies and ClinicalTrials.gov. We conducted meta-analyses to synthesize the evidence quantitatively. RESULTS A total of 1607 studies were identified by applying the search criteria. After screening, 19 cross-sectional and case-controlled studies with 1458 PD patients from 9 countries were included. Pharmacist interventions for PD patients most commonly related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (13 studies), adherence assessment (12 studies), medication review (12 studies), identification of drug interactions (11 studies), monitoring response to medication therapy (11 studies), identification of inappropriate medication (11 studies), and patient education (10 studies). Most pharmacy services were provided in outpatient settings (13 studies). Reported impact measures included adherence (8 studies), quality of life (7 studies), and identification of drug-related problems (6 studies) such as ADRs (393 times out of 1760 times, 22.33%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug choice (349 times, 19.83%, 6 studies), inappropriate dosage (335 times, 19.03%, 6 studies), inappropriate drug use (257 times, 14.60%, 3 studies) and drug-drug interactions (146 times, 8.3%, 4 studies). Pooled results from 3 studies indicated no statistically significant impact of pharmacy services on all subscales of PD Questionnaire-39. CONCLUSION ADRs were the most widely reported drug-related problems for PD patients; pharmacy services may have a role to play in medication adherence but were not found to impact on quality of life.","Yi, Zhan-Miao; Li, Ting-Ting; Tang, Qi-Yu; Zhang, Yuan; Willis, Sarah; Zhai, Suo-Di",Medicine,208,8

However, it is currently unknown which, if any, breast cancers are capable of progressing during a few to several months of observation. The difference between clinical size at diagnosis and final pathology size was assessed in 315 stage I-III primary invasive breast cancer patients who were divided into three groups based on the time between diagnosis and definitive surgery. Size differences over time were used to estimate specific growth rates. Compared with the group with ≤60 days between diagnosis and surgery, tumor growth was observed for 12% of tumors in the 61- to 120-day group and 17% of tumors in the >120-day group (p for trend = 0.032). Significantly greater specific growth rates were observed for tumors >2 cm by pathology measurement and for pathology node-positive patients (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.006, respectively). Specific growth rates were significantly greater for luminal B breast cancers than for luminal A breast cancers (p = 0.029) but not for triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. There was no evidence of nodal progression with surgery delay. Fewer than 20% of stage I-III breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy evidence size progression during follow-up periods ranging from 61 to 294 days. Clinical-pathological features cannot reliably predict which tumors will grow. Luminal B phenotype was the only clinical variable known at the time of diagnosis that strongly predicted growth.

However, a confirmation of the food safety aspects of sake based on scientific evidence is important for establishing consumer confidence, in part because consumer concerns regarding food safety have increased. The presence of Bacillus cereus spores in refined rice wine has been reported, and in light of consumers' growing concern over food safety, the establishment of food and beverage safety is important for consumers' reassurance. Herein, to confirm the microbiological safety of sake, we investigated the content and growth of B. cereus. We conducted a spore addition test to determine whether B. cereus spores grow during sake production, and we observed no growth or germination of B. cereus spores during the manufacturing process. We also observed that processes such as solid-liquid separation and filtration help remove the risk posed by B. cereus. We then conducted a survey to assess the density of B. cereus in various commercial sake products. We analyzed 162 samples of commercial sake and observed that 11 of the products had ≥1 CFU of living cells in 1 mL of sake (detection rate: 6.8%). There was no product in which ≥100 CFU/mL-sake of living cells was detected. Our findings confirmed that the density of these bacteria in sake is lower than that in other foods, and the probability of infection is very low. The emetic toxin produced by B. cereus was not detected in any of the sake samples. This is the first study based on experimental data demonstrating that B. cereus is not able to grow in sake or during the sake manufacturing process. We thus conclude that the safety risk of B. cereus in sake is negligible. Our findings indicate that Bacillus cereus is not a significant hazard in the sake brewing process, and they will contribute to the food hygiene management based on scientific evidence in sake breweries.","Takahashi, Masayuki; Kita, Yasuko; Minakami, Rui; Mukai, Nobuhiko",Journal of food protection,208,16

Primary care providers can help decrease the risk of opioid overdose deaths by adhering to opioid prescribing guidelines for chronic pain management. LOCAL PROBLEM Ten Washington State primary care clinics had gaps in guideline adherence and mandated electronic medical record (EMR) documentation for prescribing opioids. METHODS A quality improvement project using an educational intervention was implemented. INTERVENTIONS Primary care providers and support staff (defined as registered nurses and medical assistants) from the 10 primary care clinics viewed the project's instructional YouTube webinar that explained the project's primary care clinic workflow protocol, opioid prescribing best practice guidelines, and the organization's mandated EMR charting for chronic pain management. Preintervention and postintervention measures, which included five different documented patient completion rates of the organization's best practices for opioid prescribing, were used to assess for improvement to guideline adherence. Additionally, participants completed a questionnaire regarding their perceptions of the webinar as an educational tool. RESULTS Postintervention data showed significantly (p ≤ .05) increased completion rates for three of five outcome measures, indicating improvement in guideline adherence. The majority of participants reported that the webinar information would help them better adhere to best practice guidelines. CONCLUSIONS A workflow protocol on opioid prescribing taught via a YouTube webinar was an effective method for disseminating and implementing best practices in the primary care setting. Similar workflow protocols, taught via webinar, could be equally beneficial in other primary care clinics.","Weller, Lori M",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,208,1

Although stringent anthropogenic NOx emission controls have been implemented since the early 2000s in the United States, several rural regions of California still suffer from O3 pollution. Previous findings suggest that soils are a dominant source of NOx emissions in California; however, a statewide assessment of the impacts of soil NOx emission (SNOx) on air quality is still lacking. Here we quantified the contribution of SNOx to the NOx budget and the effects of SNOx on surface O3 in California during summer by using WRF-Chem with an updated SNOx scheme, the Berkeley Dalhousie Iowa Soil NO Parameterization (BDISNP). The model with BDISNP shows a better agreement with TROPOMI NO2 columns, giving confidence in the SNOx estimates. We estimate that 40.1% of the state's total NOx emissions in July 2018 are from soils, and SNOx could exceed anthropogenic sources over croplands, which accounts for 50.7% of NOx emissions. Such considerable amounts of SNOx enhance the monthly mean NO2 columns by 34.7% (53.3%) and surface NO2 concentrations by 176.5% (114.0%), leading to an additional 23.0% (23.2%) of surface O3 concentration in California (cropland).

This research intended to delve into miR-183-5p changes in mepivacaine-mediated SH-SY5Y cell injury, as well as its modulatory mechanism on cell apoptosis. RT-qPCR was adopted for assaying miR-183-5p and PDCD4 mRNA expression. Our team respectively transfected miR-183-5p mimic and inhibitor to enhance or inhibit miR-183-5p function. We employed Western blot for detecting PDCD4 protein levels, as well as flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342/PI double staining for determining cell apoptosis rate. Additionally, our crew applied an ELISA kit for measuring TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 contents. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was examined by the Image-iT LIVE Green ROS detection Kit. As well as dual-luciferase reporter experiment for verifying the targeting link of miR-183-5p with PDCD4. In mepivacaine-induced cell apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, miR-183-5p expression was down-regulated. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 contents were elevated. The rate of apoptosis increased visibly, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax levels waxed, whereas Bcl-2 level waned. MiR-183-5p could alleviate the damaging impact of mepivacaine. Dual-luciferase reporter experiments demonstrated that miR-183-5p directly targeted PDCD4. Collectively, we concluded that a high concentration of mepivacaine can cause SH-SY5Y cell damage, miR-183-5p functions crucially in mepivacaine-mediated cell damage. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of mepivacaine-induced nerve cell damage, and overexpressed miR-183-5p likely become a novel strategy to combat mepivacaine-induced nerve damage.Abbreviations:miRNA: Micro RNA; PDCD4: Programmed Cell Death 4; MDA: Malondialdehyde; SOD: Superoxide Dismutase; ROS: Reactive Oxygen Species; WT: Wild Type; Mut: Mutant; UTR: Untranslated Region; IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-1β: Interleukin-1β; TNF-α: Tumor Necrosis Factor-α; IL-8: Interleukin-8; COX-2: Cyclooxygenase-2; iNOS: inducible NOS; MEP: Mepivacaine.","Zhou, Qian; Zhang, Ling",Bioengineered,208,20

METHODS This retrospective study included 84 patients diagnosed with posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy involving inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) and lingual nerve (LN). Data on clinical characteristics, subjective symptoms including hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, and allodynia, and objective signs using thermal QST were collected and explored. RESULTS Three heat (heat hypoalgesia, heat hyperalgesia, and within normal range) and cold pain phenotypes (cold hypoalgesia, cold hyperalgesia, and within normal ranges) were identified, respectively. Thermal hypoalgesia was more frequently observed than thermal hyperalgesia. Heat hypoalgesia regardless of cold pain abnormalities appears to be associated with subjective negative symptoms, while thermal hyperalgesia seems to have little relationship with negative and positive symptoms. Thermal pain phenotypes were associated with loss of innocuous thermal sensation. Unlike heat pain phenotypes, cold pain phenotypes differed between IAN injury and LN injury. CONCLUSION The thermal pain phenotypes identified in this study seem to be related to clinical and psychophysical findings differently. These results would be a good starting point for assessing posttraumatic trigeminal neuropathy and interpreting the thermal QST results.","Kim, Hye-Kyoung; Kim, Mee-Eun",Oral diseases,208,19

However, DBS operates continuously, resulting in adverse effects such as postural instability or dysarthria. Continuous DBS (cDBS) also presents important practical issues including limited battery life of the implantable neurostimulator (INS). Collectively, these shortcomings impact optimal therapeutic benefit in ET. OBJECTIVE The goal of the study was to establish a physiology-driven responsive DBS (rDBS) system to provide targeted and personalized therapy based on electromyography (EMG) signals. METHODS Ten participants with ET underwent rDBS using Nexus-D, a Medtronic telemetry wand that acts as a direct conduit to the INS by modulating stimulation voltage. Two different rDBS paradigms were tested: one driven by one EMG (single-sensor) and another driven by two or more EMGs (multi-sensor). The feature(s) used in the rDBS algorithms was the power in the participant's tremor frequency band derived from the sensors controlling stimulation. Both algorithms were trained on kinetic and postural data collected during DBS off and cDBS states. RESULTS Using established clinical scales and objective measurements of tremor severity, we confirm that both rDBS paradigms deliver equivalent clinical benefit as cDBS. Moreover, both EMG-driven rDBS paradigms delivered less total electrical energy translating to an increase in the battery life of the INS. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study verify that EMG-driven rDBS provides clinically equivalent tremor suppression compared to cDBS, while delivering less total electrical energy. Controlling stimulation using a dynamic rDBS paradigm can mitigate limitations of traditional cDBS systems.","Cernera, Stephanie; Alcantara, Jose D; Opri, Enrico; Cagle, Jackson N; Eisinger, Robert S; Boogaart, Zachary; Pramanik, Leena; Kelberman, Madison; Patel, Bhavana; Foote, Kelly D; Okun, Michael S; Gunduz, Aysegul",Brain stimulation,208,1

Anesthesia techniques that minimize anesthetic requirements and their effects may be beneficial. Esmolol, a short acting hyperselective β-adrenergic blocker is effective in blunting adrenergic response to several perioperative stimuli and so it might interfere in the effect of the anesthetic drugs on the brain. This study was designed to investigate the effect of esmolol on the consumption of propofol and sevoflurane in patients undergoing craniotomy. METHOD Forty-two patients that underwent craniotomy for aneurysm clipping or tumour dissection were randomly divided in two groups (four subgroups). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, fentanyl and a single dose of cis-atracurium, followed by continuous infusion of remifentanil and either propofol or sevoflurane. Patients in the esmolol group received 500 mcg/kg of esmolol bolus 10 min before induction of anesthesia, followed by additional 200 mcg/kg/min of esmolol. Monitoring of the depth of anesthesia was also performed using the Bispectral Index-BIS and cardiac output. The inspired concentration of sevoflurane and the infusion rate of propofol were adjusted in order to maintain a BIS value between 40-50. Intraoperative emergence was detected by the elevation of BIS value, HR or MAP. RESULTS The initial and the intraoperative doses of propofol and sevoflurane were 18-50 mcg/kg/min and 0.2-0.5 MAC respectively in the esmolol group, whereas in the control group they where 100-150 mcg/kg/ and 0.9-2.0 MAC respectively (p = 0.000 for both groups). All procedures were anesthesiologically uneventful with no episodes of intraoperative emerge. CONCLUSIONS Esmolol is effective not only in attenuating intraoperative hemodynamic changes related to sympathetic overdrive but also in minimizing significant propofol and sevoflurane requirements without compromising the hemodynamic status.

I also discuss that so-called primitive nervous system of Hydra is in more complex than generally believed. I also discuss how cnidaria use peptides for communication among cells rather than in higher animals.","Takahashi, Toshio",Frontiers in endocrinology,208,21

However, the existence, unique phenotype and function of so-called tissue Tregs in the heart remain unclear. Methods: In mouse models of myocardial infarction (MI), myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R injury) or cardiac cryoinjury, the dynamic accumulation of Tregs in the injured myocardium was monitored. The bulk RNA-sequencing was performed to analyze the transcriptomic characteristics of Tregs from the injured myocardium after MI or I/R injury. Photoconversion, parabiosis, single-cell TCR sequencing and adoptive transfer were applied to determine the source of heart Tregs. The involvement of the interleukin (IL)-33/ST2 axis and secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein (Sparc), a molecule upregulated in heart Tregs, was further evaluated in functional assays. Results: We showed that Tregs were highly enriched in the myocardium of MI, I/R injury and cryoinjury mice. Transcriptomic data revealed that Tregs isolated from the injured hearts had plenty of differentially expressed transcripts compared to their lymphoid counterparts including heart draining lymphoid nodes, with a phenotype of promoting infarct repair, indicating a unique characteristic. The heart Tregs were accumulated mainly due to recruitment from circulating Treg pool, while local proliferation also contributed to their expansion. Moreover, a remarkable case of repeatedly detected TCR of heart Tregs, more than that of spleen Tregs, suggests a model of clonal expansion. Besides, HelioshighNrp-1high phenotype proved the mainly thymic origin of heart Tregs, with a small contribution of phenotypic conversion of conventional CD4+ T cells (Tconvs), proved by the analysis of TCR repertoires and Tconvs adoptive transfer experiments. Notably, the IL-33/ST2 axis was essential for sustaining heart Treg populations. Finally, we demonstrated that Sparc, which was highly expressed by heart Tregs, acted as a critical factor to protect the heart against MI by increasing collagen content and boosting maturation in the infarct zone. Conclusions: We identified and characterized a phenotypically and functionally unique population of heart Tregs, which may lay the foundation to harness Tregs for cardioprotection in MI and other cardiac diseases.","Xia, Ni; Lu, Yuzhi; Gu, Muyang; Li, Nana; Liu, Meilin; Jiao, Jiao; Zhu, Zhengfeng; Li, Jingyong; Li, Dan; Tang, Tingting; Lv, Bingjie; Nie, Shaofang; Zhang, Min; Liao, Mengyang; Liao, Yuhua; Yang, Xiangping; Cheng, Xiang",Circulation,208,24

Each well-recorded case in homeopathic practice is important for deciding the future course of action. This study aims at identifying clinically useful homeopathic remedies and their prescribing symptoms using the prognostic factor research model. METHODS This was an open-label, multi-centric, observational study performed from April 2020 to July 2020 at various public health care clinics. The data were collected prospectively from clinical practice at integrated COVID-19 care facilities in India. Good-quality cases were selected using a specific set of criteria. These cases were analyzed for elucidating prognostic factors by calculating the likelihood ratio (LR) of each frequently occurring symptom. The symptoms with high LR values (>1) were considered as prescribing indications of the specific remedy. RESULTS Out of 327 COVID-19 cases reported, 211 met the selection criteria for analysis. The most common complaints were fatigue, sore throat, dry cough, myalgia, fever, dry mouth and throat, increased thirst, headache, decreased appetite, anxiety, and altered taste. Twenty-seven remedies were prescribed and four of them-Arsenicum album, Bryonia alba, Gelsemium sempervirens, and Pulsatilla nigricans-were the most frequently used. A high LR was obtained for certain symptoms, which enabled differentiation between the remedies for a given patient. CONCLUSION Homeopathic medicines were associated with improvement in symptoms of COVID-19 cases. Characteristic symptoms of four frequently indicated remedies have been identified using prognostic factor research, findings that can contribute to accurate homeopathic prescribing during future controlled research in COVID-19.","Manchanda, Raj Kumar; Miglani, Anjali; Gupta, Meeta; Meena, Baljeet Singh; Chadha, Vishal; Joseph, Franco; Kalsi, Amrit; Konthembath, Pramod; Sharma, Kavita; Rama, Kamsali Nadigadda; Kaur, Prabhjeet; Thavarayil Kannoth, Jithesh; Nagrath, Cheshta; Jethani, Anju; Nellikka Aniyeri, Shajimol; Chawla, Anu; Ray, Malaya Kumar; Ghuliani, Manjula; Kudiyarasu, Ram Kumar; Naskar, Shruti; Bala, Sudha; Sharma, Brender",Homeopathy : the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy,208,1

Such complaints, including hoarseness and sore throat, have been reported in up to 90% of patients within 24 h of extubation. The purpose of this study was to determine which preoperatively documented clinical and anatomic parameters are predictive of laryngo-pharyngeal trauma resulting from elective endotracheal intubation. Fifty-three patients undergoing ENT procedures requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were recruited. Pre and postoperative laryngostroboscopic examination was performed and findings correlated to preoperative clinical and anatomic parameters. Readily assessed anatomic parameters including height (>180 cm) and weight (>80 kg) correlated significantly to the Eckerbom grade of intubation-associated acute laryngeal injury (rs = 0.374; p = 0.006 and rs = 0.278; p = 0.044, respectively). The mandibular protrusion test also correlated significantly to the Eckerbom grade (rs = 0.462, p = 0.001) while the upper-lip-bite test showed significant correlation to impaired vocal fold oscillation (rs = 0.288, p = 0.036), with injury prediction sensitivities of 37.5 and 39.4%, respectively. No parameters correlated to subjective complaints (n = 5, 9.2%).

However, some patients experience a recalcitrant disease despite treatment. Retinoids are considered the mainstay of therapy in many dermatologic diseases. Data on their use for viral warts are limited. OBJECTIVE To systematically review the published evidence on the efficacy and safety of retinoids for the treatment of cutaneous viral warts. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of topical or systemic retinoid treatment for cutaneous viral warts was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. The primary outcome was clinical response; secondary outcomes were recurrence rate and adverse events. RESULTS Fourteen publications including 399 patients treated exclusively with retinoids (65% topical, 35% systemic) were evaluated. The complete response rate was 64% (95% CI, 46-78%; I2 =80%) for topical treatment and 61% (95% CI, 44-76%; I2 =69%) for systemic treatment. The most common side effects were irritant contact dermatitis and cheilitis, respectively. Relapse rates were 6% and 17%, respectively. LIMITATIONS The reviewed studies were considerably heterogenous and most lacked a control group. CONCLUSION Both topical and systemic retinoids are effective and safe as monotherapy for cutaneous viral warts. Further studies are required to determine their exact role in this setting.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Whole-body radiography revealed a mineralized egg of normal size and shape. However, no oviposition occurred, and the bird had no signs consistent with dystocia. After 7 days, repeated radiography revealed that the egg had rotated by approximately 180° along its short axis, leading to a diagnosis of ectopic egg retention, which was supported by the results of ultrasonography. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Surgical removal of the ectopic egg was performed by means of a ventral midline approach 14 days after administration of leuprolide acetate (800 μg/kg [364 μg/lb], IM). No intracoelomic abnormalities, such as coelomitis or oviductal disease, were diagnosed, and the bird recovered without complications. Physical examination and whole-body radiography at 8 months and a follow-up phone call with the owner at 16 months after surgical treatment revealed no evidence of ectopic egg recurrence or reproductive behavior. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Clinical management of ectopic egg retention differs considerably from treatment of intraoviductal egg binding. Therefore, careful evaluation of avian patients with radiographic evidence of egg binding should be performed to avoid possible iatrogenic deterioration of the patient's condition, secondary to inappropriate treatment attempts such as hormonal induction of oviposition or attempts to remove the retained egg via the cloaca. Repeated radiography and ultrasonography and close monitoring of the patient's general condition as well as the lack of clinical signs consistent with dystocia will facilitate the diagnosis of ectopic egg retention.","Mans, Christoph; Sladky, Kurt K",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,208,1

Faced with a new pathogen, such as SARS-CoV-2, it is crucial to be able to forecast the case fatality rate (CFR) and the overall disease burden. Considerable effort has been invested towards developing a mathematical framework for predicting virulence evolution. Although many approaches accurately recapitulate complex outcomes, most rely on an assumed trade-off between CFR and infection rate. It is often impractical to empirically validate this constraint for human pathogens. Methods: A compartment model with parameters tuning the degree to which symptomatic individuals are isolated and the duration of immunity is constructed and evaluated at both short timescales and at equilibrium. Results: We reveal kinetic constraints whereby variation of multiple parameters in concert leads to decreased CFR and increased pathogen fitness, whereas independent variation of the parameters decreases pathogen fitness. Smallpox, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza are analyzed as diverse representatives of human respiratory viruses. We show that highly virulent viruses, such as smallpox, are often constrained by the host behavior, whereas moderately virulent viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, appear to be typically constrained by the relationship between the duration of immunity and CFR. Conclusions: Evolution of human respiratory epidemics appears to be often kinetically constrained and a reduction in CFR should not be assumed. These results agree with previous work demonstrating an increase in virulence for smallpox and further predict that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to continue presenting a substantial disease burden. Herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and viruses with similar life history traits might be unachievable without vaccination. However, partial isolation of symptomatic individuals can have a major effect on the epidemic dynamics not only by reducing the number of fatalities in the short term but also by changing the evolutionary trajectory of moderate CFR viruses towards reduced CFR.","Rochman, Nash; Wolf, Yuri; V Koonin, Eugene",F1000Research,208,1

As a response, the United States shut down public gatherings and businesses in an effort to quarantine. This included the stopping of elective operations, which greatly affected plastic surgeons and their practices during the initial shutdown. OBJECTIVES We aim to study the early impact of COVID-19 on the financial implications and practice patterns of plastic surgeons in the state of California during the initial shutdown of elective surgery and provide guidelines for effective management during future crises. METHODS A 20-question survey was sent using Qualtrics XM software to 851 surgeon members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey was open from May 13, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Standard statistical analysis was completed to compare private practice and nonprivate practice plastic surgeons. RESULTS We had a total of 140 respondents to our survey for a 16.5% response rate. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents were in a private practice setting. Private practice plastic surgeons reported a higher financial impact with a 79% reduction in financial income compared with nonprivate practice plastic surgeons at a 37% reduction (P < 0.0001). Additionally, private practice plastic surgeons demonstrated a higher reduction in case volume and were more likely to lay off or furlough staff, close their practice, and apply for loans (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Our survey study showed that private practice plastic surgeons in the state of California faced the most financial hardship during the early shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a valuable snapshot in our economic history and depicts the heavy financial impact of the stopping of elective surgery. Since the reopening of practices, new guidelines have been implemented to maintain safe elective surgery while the pandemic continues. Further follow-up studies on both the state and national level need to be completed to see the continued financial effects on private and nonprivate plastic surgery practices since the reopening and resumption of elective surgery.","Crowley, Jiwon Sarah; Reghunathan, Meera; Kadakia, Nikita; Barttelbort, Scott; Gosman, Amanda",Annals of plastic surgery,208,29

Treatment of ophthalmic segment aneurysms with flow diverter devices also includes coverage of the ophthalmic artery but may result in complications. It is unclear, however, whether these devices mechanically block blood flow in the ophthalmic artery. Also unclear is the relationship between deployment of a flow diverter device and post-treatment occlusion. We studied hemodynamic changes in the ophthalmic artery after deployment of a flow diverter device to determine the relationship between those changes and post-stent occlusion of the artery. METHODS We analyzed hemodynamic modifications in the ophthalmic artery in 21 patients (19 women, 2 men; mean age 53.43 ± 7.32 years) treated by a single pipeline embolization device. Patient-specific geometries were determined from three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography and the stenting process was simulated. Computational fluid dynamics technology was used to analyze the change in ophthalmic artery hemodynamics. We compared pre-treatment and post-treatment flow velocity of the ophthalmic artery. RESULTS Among the 21 patients with aneurysms located in the ophthalmic segment, no ophthalmic artery occlusion was found during immediate or follow-up angiography. Post-stent flow velocity in the ophthalmic artery decreased from 0.35 ± 0.19 to 0.33 ± 0.20 m/s, with the difference not being statistically significant (P = 0.106). CONCLUSION Our results showed no significant change in ophthalmic artery blood flow after pipeline embolization device deployment. Hence, post-stent occlusion of the ophthalmic artery could not be explained by reduced blood flow. Delayed thrombosis and neointimal formation maybe the keys to ophthalmic artery occlusion and need further investigation.","Wu, Xinzhi; Tian, Zhongbin; Liu, Jian; Li, Wenqiang; Chen, Junfan; Zhou, Yangyang; Yang, Xinjian; Mu, Shiqing",Journal of translational medicine,208,1

Infectious diseases are one of numerous issues threatening free-ranging lion populations, and low-density populations are particularly at risk. We collected data on the prevalence and diversity of viral and parasitic pathogens in a small lion population in eastern Botswana. During 2012 and 2014, blood samples were collected from 59% (n=13) of the adult-subadult lions in the Northern Tuli Game Reserve in eastern Botswana. One lion had antibodies to feline panleukopenia virus, two had antibodies to canine distemper virus, and two had feline calicivirus antibodies. Ten of the 13 had antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus and 11 had feline herpesvirus antibodies. All lions were negative for antibodies to feline coronavirus. Blood samples from all lions were negative for Trypanosoma, Anaplasma, Theileria, and Ehrlichia spp. by molecular testing; however, all lions were positive for Babesia spp. by reverse line blot hybridization assay. Sequencing of amplicons from four lions revealed four groups of Babesia spp. including several genetic variants of Babesia felis , Babesia lengau, and Babesia canis and a group of novel Babesia sequences which were only 96% similar to other Babesia spp. Six lions were infested with four species of ticks (Rhipicentor nuttalli, Rhipicephalus simus, Rhipicephalus sulcatus, and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus). These data provide the first health assessment of this population and can be used to identify management and conservation strategies to decrease the impact of pathogens on this population.

Previous studies have suggested that different host ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genetic backgrounds might contribute to differences in the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 severity. Recent studies have also shown that variants in 15 genes related to type I interferon immunity to influenza virus might predispose patients toward life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia. Other genes (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1, CXCR6, XCR1, IL6, CTSL, ABO, and FURIN) and HLA alleles have also been implicated in the response to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Currently, Brazil has recorded the third-highest number of COVID-19 cases worldwide. We aimed to investigate the genetic variation present in COVID-19-related genes in the Brazilian population. We analyzed 27 candidate genes and HLA alleles in 954 admixed Brazilian exomes. We used the information available in two public databases (http://www.bipmed.org and http://abraom.ib.usp.br/) and additional exomes from individuals born in southeast Brazil, the region of the country with the highest number of COVID-19 patients. Variant allele frequencies were compared with the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (1KGP) and gnomAD databases. We detected 395 nonsynonymous variants; of these, 325 were also found in the 1KGP and/or gnomAD. Six of these variants were previously reported to influence the rate of infection or clinical prognosis of COVID-19. The remaining 70 variants were identified exclusively in the Brazilian sample, with a mean allele frequency of 0.0025. In silico analysis revealed that seven of these variants are predicted to affect protein function. Furthermore, we identified HLA alleles previously associated with the COVID-19 response at loci DQB1 and DRB1. Our results showed genetic variability common to other populations and rare and ultrarare variants exclusively found in the Brazilian population. These findings might lead to differences in the rate of infection or response to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and should be further investigated in patients with this disease.","Secolin, Rodrigo; de Araujo, Tânia K; Gonsales, Marina C; Rocha, Cristiane S; Naslavsky, Michel; Marco, Luiz De; Bicalho, Maria A C; Vazquez, Vinicius L; Zatz, Mayana; Silva, Wilson A; Lopes-Cendes, Iscia",Human genome variation,208,1

Methods: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we transitioned our movement disorders fellowship program virtually over the course of a few days. Here we describe the parameters used for the telemedicine fellow supervised clinic visit over the course of 2 months. Fellow's input was obtained from a brief survey at the end of the experience. Faculty's experience was collected upon independent faculty discussions. We also summarize the challenges and advantages of this teaching experience and its downsides. Results: A total of 130 patients (102 follow-up and 28 new patients) were seen over 22 clinic days with any of our 3 fellows being supervised by 1 of the 6 attending physicians. The main challenges were related to technical difficulties and lack of portions of the examination such as tone, reflexes, and sensory testing. The main advantages were related to increased patient access and a decrease in scheduling barriers. The overall satisfaction with the experience of the fellows was positive (69%). Conclusions: This sample shows the feasibility (despite lack of prior experience) of virtual clinical supervision of movement disorders fellows for follow-up and new complex patient encounters. This novel method for movement disorders training has implications for training locally, nationally, and internationally. Limitations and possible future directions such as the inclusion of nonsynchronous recordings and devices for tone and balance testing are also discussed.","Suarez-Cedeno, Gerson; Pantelyat, Alexander; Mils, Kelly; Murthy, Maitreiyi; Alshaikh, Jumana; Rosenthal, Liana; Bang, Jee; Moukheiber, Emile",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,208,1

METHODS Nasal brushing samples of 55 children (28 male) were evaluated for ciliary motion and ultrastructural assessment, as well as for detection and quantification of TTV. Moreover, presence and load of TTV within ciliated cells, obtained from 5 patients by laser capture microdissection, were determined. RESULTS The nasal samples of 47 (85%) children with persistent or recurrent pneumonia resulted positive for TTV (loads = 2.1-7.3 log10 copies/microg total DNA). TTV were demonstrated also within microdissected ciliated cells. No significant difference between primary (11 subjects) and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (44 subjects) for TTV prevalence and mean loads were found. A significant correlation was observed between nasal TTV loads and ciliary beat frequency score (r = 0.305; P < 0.05), but not between TTV loads and presence of abnormal motion patterns, in patients with secondary ciliary abnormalities. As expected no correlations were found between nasal TTV loads and ciliary motion analysis in primary ciliary dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS The presence of TTV in nasal samples demonstrates TTV ability to infect respiratory ciliated cells and suggests that these cells are potentially able to support virus replication. Moreover, TTV may behave in respiratory cells in a similar way to other viruses, that is, they disrupt the mucociliary escalator.","Pifferi, Massimo; Maggi, Fabrizio; Di Cristofano, Claudio; Cangiotti, Angela M; Nelli, Luca Ceccherini; Bevilacqua, Generoso; Macchia, Pierantonio; Bendinelli, Mauro; Boner, Attilio L",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,208,1

The vaccine employed a novel platform, polysaccharide capsular antigen, based on the discovery that anticapsular antibody conferred protective immunity in humans. As with most new paradigms in vaccinology, it derived from important basic research from other scientific disciplines over the preceding years. The success of the first monovalent polysaccharide vaccine in nearly eliminating invasive meningococcal disease in military settings led to accelerated advances in polysaccharide vaccine development against other serogroups of meningococcus and other encapsulated pathogens. As gaps in vaccine efficacy arose over the past half-century, new vaccine technologies and approaches were developed to address the challenges. Several of these, including conjugate vaccines and ""reverse vaccinology"" led to other novel, successful vaccines that have had a significant, favorable global impact on invasive meningococcal disease. The history of meningococcal vaccine discovery may provide insights into the future of vaccine efforts against other infectious threats.","Artenstein, Andrew W",Vaccine,208,26

Presence of certain skin manifestations may be indicative of disease activity. Here, we evaluated the current evidence for an association between clinical signs and reported disease activity in vitiligo. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed based on a search in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library. Literature reporting skin manifestations and disease activity was analysed based on descriptive analyses and, if applicable, odd ratios. Forty-six observational studies were selected and analysed, including 28 case reports. Reported clinical signs in relation to active vitiligo were as follows: Koebner's phenomenon, confetti-like depigmentations, tri- and hypochromic lesions (including poorly defined borders), inflammatory borders/areas, itch and leukotrichia. Based on this search, strong evidence was found for Koebner's phenomenon. Poorly defined borders and confetti lesions are potential markers, although more data are needed to confirm this. Evidence for other skin manifestations was inconclusive, whereas case reports on inflammatory borders were indicative of active disease. Limitations included the lack of randomized controlled trials, large-scale prospective studies and heterogeneity due to inconsistent definitions. This systematic review urges the vitiligo community to come forward with consensus-based definitions as well as a reliable scoring system to assess these clinical signs and to design optimal trials to investigate their true predictive value.","van Geel, N; Grine, L; De Wispelaere, P; Mertens, D; Prinsen, C A C; Speeckaert, R",Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,208,16

We chose to study such patients because we were already reporting these cancers to the Indian Council of Medical Research as part of project titled ""Pattern of care and survival studies."" Aims The aim of the study is to assess and compare QOL of H and N cancer patients before and after the completion of cancer-directed treatment (CDT). Settings and Design The present study was a hospital-based study conducted in the tertiary care hospital of Jammu with longitudinal study design. Subjects and Methods All newly diagnosed HNC patients registered with the Department of Radiotherapy and ENT on inpatient or outpatient basis were included over a period of 6 months. Each patient was followed for 4-6 weeks after the completion of CDT. QOL was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ C30) (general) and EORTC QLQ H and N-35 (specific) questionnaires. Statistical Analysis Paired t-test was calculated to compare pre- and postmean scores. Pre- and post-Cronbach alpha reliability coefficient was also calculated. Results The most frequent site was larynx followed by the oral cavity. Regarding both EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire and Global health status and EORTC H and N-35 specific questionnaires, the mean scores across all domains showed worsening of QoL from their baseline. The worsening was more severe in emotional function (functional scale), while physical, cognitive, and social functions were comparatively less affected. Pain, swallowing, speech, and mouth problems were most worsened. Conclusions QoL showed worsening after CDT in all domains due to acute and subacute adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in treatment course.","Bashir, Abroo; Kumar, Dinesh; Dewan, Deepika; Sharma, Rahul",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,208,1

However, because transfusion support needs of COVID-19 patients are not well known, its impact on hospital blood supply is uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transfusion demand. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Transfusion records during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1-April 30, 2020) were reviewed in our center to assess changes in blood requirements. RESULTS During this period 636 patients received a total of 2934 blood components, which reflects a 17.6% reduction in transfusion requirements with regard to the same period of 2019, and blood donations in Madrid dropped by 45%. The surgical blood demand decreased significantly during the outbreak (50.2%). Blood usage in the hematology and oncology departments remained unchanged, while the day ward demand halved, and intensive care unit transfusion needs increased by 116%. A total of 6.2% of all COVID inpatients required transfusion support. COVID-19 inpatients consumed 19% of all blood components, which counterbalanced the savings owed to the reduction in elective procedures. CONCLUSION Although only a minority of COVID-19 inpatients required transfusion, the expected reduction in transfusion needs caused by the lack of elective surgical procedures is partially offset by the large number of admitted patients during the peak of the pandemic. This fact must be taken into account when planning hospital blood supply.","Velázquez-Kennedy, Kyra; Luna, Alejandro; Sánchez-Tornero, Adrián; Jiménez-Chillón, Carlos; Jiménez-Martín, Ana; Vallés Carboneras, Ana; Tenorio, María; García García, Irene; López-Jiménez, Francisco Javier; Moreno-Jiménez, Gemma",Transfusion,208,12

Although heterozygous mutations in OPA1 represent the most common genetic cause of ADOA, a significant number of cases remain undiagnosed.Here, we describe a family with a strong ADOA history with most family members spanning three generation having childhood onset of visual symptoms. The proband, in addition to optic atrophy, had neurological symptoms consistent with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Clinical exome analysis detected a novel mutation in the AFG3L2 gene (NM_006796.2:c.1010G > A; p.G337E), which segregated with optic atrophy in family members. AFG3L2 is a metalloprotease of the AAA subfamily which exerts quality control in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Interestingly, the identified mutation localizes close to the AAA domain of AFG3L2, while those localized in the proteolytic domain cause dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 28 (SCA28) or recessive spastic ataxia with epilepsy (SPAX5). Functional studies in patient fibroblasts demonstrate that the p.G337E AFG3L2 mutation strongly destabilizes the long isoforms of OPA1 via OMA hyper-activation and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, thus explaining the family phenotype. This study widens the clinical spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by AFG3L2 mutations, which shall be considered as genetic cause of ADOA.","Baderna, Valentina; Schultz, Joshua; Kearns, Lisa S; Fahey, Michael; Thompson, Bryony A; Ruddle, Jonathan B; Huq, Aamira; Maltecca, Francesca",Acta neuropathologica communications,208,1

METHODS Data were obtained from medical records. Outcome measures were level of oxygen therapy, discharge and death. Patients were followed up until 21 April 2020. RESULTS 108 patients were included. 34 (31%) died in hospital or were discharged for palliative care. 43% of patients aged over 65 died. The commonest comorbidities were hypertension (49; 45%) and diabetes (25; 23%).

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is working to foster public engagement in science through Smoke Sense, which is a citizen science research project that aims to reduce the public health burden of wildland fire smoke. Smoke Sense is facilitated by a mobile app that shares information on air quality, smoke, and health, and collects individual reports of smoke exposure and concurrent health symptoms. However, Smoke Sense is also generating interest among organizations that are working in this problem domain at the local, state, national, and tribal levels. The interest in the citizen science project at the organizational level led us to ask: What would motivate members of organizations to engage in a citizen science project like Smoke Sense, and how do they envision that engagement could improve public health? To explore these questions, we collected data through interviews with individuals who were engaged in Smoke Sense through their work at local, state, and tribal environmental and health agencies in the western US. An inductive, thematic analysis suggests that individuals' motivations stem from their experiences and challenges with smoke in their different roles (e.g., personal, professional, and community member). Respondents envisioned leveraging both the app itself and the data generated by individuals in their region to enhance and support their existing outreach and communication efforts related to smoke.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular effects of endotherapy. METHODS mRNA expression of 16 genes significantly associated with different BE stages was measured in paired pre-treatment BE tissues and post-treatment neo-squamous biopsies from 36 patients treated by RFA (19 patients, 3 IMC, 4 HGD, 12 LGD) or EMR (17 patients, 4 IMC, 13 HGD). EMR was performed prior to RFA in eight patients. Normal squamous esophageal tissues were from 20 control individuals. RESULTS Endoscopic therapy resulted in significant change towards the normal squamous expression profile for all genes. The neo-squamous expression profile was significantly different to the normal control profile for 11 of 16 genes. CONCLUSION Endotherapy results in marked changes in mRNA expression, with replacement of the disordered BE dysplasia or IMC profile with a more ""normal"" profile. The neo-squamous mucosa was significantly different to the normal control squamous mucosa for most genes.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study is to confirm the effect of patellofemoral contact mechanics after craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity in normal canine hindlimbs. METHODS Craniolateral and caudolateral transposition of tibial tuberosity was performed in 5 specimens, respectively. The pressure was measured in the specimen before TTT, and then in the same specimen after TTT. In this process, data was obtained in 10 specimens. The measurement results were output as visualization data through the manufacturer's software and numerical data through spreadsheet. Based on these 2 data and the anatomical structure of the patellofemoral joint (PFJ) surface, whole measurement area was analysed by dividing into medial, lateral and central area. RESULTS In craniolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, medial, central contact pressure was decreased and lateral contact pressure was not statistically changed lateral contact pressure than normal PFJ. In caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity, total, lateral contact pressure was increased and medial contact pressure was not statistically changed than normal PFJ. Although not statistically significant changed, central contact pressure in caudolateralization of tibial tuberosity was increased in all 5 specimens.

We discuss the primary objectives, subjective success rate and pelvic floor ultrasound outcomes of uterus-preserving LLSM operations. Patients and Methods Seventeen patients who underwent uterus-preserving LLSM (abdominocervicopexy) in a tertiary center were included in this prospective study. Anatomical cure was defined separately for the apical and anterior compartments as a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) score of less than - 1 cm for each compartment. Subjective cure was defined as the absence of bulge symptoms. Patient satisfaction, sexual function, prolapse-related quality of life, voiding dysfunction, nocturia and constipation were assessed. Transperineal ultrasonography was used to measure anterior compartment mobility and hiatal anteroposterior diameter. Results The anatomical cure rate was 100% for the apical and 88.2% for the anterior compartment, with one symptomatic stage-II cystorectocele and one asymptomatic stage-II cystocele. The subjective cure and patient satisfaction scores were 94.12 and 100%, respectively. Ba and C points were significantly improved, and vaginal lengthening was 10.14 ± 4.19 mm. Bp ascent was 5.72 ± 11.27 mm (p = 0.053). Proximal urethral rotation and retrovesical angles were reduced by 6.24 ± 11.95° and 27 ± 47.2°, respectively (p1 = 0.047; p2 = 0.032).

In order to implement this in a resource-saving way, new innovative teaching concepts are needed that combine the advantages of face-to-face teaching in small groups for practical and case-based learning with digital teaching offers for resource-saving teaching of theoretical content. CONCLUSION We have created a uniform radiology curriculum for medical studies in Germany, coordinated it nationally and integrated it into the NKLM 2.0. The curriculum forms the basis of a uniform mandatory radiology teaching and should be the basis for the individual curriculum development of each faculty and strengthen the position of radiology in the interdisciplinary context. KEY POINTS · A radiology curriculum for undergraduate medical education was developed.. · The curriculum was brought into agreement among the faculties in Germany and integrated into the NKLM 2.0.. · This curriculum is intended to be the basis for curriculum development and to strengthen the position of radiology.. · In order to implement the competence-based teaching, new innovative teaching concepts are necessary..

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the ""Complementary Exposure"" pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong",Cell discovery,208,1

The relationship between 12-month weight loss and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes is explored. METHODS Overweight/obese subjects (N = 10 744), ≥55 years with cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus, received sibutramine plus weight management during a 6-week Lead-in Period before randomization to continue sibutramine (N = 4906) or to receive placebo (N = 4898). The primary endpoint was the time from randomization to first occurrence of a primary outcome event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death). RESULTS For the total population, mean weight change during Lead-in Period (sibutramine) was -2.54 kg. Post-randomization, mean total weight change to Month 12 was -4.18 kg (sibutramine) or -1.87 kg (placebo). Degree of weight loss during Lead-in Period or through Month 12 was associated with a progressive reduction in risk for the total population in primary outcome events and cardiovascular mortality over the 5-year assessment. Although more events occurred in the randomized sibutramine group, on an average, a modest weight loss of approximately 3 kg achieved in the Lead-in Period appeared to offset this increased event rate. Moderate weight loss (3-10 kg) reduced cardiovascular deaths in those with severe, moderate or mild cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONS Modest weight loss over short-term (6 weeks) and longer-term (6-12 months) periods is associated with reduction in subsequent cardiovascular mortality for the following 4-5 years even in those with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. While the sibutramine group experienced more primary outcome events than the placebo group, greater weight loss reduced overall risk of these occurring in both groups.","Caterson, I D; Finer, N; Coutinho, W; Van Gaal, L F; Maggioni, A P; Torp-Pedersen, C; Sharma, A M; Legler, U F; Shepherd, G M; Rode, R A; Perdok, R J; Renz, C L; James, W P T","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",208,5

However, no statistical models are readily available to test the association between personalities and social relations in the literature. In this study, we develop a statistical model for analyzing social network data with the latent personality traits as covariates. Because the model contains a measurement model for the latent traits and a structural model for the relationship between the network and latent traits, we discuss it under the general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In our model, the structural relation between the latent variable(s) and the outcome variable is no longer linear or generalized linear. To obtain model parameter estimates, we propose to use a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML) procedure. This modeling framework is evaluated through a simulation study under representative conditions that would be found in social network data. Its usefulness is then demonstrated through an empirical application to a college friendship network.","Liu, Haiyan; Jin, Ick Hoon; Zhang, Zhiyong",Multivariate behavioral research,208,1

STUDY DESIGN Case series. ANIMALS Equids with unilateral renal disease (n = 6), aged 2 months to 18 years, weighing 90-434 kg. METHODS A ventral median celiotomy was used to access the left or right kidney. To facilitate surgical exposure, the small intestine was reflected towards the diaphragm using laparotomy sponges and the ascending colon was exteriorized and in some cases evacuated. The peritoneum over the affected kidney was incised and blunt dissection used to free the kidney from the retroperitoneal fat, then the renal artery, vein, and ureter were isolated and ligated. Abdominal lavage with sterile saline solution was performed before abdominal closure. RESULTS Four horses, 1 donkey, and 1 mule had unilateral nephrectomy to treat verminous nephritis (1), idiopathic hematuria (1), and ectopic ureter (4). A ventral median approach provided adequate access to the kidney in all 6 cases. Two horses had postoperative complications (peritonitis, chylous abdominal effusion) that resolved with medical therapy. No complications attributable to nephrectomy were reported by the owners upon follow-up 1-8 years after surgery. CONCLUSIONS A ventral median approach for nephrectomy can be used for unilateral nephrectomy in equids weighing up to 434 kg.","Arnold, Carolyn E; Taylor, Tex; Chaffin, M Keith; Schott, Harold C; Caron, John P",Veterinary surgery : VS,208,31

OBJECTIVES to analyze the effectiveness of the measurement of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV2 (IgM and IgG) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and to analyze the rate of SARS-CoV2 seroprevalence in the population. METHODS 11 relevant studies, published before June 5, 2020, were included in this meta-analysis. These studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE and Scopus databases. The final selected studies were analyzed using STATA version 14. Publication bias was examined using both Egger's test and Funnel plots. Moreover, the I² statistic has been used to evaluate and verify heterogeneity. RESULTS The 11 relevant studies selected for the present meta-analysis cover a total of 996 infection cases. According to the results, the average rate of positive cases for IgM (AU/mL) was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.65-2.55; I2=92.2%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgM test was 63% (95% CI: 47-79; I2=94.9%). In addition, the average rate of positive cases for IgG (AU/mL) was 67.44 (95% CI: 28.79-106.09; I2=99.4%), and the sensitivity in individuals with positive IgG test was 79% (95% CI: 67-90; I2=89.5%). CONCLUSIONS According to this analysis, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies may assist early detection of SARS-CoV2 infection. Whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 confer protective immunity warrants further studies.","Fathi, Mobina; Vakili, Kimia; Sayehmiri, Fatemeh; Mohamadkhani, Ashraf; Ghanbari, Reza; Hajiesmaeili, Mohammadreza; Rezaei-Tavirani, Mostafa",Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,208,1

DESIGN A search of PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases, a Google search, and a consultation with experts in the field of IYCF performed in July 2016. SETTING Low- and middle-income countries, as defined by the World Bank Group. SUBJECTS Eligible studies: included a mass media component (with or without nutrition education); conducted a pre-post evaluation (with or without a control group); assessed IYCF knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and/or practices; and were published in English between 2000 and present. RESULTS Eighteen unique studies were identified that examined the effect of mass media (types included: television; print; voice and/or SMS (text) messages; radio; megaphones/loudspeakers; videos; social media; songs/dramas) and nutrition education interventions on IYCF practices within thirteen countries. Of these, fifteen studies reported improvements in breast- and/or complementary feeding practices, using indicators recommended by the WHO, and six studies reported improvements in related psychosocial factors. However, little detail was provided on the use of formative research, a formal behaviour change theory and behaviour change techniques. Few studies reported both dose delivered and participants' exposure to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Despite evidence of effectiveness, few common elements in the design of interventions were identified. Future research should consistently report these details to open the 'black box' of IYCF interventions, identify effective design components and ensure replicability.","Graziose, Matthew M; Downs, Shauna M; O'Brien, Quentin; Fanzo, Jessica",Public health nutrition,208,1

The standard theory of its anthelmintic and insecticidal mode of action is that it is a selective positive allosteric modulator of glutamate-gated chloride channels found in nematodes and insects. At higher concentrations, ivermectin also acts as an allosteric modulator of ion channels found in host central nervous systems. In addition, in tissue culture, at concentrations higher than anthelmintic concentrations, ivermectin shows antiviral, antimalarial, antimetabolic, and anticancer effects. Caution is required before extrapolating from these preliminary repositioning experiments to clinical use, particularly for Covid-19 treatment, because of the high concentrations of ivermectin used in tissue-culture experiments.","Martin, Richard J; Robertson, Alan P; Choudhary, Shivani",Trends in parasitology,208,31

These various types of cells have several important functions; thus, communication between these cells plays an important role in homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases in the lungs. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung diseases, researchers have isolated each type of lung cell to investigate the changes in their gene expressions, including their humoral factor or adhesion molecules, to reveal the intercellular communication among these cells. In particular, investigations during the past decade have focused on extracellular vesicles, which are lipid bilayer delimited vesicles released from a cell that can move among various cells and transfer substances, including microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, thus, functioning as intercellular messengers. Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three general groups: apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microparticles. Extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes and microparticles, are attracting increasing attention from pulmonologists as tools for understanding pathogenesis and disease diagnosis. Here, we review studies, including our own, on exosomes and microparticles and their roles in both lung homeostasis and the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Unfortunately, a notable proportion of scans are not readily classified as positive or negative but deemed indeterminate. The extent of reporting of indeterminate bone scans and how such scans are handled in clinical trials are not known. A systematic review was conducted using electronic databases up to October 2016. The main outcome of interest was the reporting of indeterminate bone scans, analyses of how such scans were managed, and exploratory analyses of the association of study characteristics and the reporting of indeterminate bone scan results. Seventy-four eligible clinical trials were identified. The trials were mostly retrospective (85%), observational (95%), large trials (median 195 patients) from five continents published over four decades. The majority of studies had university affiliation (72%), and an author with imaging background (685). Forty-five studies (61%) reported an indeterminate option for the bone scan and 23 studies reported the proportion of indeterminate scans (median 11.4%). Most trials (44/45, 98%) reported how to handle indeterminate scans. Most trials (n = 39) used add-on supplementary imaging, follow-up bone scans, or both. Exploratory analyses showed a significant association of reporting of indeterminate results and number of patients in the study (p = 0.024) but failed to reach statistical significance with other variables tested.

Multimodal neuroimaging methods ideally provide the exact localization, extent, and metabolic activity of target tissues. Post-stroke cognitive impairment has recently been realized to be another major concern except for neurological function impairment. The aim of our study was to carry out a prospective study to compare neurological and cognitive functions after thrombectomy in mild to moderate anterior circulation infarction patients selected by multimodal neuroimaging. METHODS Ninety patients were recruited from January 2016 to March 2017 consecutively. Neurological function was assessed by NIHSS before thrombectomy, and 6 h, 24 h, 7 days, 90 days after mechanical thrombectomy. Cognitive functions were evaluated by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Hachinski Ischemic Scale. RESULTS Patients who received mechanical thrombectomy had significantly better neurological functions at 6 h (p < 0.001), 24 h (p < 0.001), 7 days (p < 0.001), and 90 days (p < 0.001), as well as cognitive functions evaluated by MoCA (26.23 ± 3.85 vs. 24.62 ± 2.25, p = 0.022, n = 85) and MMSE (26.65 ± 2.77 vs. 25.10 ± 2.36, p = 0.023, n = 85) compared to the standard therapy group.

METHODS In this study, we utilized in vivo luminescent imaging of NF-κB activity and serum cytokine measures to investigate relationships between the NF-κB regulatory network and the presentation of painful symptoms in a model of neuropathy. RESULTS The chronic constriction injury model led to temporal increases in NF-κB activity that were strongly and non-linearly correlated with the presentation of pain sensitivities (i.e. mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia). The delivery of NEMO-binding domain peptide reduced pain sensitivities through the inhibition of NF-κB activity in a manner consistent with the demonstrated non-linear relationship. Importantly, the combination of non-invasive measures of NF-κB activity and NF-κB-regulated serum cytokines produced a highly predictive model of both mechanical (R(2) = 0.86) and thermal (R(2) = 0.76) pain centred on the NF-κB regulatory network (NF-κB, IL-6, CXCL1).

PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate opacification of the pulmonary vasculature (PV) during CT pulmonary angiography using a patient-specific contrast formula (PSCF) and exponentially decelerated contrast media (EDCM) injection rate. MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed on 200 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism using a 64-channel CT scanner. Patient demographics were equally distributed. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 equal protocol groups: protocol A used a PSCF, and protocol B involved the use of a PSCF combined with EDCM. The mean cross-sectional opacification profile of 8 central and 11 peripheral PVs were measured for each patient, and arteriovenous contrast ratio was calculated. Protocols were compared using Mann-Whitney U nonparametric statistics. Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to assess diagnostic efficacy. Interobserver variations were investigated using kappa methods. RESULTS A number of pulmonary arteries demonstrated increases in opacification (P < 0.02) for protocol B compared with A, whereas opacification in all veins was reduced in protocol B (P < 0.03). Subsequently, increased arteriovenous contrast ratio in protocol B compared with A was observed at all anatomic locations (P < 0.0002). An increase in jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figure of merit (P < 0.0002) and interobserver variation was observed with protocol B compared with protocol A (κ = 0.3-0.73). Mean contrast volume was reduced in protocol B (29 [4] mL) compared with protocol A (33 [9] mL). Mean effective radiation dose in protocol B (1.2 [0.4] mSv) was reduced by 14% compared with protocol A (1.4 [0.6] mSv). CONCLUSIONS Significant improvements in visualization of the PV can be achieved with a low contrast volume using an EDCM and PSCF. The reduced risk of cancer induction is highlighted.","Saade, Charbel; Mayat, Ahmad; El-Merhi, Fadi",Journal of computer assisted tomography,208,31

Based on this preclinical model, longitudinal studies can be carried out to provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying the outcomes seen after bariatric surgery in humans. For this purpose, rats are operated on through a laparotomy under general anesthesia with isoflurane. First, the surgeon creates a long and tubular gastric pouch: after greater curve and hiatal dissection, the nonglandular stomach is stapled and removed. Then, the remaining stomach is also stapled in order to create a gastric tube and exclude the antrum of the stomach. After that, the surgeon performs a single end-to-side gastrojejunostomy 35 cm from the duodenojejunal angle. This limb length has been chosen in order to reproduce the same ratio between the biliopancreatic limb (BPL) and common limb (CL) length as in human bariatric surgery. The operation ends by aponeurotic and cutaneous closure. The early postoperative management consists of subcutaneous hydration, an intramuscular prophylactic antibiotic injection, a parietal injection of xylocaine, the administration of painkillers, and a progressive reintroduction of diet.","Siebert, Matthieu A; Chevallier, Jean-Marc; D'Aurelle de Paladines, Diego; Pottier, Yohann; Msika, Simon; Le Gall, Maude; Bado, André; Ribeiro-Parenti, Lara",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,208,31

So far, gas exchange has been examined using transcutaneously measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this structured investigation, arterial blood gas analysis in a 30-year-old female resident was carried out during a 13-hour day shift on the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria. An FFP3 mask (3MTM AuraTM) with an exhalation valve was continuously worn, except for 1 break of 20 min. Arterial blood samples were obtained before putting on the PPE, and after 5 h, 9 h and 13 h of working in the contaminated area. RESULTS During the multi-hour wearing time, an increase in PaCO2 (the baseline value: 29.3 mm Hg, the max. value: 38.9 mm Hg) and a continuous decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2, the baseline value: 102 mm Hg, the min. value: 80.8 mm Hg) was detectable. CONCLUSIONS All measured values were within the normal range, but a trend towards an insufficient gas exchange could be suspected.","Fantin, Raffaella",International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,208,19

No studies have examined the prognostic value of Axis IV in DSM-IV. METHOD We analyzed data from 2497 participants in the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) with major depressive episode (MDE). We hypothesized that psychosocial stressors predict a poor prognosis of MDE. Secondarily, we hypothesized that psychosocial stressors predict a poor prognosis of anxiety and substance use disorders. Stressors were defined according to DSM-IV's taxonomy, and empirically using latent class analysis (LCA). RESULTS Primary support group problems, occupational problems and childhood adversity increased the risks of depressive episodes and suicidal ideation by 20-30%. Associations of the empirically derived classes of stressors with depression were larger in magnitude. Economic stressors conferred a 1.5-fold increase in risk for a depressive episode [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.9]; financial and interpersonal instability conferred a 1.3-fold increased risk of recurrent depression (95% CI 1.1-1.6). These two classes of stressors also predicted the recurrence of anxiety and substance use disorders. Stressors were not related to suicidal ideation independent from depression severity. CONCLUSIONS Psychosocial and environmental problems are associated with the prognosis of MDE and other Axis I disorders. Although DSM-IV's taxonomy of stressors stands to be improved, these results provide empirical support for the prognostic value of Axis IV. Future work is needed to determine the reliability of Axis IV assessments in clinical practice, and the usefulness of this information to improving the clinical course of mental disorders.","Gilman, S E; Trinh, N-H; Smoller, J W; Fava, M; Murphy, J M; Breslau, J",Psychological medicine,208,1

The cytokine storm is a known factor causing major clinical symptoms leading to death in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE To investigate and compare the serum levels of different cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity. METHODS Concentrations of serum cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF, were measured in 61 COVID-19 patients and 31 normal controls with ELISA. We investigated the correlation between the levels of these cytokines and clinical severity, CRP level, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS Our data indicated that the levels of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF, but not IL-10 were significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared to normal controls. Statistical analysis showed that the level of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF were higher in severe COVID-19 than those of mild cases. The concentrations of all mentioned cytokines were negatively associated with the absolute count of lymphocytes, and positively correlated with the CRP level and the absolute count of neutrophils. CONCLUSION The current study suggests that high levels of various cytokines correlate with the disease severity and immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.","Taghiloo, Saeid; Soltanshahi, Mohsen; Aliyali, Masoud; Abedi, Siavash; Mehravaran, Hossein; Ajami, Abolghasem; Asgarian-Omran, Hossein",Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,208,24

However, few studies have sought to identify these factors. The present study had a double objective: (1) To identify the individual factors that differentiate patients who had been prescribed opioids for the management of chronic back pain from those who had not been prescribed opioids and (2) to determine which factors make significant and independent contributions to the prediction of opioid prescribing. Methods: A total of 675 patients from four primary care centers were included in the sample. Variables included sex, age, pain intensity, depressive symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and pain acceptance. Results: Although no differences were found between men and women, participants with chronic noncancer pain who were prescribed opioids were older, reported higher levels of pain intensity and depressive symptoms, and reported lower levels of pain-acceptance. An independent association was found between pain intensity and depressive symptoms and opioid prescribing. Conclusions: The findings suggest that patient factors influence physicians' decisions on prescribing opioids. It may be useful for primary care physicians to be aware of the potential of these factors to bias their treatment decisions.","Ramírez-Maestre, Carmen; Reyes-Pérez, Ángela; Esteve, Rosa; López-Martínez, Alicia E; Bernardes, Sonia; Jensen, Mark P",International journal of environmental research and public health,208,1

Reduced relaxation time between contractions in exercise requires increased vasodilatation and/or pressor response to prevent hypoperfusion and potential compromise to exercise tolerance. However, it remains unknown whether and to what extent local vasodilatation and/or systemic pressor compensation occurs and whether the efficacy of compensation is exercise intensity dependent. What is the main finding and its importance? We demonstrate that in a forearm exercise model vasodilatory but not pressor compensation occurs and is adequate to prevent hypoperfusion below but not above ∼40% peak work rate. Inadequate compensation occurs with exercise still well inside the submaximal domain, despite a vasodilatory reserve, and compromises exercise performance. During muscle contraction in rhythmic exercise, muscle blood flow is significantly impeded by microvascular compression. The purpose of this study was to establish the nature and magnitude of vasodilatory and/or pressor compensatory responses during forearm exercise in the face of an increased duration of mechanical microvascular compression, and whether the effectiveness of such compensation was exercise intensity dependent. Seven healthy males (21.0 ± 1.8 years old) completed progressive forearm exercise (24.5 N every 3 min; 2 s contraction-4 s relaxation duty cycle) in two conditions: control (CON), 2 s 100 mmHg forearm cuff inflation during contraction; and impedance (IMP), extension of cuff inflation 2 s beyond contraction. Forearm blood flow (in millilitres per minute); brachial artery Doppler and echo ultrasound), mean arterial blood pressure (in millimetres of mercury; finger photoplethysmography) and exercising forearm venous effluent (antecubital vein catheter) measurements revealed an exercise intensity-dependent compensatory vasodilatation effectiveness whereby increased vasodilatation fully protected forearm blood flow up to the 30% exercise intensity in IMP. Above this exercise intensity, forearm blood flow was defended only in part, although submaximal oxygen uptake was not compromised for any completed work rate. As a result, peak exercise intensity (175 ± 22 versus 196 ± 28 N, P = 0.04) and oxygen delivery (76 ± 14 versus 112 ± 22 ml O2 min-1 , P = 0.01) were significantly reduced in IMP compared with CON. In conclusion, reducing relaxation time compromised exercise capacity without compromise to oxygen uptake. Vasodilatory compensation was complete at lower but not higher exercise intensities, whereas pressor compensation was absent. The reasons for the exercise intensity dependence of the efficacy of vasodilatory compensation remain to be determined.","Bentley, Robert F; Poitras, Veronica J; Hong, Terrence; Tschakovsky, Michael E",Experimental physiology,208,1

Distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) use the same propagation medium, i.e., single mode optical fibre, and aim at comparable targets such as covering the highest distance with the best signal quality. In the case of sensors, a noiseless transmission enables us to monitor a large quantity of mechanical events along the fibre. This paper aims at extending the perspectives of DAS systems with regard to technology breakthroughs introduced in long haul transmission systems over the past decade. We recently developed a sensor interrogation method based on coherent phase-sensitive optical time domain reflectometry (ϕ-OTDR), with dual polarization multiplexing at the transmitter and polarization diversity at the receiver. We name this technique coherent-MIMO sensing. A study is performed from a dual-polarization numerical model to compare several sensor interrogation techniques, including coherent-MIMO. We demonstrate that dual-polarization probing of a fibre sensor makes it insensitive to polarization effects, decreases the risks of false alarms and thus strongly enhances its sensitivity. The simulations results are validated with an experiment, and finally quantitative data are given on the performance increase enabled by coherent-MIMO sensing.","Guerrier, Sterenn; Dorize, Christian; Awwad, Elie; Renaudier, Jérémie",Optics express,208,1

Autopsy revealed firm, consolidated lungs or lobar pneumonia. Histology of the lungs showed changes of diffuse alveolar damage with fibrin membrane formation, thickened alveolar walls and interstitium with lymphocytic infiltrate, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia with shedding into the alveolar space. This series is the first in the world to describe autopsy findings in individuals dying suddenly in the community, not previously known to have COVID-19 infection, and the first autopsy series in the UK. During a time when testing in the UK is currently primarily offered to patients in hospital or symptomatic key workers, with limited testing available in community settings, it highlights the importance of testing for COVID-19 at autopsy. Two deaths occurred in care homes where a diagnosis of COVID-19 allowed the health protection team to provide support in that 'closed setting' to reduce the risks of onward transmission. This work highlights the need for frequent COVID-19 testing in the management of patients in community settings.

Few studies explored the perception of appropriateness by professionals in pediatric palliative care, revealing the conflict sometimes faced when confronted with the uncertainty of prognosis and end-of-life decisions. AIMS The objective of this study is firstly to investigate the perception that doctors, nurses and psychologists, operating in Italian pediatric hospices, have of the appropriateness of the care they provide. Secondly, to understand what repercussions the perception of non-appropriateness has at individual and team level. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted between 2019 and 2020 through semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of 17 professionals working it Italian pediatric hospices. RESULTS The interviewees do not refer to a common concept of appropriateness, but compare the latter to: the quality of life, the global care of the assisted person, the proportionality of care, the early recognition of the need for palliative care. The discussion within the team emerges as a privileged place to manage the discomfort of individual professionals in the face of treatment choices in conflict with their own values. CONCLUSION the non-referring to a univocal conception of appropriateness deprives professionals of an objective criterion to resolve the most difficult decisions. However, it allows them to establish what from time to time seems to be the most appropriate care pathway for a given patient, at a given time and context, preserving the goal of personalized care.","Cappi, Valentina; Riboni, Serena; Grana, Marianna; Pierotti, Emanuela; Ravelli, Andrea; Sutti, Stefania; Testa, Sara; Spacci, Alessio; Artioli, Giovanna; Sarli, Leopoldo; Pellegatta, Federico",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,208,22

These complications may also worsen due to the potential compounding of COVID-19 related stigma with stigmatization associated with previously diagnosed conditions. This exploratory study analyzes the experiences of the stigma associated with COVID-19 lockdown in people with different previous diagnoses 2 and 5 weeks after the beginning of the state of emergency in Spain. Gender and age were controlled as covariables and 1,052 people participated in the study. The diagnosis groups were: Psychiatry and mental health (n = 71), Cardiovascular disease (n = 42), Neurological disease (n = 23), Lung disease (n = 53), and No diagnosis (n = 863). The instruments used to measure the stigma were the Intersectional Day-to-Day Discrimination Index and two items of the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale. Analysis of covariance of repeated measures and analysis of variance, including Scheffe's post hoc test, were performed. We found significant differences in stigma among the first and second evaluation. Regarding the previous diagnosis, no differences were found at Time 1, but significant differences were found at Time 2, with those having a previous psychiatric or mental health diagnosis reporting higher levels of perceived discrimination and internalized stigmatization. Our results suggest that people with previous stigmatizing conditions might be more vulnerable to experiencing stigma in a confinement situation. In order to reduce the burden of the COVID-19 stigma, health interventions should also consider the resulting intersection of effects on internalized stigma and perceived discrimination.

METHODS We measured dead space in 56 needle and syringe combinations obtained from needle and syringe programs across 17 countries in Europe and Asia. We also calculated the amounts of blood and HIV that would remain in different combinations following injection and rinsing. RESULTS Syringe barrel capacities ranged from 0.5 to 20 mL. Needles ranged in length from 8 to 38 mm. The average dead space was 3 μL in low dead space syringes with permanently attached needles, 13 μL in high dead space syringes with low dead space needles, 45 μL in low dead space syringes with high dead space needles, and 99 μL in high dead space syringes with high dead space needles. Among low dead space designs, calculated volumes of blood and HIV viral burden were lowest for low dead space syringes with permanently attached needles and highest for low dead space syringes with high dead space needles. CONCLUSION The dead space in different low dead space needle and syringe combinations varied substantially. To reduce HIV transmission related to syringe sharing, needle and syringe programs need to combine this knowledge with the needs of their clients.","Zule, William A; Pande, Poonam G; Otiashvili, David; Bobashev, Georgiy V; Friedman, Samuel R; Gyarmathy, V Anna; Des Jarlais, Don C",Harm reduction journal,208,26

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be used as a supportive therapy to improve outcomes but evidence-based guidelines have not been defined. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA Initial mortality rates associated with ECMO for ARDS in COVID-19 were high, leading some to believe that there was no role for ECMO in this viral illness. With more experience, outcomes have improved. The ideal candidate, timing of cannulation, and best post-cannulation management strategy, however, has not yet been defined. METHODS We conducted a retrospective review from April 1 to July 31 2020 of the first 25 patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS placed on V-V ECMO at our institution. We analyzed the differences between survivors to hospital discharge and those who died. Modified Poisson regression was used to model adjusted risk factors for mortality. RESULTS 44% of patients (11/25) survived to hospital discharge. Survivors were significantly younger (40.5 years vs. 53.1 years; p < 0.001) with no differences between cohorts in mean body mass index, diabetes, or PaO2:FiO2 at cannulation. Survivors had shorter duration from symptom onset to cannulation (12.5 days vs. 19.9 days, p = 0.028) and shorter duration of intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) prior to cannulation (5.6 days vs. 11.7 days, p = 0.045). Each day from ICU admission to cannulation increased the adjusted risk of death by 4% and each year increase in age increased the adjusted risk 6%. CONCLUSIONS ECMO has a role in severe, refractory ARDS associated with COVID-19.

We compared two stapling devices in the distal rectum in a cadaver study: the iDrive™ right angle linear cutter (RALC) (Covidien, New Haven, CT) and the CONTOUR® curved cutter (CC) (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincinnati, OH). METHODS Twelve male cadavers underwent pelvic dissection by 4 surgeons. After rectal mobilization as in a total mesorectal excision, the staplers were applied to the rectum as deep as possible in both the coronal and sagittal positions. The distance from the pelvic floor was measured for each application. A questionnaire rated the visibility and access of the stapling devices. Measurements were taken between pelvic landmarks to see what anatomic factors hinder the placement of a distal rectal stapler. RESULTS The median (range) distance of the stapler from the pelvic floor in the coronal position for the RALC was 1.0 cm (0-4.0) vs. 2.0 cm (0-5.0) for the CC, p = 0.003. In the sagittal position, the median distance was 1.6 cm (0-3.5) for the RALC and 3.3 cm (0-5.0) for the CC, p < 0.0001. The RALC scored better than the CC in respect to: 1. interference by the symphysis pubis, 2. number of stapler readjustments, 3. ease of placement in the pelvis, 4. impediment of visibility, 5. ability to hold and retain tissue, 6. visibility rating, and 7. access in the pelvis. A shorter distance between the tip of the coccyx and the pubic symphysis correlated with a longer distance of the stapler from the pelvic floor (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS The RALC is superior to the CC in terms of access, visibility, and ease of placement in the deep pelvis. This could provide important clinical benefit to both patient and surgeon during difficult rectal surgery.","Sonoda, Toyooki; Verdeja, Juan Carlos; Rivadeneira, David E",Annals of surgical innovation and research,208,7

Protein phosphorylation forms the basis for identifying a variety of cellular signaling pathways responsible for regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs induced by OECs. To better understand the signaling cascades in the early phases of OEC-induced NSC differentiation, changes in the NSC proteome and phosphoproteome during the first 24h were determined using dimethyl labeling and TiO2 phosphorylation enrichment coupled with Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 565 proteins and 2,511 phosphorylation sites were identified. According to quantitative phosphoproteomics analyses of NSC differentiation induced by OECs during the first 12 and 24h, it was speculated that there were at least two different signal waves: one peaking within 12h after stimulation and the second upsurge after 24h. In addition to understanding the dynamics of the proteome and phosphoproteome in the early stages of NSC differentiation, our analyses identified a key role of the TGF-β3 protein secreted by OECs, which may be an initiating factor that promotes differentiation of NSCs into neurons induced by OECs. These findings not only redemonstrated a OECs-based therapeutic strategy in cell therapy, but also added a node to the regulatory network for the neural lineage commitment of NSCs induced by OECs.

To test the effects of TRAP, pregnant rat dams were transported to a vivarium adjacent to a major freeway tunnel system in northern California where they were exposed to TRAP drawn directly from the face of the tunnel or filtered air (FA). Offspring remained housed under the exposure condition into which they were born and were tested in a variety of behavioral assays between postnatal day 4 and 50. To assess the effects of near roadway exposure, offspring of dams housed in a standard research vivarium were tested at the laboratory. An additional group of dams was transported halfway to the facility and then back to the laboratory to control for the effect of potential transport stress. Near roadway exposure delayed growth and development of psychomotor reflexes and elicited abnormal activity in open field locomotion. Near roadway exposure also reduced isolation-induced 40-kHz pup ultrasonic vocalizations, with the TRAP group having the lowest number of call emissions. TRAP affected some components of social communication, evidenced by reduced neonatal pup ultrasonic calling and altered juvenile reciprocal social interactions. These findings confirm that living in close proximity to highly trafficked roadways during early life alters neurodevelopment.","Berg, Elizabeth L; Pedersen, Lauren R; Pride, Michael C; Petkova, Stela P; Patten, Kelley T; Valenzuela, Anthony E; Wallis, Christopher; Bein, Keith J; Wexler, Anthony; Lein, Pamela J; Silverman, Jill L",Translational psychiatry,208,5

Given that some reports suggest that this infection can also occur with neurologic manifestations, this narrative review addresses the basic and clinical aspects concerning the nervous system involvement associated with this disease. More than one third of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 can present with both central and peripheral neurological manifestations. The former include dizziness and headache, while the latter include taste and smell disturbances. Other reported neurological manifestations are cerebrovascular disease and epileptic seizures. According to published reports, neurological disorders are not uncommon in COVID-19 and can sometimes represent the first manifestation of the disease; therefore, neurologists should consider this diagnostic possibility in their daily practice. Since maybe not all COVID-19 neurological manifestations are due to SARS-CoV-2 direct effects, it is important to monitor the rest of the clinical parameters such as, for example, oxygen saturation. Similarly, follow-up of patients is advisable, since whether neurological complications may develop lately is thus far unknown.","Corona, Teresita; Rodríguez-Violante, Mayela; Delgado-García, Guillermo",Gaceta medica de Mexico,208,27

This understanding is not mature yet, and there are wide areas of possible improvement. In particular, the fast mobilization and reconfiguration of resources frequently result into the severe disruption of elective activities, worsening the quality of care. More resilient resource allocation strategies, ie, which adapt to the dynamics of the prevailing circumstance, are needed to maximize the effectiveness of health-care delivery. In this study, a simulation approach was adopted to assess and compare different hospital's adaptive resource allocation strategies in responding to a mass casualty incident (MCI). METHODS A specific set of performance metrics was developed to take into consideration multiple objectives and priorities and holistically assess the effectiveness of health-care delivery when coping with an MCI event. Discrete event simulation (DES) and system dynamics (SD) were used to model the key hospital processes and the MCI plan. RESULTS In the daytime scenario, during the recovery phase of the emergency, a gradual disengagement of resources from the emergency department (ED) to restart ordinary activities in operating rooms and wards, returned the best performance. In the night scenario, the absorption capacity of the ED was evaluated by identifying the current bottleneck and assessment of the benefit of different resource mobilization strategies. CONCLUSIONS The present study offers a robust approach, effective strategies, and new insights to design more resilient plans to cope with MCIs. Future research is needed to widen the scope of the analysis and take into consideration additional resilience capacities, such as operational coordination mechanisms, among multiple hospitals in the same geographic area.","Trucco, Paolo; Nocetti, Claudio; Sannicandro, Riccardo; Carlucci, Michele; Weinstein, Eric S; Faccincani, Roberto",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,208,1

Since the associated training process is challenging, it is fundamental to design reliable algorithms to compute an equilibrium. In this article, we propose a stochastic relaxed forward-backward (SRFB) algorithm for GANs, and we show convergence to an exact solution when an increasing number of data is available. We also show convergence of an averaged variant of the SRFB algorithm to a neighborhood of the solution when only a few samples are available. In both cases, convergence is guaranteed when the pseudogradient mapping of the game is monotone. This assumption is among the weakest known in the literature. Moreover, we apply our algorithm to the image generation problem.","Franci, Barbara; Grammatico, Sergio",IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,208,1

METHODS AND RESULTS Between January 2012 and May 2014, 505 patients undergoing coronary angiography, percutaneous coronary intervention, or both were randomized to use (n=253) or no use (n=252) of the Bleeper Sv radiation monitor. Operator radiation exposure was measured in both groups using a second, silent radiation exposure monitoring device. Mean patient age was 65±8 years, most patients (99%) were men, and 30% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Baseline clinical characteristics were similar in the 2 study groups. Radial access was used in 18% and chronic total occlusion percutaneous coronary intervention constituted 7% of the total procedures. Median procedure time was 17 (12-27) minutes for diagnostic angiography, 42 (28-70) minutes for percutaneous coronary intervention, and 27 (14-51) minutes in the overall study population, with similar distribution between the study groups. First (9 [4-17] versus 14 [7-25] μSv; P<0.001) and second (5 [2-10] versus 7 [4-14] μSv; P<0.001) operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in the Bleeper Sv group. Use of the device did not result in a significant reduction in patient radiation dose. The effect of the Bleeper Sv device on operator radiation exposure was consistent among various study subgroups.

Invasion into the diaphragm is considered a contraindication to the laparoscopic approach. At their institution, the authors have begun approaching all tumors laparoscopically. This report presents the techniques necessary to perform right hepatectomy, partial diaphragm resection, and repair using totally laparoscopic techniques. METHODS Five trocars are placed in a semilunar fashion approximately one handbreadth apart along a line one handbreadth below the right subcostal margin. The hepatic inflow is taken extraparenchymally before transection of the hepatic parenchyma in an anterior-to-posterior fashion. The hepatic inflow then is transected, and the involved portion of diaphragm is transected with ultrasonic shears. Next, the diaphragm is repaired primarily and buttressed with an absorbable material to decrease the incidence of recurrent diaphragmatic hernia. RESULTS Laparoscopic treatment was attempted for ten patients and successfully completed for nine of these patients (90%). All 10 patients had secondary liver tumors. Three patients required concomitant partial diaphragm resection. The median estimated blood loss (EBL) was 500 ml (range, 300-3,000 ml). All margins were negative, and the average hospital stay was 8 days (range, 5-17 days). Two patients (20%) experienced complications, which consisted of biliary leaks, which were treated with percutaneous drainage. One of these patients underwent conversion to an open procedure due to an inferior vena cava injury. No mortality occurred at 30 or 90 days of follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSION The minimally invasive approach to secondary tumors requiring right hepatectomy is feasible and safe even when there is diaphragmatic involvement. Larger series with long-term follow-up evaluation are needed to determine whether these short-term results translate into durable benefits.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Leventhal, Abraham; Hoffman, John P",Surgical endoscopy,208,1

The majority have spilled from wildlife reservoirs, either directly to humans or via domestic animals. The emergence of many can be attributed to predisposing factors such as global travel, trade, agricultural expansion, deforestation/habitat fragmentation, and urbanization; such factors increase the interface and/or the rate of contact between human, domestic animal, and wildlife populations, thereby creating increased opportunities for spillover events to occur. Infectious disease emergence can be regarded as primarily an ecological process. The epidemiological investigation of EIDs associated with wildlife requires a trans-disciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the ecology of the wildlife species, and an understanding of human behaviours that increase risk of exposure. Investigations of the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003 provide useful case studies. The emergence of Nipah virus was associated with the increased size and density of commercial pig farms and their encroachment into forested areas. The movement of pigs for sale and slaughter in turn led to the rapid spread of infection to southern peninsular Malaysia, where the high-density, largely urban pig populations facilitated transmission to humans. Identifying the factors associated with the emergence of SARS in southern China requires an understanding of the ecology of infection both in the natural reservoir and in secondary market reservoir species. A necessary extension of understanding the ecology of the reservoir is an understanding of the trade, and of the social and cultural context of wildlife consumption. Emerging infectious diseases originating from wildlife populations will continue to threaten public health. Mitigating and managing the risk requires an appreciation of the connectedness between human, livestock and wildlife health, and of the factors and processes that disrupt the balance.","Field, H E",Zoonoses and public health,208,31

However, the characteristics of some devices may limit the freedom of individuals to be as physically active as they desire. Limited mobility may negatively affect the perceived quality of life of individuals with COPD. The aim of this study was to understand perceived limitations that patients with COPD experience in using long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) devices. METHODS We performed a qualitative analysis of 311 responses to an open-ended question from a previously deployed electronic survey designed to investigate how LTOT devices affect oxygen-dependent patients with COPD. Our thematic analysis was facilitated by NVivo, a qualitative data analysis software package. This involved identifying patterns and themes within the robust, text-rich data from the open-ended survey question regarding the survey subjects' experiences with their LTOT devices. Cluster analysis was also performed to highlight relationships between various concepts. RESULTS Themes generated revealed that subjects experienced decreased mobility, which resulted in feelings of decreased autonomy and isolation. We also found that subjects perceived a decrease in quality of life due to their described experience of portable oxygen cylinders being heavy and cumbersome. Subjects described feelings of fear and anxiety due to insufficient support for breathing provided by pulse-dose portable oxygen concentrators, as well as portable oxygen cylinders that run out before they are able to complete errands and other activities of daily living. Some subjects also reported that they willingly pay for liquid oxygen systems out-of-pocket because of the mobility it affords, which in their perception improves their quality of life. CONCULSIONS Oxygen-dependent individuals with COPD may be at risk of adverse outcomes associated with decreased mobility encouraged by unsatisfactory physical and technical characteristics of portable oxygen cylinders and concentrators.","AlMutairi, Hejab J; Mussa, Constance C; Lambert, Clement Tm; Vines, David L; Strickland, Shawna L",Respiratory care,208,24

Furthermore, we found that upregulation of LC3B expression contributes to an increase in EGF secretion. The subsequent hyperactivation of EGFR-AKT signaling rendered NANOG+ tumor cells resistant to CTL killing. The NANOG-LC3B-p-EGFR axis was preserved across various types of human cancer and correlated negatively with the overall survival of cervical cancer patients. Inhibition of LC3B in immune-refractory tumor models rendered tumors susceptible to adoptive T-cell transfer, as well as PDCD1/PD-1 blockade, and led to successful, long-term control of the disease. Thus, our findings demonstrate a novel link among immune-resistance, stem-like phenotypes, and LC3B-mediated autophagic secretion in immune-refractory tumor cells, and implicate the LC3B-p-EGFR axis as a central molecular target for controlling NANOG+ immune-refractory cancer.","Kim, Suyeon; Cho, Hanbyoul; Hong, Soon-Oh; Oh, Se Jin; Lee, Hyo-Jung; Cho, Eunho; Woo, Seon Rang; Song, Joon Seon; Chung, Joon-Yong; Son, Sung Wook; Yoon, Sang Min; Jeon, Yu-Min; Jeon, Seunghyun; Yee, Cassian; Lee, Kyung-Mi; Hewitt, Stephen M; Kim, Jae-Hoon; Song, Kwon-Ho; Kim, Tae Woo",Autophagy,208,5

However, the evolutionary steps that facilitate the de novo generation of a novel protein within an ancestral ORF have remained poorly characterized. Here, we describe the identification of an overprinting gene, expressed from an Alternate frame of the Large T Open reading frame (ALTO) in the early region of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), the causative agent of most Merkel cell carcinomas. ALTO is expressed during, but not required for, replication of the MCPyV genome. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that ALTO is evolutionarily related to the middle T antigen of murine polyomavirus despite almost no sequence similarity. ALTO/MT arose de novo by overprinting of the second exon of T antigen in the common ancestor of a large clade of mammalian polyomaviruses. Taking advantage of the low evolutionary divergence and diverse sampling of polyomaviruses, we propose evolutionary transitions that likely gave birth to this protein. We suggest that two highly constrained regions of the large T antigen ORF provided a start codon and C-terminal hydrophobic motif necessary for cellular localization of ALTO. These two key features, together with stochastic erasure of intervening stop codons, resulted in a unique protein-coding capacity that has been preserved ever since its birth. Our study not only reveals a previously undefined protein encoded by several polyomaviruses including MCPyV, but also provides insight into de novo protein evolution.","Carter, Joseph J; Daugherty, Matthew D; Qi, Xiaojie; Bheda-Malge, Anjali; Wipf, Gregory C; Robinson, Kristin; Roman, Ann; Malik, Harmit S; Galloway, Denise A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,208,19

Many lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease are associated with dramatic changes in mechanical properties of lung tissues. Nevertheless, US-E is rarely used to image the lung because it is filled with air. The large difference in acoustic impedance between air and lung tissue results in the reflection of the ultrasound wave at the lung surface and consequently the loss of most ultrasound energy. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in US-E applications in evaluating lung diseases. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the technological advances of US-E research on lung disease diagnosis. We introduce the basic principles and major techniques of US-E and provide information on various applications in lung disease assessment. Finally, the potential applications of US-E to the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is discussed.","Zhou, Boran; Yang, Xiaofeng; Zhang, Xiaoming; Curran, Walter J; Liu, Tian","IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",208,8

Cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release were evaluated in the L929 fibroblasts. Swiss mice were submitted to TPA application and were topically treated with AEAM (0.3, 1 or 3 mg/ear). After 6 h, inflammatory and oxidative parameters were evaluated. Quercetin 3-glucoside, rutin, chlorogenic acid, catechin and gallic acid were identified in AEAM. It also presented antioxidant activity in all in vitro assays used. Incubation with AEAM did not cause cell cytotoxicity but reduced ROS release from fibroblasts. Compared with the control group, treatment with AEAM significantly reduced ear oedema and mieloperoxidase activity in inflamed ears, as well as histological parameters of inflammation. These results were associated with the reduction of total hydroperoxides and modulation of catalase, but not superoxide dismutase activity.

Focusing on the United States, we find a proliferation and diversification of cultural authority, reflecting a partial movement from the domain of medicine into new terrains of health. This shift is apparent in the resurgence of alternative healing, the advent of new forms of self-care and self-monitoring, the rise of health social movements, and the spread of health information online.

A cure has not been developed yet and currently used treatment protocols are aimed at relieving clinical symptoms of the disease. This article presents a retrospective review of biologically active compounds of plant origin that can inhibit the reproduction of CoVs, which makes them potential candidates for creating medicinal antiviral preparations against severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 infections. A literature review of articles from highly rated journals was performed using public databases. The search was carried out using keywords related to CoVs, targets for therapy, and plant as antiviral agents. Although inhibition of viral replication is often considered the common mechanism of antiviral activity exerted by most natural products, several plant-derived compounds show specific activity for particular target viruses. In this context, certain classes of plant preparations can serve as a basis for designing modern antiviral agents. In addition, a large number of plant compounds that are potentially active against CoVs are the main components of certain common dietary supplements that can be used to improve the resistance of a population against certain respiratory infections. In this review, we have attempted to characterize the main groups of biologically active plant compounds that have the potential to disrupt the key stages of CoV replication. It has been shown that the use of certain herbal preparations can change the course of infection.","Berezin, Vladimir; Bogoyavlenskiy, Andrey; Alexyuk, Madina; Alexyuk, Pavel",Journal of medicinal food,208,31

These labels educate people about the health risks associated with the target behavior and are typically accompanied by graphic imagery that elicits disgust (e.g., a picture of blackened lungs). Although the emotion of disgust has been shown to be an effective tool to affect consumer attitudes toward meat, it remains unclear whether such graphic warning labels that recruit disgust would also affect people's intentions to reduce their meat consumption. Two experiments reveal that graphic warning labels, by recruiting disgust, can increase people's intention to reduce their current levels of meat consumption. However, by eliciting disgust, graphic warning labels can simultaneously trigger reactance: graphic images can make people feel they are being manipulated, thereby ironically decreasing meat-reduction intentions. In a final experiment, we aimed to circumvent reactance by providing disgusting information under the guise of trivia, thereby avoiding the perception that the disgusting information was meant to manipulate. Via this route, disgust becomes a potent tool to influence consumers' intentions to consume meat.

Methods: Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed in 58 COVID-19 patients with hypertension admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center from January 20 to February 22, 2020, including epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest CT and outcome. Patients were divided into ACEI/ARB group and non-ACEI/ARB group. Results: Twenty-six patients were in ACEI/ARB group and the other 32 patients in non-ACEI/ARB group, with median age 64.0 (49.5, 72.0) years and 64.0 (57.0, 68.8) years respectively. The median time to onset was 5(3, 8) days in ACEI/ARB group and 4 (3, 7) days in non-ACEI/ARB group, the proportion of patients with severe or critical illness was 19.2% and 15.6% respectively. The main clinical symptoms in two groups were fever (80.8% vs. 84.4%) and cough (23.1% vs. 31.3%).

MATERIALS/METHODS Peritoneal and serum concentrations of Caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin were analyzed in surgical patients with suspected candida peritonitis. After four days of starting therapy serum and peritoneal samples (through peritoneal drainage) were obtained at baseline, 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h of drug administration. Micafungin and anidulafungin concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/F), whereas caspofungin concentration were stablished by bioassay. RESULTS A total of 23 critically ill patients with suspected abdominal fungal infection who were receiving an echinocandin were prospectively recruited. No specific criteria were applied to prescribe one specific echinocadin. No special clinical differences were observed among the 3 groups of patients. All were receiving antibiotic therapy, 80% required inotropic drugs and finally fungal peritonitis were confirmed in 74% of them. The AUC0_24h (mg*h/L) obtained in serum and peritoneal fluid were: 126.84 and 34.38; 98.52 and 18.83; and 66.9 and 8.78 for anidulafungin, micafungin and caspofungin, respectively. The median concentration in peritoneal fluid ranged from 0.66 to 1.82 μg/ml for anidulafungin, 0.68 to 0.88 μg/mL for micafungin and 0.21 to 0.46 μg/ml for caspofungin. CONCLUSION The results show a moderate penetration of echinocandins into the peritoneal fluid in these patients. These levels are below the threshold of resistance mutant selection published by other authors. It could justify a potential risk of resistance in patients with prolonged treatments with echinocandins and suboptimal control of the abdominal infection.","Gioia, Francesca; Gomez-Lopez, Alicia; Alvarez, Maria Elena; Gomez-García de la Pedrosa, Elia; Martín-Davila, Pilar; Cuenca-Estrella, Manuel; Moreno, Santiago; Fortun, Jesús",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,208,31

One measure, reduction in ship speed, has been shown to be one of the key drivers in reducing sound source levels of vessels. In 2017, a study began to assess the impacts of increasing commercial shipping traffic on sperm whales in Northwest Providence Channel, northern Bahamas, an international trade route that primarily serves the southeast US. Ship data were collected from an Automatic Identification System (AIS) station combined with recordings from an acoustic recorder to measure underwater sound levels and to detect the presence of sperm whales. Here we analyze a subset of these data to opportunistically investigate potential changes in ship traffic before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. These data span one calendar year from October 2019 to October 2020. A pre-COVID-19 dataset of 121 days, from a recorder approximately 2 km from the shipping route was compared to a 134-day dataset collected during COVID-19 from the same site, comprising 2900 and 3181 ten-minute recordings, respectively. A dramatic decrease in ocean noise levels concurrent with changes in shipping activity occurred during the pandemic. The mean pre-COVID-19 power density level in the 111-140 Hz 1/3-octave band was 88.81 dB re 1 mu Pa (range 81.38-100.90) and decreased to 84.27 dB re 1 mu Pa (range 78.60-99.51) during COVID-19, equating to a 41% reduction in sound pressure levels (SPL). After differences in seasonal changes in wind speed were accounted for, SPL decreased during the pandemic by 3.98 dB (37%). The most notable changes in ship activity were significantly reduced vessel speeds for all ship types and fewer ships using the area during the pandemic. Vessel speed was highly correlated to SPL and the only ship-based variable that predicted SPLs. Despite the opportunistic nature [i.e., not a standard before-after-control-impact (BACI) study], this study provides a unique opportunity to assess the effectiveness of ship traffic management strategies, such as slowing ships down, to mitigate impacts on marine life in the study area, including local sperm whale populations.","Dunn, C.; Theriault, J.; Hickmott, L.; Claridge, D.",Frontiers in Marine Science,208,23

Public health professionals have long feared that further spread of fentanyl could greatly exacerbate the opioid epidemic. We aimed to measure and characterize recent fentanyl deaths in jurisdictions west of the Mississippi River. Design: Systematic search of states and counties in the Western U.S. for publicly available data on fentanyl-related deaths since the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics, which cover through December 2018. Longitudinal study using 2019 and 2020 mortality records to identify changes in fentanyl-involved mortality since most recent CDC statistics. Settings: U.S. states west of the Mississippi River. Measurements: Annual rate of fentanyl-involved deaths per 100,000 population. Proportion of fatal heroin-, stimulant, and prescription pill overdoses also involving fentanyl. Findings: We identified nine jurisdictions with publicly available fentanyl death data through December 2019 or later: State of Arizona, Denver County, CO, Harris County, TX, Humboldt County, CA, King County, WA, Los Angeles County, CA, San Francisco County, CA, Siskiyou County, CA, Dallas-Fort Worth, TX metro area (Denton, Johnson, Parker, Tarrant counties. Fentanyl deaths increased in each jurisdiction. Their collective contribution to national synthetic narcotics mortality tripled from 2017 to 2019. First quarter 2020 data (available from all but San Francisco County) showed a 33% growth in fentanyl-mortality over 2019. Fentanyl-involvement in heroin, stimulant, and prescription pill deaths has grown substantially over time. Conclusions: Fentanyl has spread westward, which could dramatically worsen the already severe opioid epidemic in the United States. Increasing standard-dose of naloxone, expanding Medicaid, improving coverage of addiction treatment, and public health educational campaigns should be prioritized.","Shover, C. L.; Falasinnu, T.

Loss of biodiversity and our connectedness to nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of ‘lesser known’ microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall –– this could potentially be attributed to a ‘COVID-19 effect’. Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. A greater emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes towards the foundations of our ecosystems – the microorganisms.","Robinson, Jake M.; Cameron, Ross; Jorgensen, Anna",bioRxiv,208,16

Design/methodology/approach: The data are collected from listed firms in five markets that have experienced the second wave of COVID-19 contagion, namely the United States (US), Australia, China, Hong Kong and South Korea. The period of investigation in this study ranges from January 24 to August 28, 2020 to cover the first two COVID-19 waves in selected markets. The study estimates the research model by employing the ordinary least square method with fixed effects to control for the heterogeneity that may confound the empirical outcomes. Findings: The analysis reveals that firms with larger size and more cash reserves before the COVID-19 outbreak have better stock performance under the first wave;however, these advantages impede stock resilience during the second wave. Corporate governance practices significantly influence stock returns only in the first wave as their effects fade when the second wave emerges. The results also suggest that in economies with greater power distance, although stock price depreciation was milder in the first wave, it is more intense when new cases again surge after the first wave was contained. Practical implications: This paper provides practical implications for corporate managers, policymakers and governments concerning crisis management strategies for COVID-19 and future pandemics. Originality/value: This study is the first to evaluate built-in corporate immunity before the COVID-19 shock under successive contagious waves.

These end caps consist of sialic acids or sugar molecules. Coronaviruses (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are found to use this route of interaction. The strength and spatial interactions on the single molecule level of sialic acids with either the spike (S) protein of SARS coronaviruses, or human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and furin are probed and compared to the binding modes of those sugar molecules which are present in glycans of glycoproteins. The protocol of using single molecules is seen as a simplified but effective mimic of the complex mode of interaction of the glycans. Averaged estimated binding energies from a docking approach result in preferential binding of the sialic acids to a specific binding site of the S protein of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43). Furin is proposed to provide better binding sites for sialic acids than ACE2, albeit outweighed by sites for other sugar molecules. Absolute minimal estimated binding energies indicate weak binding affinities and are indifferent to the type of sugar molecules and the proteins. Neither the proposed best binding sites of the sialic acids nor those of the sugar molecules overlap with any of the cleavage sites at the S protein and the active sites of the human proteins. © 2021, AIMS Biophysics.

With the rapid development of the internet, the internet has penetrated into all aspects of people's lives. As soon as e-commerce was introduced, it was loved by the majority of young people and brought tremendous changes to people's lives. As an important pillar industry of the national economy, real estate lacks a better e-commerce model and is still in the traditional sales model, waiting for customers to come. With the advent of the era of big data, breakthroughs in IT technology have made the collection, analysis, and processing of big data a reality, which makes it possible for big data to provide guidance for the development of e-commerce. As traditional processing technologies and ways of thinking gradually fail to meet application requirements, people have reached a consensus that big data will trigger the next revolution in the e-commerce industry, and how to make the real estate industry develop better in this revolution has become a reality. Based on this, this paper studies a real estate virtual e-commerce model based on big data. In the study of this model, this paper combines the advantages of e-commerce and virtual communities to design a more effective virtual e-commerce model that collects the data of virtual e-commerce platforms for analysis and processing, accurately obtains the needs of customers, provides customers with more reasonable options to meet their needs, and promoted the healthy development of the real estate industry. The analysis of e-commerce and virtual communities shows that the virtual e-commerce model designed in this paper is a more effective model, and the real estate virtual e-commerce model based on big data technology can serve the real estate industry and do a good job in the sales reform of the real estate industry.","Zhu, D.

This virus can be transmitted to other humans primarily through respiratory secretions when an infected person coughs or talks. To avoid human to human transmission of this pandemic, the government extend the state of emergency policies which cause vital damage for many business sections worldwide including educational institution. Many schools decide to let the students learn at home. However, in practical courses such as a chemical workshop, students must come to the laboratory room to perform experiments which may increase the risk of infection. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between students and staff, anybody entering the school must conduct a risk assessment, measure a body temperature and wear a face mask at all times. Many COVID-19 contact tracing platforms allow users to assess infection risk and notify if they have been exposed to infected persons. Unfortunately, they cannot be used effectively with the on-campus education system. The proposed mobile application was developed to handle the needs of the onsite education system during the ongoing COVID-19 situation in schools. The application contains three main functions which are a COVID-19 self-assessment, a roll-call, and a social distancing function. This paper focused on the roll-call function using face recognition and Global Positioning System (GPS). In a normal situation, the student just opens an application, shows his or her face to a smartphone camera then the application will detect a face part and easily recognize the student's identification. However, in the new normal situation where everyone must wear a mask, it will be a very difficult task to perform face recognition since almost half of the face is hidden. The convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to train a CNN model using a dataset of 18 peoples with non face mask wearing and face mask wearing. The face mask wearing consisted of three different face mask types: Disposable surgical mask (DS), N95 face respirators (N95) and general 3D mask (3D). After that, the model was exported to the proposed mobile application. Experimental results on a realworld dataset show that the proposed model can be used with a high accuracy rate in non face mask samples. In face mask samples, the 3D mask has the highest accuracy rate. © 2021 IEEE.","Tangtisanon, P.","6th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Communication Systems, ICCCS 2021",208,1

The purpose of this study is to identify the challenges faced by the special education teachers (SETs) who have been providing distance learning for children with special needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using a survey method by distributing questionnaires via Google Forms to 226 SETs in Indonesia. Data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics. The results show that most of the SETs (66%) stated that they had faced barriers to distance learning that came from parents, students, and other teachers, as well as technical barriers. According to the SETs’ perceptions, some of the barriers that came from parents included lack of coordination and communication, limited use of mobile phones, and limited time for parents to accompany the students. The barriers coming from students were boredom and their lack of abilities. Furthermore, the barriers from the SETs themselves included difficulties in adapting material to online learning, difficulties in monitoring and evaluating student progress, and the lack of direction and coordination from schools. Other technical barriers were the frequent blackouts and insufficient internet signal.","Supratiwi, Mahardika; Yusuf, Munawir; Anggarani, Fadjri Kirana; en,",International Journal Of Pedagogy And Teacher Education,208,13

We aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of QSM and R2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical studies. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and multi-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were scanned five times at each “home” site and once at each of four other sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R2* maps were computed with the Multi-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm (https://github.com/fil-physics/Publication-Code). Results were assessed in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or by the MNI152 standard space. Results and Discussion Mean susceptibility (χ) and R2* values agreed broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site within-subject standard deviation was 0.001 – 0.005 ppm (χ) and 0.0005 – 0.001 ms-1 (R2*). For χ this is 2.1-4.8 fold better than 3T reports, and 1.1-3.4 fold better for R2*. The median ICC from within- and cross-site R2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Multi-echo QSM had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with large B0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across sites, R2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical structures due to differences in B0-shimming. On a between-subject level, our measured χ and R2* cross-site variance is comparable to within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol. Conclusion The harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers on average a 3-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for QSM and R2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site reproducibility at 3T. These protocols are ready for use in multi-site clinical studies at 7T.","Rua, Catarina; Clarke, William T; Driver, Ian D; Mougin, Olivier; Morgan, Andrew T.; Clare, Stuart; Francis, Susan; Muir, Keith; Wise, Richard; Carpenter, Adrian; Williams, Guy; Rowe, James B; Bowtell, Richard; Rodgers, Christopher T",bioRxiv,208,1

Several schools, colleges, and universities across the globe, as a result, have adopted the online mode of teaching. While the businesses and day-to-day activities were shutting down, eLearning tools and online education platforms saw considerable demand. Many institutions with digital infrastructure in place and prior distance teaching experience had a smoother transition from on-campus classes and lecturing to online teaching and learning. In contrast, for many, the transition involved challenges, including keeping students' motivation, interaction, and interest alive, in addition to adapting tools and technologies. This paper reports on students' engagement and motivation levels along with the learning curve during the online learning using a game-based digital quiz tool within a Human-Computer Interaction course in a university in Kosovo. The study investigates the effect of in-lecture quizzes in online classes and correlating the effect of students in the learning curve over four months. Two key motivation parameters-students' engagement and interaction - are compared and analyzed using two different online quiz platforms and the impact of its uses reflected in the learning curve. The results indicated a significant increase in students' engagement and interaction levels in lectures with systematic in-lecture quizzes. Further, the results show that the learning curve is steeper when using in-lecture quizzes (with 73%) in contrast to classes where in-lecture quizzes are not used (57.5%).","Nuci, K.

Numerical simulations are therefore deployed to account for the many factors influencing the disease spreading dynamics. Yet, the results from numerical simulations are often as complicated as the reality, leaving us with a sense of confusion about how the different factors account for the simulation results. Here, using a multi-type branching together with a graph tensor product approach, I derive a single equation for the effective reproductive number of an infectious disease outbreak. Using this equation I deconvolute the impact of crowd management, contact heterogeneity, testing, vaccination, mask use and smartphone tracing app use. This equation can be used to gain a basic understanding of infectious disease outbreaks and their simulations.","Vazquez, A.",,208,16

Here, we investigated whether persons vaccinated after a prior infection have better protection against future infection than those vaccinated without prior infection. Effect of prior infection was assessed in Qatar population, where the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Beta (B.1.351) variants dominate incidence, using two national retrospective, matched-cohort studies, one for the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine, and one for the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. Incidence rates of infection among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, with and without prior infection, were estimated, respectively, at 1.66 (95% CI: 1.26-2.18) and 11.02 (95% CI: 9.90-12.26) per 10,000 person-weeks.

It is unclear if antibody effector functions alone could protect against SARS-CoV-2. Here we isolated CV3-13, a non-neutralizing antibody from a convalescent individual with potent Fc-mediated effector functions that targeted the N- terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The cryo-EM structure of CV3-13 in complex with SAR-CoV-2 spike revealed that the antibody bound from a distinct angle of approach to a novel NTD epitope that partially overlapped with a frequently mutated NTD supersite in SARS-CoV-2 variants. While CV3-13 did not alter the replication dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model, an Fc-enhanced CV3-13 significantly delayed neuroinvasion and death in prophylactic settings. Thus, we demonstrate that efficient Fc-mediated effector functions can contribute to the in vivo efficacy of anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies in the absence of neutralization.","Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Chen, Yaozong; Ullah, Irfan; Prévost, Jérémie; Tolbert, William D.; Symmes, Kelly; Ding, Shilei; Benlarbi, Mehdi; Gong, Shang Yu; Tauzin, Alexandra; Gasser, Romain; Chatterjee, Debashree; Vézina, Dani; Goyette, Guillaume; Richard, Jonathan; Zhou, Fei; Stamatatos, Leonidas; McGuire, Andrew T.; Charest, Hughes; Roger, Michel; Pozharski, Edwin; Kumar, Priti; Mothes, Walther; Uchil, Pradeep D.; Pazgier, Marzena; Finzi, Andrés",bioRxiv,208,10

At the same time, Italy continues to position itself as a middle power, whose dominance in the Mediterranean is a natural result of its geographic position and national priorities. Currently traditional competition is aggravated by the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic for the world maritime economy. Rome expects that the EU's Green Deal and the EU Next Generation Plan will help Italy solve three problems: 1) to increase its own competitiveness in the transport and logistics system of the Mediterranean;2) to stimulate the development of the South of the country;3) to become a protagonist of the new EU normative power and leadership in the green transformation in the Mediterranean.

The empirical results verify the effectiveness of the monetary policy based on the real estate market and the asymmetrical effects of monetary policy and output on the real estate market. In addition, the smaller response of the real estate market to output in a low-speed growth regime means that negative shocks (e.g., COVID-19) from output have weak effects on the real estate market. Finally, monetary policy has bigger positive effects on the real estate market in a low-speed growth regime;thus, quantitative easing monetary policy can effectively stimulate China’s real estate market at present.","Zhang, Xiaoyu Pan Fanghui",Economic Modelling,208,28

Objectives: To compare and evaluate the prognostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and their derived immune-inflammatory indices (CRP/albumin (CRP/alb), lymphocyte/CRP (L/CRP), and lymphocyte/IL-6 (L/IL-6)) in COVID-19 patients. Methods: On admission, 85 confirmed COVID-19 patients' measured and collected laboratory data were obtained and compared. Results: Levels of CRP, IL-6 and CRP/alb were significantly higher (P=0.001) in severe patients and in non-survivors, but L/CRP and L/IL-6 were significantly lower (P=0.001). The best predictive performance for COVID-19 severity was observed at 1.65 for CRP/alb and 260.86 for L/CRP with 84.7% diagnostic accuracy for both. The best diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19 in-hospital mortality was 87.1% by IL-6 at 120 pg/ml and 85.9% by L/IL-6 at 5.40. The performance of the combined prediction was better than the single prediction by one biomarker. IL-6 was an independent risk factor associated with severe disease development (odds ratio (OR): 1.033; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.002-1.066). Conclusions: Pretreatment values of CRP, IL-6 and their derived indices could be included in the diagnostic work-up of COVID-19 to stratify disease severity and predict outcomes.","Taha, S.

Access to a safe, stable, and high quality food supply is often taken for granted by Canadians but it is one of the key roles that our agricultural industry serves and underlines why it is designated an essential service. Despite the federal government’s assurance that our nation’s food supply remains stable, concerns have been mounting from both consumers and the agricultural industry that disruptions in the food supply chain will cause food insecurity and severe economic distress. As a whole, Canada’s agri-food industry is well-positioned to adapt to the present crisis and continue supplying domestic and export markets. However, this does not mean that our food system is impermeable to disruption. In fact, challenges caused by COVID-19 have highlighted vulnerabilities in the food supply chain. Labour shortages, major shifts in consumer demand, and the slowdowns/closures at processing plants have already exacerbated food insecurity among Canadians and increased financial pressure on primary producers. As the foundation of the food supply chain, Canadian farmers are key to its stability. As many farms were experiencing severe economic hardship prior to the pandemic, the challenges of market uncertainty and increased production costs put these operations at greater financial risk. Policy action will be key to ensure the short and long-term viability of our primary industry and maintain the capacity to meet domestic and export market demands. Canada is still in the early stages of crisis management but government support of Canadian agriculture has been largely inadequate in alleviating the financial impact on farmers. The Canadian government must take immediate steps to alleviate the financial burden on primary producers, ensure export markets remain open and free from trade barriers, and commit to establishing a long-term agri-food strategy and action plan.","Holland, Kerri",The School of Public Policy Publications (SPPP),208,1

Out of various drug repurposing options, Remdesivir, and Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Lopinavir/Ritonavir were found to be the popular ones for treating COVID-19 patients across the world. Even though there are concerns regarding asymptotic patients, the most dominant symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough, followed by Dyspnoea and muscle ache. This review concludes that the COVID-19 related research should focus on developing immunity vaccines, and repurposing of drugs. Research on the problems of quarantine life, patient monitoring, and usage of information technology in facing COVID-19 will improve the quality of patient handling during the pandemic. The research on the effectiveness of various models of lockdown and regulation of social life during lockdown periods, improving the safety of health care workers in the workplace will definitely help the governments in their fight against COVID-19.","Singh, Sanjeet; Jayaram, R.",J.

In addition to the baseline complexity that arises from the notion that genetic information can interact in a nonlinear way, recent studies have revealed that interactions can change as a function of environmental context. Here I propose the fusion of measurements of the effect of mutations and physiological epistasis with the reaction norm, a central abstraction used to depict genotype by environment interactions. In doing so, I formalize the notion of a “mutation effect reaction norm” (MERN) as an instrument through which one can analyze or depict the phenotypic consequences of interactions between mutations across environmental contexts. I demonstrate its utility through a discussion of the signature of mutations that undermine reverse evolution of antimicrobial resistance. In closing, I argue that the mutation effect reaction norm may help us resolve the dynamism of evolution across fitness seascapes through specific insight into how mutation effects and interactions are modulated by environmental context.","Ogbunugafor, C.

The PPIs range from the initial binding of viral coat proteins to host membrane receptors to the hijacking of host transcription machinery. However, few interspecies PPIs have been identified, because experimental methods including mass spectrometry are time-consuming and expensive, and molecular dynamic simulation is limited only to the proteins whose 3D structures are solved. Sequence-based machine learning methods are expected to overcome these problems. We have first developed the LSTM model with word2vec to predict PPIs between human and virus, named LSTM-PHV, by using amino acid sequences alone. The LSTM-PHV effectively learnt the training data with a highly imbalanced ratio of positive to negative samples and achieved an AUC of 0.976 with an accuracy of 98.4% using 5-fold cross-validation. By using independent test dataset, we compared the LSTM-PHV with existing state-of-the-art PPI predictors including DeepViral. In predicting PPIs between human and unknown or new virus, the LSTM-PHV presented higher performance than the existing predictors when they were trained by multiple host protein-including datasets. LSTM-PHV learnt multiple host protein sequence contexts more efficiently than the DeepViral. Interestingly, learning of only sequence contexts as words presented remarkably high performances. Use of uniform manifold approximation and projection demonstrated that the LSTM-PHV clearly distinguished the positive PPI samples from the negative ones. We presented the LSTM-PHV online web server that is freely available at http://kurata35.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/.","Tsukiyama, Sho; Hasan, Md Mehedi; Fujii, Satoshi; Kurata, Hiroyuki",bioRxiv,208,6

These meetings have largely been held in-person with rapid proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees. Yet the format and quality of their organization lag behind what is possible and as a result, the current experience of attending conferences in many disciplines remains unchanged in many respects. We created a database of 270 national and international academic conferences held in-person during 2018-2019 in various disciplines and examined them for their features, costs and impact on the community. We found that many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and importantly, reducing the meetings’ carbon footprint. It is important to accelerate and mandate efforts to improve conferences so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We discuss a combination of approaches and recommendations to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet. “They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.” — Andy Warhol","Sarabipour, Sarvenaz; Khan, Aziz; Seah, Samantha; Mwakilili, Aneth D.; Mumoki, Fiona N.; Sáez, Pablo J.; Schwessinger, Benjamin; Debat, Humberto J.; Mestrovic, Tomislav",bioRxiv,208,1

Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. METHODS: A search was conducted across EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by relevant grey-literature and ClinicalTrials.gov. All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. Further analysis of available safety data from phase 2 and 3 studies was undertaken. Data extracted were adverse events (AEs) grade 1–4, serious AEs and discontinuation for AEs. Specific AEs of interest highlighted in early-phase studies, including gastrointestinal AEs and hyperuricaemia, were also examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. Six were phase 2 and 3 studies reporting relevant safety data for statistical comparison, representing a total of 4299 participants, an estimated 175 person-years-of-follow-up (PYFU). Comparator drugs were oseltamivir, umifenovir, lopinavir/ritonavir or placebo. Study follow-up was between 5 and 21 days. The proportions of grade 1–4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% vs 28.4% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% vs 1.2% (P = n.s.) in the comparison arms. For serious AEs the proportion was 0.4% in both arms (P = n.s.). There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir vs comparators [8.7% vs 11.5%; P = 0.003]. Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001]. CONCLUSIONS: Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. However, safety concerns remain: hyperuricaemia, teratogenicity and QTc prolongation have not yet been adequately studied. Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.","Pilkington, Victoria; Pepperrell, Toby; Hill, Andrew",,208,17

The purposes of this study were to identify which retinal neurons are infected and to determine the routes by which MCMV spreads in the retina. METHODS Immunosuppressed (IS) BALB/c mice were inoculated with 5 x 10(3) PFU of MCMV (k181) through the supraciliary route. Injected eyes were collected at several times after inoculation, sectioned, and examined by electron microscopy and by staining for retinal cell antigens and for MCMV early (EA) or late (LA) antigen. RESULTS MCMV-infected cells were observed in the choroid and RPE by day 3 after infection (PI) and in the inner retina beginning at day 5 PI. At this time, many horizontal and bipolar cells were MCMV-antigen-positive but only rare MCMV-infected amacrine cells (glycine positive or gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] positive) or MCMV-infected ganglion cells (NF positive) were observed in the inner retina. At day 10 PI, most virus-infected cells were glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)- and GABA-positive glia. Virions were observed by electron microscopy in the choroid, RPE, and inner nuclear layer of the retina. Although virions were observed in the endothelium of the retinal vessels and the nearby retinal cells, the endothelial cell lining of the retinal vessels remained intact. Both apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were seen in the inner retina. CONCLUSIONS In the inner retina, horizontal and bipolar cells were the early (< or = day 7 PI) targets of MCMV infection. Virus spread from the RPE and the photoreceptor layer to the inner retina through infected Muller cells and within the inner retina horizontally through infected horizontal cells.","Zhang, Ming; Xin, Hua; Roon, Penny; Atherton, Sally S",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,208,16

This dipeptide might be part of a hinge region (HR) that facilitates interdomain movements and thereby regulates (in time and space) autoprocessing of replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab at eight sites that are conserved in arteriviruses. To test this hypothesis, we characterized nsp4 proteinase mutants carrying either point mutations in the putative HR domain or a large deletion in the CTD. When tested in a reverse genetics system, three groups of mutants were recognized (wild-type-like, debilitated, and dead), which was in line with the expected impact of mutations on HR flexibility. When tested in a transient expression system, the effects of the mutations on the production and turnover of replicase proteins varied widely. They were cleavage product specific and revealed a pronounced modulating effect of moieties derived from the nsp1-3 region of pp1a. Mutations that were lethal affected the efficiency of polyprotein autoprocessing most strongly. These mutants may be impaired in the accumulation of nsp5-7 and/or suffer from delayed or otherwise perturbed processing at the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 junctions. On average, the production of nsp7-8 seems to be the most resistant to debilitating nsp4 mutations. Our results further prove that the CTD is essential for a vital nsp4 property other than catalysis.","van Aken, Danny; Snijder, Eric J; Gorbalenya, Alexander E",Journal of virology,208,1

Patients and methods Hospital records of all cases, where lipase levels were measured, and the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test due to SARS-CoV-2 was found positive, were retrospectively investigated. Of 127 COVID-19 patients tested for lipase, 20 (15.7%) had serum lipase levels above the upper laboratory limit. The patient group with the ""high lipase level"" was created from these subjects, and the rest constituted the ""control"" group. Results While body mass index (BMI) levels were higher in the high lipase group, (p=0.014), the number of those with pre-existing diabetes mellitus (DM) was also found higher in the high lipase group than the controls (p=0.002). The history of DM was detected to increase the risk of developing high lipase level 4.63 times higher. Only two patients were diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP). While oxygen saturations on admission (p=0.019) and discharge (p=0.011) were lower in the high lipase group than the controls, amylase (p<0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.002) and D-dimer (p=0.004) levels were found higher. In addition, more patients required the treatment in intensive care unit in the high lipase group, compared to the controls (p=0.027). Accordingly, time of hospital stay became also prolonged (p=0.003). Conclusions Pancreatic injuries or even AP may develop during SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those with pre-existing DM. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes is important in COVID-19 patients, especially with pre-existing DM.","Akkus, C; Yilmaz, H; Mizrak, S; Adibelli, Z; Akdas, O; Duran, C",Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,208,1

METHODS A 12-min RFA was modelled using a cooled electrode (17G, 3 cm tip) inserted in hepatic tissue. The short (transverse) diameter of the coagulation zone was assessed under in vivo (with blood perfusion (BP) and considering clamping) and ex vivo (at 21 °C) conditions. The computer results obtained by programming voltage pulses were compared with current pulses. RESULTS The differences between voltage and current pulses were noticeable: using current instead of voltage allows larger coagulation zones to be created, due to the higher energy applied by current pulses. If voltage pulses are employed the model can accurately predict the number of roll-offs, although the waveform of the applied power is clearly not realistic. If current voltages are employed, the applied power waveform matches well with those reported experimentally, but there are significantly fewer roll-offs. Our computer results were overall into the ranges of experimental ones. CONCLUSIONS The proposed models reproduce reasonably well the electrical-thermal performance and coagulation zone size obtained during an impedance-controlled pulsing protocol.","Trujillo, Macarena; Bon, Jose; José Rivera, María; Burdío, Fernando; Berjano, Enrique","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",208,20

This study was conducted in the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka with clinically COVID-19 suspected patients. This cross sectional study was performed from July 7 to August 7, 2020 where both chest HRCT and RT-PCR test were included, keeping RT-PCR as the reference standard. Of the 114 patients 104(91.22%) patients had ground glass opacities (with no consolidation), 50(43.85%) patients had ground glass opacity and consolidation. Along with ground glass opacities 60(52.63%) patients had associated crazy paving appearance, 44(39.59%) patients had reverse halo sign, 76(66.66%) patients had vascular thickening and 60(52.63%) patients had fibrotic shadows.

Here we show that Hantaan virus (HTNV), which belongs to the Bunyaviridae family (genus Hantavirus) and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, productively infects human DCs in vitro. In the course of HTNV infection, DCs did not show any cytopathic effect and viral replication did not induce cell lysis or apoptosis. Furthermore, HTNV did not affect apoptosis-inducing signals that are important for the homeostatic control of mature DCs. In contrast to immunosuppressive viruses, e.g., human cytomegalovirus, HTNV activated immature DCs, resulting in upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), costimulatory, and adhesion molecules. Intriguingly, strong upregulation of MHC class I molecules and an increased intercellular cell adhesion molecule type 1 expression was also detected on HTNV-infected endothelial cells. In addition, antigen uptake by HTNV-infected DCs was reduced, another characteristic feature of DC maturation. Consistent with these findings, we observed that HTNV-infected DCs stimulated T cells as efficiently as did mature DCs. Finally, infection of DCs with HTNV induced the release of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and alpha interferon. Taken together, our findings indicate that hantavirus-infected DCs may significantly contribute to hantavirus-associated pathogenesis.","Raftery, Martin J; Kraus, Annette A; Ulrich, Rainer; Krüger, Detlev H; Schönrich, Günther",Journal of virology,208,1

Among them enteric diseases due to strains of Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the most commonly occurring form of colibacillosis in newborn calves. Specific antibodies against whole ETEC cells and total immunoglobulin G in dam serum, colostrum and calf serum were determined. There were significant differences (P=0.0005) between antibody titers in normal and diarrheic groups, in which diarrheic group had a higher titer. Total IgG concentration in diarrheic calves (20.86 ± 0.49), their dams (23.48 ± 0.54) and colostrum (33.40 ± 0.50) was less than normal group (P=0.0005). There was a highly significant positive correlation between dam total IgG with calf total IgG (r=0.022; ratio=52.11).

Anti-E. coli antibody in calf serum had a highly significant negative correlati with total IgG of dam serum, colostrum and calf serum. While the level of anti-E. coli antibodies in diarrheic group was considerably higher than normal group, our findings reported here are in agreement that immunity to diarrhea also might be correlated with maternal cells or cellular components as well as cytokines which are transferred by colostrum to neonatal calves. Nevertheless, the level of maternally derived antibodies is a promising indicator for passive immunity and protection against diarrhea in neonatal calves.","Al-Alo, K Z K; Nikbakht Brujeni, Gh; Lotfollahzadeh, S; Moosakhani, F; Gharabaghi, A",Iranian journal of veterinary research,208,1

Among various approaches supraclavicular approach is the most consistent method for anaesthesia and postoperative pain management in surgery below the elbow joint. Many drugs are used as adjuvants in brachial plexus block for faster onset, denser block and for prolongation of postoperative analgesia. Dexmedetomidine also has been shown to prolong the sensory and motor duration when added as an adjuvant to local anaesthetic in nerve blocks. Objective To assess the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to ropivacaine in brachial block. Method Sixty patients, planned for upper limb surgeries under ultrasound guided brachial block were randomly allocated into two groups. Group RS (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 1 ml Normal Saline and Group RD (n=30) received 30 ml of 0.5% Ropivacaine + 0.75 mcg/kg Dexmedetomidine diluted to 1 ml solution. The onset time to sensory and motor blockade were recorded. The duration of sensory and motor block and duration of analgesia were recorded. Result The mean time to onset of sensory block (12.60±2.67 min Vs 22.17±2.81 min) and motor block (14.20±3.22 min Vs 22.53±3.97) in Group RD was significantly faster in Group RD than Group RS. The mean duration of sensory block (838.70±164.11 min Vs 670.20±145.16 min), motor block (804.16±148.71 min Vs 594.93±53.89 min) and duration of analgesia (1193.80±223.11 min Vs 828.23±136.30 min) were significantly longer in Group RD compared to Group RS. The incidence of side effects in both groups were comparable. Conclusion From this study, it can be concluded that addition of Dexmedetomidine 0.75 mcg/ kg to 0.5% Ropivacaine results in early onset of sensory and motor blockade, prolongation of duration of sensory and motor blockade and duration of analgesia postoperatively without any significant side effects.","Sharma, S; Shrestha, A; Koirala, M",Kathmandu University medical journal,208,30

The patient, a researcher in a university laboratory, had been working along with other members of the laboratory group with a pigmentation-negative (pgm-) attenuated Y. pestis strain (KIM D27). The strain had not been known to have caused laboratory-acquired infections or human fatalities. Other researchers in a separate university laboratory facility in the same building had contact with a virulent Y. pestis strain (CO92) that is considered a select biologic agent; however, the pgm- attenuated KIM D27 is excluded from the National Select Agent Registry. The university, CDPH, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), and CDC conducted an investigation to ascertain the cause of death. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which determined that the cause of death likely was an unrecognized occupational exposure (route unknown) to Y. pestis, leading to septic shock. Y. pestis was isolated from premortem blood cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) identified the clinical isolate as a pgm- strain of Y. pestis. Postmortem examination revealed no evidence of pneumonic plague. A postmortem diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis was made on the basis of histopathologic, laboratory, and genetic testing. One possible explanation for the unexpected fatal outcome in this patient is that hemochromatosis-induced iron overload might have provided the infecting KIM D27 strain, which is attenuated as a result of defects in its ability to acquire iron, with sufficient iron to overcome its iron-acquisition defects and become virulent. Researchers should adhere to recommended biosafety practices when handling any live bacterial cultures, even attenuated strains, and institutional biosafety committees should implement and maintain effective surveillance systems to detect and monitor unexpected acute illness in laboratory workers.",,MMWR.

To date, most studies have been inadequately powered to explore differences in the infrequent post-operative complications following thyroidectomy. This study is designed to compare the outcomes of sutureless thyroidectomy and conventional thyroidectomy for recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury, permanent hypoparathyroidism, and haematoma formation. METHODS A cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing total thyroidectomy using conventional versus sutureless techniques was performed. Sutureless thyroidectomy was performed using either Ligasure Precise (Covidien) or Harmonic Focus (Johnson and Johnson) devices. The primary outcome measures were post-operative haemorrhage, permanent RLN injury and hypoparathyroidism. Secondary outcome measures were operative time, temporary hypoparathyroidism and vocal cord dysfunction. A cost minimization analysis comparing the two techniques was performed. RESULT From January 2006 to July 2009, 1935 consecutive patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Of these, 772 underwent conventional thyroidectomy and 1163 were performed using a sutureless technique. The mean operative time was significantly lower in the sutureless group (71 versus 86 min, P = 0.02). There was no difference in the post-operative complications of haematoma (0.78% conventional versus 1.12% sutureless, P = 0.46), permanent hypoparathyroidism (1.30% conventional versus 0.52% sutureless, P = 0.06) or permanent RLN injury (0.26% conventional versus 0.52% sutureless, P = 0.39). There was an overall cost saving of AUD$14,300 per 100 total thyroidectomy cases performed using the sutureless technique. CONCLUSIONS Sutureless thyroidectomy is a safe and efficient way of performing total thyroidectomy and has the potential to reduce operating room costs.","Chang, Ling-Yun; O'Neill, Christine; Suliburk, James; Sidhu, Stan; Delbridge, Leigh; Sywak, Mark",ANZ journal of surgery,208,9

It is shared for signaling by a variety of adaptive and innate immune receptors as well as cytokine receptors. Previous studies examining conditional TRAF3-deficient mouse models that have the Traf3 gene specifically deleted in B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes have revealed the diverse and critical in vivo functions of TRAF3 in adaptive immunity. Although in vitro evidence points to a pivotal and indispensable role for TRAF3 in type I interferon production induced by pattern recognition receptors in macrophages and dendritic cells, the in vivo functions of TRAF3 in the innate immune system had long remained unclear. Three laboratories have recently addressed this gap in knowledge by investigating myeloid cell-specific TRAF3-deficient (genotype: TRAF3flox/floxLysM+/Cre) mice. The new evidence together demonstrates that specific ablation of TRAF3 in myeloid cells leads to inflammatory diseases, altered progression of diabetes, and spontaneous development of different types of tumors and infections in mice. These new findings indicate that TRAF3 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor and is required for optimal innate immunity in myeloid cells. Strikingly, the new evidence also identifies TRAF3 as a novel tumor suppressor gene in macrophages and other myeloid cells. In this review, we discuss and summarize the new findings and current knowledge about the multi-faceted regulatory roles and complex signaling mechanisms of myeloid cell TRAF3 in inflammation, innate immunity, and tumor development.","Lalani, Almin I; Luo, Chang; Han, Yeming; Xie, Ping",Macrophage,208,1

RNA interference has emerged as a powerful tool to gain insight into gene function. For this purpose, lentiviral vectors that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) into mammalian cells represent a powerful tool to achieve stable gene silencing. In order to interfere with DC-SIGN function, we developed shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors capable of conditionally suppressing DC-SIGN expression. Selectivity of inhibition of human DC-SIGN and L-SIGN and chimpanzee and rhesus macaque DC-SIGN was obtained by using distinct siRNAs. Suppression of DC-SIGN expression inhibited the attachment of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 to DC-SIGN transfectants, as well as transfer of HIV-1 to target cells in trans. Furthermore, shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors were capable of efficiently suppressing DC-SIGN expression in primary human DCs. DC-SIGN-negative DCs were unable to enhance transfer of HIV-1 infectivity to T cells in trans, demonstrating an essential role for the DC-SIGN receptor in transferring infectious viral particles from DCs to T cells. The present system should have broad applications for studying the function of DC-SIGN in the pathogenesis of HIV as well as other pathogens also recognized by this receptor.","Arrighi, Jean-François; Pion, Marjorie; Wiznerowicz, Maciej; Geijtenbeek, Teunis B; Garcia, Eduardo; Abraham, Shahnaz; Leuba, Florence; Dutoit, Valérie; Ducrey-Rundquist, Odile; van Kooyk, Yvette; Trono, Didier; Piguet, Vincent",Journal of virology,208,1

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of underlying diseases and associated comorbidities in COVID-19 patients using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Major biomedical electronic databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched for all relevant literature published in English from January to July 2020. Cross-sectional and retrospective studies reporting the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as acute cardiac injury, acute myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, shock, acute respiratory disease, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. After selecting eligible studies, two authors extracted data of each study, independently, and any inconsistency was resolved through discussion with the third reviewer until reaching a consensus. The risk of bias was assessed by two independent research experts using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The variance in the meta-analyses on prevalence was stabilized by double arcsine transformations. Results The pooled prevalence of acute respiratory injury in patients with COVID-19 was estimated as 34% (95% Cl: 10 - 57%). Also, the prevalence of acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and shock were estimated as 10% (95% Cl: 6 - 14%), 19% (95% Cl: 10 - 27%), 23 % (95% Cl: 19 - 27%), and 12 % (95% Cl: 5 - 19 %).

We have analyzed the interaction of measles virus with cell surface proteins, using an overlay binding assay with cellular proteins immobilized on nitrocellulose. Among surface-biotinylated proteins from a human rectal tumor cell line (HRT), measles virus was able to bind only to a 67-kDa protein that was identified as MCP. The virus recognized different isoforms of MCP expressed from human (HRT and HeLa) and simian (Vero) cell lines. The binding of measles virus to MCP was abolished after cleavage of the disulfide bonds by reducing agents as well as after enzymatic release of N-linked oligosaccharides. By contrast, removal of sialic acid or O-linked oligosaccharides did not affect the recognition of MCP measles virus. These data indicate that the receptor determinant of MCP is dependent on a conformation of the protein that is maintained by disulfide bonds and N-glycans present in the complement binding domains. Our results are consistent with a role of MCP as primary attachment site for measles virus in the initial stage of an infection. The functional relationship between MCP and moesin in a measles virus infection is discussed.","Maisner, A; Schneider-Schaulies, J; Liszewski, M K; Atkinson, J P; Herrler, G",Journal of virology,208,31

Most plans have focused on minimizing impact by containing the virus through quarantine, but quarantine has not been used widely in the United States and little is known about what would be the public's response. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that influence an individual's decision to comply with a hypothetical avian influenza quarantine order. METHODS A total of 1204 adult Pennsylvania residents participated in a random digit dial telephone sample. The residents were interviewed regarding their attitudes about and knowledge of avian influenza and about compliance with quarantine orders, including staying at home or traveling to a government-designated facility. RESULTS Analysis of variance showed differences among demographic groups in willingness to comply with quarantine orders, with women and individuals not presently employed more willing to stay at home or to travel to a government-designated facility if ordered. Those who did not regularly attend religious services were significantly less willing than those who did attend regularly to comply with any type of quarantine order. Regression analysis indicated that demographic variables, overall knowledge of avian influenza, attitudes about its severity, and the belief that the respondent and/or his or her significant other(s) may contract it were predictive.

Nasal congestion may also affect personal well-being and quality of life. Furthermore, as the nasal mucosa is the first part of the airways in contact with the environment, objective evaluation of nasal congestion or nasal patency is important. Systematic evaluation of nasal patency was described in the last part of the 19th century by Zwaardemaker. Measurement of the pressure drop over the nasal cavity at a passive dow has been described in 1903 by Courtade and is one of first descriptions rhinomanometry. The technique is still in use and computer technology has made the measurements much easier but the method has not yet been accepted for wide clinical use. METHODOLOGY Acoustic methods have also been used for evaluation of nasal patency. A qualitative method was the hum-test by Spiess (1902), where external occlusion of the nonocciuded side of the nasal cavity is experienced as a change in the timbre of the sound during humming. Acoustic reflections have been used in geophysical investigations especially with regard to search for oil. The use of acoustic reflections from the airways gained special interest in 1960-70 for determining the geometry of the vocal tract shape with regard to speech reconstruction. A method described by A. Jackson (1977) was adopted and for the first time applied to the nasal cavity. The method for determining the cross-sectional area as function of distance in the airways by acoustic reflections is impulse or relatively simple. The incident sound pseudorandom noise in the audible frequency range is compared with the response - the reflections from the airways. Intuitively, if the size of the entrance to the airways is known, the size of the reflections may represent changes of the airway size and the time between reflections may give the distance between the changes, dependent on the speed of sound. In this way it is possible to determine the area as function of distance in the airways. The technique has some assumptions and the major effort has been to validate use in the nose and elucidate aspects with regard to sound loss in the airways and resolution. Therefore, the acoustic reflection technique - named acoustic rhinometry - was compared with other methods like MRI, CT, and rhinomanometry. Allergic and nonallergic subjects were also compared. RESULTS Acoustic rhinometry showed reasonable correlation with CT in a cadaver and in 10 subjects in comparison with MRI for the first 6 cm of the nasal cavity. Models based on MRI scannings of subjects also showed good correlation for the first 6 cm of the nasal cavity. Posteriorly in the nasal cavity and the epipharynx, differences were found mainly due to 'sound loss' to the paranasal sinuses. Sound loss due to viscous loss or friction at increasing surface/area ratio (the complex geometry in the nose) and loss due to nonrigidity the nasal mucosa were also examined. Neither these factors affected the area-distance function significantly. Acoustic rhinometry seems to reflect the area-distance function in the nose reasonably accurately. In allergic subjects acoustic rhinometry has been used to evaluate hypersensitivity. More pronounced spontaneous variation in nasal mucosa congestion was found in patients suffering from hay fever compared to nonallergic subjects. Furthermore, a tendency to a more swollen mucosa in the allergic subjects compared to the normal state, and increased sensitivity to histamine was found. This and reduction in swelling of the mucosa in allergic subjects during nasal steroid treatment out of the pollen season indicate an ongoing inflammatory process or hypersensitivity in allergic subjects out ot the pollen season. During allergen challenge the change in nasal cavity dimension as well as inflammation may affect olfaction in hay fever patients. DISCUSSION Acoustic rhinometry has not only been used to examine hay fever patients but in many different aspects of rhinology. Since the introduction of the acoustic reflection technique in the nose more than papers using the technique have been published. Most of the papers find the technique valuable for evaluation of nasal patency. Fortunately, some critical papers have drawn attention to some practical aspects of the technique. Standard operating procedures, and calibration checks as well as training operators will enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of results. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES A decade after its introduction acoustic rhinometry is a well-established method for evaluation of nasal patency, but further improvement can be obtained by continued validation and adjustments of the technique.","Hilberg, Ole",Allergy,208,1

The CLEIA was established with an optical combination of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against SARS CoV N protein prepared from mice immunized with recombinant N protein without cultivating the virus. The capture and detecting MAbs of the CLEIA reacted to the carboxyl-terminal and amino-terminal peptides of the N protein, respectively. The CLEIA was capable of detecting recombinant N protein at 1.56 pg/ml and viral N protein in SARS CoV cell culture lysates at 0.087 of 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml.

One drug that has shown promising results in vitro is nitazoxanide. Unlike other postulated drugs, nitazoxanide shows a high ratio of maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), after 1 day of 500 mg twice daily (BD), to the concentration required to inhibit 50% replication (EC50) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Cmax : EC50 roughly equal to 14:1). As such, it is important to investigate the safety of nitazoxanide for further trials. Furthermore, treatments for COVID-19 should be cheap to promote global access, but prices of many drugs are far higher than the costs of production. We aimed to conduct a review of the safety of nitazoxanide for any prior indication and calculate its minimum costs of production. Methods A review of nitazoxanide clinical research was conducted using EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, supplemented by ClinicalTrials.gov. We searched for phase 2 or 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nitazoxanide with placebo or active control for 5-14 days in participants experiencing acute infections of any kind. Data extracted were grade 1-4 and serious adverse events (AEs). Data were also extracted on gastrointestinal (GI) AEs, as well as hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects.Active pharmaceutical ingredient cost data from 2016 to 2019 were extracted from the Panjiva database and adjusted for 5% loss during production, costs of excipients, formulation, a 10% profit margin and tax. Two dosages, at 500 mg BD and a higher dose of 1100 mg three times daily (TDS), were considered. Our estimated costs were compared with publicly available list prices from a selection of countries. Results Nine RCTs of nitazoxanide were identified for inclusion. These RCTs accounted for 1514 participants and an estimated 95.3 person-years-of-follow-up. No significant differences were found in any of the AE endpoints assessed, across all trials or on subgroup analyses of active- or placebo-controlled trials. Mild GI AEs increased with dose. No hepatorenal or cardiovascular concerns were raised, but few appropriate metrics were reported. There were no teratogenic concerns, but the evidence base was very limited.Based on a weighted-mean cost of US $61/kg, a 14-day course of treatment with nitazoxanide 500 mg BD would cost $1.41. The daily cost would therefore be $0.10. The same 14-day course could cost $3944 in US commercial pharmacies, and $3 per course in Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. At a higher dose of 1100 mg TDS, our estimated cost was $4.08 per 14-day course, equivalent to $0.29 per day. Conclusion Nitazoxanide demonstrates a good safety profile at approved doses. However, further evidence is required regarding hepatorenal and cardiovascular effects, as well as teratogenicity. We estimate that it would be possible to manufacture nitazoxanide as generic for $1.41 for a 14-day treatment course at 500 mg BD, up to $4.08 at 1100 mg TDS. Further trials in COVID-19 patients should be initiated. If efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated in clinical studies, nitazoxanide may represent a safe and affordable treatment in the ongoing pandemic.","Pepperrell, Toby; Pilkington, Victoria; Owen, Andrew; Wang, Junzheng; Hill, Andrew M",Journal of virus eradication,208,1

The humanized mAb Synagis (palivizumab), which is still the only mAb against a viral disease approved by the US FDA, has been widely used as a prophylactic measure against respiratory syncytial virus infections in neonates and immunocompromised individuals. The first fully human mAbs against two other paramyxoviruses, Hendra and Nipah virus, which can cause high (up to 75%) mortality, were recently developed; one of them, m101, showed exceptional potency against infectious virus. In an amazing pace of research, several potent human mAbs targeting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S glycoprotein that can affect infections in animal models have been developed months after the virus was identified in 2003. A potent humanized mAb with therapeutic potential was recently developed against the West Nile virus. The progress in developing neutralizing human mAbs against Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, vaccinia and other emerging and biodefense-related viruses is slow. A major problem in the development of effective therapeutic agents against viruses, including therapeutic antibodies, is the viruses' heterogeneity and mutability. A related problem is the low binding affinity of crossreactive antibodies able to neutralize a variety of primary isolates. Combinations of mAbs or mAbs with other drugs, and/or the identification of potent new mAbs and their derivatives that target highly conserved viral structures, which are critical for virus entry into cells, are some of the possible solutions to these problems, and will continue to be a major focus of antiviral research.","Zhu, Zhongyu; Dimitrov, Antony S; Chakraborti, Samitabh; Dimitrova, Dimana; Xiao, Xiaodong; Broder, Christopher C; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,208,1

Reduced necessity for a physical presence of the patient within the healthcare setting is of particular benefit in the current COVID-19 era. It is also of benefit to a diverse group of patients, for example: those who are geographically distant from the base hospital, those suffering from mobility issues or chronic illness, those who require chaperoning as well as those with limited access to transport. We have developed guidelines for the use of the medical telecommunications platform, Attend Anywhere, which has been utilised across the English and Scottish National Health Services, as well as with the Australian Health service, and is now available in Health Service Executive (HSE) settings. Herein we describe and recommend a process that we have found helpful, and we propose guidelines on how a Health Care Worker (HCW) might consider approaching a virtual consultation when initiating and safely executing a patient encounter on Attend Anywhere, in a secure and efficient manner. The guidelines were created following review of the literature on previous experience by others with this software, as well as recent guidance published by the Irish Medical Council. A proportion of this guidance is transferable to other platforms. Methods We also undertook a short survey of our patients and physicians in Sligo University Hospital, who used Attend Anywhere over a six-week period to gauge their satisfaction levels with the experience., We estimated distance that our patients would have travelled for their appointment had the traditional face-to-face consultation been carried out. We noted whether we considered the medium appropriate for the patient consultations. Results 53 patients took part and satisfaction was rated from satisfied to very satisfied on a 3-point scale for all stakeholders. In addition, we found that remote consultation, when compared to face-to-face consultation, alleviated an average of 144km of unnecessary travel per appointment. Remote consultation was deemed appropriate in all cases and no rescheduled face-to-face appointments were required due to failure of the consultation due to difficulties encountered. Conclusion The authors recommend the implementation of the described guidance, with suggested Checklist, Information leaflet and Consent form, as a means of ensuring the confidentiality of the consultation and to ensure that processes are adhered to that optimise protection for both the patient and the clinician, while reducing the burden of attendance to the healthcare location.","Skelly, J R; O'Connor, T",Irish medical journal,208,26

Recently, three SARS-CoV-2 lineages, B.1.1.7 (501Y.V1), B.1.351 (501Y.V2) and B.1.1.28.1 (P.1), have emerged in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, respectively. Here, we have presented global viewpoint on implications of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants based on structural-function impact of crucial mutations occurring in its spike (S), ORF8 and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. While the N501Y mutation was observed in all three lineages, the 501Y.V1 and P.1 accumulated a different set of mutations in the S protein. The missense mutational effects were predicted through a COVID-19 dedicated resource followed by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Current findings indicate that some mutations in the S protein might lead to higher affinity with host receptors and resistance against antibodies, but not all are due to different antibody binding (epitope) regions. Mutations may, however, result in diagnostic tests failures and possible interference with binding of newly identified anti-viral candidates against SARS-CoV-2, likely necessitating roll out of recurring ""flu-like shots"" annually for tackling COVID-19. The functional relevance of these mutations has been described in terms of modulation of host tropism, antibody resistance, diagnostic sensitivity and therapeutic candidates. Besides global economic losses, post-vaccine reinfections with emerging variants can have significant clinical, therapeutic and public health impacts.","Singh, Jasdeep; Samal, Jasmine; Kumar, Vipul; Sharma, Jyoti; Agrawal, Usha; Ehtesham, Nasreen Z; Sundar, Durai; Rahman, Syed Asad; Hira, Subhash; Hasnain, Seyed E",Viruses,208,21

While ecological studies show higher burdens of COVID-19 mortality in areas with higher rates of poverty, little is known about social determinants of COVID-19 mortality at the individual level. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimated the proportions of COVID-19 deaths by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbid conditions using their reported univariate proportions among COVID-19 deaths and correlations among these variables in the general population from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We used these proportions to randomly sample individuals from NHANES. We analyzed the distributions of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity, income, education level, and veteran status. We analyzed the association of these characteristics with mortality by logistic regression. Summary demographics of deaths include mean age 71.6 years, 45.9% female, and 45.1% non-Hispanic white. We found that disproportionate deaths occurred among individuals with nonwhite race/ethnicity (54.8% of deaths, 95% CI 49.0%-59.6%, p < 0.001), individuals with income below the median (67.5%, 95% CI 63.4%-71.5%, p < 0.001), individuals with less than a high school level of education (25.6%, 95% CI 23.4% -27.9%, p < 0.001), and veterans (19.5%, 95% CI 15.8%-23.4%, p < 0.001). Except for veteran status, these characteristics are significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality in multiple logistic regression. Limitations include the lack of institutionalized people in the sample (e.g., nursing home residents and incarcerated persons), the need to use comorbidity data collected from outside the US, and the assumption of the same correlations among variables for the noninstitutionalized population and COVID-19 decedents. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial inequalities in COVID-19 mortality are likely, with disproportionate burdens falling on those who are of racial/ethnic minorities, are poor, have less education, and are veterans. Healthcare systems must ensure adequate access to these groups. Public health measures should specifically reach these groups, and data on social determinants should be systematically collected from people with COVID-19.","Seligman, Benjamin; Ferranna, Maddalena; Bloom, David E",PLoS Med,208,16

Pregnant women are at risk of infection. The present study examined the frequency of washing hands with soap and wearing face mask when going out, prevalence of depression and anxiety, and identified their associated factors among pregnant women during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 24 February and 3 March 2020. A total of 15 428 pregnant women who were using maternal health care services in China completed a questionnaire which assessed their socio-demographic and pregnancy-related characteristics, contextual, cognitive and social factors related to COVID-19, frequency of washing hands and wearing face masks, and depression and anxiety. Logistics regression analyses were performed to identify the associated factors of preventive behaviours and mental health. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable anxiety and depression was 28.2% and 43.6% respectively. 19.8% reported always wearing face mask when going out, and 19.1% reported washing hands with soap for more than 10 times per day. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that older age was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (OR = 0.42-0.67) and higher frequency of washing hands (OR = 1.57-3.40). Higher level of education level was associated with probable depression (OR = 1.31-1.45) and higher frequency of wearing face mask (OR = 1.50-1.57). After adjusting for significant socio-demographic and pregnancy-related factors, place of residence being locked down (aOR = 1.10-1.11), being quarantined (aOR = 1.42-1.57), personally knowing someone being infected with COVID-19 (aOR = 1.80-1.92), perception that COVID-19 would pose long term physical harm to human (aOR = 1.25-1.28) were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety, while the perception that the disease will be under control in the coming month was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aOR = 0.59-0.63) and lower tendency of always wearing face mask (aOR = 0.85). Social support was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety (aOR = 0.86-0,87) and higher frequency of washing hands (aOR = 1.06).

Herein, we assessed the impact of COVID-19 on subthreshold depressive symptoms and identified potential mitigating factors. METHODS: Participants were from Depression Cohort in China (ChiCTR registry number 1900022145). Adults (n = 1722) with subthreshold depressive symptoms were enrolled between March and October 2019 in a 6-month, community-based interventional study that aimed to prevent clinical depression using psychoeducation. A total of 1506 participants completed the study in Shenzhen, China: 726 participants, who completed the study between March 2019 and January 2020 (i.e. before COVID-19), comprised the 'wave 1' group; 780 participants, who were enrolled before COVID-19 and completed the 6-month endpoint assessment during COVID-19, comprised 'wave 2'. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were assessed at baseline and endpoint (i.e. 6-month follow-up) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), respectively. Measures of resilience and regular exercise were assessed at baseline. We compared the mental health outcomes between wave 1 and wave 2 groups. We additionally investigated how mental health outcomes changed across disparate stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, i.e. peak (7-13 February), post-peak (14-27 February), remission plateau (28 February-present). RESULTS: COVID-19 increased the risk for three mental outcomes: (1) depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.62); (2) anxiety (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.16-1.88) and (3) insomnia (OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07-1.77). The highest proportion of probable depression and anxiety was observed post-peak, with 52.9% and 41.4%, respectively. Greater baseline resilience scores had a protective effect on the three main outcomes (depression: OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.19-0.37; anxiety: OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33 and insomnia: OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.11-0.28). Furthermore, regular physical activity mitigated the risk for depression (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.79-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic exerted a highly significant and negative impact on symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia.

The major clinical feature of severe COVID-19 requiring ventilation is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with multi-functional failure as a result of a cytokine storm with increased serum levels of cytokines. The pathogenesis of the respiratory failure in COVID-19 is yet unknown, but diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial thickening leading to compromised gas exchange is a plausible mechanism. Hypoxia is seen in the COVID-19 patients, however, patients present with a distinct phenotype. Intracellular levels of nitric oxide (NO) play an important role in the vasodilation of small vessels. To elucidate the intracellular levels of NO inside of RBCs in COVID-19 patients compared with that of healthy control subjects. METHODS: We recruited 14 COVID-19 infected cases who had pulmonary involvement of their disease, 4 non-COVID-19 healthy controls (without pulmonary involvement and were not hypoxic) and 2 hypoxic non-COVID-19 patients subjects who presented at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital of Tehran, Iran between March-May 2020. Whole blood samples were harvested from patients and intracellular NO levels in 1 × 106 red blood cells (RBC) was measured by DAF staining using flow cytometry (FACS Calibour, BD, CA, USA). RESULTS: The Mean florescent of intensity for NO was significantly enhanced in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy control subjects (P &#8804; 0.05). As a further control for whether hypoxia induced this higher intracellular NO, we evaluated the levels of NO inside RBC of hypoxic patients.

This study reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of individuals who attended the centre for COVID-19 testing. METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study collected epidemiological and clinical data. The primary outcome was a positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 test result, according to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses of pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected at the centre. The relationships of clinical characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 positive test results were assessed by multivariable binary logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 1258 attendees included in the analysis, 86 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (positivity rate=6.84%; 95% confidence interval [CI]=5.57%-8.37%). Of these 86 individuals, 40 (46.5%) were aged 15 to 24 years and 81 (94.2%) had a history of recent travel. Symptoms were reported by 86.0% and 96.3% of individuals with positive and negative test results, respectively. The clinical characteristics most strongly associated with a positive test result were anosmia (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj]=8.30; 95% CI=1.12-127.09) and fever ORadj=1.32; 95% CI=1.02-3.28). CONCLUSION: The temporary test centre successfully helped identify individuals with COVID-19 who exhibited mild disease symptoms. Healthcare providers should carefully consider the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 to arrange early testing to reduce community spread.","Leung, W L H; Yu, E L M; Wong, S C; Leung, M; Lee, L L Y; Chung, K L; Cheng, V C C",Hong Kong Med J,208,16

These are: 'high risk', 'medium risk' and 'low risk'. In the operating theatre, where procedures may be urgent or planned, and where various surgical and anaesthetic procedures generate airborne particles (aerosols), it is crucial to communicate the infection prevention and control recommendations in a way that is easily understood and followed by all healthcare professionals. The theatre team at one hospital in the East of England produced local alternating signage to communicate the COVID-19 pathway risk during cases in theatres. This signage - named the 'COVID-19 Flag' - is placed outside of the individual theatre to ensure that staff are informed of the infection risk with the cases underway. Furthermore, it is a quick visual guide to be used in conjunction with national guidance and local protocols for appropriate decisions regarding the treatment and care of patients in the operating theatres.","Hayman, Gareth; Britton, Carolina R",J Perioper Pract,208,21

Predictions of mortality, cases and hospitalisations help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we combine the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. We use a dataset that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. A notable feature of the dataset is that the availability of forecasts from participating teams varies greatly across the 40 weeks in our study. We evaluate the accuracy of combining methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods. In addition, we propose several new weighted combining methods. Our results show that, although the median was very useful for the early weeks of the pandemic, the simple average was preferable thereafter, and that, as a history of forecast accuracy accumulates, the best results can be produced by a weighted combining method that uses weights that are inversely proportional to the historical accuracy of the individual forecasting teams.","Taylor, James W; Taylor, Kathryn S",European journal of operational research,208,3

In this prospective cross-sectional study with a longitudinal component, blood lactate was quantified in 10 healthy and 34 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) dogs to investigate its potential use as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. While there were no differences in lactate concentration between control animals and stages B1 (3.31±0.62mmol/L) and B2 (3.32±0.46mmol/L) dogs, significant differences were found between healthy (2.50±0.69mmol/L) and both C (3.99±0.47mmol/L) and D (6.97±1.23mmol/L) animals. When a cut-off of 3.35mmol/L was used, lactate was able to distinguish dogs with normal and remodeled hearts with a sensitivity of 78.2% and specificity of 63.6%. Also, significant correlations existed between lactate and indicators of cardiac remodeling. Finally, animals with blood lactate <3.5mmol/L carried a better prognosis when compared with dogs in which lactate was >5.0mmol/L. Our results suggest that the progression of MMVD results in accumulation of lactate within the bloodstream, which is likely attributable to the impaired peripheral tissue perfusion. In MMVD dogs, blood lactate may be used as a surrogate for cardiac remodeling, and an increased concentration is associated with a worse prognosis regarding the time to evolve into congestive heart failure.(AU)","Silva-Filho, Jorge Cardoso; Sousa, Marlos G; Pereira, Evandro Zacché; Ortiz, Edna M.

The aim was to determine the efficacy of vaporized hydrogen peroxide fogging on pathogens related to the dental environment and its possible application in dentistry. PICOS statement (Population, Intervention, Comparison/Control, Outcome and Study design statement) was used in the review. Six electronic databases were searched for articles published from 2010 to 2020. Articles written in English reporting vaporized hydrogen peroxide on pathogens deemed to be relevant to the dental environment were assessed. The quality of the studies was assessed using the risk-of-bias assessment tool designed for the investigation of vaporized hydrogen peroxide application in dentistry. A total of 17 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most commonly reported single bacterial pathogen was Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in five studies, and the viruses Feline calicivirus, Human norovirus, and Murine norovirus were featured in three studies. The results of the studies reporting the log kill were sufficient for all authors to conclude that vaporized hydrogen peroxide generation was effective for the assessed pathogens. The studies that assessed aerosolized hydrogen peroxide found a greater log kill with the use of vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators. The overarching conclusion was that hydrogen peroxide delivered as vaporized hydrogen peroxide was an effective method to achieve large levels of log kill on the assessed pathogens. The hydrogen peroxide vapor generators can play a role in dental bio-decontamination. The parameters must be standardized and the efficacy assessed to perform bio-decontamination for the whole clinic. For vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators to be included in the dental bio-decontamination regimen, certain criteria should be met. These include the standardization and efficacy assessment of the vaporized hydrogen peroxide generators in dental clinics.","Ahmed, Rukshana; Mulder, Riaan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),208,8

Of all patients who received telephone genetic counseling, fewer consented to genetic testing as compared to patients seen in-person prior to the pandemic (79% pre-COVID v. 72% post-COVID; p = .012). Four weeks after this cohort was closed for analysis, 96 out of 303 samples (32%) had not been received by the genetic testing laboratory, despite at least one reminder phone call to the patient. In 13 reported instances, a second sample was required (quality not sufficient, lost or mislabeled sample), thus delaying test results. We conclude that a rapid transition to remote genetic counseling and testing allowed uninterrupted access to cancer genetics services during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient compliance with sample return and higher rates of sample failure emerge as potential barriers to timely genetic testing under this service delivery model.","Shannon, Kristen M; Emmet, Margaret M; Rodgers, Linda H; Wooters, Mackenzie; Seidel, Meredith L",J. genet. couns,208,23
223054,223054,223054,Response to Rathi et al,15.10801,7.791858,2020,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causative agent of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in over two million deaths worldwide to date. Diphyllin and diphyllinosides are known as natural blockers of cellular vacuolar ATPases, and so can act as inhibitors of the pH-dependent fusion of viral envelopes with host cell endosomal membranes. Such pH-dependent fusion is a critical early step during the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Accordingly, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 profiles and cytotoxicities of diphyllin, diphyllinoside cleistanthin B, and two structurally related compounds, helioxanthin 8-1 and helioxanthin 5-4-2, are evaluated here using in vitro cell-based assay systems. Neither helioxanthin exhibits any obvious anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in vitro. By contrast diphyllin and cleistanthin B do exhibit anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects in Vero cells, with respective 50% effective concentrations (EC50) values of 1.92 and 6.51 µM. Diphyllin displays anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect also in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CaCo-2) cells. Moreover, when diphyllin is added at various times post infection, a significant decrease in viral titer is observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, even at high viral multiplicities of infection. Importantly, neither diphyllin nor cleistanthin B are found cytotoxic to Vero cells in concentrations up to 100 µM. However, the cytotoxic effect of diphyllin is more pronounced in Vero E6 and CaCo-2 cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that diphyllin and diphyllin analogues might be perfected as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in future preclinical studies, most especially if nanomedicine approaches may be invoked to optimize functional drug delivery to virus infected cells.","Stefanik, Michal; Strakova, Petra; Haviernik, Jan; Miller, Andrew D; Ruzek, Daniel; Eyer, Ludek",,208,1

However, rapid assays for assessing candidate drugs typically involve in vitro screens and cell lines that do not recapitulate human physiology at the tissue and organ levels. Here we show that a microfluidic bronchial-airway-on-a-chip lined by highly differentiated human bronchial-airway epithelium and pulmonary endothelium can model viral infection, strain-dependent virulence, cytokine production and the recruitment of circulating immune cells. In airway chips infected with influenza A, the co-administration of nafamostat with oseltamivir doubled the treatment-time window for oseltamivir. In chips infected with pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), clinically relevant doses of the antimalarial drug amodiaquine inhibited infection but clinical doses of hydroxychloroquine and other antiviral drugs that inhibit the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines under static conditions did not. We also show that amodiaquine showed substantial prophylactic and therapeutic activities in hamsters challenged with native SARS-CoV-2. The human airway-on-a-chip may accelerate the identification of therapeutics and prophylactics with repurposing potential.","Si, Longlong; Bai, Haiqing; Rodas, Melissa; Cao, Wuji; Oh, Crystal Yuri; Jiang, Amanda; Moller, Rasmus; Hoagland, Daisy; Oishi, Kohei; Horiuchi, Shu; Uhl, Skyler; Blanco-Melo, Daniel; Albrecht, Randy A; Liu, Wen-Chun; Jordan, Tristan; Nilsson-Payant, Benjamin E; Golynker, Ilona; Frere, Justin; Logue, James; Haupt, Robert; McGrath, Marisa; Weston, Stuart; Zhang, Tian; Plebani, Roberto; Soong, Mercy; Nurani, Atiq; Kim, Seong Min; Zhu, Danni Y; Benam, Kambez H; Goyal, Girija; Gilpin, Sarah E; Prantil-Baun, Rachelle; Gygi, Steven P; Powers, Rani K; Carlson, Kenneth E; Frieman, Matthew; tenOever, Benjamin R; Ingber, Donald E",,208,16

Although there is a budding body of literature on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and psychological well-being, little research has been published among Filipino Graduate students in the context of a pandemic. This descriptive-correlational, cross-sectional research examined the relationship of resilience on COVID-19 perceived stress, anxiety, and fear. Two-hundred and three Graduate students participated in the online survey conducted in the last week of August 2020. Four self-reported questionnaires were used to gather the data. Descriptive statistics and correlational analysis were performed. Results indicated that the composite scores of the COVID-19 stress, anxiety, and fear were 2.81 (SD=.605), 3.94 (SD=.686), and 3.03 (SD=1.004) respectively. The composite score on the resilience scale was 3.33 (SD=.496). COVID-19 stress and fear had a significant inverse correlation with resilience. Resilience has a protective influence on COVID-19 fear and is pivotal to cope with COVID-19 stress. Educational institutions may need to cultivate and harness the resilient trait of Graduate students in the midst of pandemic and other stressful events to help combat negative mental states and undesirable psychological consequences.","Oducado, R.

It is unclear if this situation will affect long-standing infection prevention practices and impact on healthcare associated infections. Here, we report a nosocomial cluster of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) that occurred on a COVID-19 dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) despite intensified contact precautions during the current pandemic. Whole genome sequence-based typing (WGS) was used to investigate genetic relatedness of VRE isolates collected from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients during the outbreak and to compare them to environmental VRE samples. METHODS: Five VRE isolated from patients (three clinical and two screening samples) as well as 11 VRE and six vancomycin susceptible Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) samples from environmental sites underwent WGS during the outbreak investigation. Isolate relatedness was determined using core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). RESULTS: WGS revealed two genotypic distinct VRE clusters with genetically closely related patient and environmental isolates. The cluster was terminated by enhanced infection control bundle strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate the importance of continued adherence to infection prevention and control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent VRE transmission and healthcare associated infections.","Kampmeier, Stefanie; Tönnies, Hauke; Correa-Martinez, Carlos L; Mellmann, Alexander; Schwierzeck, Vera",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,208,22

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world, including Turkey where this study was conducted. Nurses are among healthcare professionals who are intensively working at the forefront during this pandemic. Countries are implementing many policies to fight this pandemic. Turkey also has implemented protective measures related to travel, sports, and cultural activities and has prohibited social meetings. METHOD: The study was conducted with 26 nurses working in COVID-19 clinics of two hospitals in eastern Turkey between May and July 2020 using a qualitative descriptive design. FINDINGS: Nurses who had children longed for their children and worried about them. They were afraid of getting infected with the disease and transmitting it. Based on content analysis, the themes of the study were determined as follows: (1) longing (longing for children and longing for the pre-pandemic period), (2) fear (fear of transmitting the disease and fear of death), (3) despair, (4) concern (concern resulting from working in a different clinic, concern resulting from lack of knowledge, and concern resulting from lack of protective equipment), and (5) professional responsibility (professional awareness and love for the profession). CONCLUSION: Nurses were away from their families for a long time because of the fear of getting infected with COVID-19 and transmitting it. They longed for their children and experienced desperation, fear, and anxiety. They loved their profession and were not considering quitting their profession. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING AND HEALTH POLICY: Nurses working in COVID-19 units wear protective equipment and work for a long time under difficult conditions. In addition, nurses who have children are separated from their children because of the fear of transmitting COVID-19. Therefore, nurses caring for COVID-19 patients should alternately be replaced by nurses working in other services. They should be given the opportunity to rest and spend time with their loved ones if they are not carriers of COVID-19.","Coskun Simsek, Didem; Günay, Ulviye",Int. nurs. rev,208,4

According to the COR theory, critical events (e.g., the coronavirus epidemic) make people fearful of losing their valuable resources. A prolonged state of anxiety may lead to sleeping troubles, which over time results in an increase in exhaustion. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from 440 Polish healthcare providers, including nurses and midwives, doctors, paramedics, medical assistance workers, and wardens. Three measures were used: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (the sleeping trouble subscale) and the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (the exhaustion subscale). Hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling. RESULTS: The obtained results fully support the hypotheses. Both the direct and indirect relationships between coronavirus anxiety and exhaustion were observed. Specifically, high coronavirus anxiety increased insomnia, which in turn contributed to the development of exhaustion. CONCLUSIONS: The results are consistent with the COR theory. Prolonged coronavirus anxiety and sleeping problems depleted healthcare providers' resources and made them feel exhausted.

To address this issue, in this paper, we have developed an automated system that can collect and validate the fact from multi web-platform to decide the credibility of the content. To identify the credibility of the posted claim, probable instances/clues(titles) of news information are first gathered from various web platforms. Later, the crucial set of features is retrieved that further feeds into the ensemble-based machine learning model to classify the news as misleading or real. The four sets of features based on the content, linguistics/semantic cues, similarity, and sentiments gathered from web-platforms and voting are applied to validate the news. Finally, the combined voting decides the support given to a specific claim. In addition to the validation part, a unique source platform is designed for collecting data/facts from three web platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Google) based on certain queries/words. This unique platform can also help researchers build datasets and gather useful/efficient clues from various web platforms. It has been observed that our proposed intelligent strategy gives promising results and quite effective in predicting misleading information.

The Council includes representatives from 21 organizations working across the state, as well as three representatives from regional local food councils. The Council's response to the pandemic addressed three key areas of action: (1) Coordinate responses across multiple sectors;(2) Enhance collaboration across the food supply chain;and (3) Facilitate data collection and public messaging. This paper describes the positive impacts the Council has had across North Carolina on consumers and producers of local food as a result of this collaborative network and long-established relationships across the state. Now, more than ever, the relationships and collaborative efforts of statewide organizations and partners are needed. The Council's crisis response has been strong because of the long-standing relationships of its members and its ability to share resources quickly, allowing it to work toward coordinated responses. The work of the North Carolina Local Food Council can serve as a model for other states that have state-level local food councils or want to develop them. In addition, the Council's work demonstrates how collaborations among statewide partners can foster resilience within local food systems, particularly during a public health crisis.","Cruz, A.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 34 children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and 34 matched typically developing children participated (7-10 years). The PERF-FIT was used to examine known group validity. The PERF-FIT items were also compared to test items of well-known standardized tests to examine concurrent validity. RESULTS: Concurrent validity was found to be of the expected low to moderate magnitude. Children with DCD were consistently found to have lower levels of motor skill-related fitness compared to typically developing children. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The PERF-FIT seems to be a valid test to measure movement skills, musculoskeletal fitness and agility in children between the ages of 7 and 10 years in low resourced communities.

Thus, 2019 was assessed as the employee market. However, changes in the labor market take place in real time and, as it turns out, meeting them is not only difficult due to the reaction time, but above all due to their intensity. The aim of the article is to present changes in the labor market caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic in relation to the evolution of individual sectors towards economy 4.0. Design/Methodology/Approach: To achieve the main goal of the article, theoretical literature review was chosen, in particular argumentative review, which could introduce problems, but certainly constitute the introduction to in-depth research, also empirical. Findings: The article consists of 3 parts. In the first of them, the theoretical definition of the category of competences was made - which is an introduction to considerations of a utilitarian nature. The second part defines what types of competences accompanied the classical labor market. The third part focuses on identifying possible directions of employee competency development, including defining the range of necessary competences resulting from a) the need to adapt to market changes as a result of the pandemic, and b) the evolution of individual sectors towards the 4.0 economy. Practical Implications: They focus on highlighting significant changes that have already begun in the labor market, and the consequences of which will be long-term. These changes relate to the competency requirements of employees of various industries, and thus the phasing out of those sectors of activity that will no longer be crucial for civilization in the future. The forecasts contained in the study are speculative, but nevertheless result from the observation of historical and contemporary changes, in terms of organizations and world economies. Originality/value: In the article we propose an original set of competencies, which are crucial for the emerging new professions that respond to Industry 4.0 and which have been catalyzed by the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Sus, Aleksandra Sylwestrzak Bartosz",European Research Studies,208,33

But it requires high uptake and continued participation across the population to be effective. To achieve sufficient uptake/participation, health authorities should address, and thus be aware of, user concerns. AIM: This work manually analyzes user reviews of the Irish Heath Service Executive's (HSE) Contact Tracker app, to identify user concerns and to lay the foundations for subsequent, large-scale, automated analyses of reviews. While this might seem tightly scoped to the Irish context, the HSE app provides the basis for apps in many jurisdictions in the USA and Europe. METHODS: Manual analysis of (1287) user reviews from the Google/Apple playstores was performed, to identify the aspects of the app that users focused on, and the positive/negative sentiment expressed. RESULTS: The findings suggest a largely positive sentiment towards the app, and that users thought it handled data protection and transparency aspects well. But feedback suggests that users would appreciate more targeted feedback on the incidence of the virus, and facilities for more proactive engagement, like notifications that prompt users to submit their health status daily. Finally, the analysis suggests that the ""android battery"" issue and the backward-compatibility issue with iPhones seriously impacted retention/uptake of the app respectively. CONCLUSION: The HSE have responded to the public's desire for targeted feedback in newer versions, but should consider increasing the app's proactive engagement. The results suggest they should also raise the backward compatibility issue, regarding older iPhones, with Apple.","Rekanar, Kaavya; O039,; Keeffe, Ian R; Buckley, Sarah; Abbas, Manzar; Beecham, Sarah; Chochlov, Muslim; Fitzgerald, Brian; Glynn, Liam; Johnson, Kevin; Laffey, John; McNicholas, Bairbre; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Connell, James; Keeffe, Derek; Callaghan, Mike; Razzaq, Abdul; Richardson, Ita; Simpkin, Andrew; Storni, Cristiano; Tsvyatkova, Damyanka; Walsh, Jane; Welsh, Thomas; Buckley, Jim",Ir. j. med. sci,208,24

DESIGN: We explored numerous psychopathology, sociodemographic, and virus exposure-related variables associated with anxiety and perceived threat of death regarding COVID-19. METHOD: We recruited 908 adults from Eastern China for a cross-sectional web survey, from 24 February to 15 March 2020, when social distancing was heavily enforced in China. We used several machine learning algorithms to train our statistical model of predictor variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety, and perceived threat of death, separately. We trained the model using many simulated replications on a random subset of participants, and subsequently externally tested on the remaining subset of participants. RESULTS: Shrinkage machine learning algorithms performed best, indicating that stress and rumination were the most important variables in modeling COVID-19-related anxiety severity. Health anxiety was the most potent predictor of perceived threat of death from COVID-19.

To alleviate the burden of data annotation, we herein present a label-free approach for segmenting COVID-19 lesions in CT via pixel-level anomaly modeling that mines out the relevant knowledge from normal CT lung scans. Our modeling is inspired by the observation that the parts of tracheae and vessels, which lay in the high-intensity range where lesions belong to, exhibit strong patterns. To facilitate the learning of such patterns at a pixel level, we synthesize `lesions' using a set of surprisingly simple operations and insert the synthesized `lesions' into normal CT lung scans to form training pairs, from which we learn a normalcy-converting network (NormNet) that turns an 'abnormal' image back to normal. Our experiments on three different datasets validate the effectiveness of NormNet, which conspicuously outperforms a variety of unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) methods.","Yao, Qingsong; Xiao, Li; Liu, Peihang; Zhou, S.

Our results show that senior individuals have been the most severely affected by CoVID-19, particularly men, with an aCFR of nearly 60% for those aged 80- years. We also found that men have a significantly higher cumulative morbidity ratio across most age groups (proportion test, p-value< 0.001), with the exception of those aged 0-9 years.The ongoing CoVID-19 pandemic is generating a substantial mortality burden in Peru. Senior individuals, especially those older than 70 years, are being disproportionately affected by the CoVID-19 pandemic.","Munayco, Cesar; Chowell, Gerardo; Tariq, Amna; Undurraga, Eduardo A; Mizumoto, Kenji",Aging (Albany NY),208,1

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of the level of authority in tele-ICU care on patient outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and Web of Science from inception until August 30, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: We searched for randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing standard care plus tele-ICU care with standard care alone in critically ill patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors performed data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Mean differences and risk ratios were calculated using a random-effects model. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 20 studies with 477,637 patients (ntele-ICU care = 292,319, ncontrol = 185,318) were included. Although ""decision-making authority"" as the level of authority was associated with a significant reduction in ICU mortality (pooled risk ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71-0.94; p = 0.006), we found no advantage of tele-ICU care in studies with ""expert tele-consultation"" as the level of authority. With regard to length of stay, ""decision-making authority"" resulted in an advantage of tele-ICU care (ICU length of stay: pooled mean difference, -0.78; 95% CI, -1.46 to -0.10; p = 0.14; hospital length of stay: pooled mean difference, -1.54; 95% CI, -3.13 to 0.05; p = 0.06), whereas ""expert tele-consultation"" resulted in an advantage of standard care (ICU length of stay: pooled mean difference, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10-0.53; p = 0.005; hospital length of stay: pooled mean difference, 0.58; 95% CI, -0.04 to 1.21; p = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to expert tele-consultations, decision-making authority during tele-ICU care reduces mortality and length of stay in the ICU. This work confirms the urgent need for evidence-based ICU telemedicine guidelines and reveals potential benefits of uniform regulations regarding the level of authority when providing tele-ICU care.","Kalvelage, Christina; Rademacher, Susanne; Dohmen, Sandra; Marx, Gernot; Benstoem, Carina",Crit. care med,208,32

The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

Objective: Pulmonary microvascular injury and thrombosis are increasingly reported as constitutive features of COVID-19 respiratory failure. Our aim was to study pulmonary mechanics and gas exchanges in COVID-2019 ARDS patients studied early after initiating protective invasive mechanical ventilation, seeking after corresponding pathophysiological and biological characteristics. Methods: Between March 22 and March 30, 2020 respiratory mechanics, gas exchanges, circulating endothelial cells (CEC) as markers of endothelial damage, and D-dimers were studied in 22 moderate-to-severe COVID-19 ARDS patients, 1 [1–4] day after intubation (median [IQR]). Measurements and main results: Thirteen moderate and 9 severe COVID-19 ARDS patients were studied after initiation of high PEEP protective mechanical ventilation. We observed moderately decreased respiratory system compliance_ 39.5 [33.1–44.7] mL/cmH 2O and end-expiratory lung volume: 2100 [1721–2434] mL. Gas exchanges were characterized by hypercapnia 55 [44–62] mmHg, high physiological dead-space (V D/V T): 75 [69–85.5] % and ventilatory ratio (VR): 2.9 [2.2–3.4]. V D/V Tand VR were significantly correlated: r 2= 0.24, p = 0.014. No pulmonary embolism was suspected at the time of measurements. CECs and D-dimers were elevated as compared to normal values: 24 [12–46] cells per mL and 1483 [999–2217] ng/mL, respectively. Conclusions: We observed early in the course of COVID-19 ARDS high V D/V Tin association with biological markers of endothelial damage and thrombosis. High V D/V Tcan be explained by high PEEP settings and added instrumental dead space, with a possible associated role of COVID-19-triggered pulmonary microvascular endothelial damage and microthrombotic process.","Diehl, J.-L.; Peron, N.; Chocron, R.; Debuc, B.; Guerot, E.; Hauw-Berlemont, C.; Hermann, B.; Augy, J.

Cerebral cerebrospinal fluid loss in the presence of altered brain viscoelastic properties has previously been suggested as the pathophysiologic process leading to ventriculomegaly, despite low or negative intracranial pressures and patent shunts. More recently, cerebral venous overdrainage has been proposed as a possible explanation in the pathogenesis of LPH, although its connection to lumbar punctures in patients with shunts has not been contemplated yet. The effectiveness of epidural blood patch in the management of post-lumbar puncture LPH has been shown in children but has not been reported in adults. CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein we detail 2 episodes of shunt malfunction in a 30-year-old female patient with a history of hydrocephalus related to a posterior fossa tumor diagnosed during childhood. In both instances, imaging studies demonstrated ventricular dilation along with perimedullary cistern enlargement and brainstem distortion, which occurred following a lumbar puncture despite a patent shunt. A lumbar blood patch was effective in both episodes, enabling resolution of the ventriculomegaly and a good outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A blood patch can be efficient in adults with post-lumbar puncture LPH. Some symptoms may be explained by brainstem compression caused by enlarged cerebrospinal fluid spaces at the skull base. The role of cerebral venous overdrainage in the setting of post-lumbar puncture LPH is further supported.","Vilela, Marcelo D; Pedrosa, Hugo As; Mesquita, Braulio F; Horiguchi, Claudia L F",World Neurosurg,208,1

In addition to in-hospital emergency medicine, prehospital emergency medicine has the decisive task of fully guaranteeing emergency medical healthcare. In this article the Berlin Fire Brigade shows new ways for emergency medical services to fulfil these increased responsibilities during the pandemic in prehospital emergency medicine in the State of Berlin. METHODS: A systematic presentation of the challenges and conceptional responses of preclinical emergency medicine to the COVID-19 pandemic was carried out using the example of the emergency medical services in the State of Berlin. RESULTS: The Berlin Fire Brigade has a dispatch center that coordinates all requests for assistance in the State of Berlin over the emergency telephone number 112. On average a total of 2565 emergency calls are received every 24â¯h, from which 1271 missions are generated. During the pandemic there was a striking increase in missions to patients with acute respiratory diseases (ARD). Of the missions 11% were carried out to patients with the suspicion of COVID-19. The duration of the emergency calls was extended on average by 1:36â¯min due to the additional questions in the pandemic protocol and the duration of the mission by an average of 17â¯min with the additional alarm keyword acute respiratory disease (ARD). CONCLUSION: The continuing pandemic reveals that tasks and responsibilities of public services in emergency rescue go far beyond the immediate medical prevention of danger to life and limb. In addition to the controller and triage functions in the integrated dispatch center of the Berlin Fire Brigade (112), the emergency and healthcare measures could be ensured. This was accomplished by comprehensive measures for situation control, situation reports and mastering situations despite the lack of alternative outpatient care options, especially in the areas of general practitioner, public health care and medical specialist practices.","Dahmen, Janosch; Bäker, Linnart; Breuer, Florian; Homrighausen, Karsten; Pommerenke, Christopher; Stiepak, Jan-Karl; Poloczek, Stefan",Anaesthesist,208,1

METHODS: A new electrostatic filter was placed before (pre) or after (post) the bubble CPAP generator, or with no filter (control) in an in vitro study. Pressure was recorded at the nasal interface for 18 h (6 L/min; 7 cm H2O) on 3 occasions for each configuration. Filter failure was defined as pressure >9 cm H2O for 60 continuous minutes. The filter was weighed before and after each experiment. RESULTS: Mean (SD) time to reach the fail point was 257 (116) min and 525 (566) min for filter placement pre- and post-CPAP generator, respectively. Mean pressure was higher throughout in the pre-generator position compared to control. The filter weight was heavier at end study in the pre- compared to the post-generator position. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of the filter at the pre-generator position in a bubble CPAP circuit should be avoided due to unstable mean pressure.

This study presents a comprehensive review of the documented impact of air pollution and PV soiling on solar resources and techno-economic performances of PV systems. Both air pollution attenuation and soiling could significantly reduce the solar PV power generation globally, and soiling losses contribute to most of the total power reduction in most regions except in high-polluted areas. In addition, considering the natural soiling processes, the influencing parameters of soiling such as environmental and configurational factors and their correlation to dust deposition on PV surface are discussed.

Here we sought to potentially understand and infer complex disease progression, immune regulation, and symptoms in patients infected with coronaviruses (35 SARS-CoV and 3 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 57 samples) at two different disease progression stages. Further, we compared coronavirus data with healthy individuals (n = 16) and patients with other infections (n = 144; all publicly available data). We applied inferential statistics (the COVID-engine platform) to RNA profiles (from limited number of samples) derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Compared to healthy individuals, a subset of integrated blood-based gene profiles (signatures) distinguished acute-like (mimicking coronavirus-infected patients with prolonged hospitalization) from recovering-like patients. These signatures also hierarchically represented multiple (at the system level) parameters associated with PBMC including dysregulated cytokines, genes, pathways, networks of pathways/concepts, immune status, and cell types. Proof-of-principle observations included PBMC-based increases in cytokine storm-associated IL6, enhanced innate immunity (macrophages and neutrophils), and lower adaptive T and B cell immunity in patients with acute-like disease compared to those with recovery-like disease. Patients in the recovery-like stage showed significantly enhanced TNF, IFN-Î³, anti-viral, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-F gene expression and cytolytic activity, and reduced pro-viral gene expression compared to those in the acute-like stage in PBMC. Besides, our analysis revealed overlapping genes associated with potential comorbidities (associated diabetes) and disease-like conditions (associated with thromboembolism, pneumonia, lung disease, and septicemia). Overall, our COVID-engine inferential statistics platform and study involving PBMC-based RNA profiling may help understand complex and variable system-wide responses displayed by coronavirus-infected patients with further validation.","Sadanandam, Anguraj; Bopp, Tobias; Dixit, Santosh; Knapp, David J H F; Emperumal, Chitra Priya; Vergidis, Paschalis; Rajalingam, Krishnaraj; Melcher, Alan; Kannan, Nagarajan",Cell Death Discov,208,20

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are on the frontline of treating patients infected with COVID-19. However, data related to its infection rate among HCWs are limited. The aim was to present evidence associated with the number of HCWs being infected with COVID-19 from most viral affected countries (Italy, China, United States, Spain, and France). Furthermore, we looked into the reasons for HCWs COVID 19 infections and strategies to overcome this problem. Early available evidence suggested that HCWs are being increasingly infected with the novel infection ranging from 15% to 18% and in some cases up to 20% of the infected population. Major factors for infection among HCWs include lack of understanding of the disease, inadequate use and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), uncertain diagnostic criteria, unavailability of diagnostic tests and psychological stress. Therefore the protection of HCWs by authorities should be prioritized through education and training, the readiness of staff, incentives, availability of PPEs, and psychological support.","Ali, Saqib; Noreen, Sara; Farooq, Imran; Bugshan, Amr; Vohra, Fahim",Pak.

This study aimed to verify the effects of M. charantia saponins on insulin secretion and explore the potential underlying mechanisms in INS-1 pancreatic ß-cells. We injured INS-1 cells with 33.3mM glucose and then treated them with saponins. Saponins improved cell morphology and viability as demonstrated by inverted microscopy and CCK8 detection and significantly increased insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by ELISA. Thus, we obtained the optimal concentration for the subsequent experiments. Potential mechanisms were explored by immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RT-qPCR techniques. First, saponins increased the mRNA and protein levels of IRS-2 but decreased the serine 731 phosphorylation level of IRS-2. Moreover, saponins increased the phosphorylation of Akt protein and decreased the protein level of FoxO1, which were both reversed by the PI3K inhibitor ly294002. Furthermore, saponins increased the protein level of the downstream molecule and insulin initiating factor PDX-1, which was also reversed by ly294002. Saponins also increased Akt and PDX-1 mRNA and decreased FoxO1 mRNA, which were both reversed by ly294002. Saponins increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and intracellular insulin content, which were reversed by ly294002, as determined by ELISA. The immunofluorescence results also confirmed this tendency. In conclusion, our findings improve our understanding of the function of saponins in INS-1 pancreatic ß-cells and suggest that saponins may increase insulin secretion via the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway.","Liu, Yufan; Mu, Shumin; Chen, Wenbin; Liu, Shiyin; Cong, Yuxuan; Liu, Jiajia; Jia, Ning",Endocrinol. diabetes nutr.

However, the current pandemic has amplified cases of domestic violence (DV) against women and girls, with up to thrice the prevalence in DV cases compared to the same time last year. Evidence of the adverse effects of the pandemic on DV is still emerging, even as violence prevention strategies are iteratively being refined by service providers, advocacy agencies, and survivors to meet stay-at-home mandates. Emotional and material support for survivors is a critical resource increasingly delivered using digital and technology-based modalities, which offer several advantages and challenges. This paper rapidly describes current DV mitigation approaches using digital solutions, signaling emerging best practices to support survivors, their children, and abusers during stay-at-home advisories. Some examples of technology-based strategies and solutions are presented. An immediate priority is mapping out current digital solutions in response to COVID-19-related DV and outlining issues with uptake, coverage, and meaningful use of digital solutions.","Emezue, Chuka",JMIR Public Health Surveill,208,23

Consistent with EC activation, increased plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels have been reported in COVID-19. Importantly however, studies in other microangiopathies have shown that plasma VWF propeptide (VWFpp) is a more sensitive and specific measure of acute EC activation. In the present study, we further investigated the nature of EC activation in severe COVID-19. Markedly increased plasma VWF:Ag [median (interquatile range, IQR) 608·8 (531-830)iu/dl] and pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII) levels [median (IQR) 261·9 (170-315) iu/dl] were seen in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Sequential testing showed that these elevated VWF-FVIII complex levels remained high for up to 3 weeks. Similarly, plasma VWFpp levels were also markedly elevated [median (IQR) 324·6 (267-524) iu/dl]. Interestingly however, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was reduced, demonstrating that decreased VWF clearance contributes to the elevated plasma VWF:Ag levels in severe COVID-19. Importantly, plasma VWFpp levels also correlated with clinical severity indices including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sustained fulminant EC activation is occurring in severe COVID-19, and further suggest that VWFpp may have a role as a biomarker in this setting.","Ward, Soracha E; Curley, Gerard F; Lavin, Michelle; Fogarty, Helen; Karampini, Ellie; McEvoy, Natalie L; Clarke, Jennifer; Boylan, Maria; Alalqam, Razi; Worrall, Amy P; Kelly, Claire; de Barra, Eoghan; Glavey, Siobhan; Ni Cheallaigh, Cliona; Bergin, Colm; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Townsend, Liam; Mallon, Patrick W; O039,; Sullivan, Jamie M; Donnell, James S",Br. j. haematol,208,26

Here we show that the observed part of Phaethon does not exhibit the 3-µm hydrated mineral absorption (within 2&#963;). These observations suggest that Phaethon's modern activity is not due to volatile sublimation or devolatilization of phyllosilicates on its surface. It is possible that the observed part of Phaethon was originally hydrated and has since lost volatiles from its surface via dehydration, supporting its connection to the Pallas family, or it was formed from anhydrous material.","Takir, Driss; Kareta, Theodore; Emery, Joshua P; Hanus, Josef; Reddy, Vishnu; Howell, Ellen S; Rivkin, Andrew S; Arai, Tomoko",Nat Commun,208,16

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children's anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male.

METHODS: Adult patients suspected of COVID-19 aged >18 years who underwent chest CT scans and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests within 14 days of symptom onset were enrolled. The enrolled patients were confirmed and grouped according to the results of the RT-PCR tests. The basic demographics, single chest CT features, and combined chest CT features were analyzed for the confirmed and nonconfirmed groups. RESULTS: A total of 130 patients were enrolled, with 54 testing positive and 76 testing negative. The typical CT imaging features of the positive group were ground glass opacities (GGOs), the crazy-paving pattern and air bronchogram. The lesions were mostly distributed bilaterally and close to the lower lungs or the pleura. When features were combined, GGOs with bilateral pulmonary distribution and GGOs with pleural distribution were more common among the positive patients, found in 31 (57.4%) and 30 patients (55.6%), respectively. The combinations were almost all statistically significant (P < .05), except for the combination of GGOs with consolidation.

Spleen, liver and lung accounts for more than 95% of phagocytic activity in humans. METHODS: We used intravenous inoculation of Escherichia coli AB1157 in Wistar rats in order to evaluate this function. Young and adult rats of both sexes were submitted to total splenectomy and compared to animals not submitted to any surgical procedure. Sixteen weeks later, rats of both groups were challenged with a suspension of E. coli labeled with Tc-99m, and, after twenty minutes, they were killed. Liver, lung, spleen and a blood clot sample were removed for radioactivity determination. The statistical study was performed with Student's t test. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the radioactivity uptake obtained from young and adult splenectomized rats. However, these rats were associated with higher levels of blood counts than animals of the control group (p 0.0001) due to a larger bacteria remnant in the bloodstream. CONCLUSION: This finding suggests that some failure in mononuclear phagocytic system occurs in spleen absence adaptation, ratifying the necessity of development of alternative surgical techniques to total splenectomy in patients requiring spleen removal.","Garcia Marques, Ruy; Petroianu, Andy; Betânia Nunes de Oliveira, Márcia; Bernardo Filho, Mário",Acta cir. bras.,208,6

Current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) schools might not significantly contribute to COVID-19 spread nationwide (3). During August 31-November 29, 2020, COVID-19 cases, spread, and compliance with mask use were investigated among 4,876 students and 654 staff members who participated in in-person learning in 17 K-12 schools in rural Wisconsin. School-attributable COVID-19 case rates were compared with rates in the surrounding community. School administration and public health officials provided information on COVID-19 cases within schools. During the study period, widespread community transmission was observed, with 7%-40% of COVID-19 tests having positive results. Masking was required for all students and staff members at all schools, and rate of reported student mask-wearing was high (>92%). COVID-19 case rates among students and staff members were lower (191 cases among 5,530 persons, or 3,453 cases per 100,000) than were those in the county overall (5,466 per 100,000). Among the 191 cases identified in students and staff members, one in 20 cases among students was linked to in-school transmission; no infections among staff members were found to have been acquired at school. These findings suggest that, with proper mitigation strategies, K-12 schools might be capable of opening for in-person learning with minimal in-school transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Falk, Amy; Benda, Alison; Falk, Peter; Steffen, Sarah; Wallace, Zachary; Høeg, Tracy Beth",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,208,1

Even though a majority of the population develops only minor symptoms upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, a significant number are hospitalized at intensive care units (ICU) requiring critical care. While insights into the early stages of the disease are rapidly expanding, the dynamic immunological processes occurring in critically ill patients throughout their recovery at ICU are far less understood. Here, we have analysed whole blood samples serially collected from 40 surviving COVID-19 patients throughout their recovery in ICU using high-dimensional cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) and cytokine multiplexing. Based on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), we defined four sequential immunotypes during recovery that correlated to various clinical parameters, including the level of respiratory support at concomitant sampling times. We identified classical monocytes as the first immune cell type to recover by restoration of HLA-DR-positivity and the reduction of immunosuppressive CD163 + monocytes, followed by the recovery of CD8 + and CD4 + T cell and non-classical monocyte populations. The identified immunotypes also correlated to aberrant cytokine and acute-phase reactant levels. Finally, integrative analysis of cytokines and immune cell profiles showed a shift from an initially dysregulated immune response to a more coordinated immunogenic interplay, highlighting the importance of longitudinal sampling to understand the pathophysiology underlying recovery from severe COVID-19.","Penttilä, P A; Van Gassen, S; Panovska, D; Vanderbeke, L; Van Herck, Y; Quintelier, K; Emmaneel, A; Filtjens, J; Malengier-Devlies, B; Ahmadzadeh, K; Van Mol, P; Borràs, D M; Antoranz, A; Bosisio, F M; Wauters, E; Martinod, K; Matthys, P; Saeys, Y; Garg, A D; Wauters, J; De Smet, F",Cell Mol Life Sci,208,1

Alternatively, natural silica sources from biomass are often cheap and abundant, yet they contain impurities. Silica can be extracted from corn cob, coffee husk, rice husk, sugarcane bagasse and wheat husk wastes, which are often disposed of in rivers, lands and ponds. These wastes can be used to prepare homogenous silica nanoparticles. Here we review properties, preparation and applications of silica nanoparticles.

We describe epidemiological and clinical characteristics and aim at identifying risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 detection during the first 6 weeks of operation. METHODS: Testing followed national recommendations, but was also based on the physician's discretion. We related patient characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 test positivity for exploratory analyses using a cross-sectional, observational study design. RESULTS: Between 3 March and 13 April 2020, 5179 individuals attended the site (median age 34 years; interquartile range 26-47 years). The median time since disease onset was 4 days (interquartile range 2-7 days). Among 4333 persons tested, 333 (7.7%) were positive. Test positivity increased up to 10.3% (96/929) during the first 3 weeks and then declined, paralleling Germany's lock-down and the course of the epidemic in Berlin. Strict adherence to testing guidelines resulted in 10.4% (262/2530) test positivity, compared with 3.9% (71/1803) among individuals tested for other indications.

Risk factors for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection were recent contact with a positive case (second week after contact, OR 3.42; 95% CI 2.48-4.71), travel to regions of high pandemic activity (e.g. Austria, OR 4.16; 95% CI 2.48-6.99), recent onset of symptoms (second week, OR 3.61; 95% CI 1.87-6.98) and an impaired sense of smell/taste (4.08; 95% CI 2.36-7.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this young population, early-onset presentation of COVID-19 resembled flu-like symptoms, except for smell and/or taste dysfunction.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study utilizing all patients completing &#8805; 1 Pl-OC cycle from 2016 to 2018 at a large single-center OC program. Subjects were categorized by age at retrieval and number of cycles. We extrapolated age-based oocyte thresholds for 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR from previously published data. We calculated the proportion of subjects overall, and for each age group, whose number of frozen oocytes was greater than or equal to their age-based threshold for a 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR after 1 and 2 cycles. OR for 60% eLBR with one cycle was calculated for age and AMH cutoff values and corroborated with logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1241 subjects, completing 1799 Pl-OC cycles, were included. With one cycle, 66% (819/1241) achieved &#8805; 50% eLBR and 51% (634/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. With two cycles, 79.6% (988/1241) attained &#8805; 50% eLBR and 65.5% (813/1241) achieved 70% eLBR. Achieving 50%, 60%, or 70% eLBR with 1-2 cycles was significantly associated with both age (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.001).

In this work, we aimed to assess the maintenance of immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2. Methods We evaluated the long-term virus-specific cellular and humoral immune response in the members of an Italian Serie A football team, who experienced a cluster of COVID-19 in March 2020, which was strictly evaluated in the following months. Results Our results highlight a heterogeneous magnitude of immunological memory at 5 months after infection. Indeed, 20% of the subjects displayed a weak cellular and humoral memory to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that they may be at higher risk of reinfection. In addition, a history of symptomatic COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells and specific antibody levels than in asymptomatic individuals. Conclusion Collectively, these data demonstrate that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is maintained five months postinfection even if the magnitude of response is heterogeneous among individuals. This finding suggests that some COVID-19-recovered subjects may benefit from vaccination.","Mazzoni, Alessio Maggi Laura Capone Manuela Vanni Anna Spinicci Michele Salvati Lorenzo Tekle Kiros Seble Semeraro Roberto Pengue Luca Colao Maria Grazia Magi Alberto Rossolini Gian Maria Liotta Francesco Cosmi Lorenzo Bartoloni Alessandro Annunziato Francesco",Clinical &amp; Translational Immunology,208,23

Recent evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits neurotropic properties and causes neurological diseases. Here we review the literature on neurological involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infections and the possible mechanisms of invasion of the nervous system by this virus, to provide a summary and critical analysis of the early reporting of neurological involvement in COVID-19. An exhaustive search of scientific articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 was performed in the Web of Science, Scopus, Medline/PubMed, and several other databases. Nineteen relevant articles that had been published or were in preprint were carefully selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Based on our research, we found that patients with COVID-19 can present with neurological symptoms that can be broadly divided into central nervous system involvement, such as headache, dizziness, altered mental state, and disorientation, and peripheral nervous system involvement, such as anosmia and hypogeusia. Most of these patients are in the older age group and exhibit comorbidities, especially hypertension, and severe infection. In extreme presentations of COVID-19, some patients exhibit seizures, stroke, flaccid paraparesis, corticospinal weakness, and even coma. Moreover, the neurological manifestations can occur independently of the respiratory system. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause multiple neurological syndromes in a more complex presentation. Therefore, this review elucidated the involvement of the nervous system in SARS-CoV-2 infection and will hopefully help improve the management of COVID-19.","Payus, Alvin Oliver; Liew Sat Lin, Constance; Mohd Noh, Malehah; Jeffree, Mohammad Saffree; Ali, Raymond Azman",,208,11

Type of program or service: We present a case study of a participatory research collaboration between CALD community leaders and health behaviour change scientists during the COVID-19 crisis. The goal was to better understand the role of community leaders in shaping health behaviours in their communities and how that role might be leveraged for better health outcomes. METHODS: This article is the culmination of a series of dialogues between CALD community and advocacy leaders, and health behaviour change scientists in July 2020. The academic authors recruited 12 prominent CALD community leaders, conducted five semi-structured dialogues with small groups, and worked with all participants to develop insights that were applicable to the many different CALD communities represented in the research collaboration. RESULTS: Three key findings emerged: 1) partnerships between CALD leaders, communities and government are critical for effective health communication; 2) shifting behaviour requires moving beyond disseminating information to designing tailored solutions; and 3) the diverse needs and circumstances of people and communities must be at the centre of health communication and behaviour change strategies. LESSONS LEARNT: The collaborative process we undertook in this study enabled us to identify key challenges experienced and solutions offered by CALD leaders in communicating health information throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Partnering with communities that are subject to health messaging can reduce inequalities in healthcare communication by enabling the development of strategies that help align human behaviour with the recommendations of health experts. This - along with sustained partnership and collaboration with CALD communities, understanding the cultural context, and the appropriate tailoring and delivery of communications - will ensure health-related messages are not lost in translation. The lessons provided in this paper are applicable not only to the current pandemic but also to post-pandemic social and economic recovery.","Wild, Abigail; Kunstler, Breanne; Goodwin, Denise; Onyala, Saturnino; Zhang, Li; Kufi, Marama; Salim, Wudad; Musse, Faduma; Mohideen, Mohamed; Asthana, Molina; Al-Khafaji, Mohammad; Geronimo, Mary Ann; Coase, Daniel; Chew, Erin; Micallef, Eddie; Skouteris, Helen",Public Health Res.

STUDY DESIGN: This prospective cohort study was conducted in Ankara City Hospital between April, 15, 2020 and June, 5, 2020. A total of 206 asymptomatic pregnant women (103 low-risk pregnant women without any defined risk factor and 103 high-risk pregnant women) were screened for SARS-CoV-2 positivity upon admission to hospital for delivery. Detection of SARS-CoV2 in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples was performed by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) method targeting RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene. Two groups were compared in terms of demographic features, clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 positivity. RESULTS: Three of the 206 pregnant women participating in the study had positive RT-PCR tests (1.4 %) and all positive cases were in the high-risk pregnancy group. Although, one case in the high-risk pregnancy group had developed symptoms highly suspicious for COVID-19, two repeated RT-PCR tests were negative. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity rate was significantly higher in the high-risk pregnancy group (2.9 % vs 0%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Healthcare professionals should be cautious in the labor and delivery of high-risk pregnant women during the pandemic period and universal testing for COVID-19 may be considered in selected populations.","Tanacan, Atakan; Erol, Seyit Ahmet; Turgay, Batuhan; Anuk, Ali Taner; Secen, Elcin Islek; Yegin, Gulin Feykan; Ozyer, Sebnem; Kirca, Fisun; Dinc, Bedia; Unlu, Serpil; Yapar Eyi, Elif Gul; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Sahin, Dilek; Surel, Aziz Ahmet; Tekin, Ozlem Moraloglu",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,208,10

Delay in diagnosis and limited hospital resources lead to a rapid spread of COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the effect of delay in diagnosis on the disease transmission with a new formulated dynamic model. Sensitivity analyses and numerical simulations reveal that, improving the proportion of timely diagnosis and shortening the waiting time for diagnosis can not eliminate COVID-19 but can effectively decrease the basic reproduction number, significantly reduce the transmission risk, and effectively prevent the endemic of COVID-19, e.g., shorten the peak time and reduce the peak value of new confirmed cases and new infection, decrease the cumulative number of confirmed cases and total infection. More rigorous prevention measures and better treatment of patients are needed to control its further spread, e.g., increasing available hospital beds, shortening the period from symptom onset to isolation of patients, quarantining and isolating the suspected cases as well as all confirmed patients.","Rong, Xin Miao; Yang, Liu; Chu, Hui di; Fan, Meng",Math Biosci Eng,208,24

Malnutrition has long been associated with poor outcomes among patients with pneumonia. This may be due to the increased risk of malnourished patients to develop impaired muscle and respiratory function. We aimed to determine the outcomes of adult COVID 19 patients admitted in a tertiary government hospital accordingly to nutrition status and risk. METHODS: Retrospective study on the adult COVID 19 patients admitted from July 15 to September 15, 2020 who were screened using the Philippine Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition modified Subjective Global Assessment Grade tool. Chi-square or Fisher exact test, as well as Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis with post-hoc Dunn test, as appropriate were done. Survival analysis for mortality was done with right-censored data length of initial admission in days. Cox proportional hazard regression was done to determine the association of the main variables of interest with mortality with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: Malnourished patients were 30% less likely to be discharged [HR 0.70 95% CI (0.50, 0.97)]; malnutrition was also associated with length of hospital stay as those who were malnourished had longer lengths of hospital stay of about 4 days on the average [HR 3.55 95% CI (0.83, 6.27)]. High nutrition risk was significantly associated with length of hospital stay [HR 4.36 95% CI (0.89, 7.83)]. CONCLUSION: The only risk factor for mortality shown in this study is ICU transfer. Malnutrition, moderate nutrition risk, and high nutrition risk were risk factors of having longer lengths of hospital stays. While only malnutrition was the risk factor for being less likely to be discharged. We reiterate that nutrition assessment and support are important in mitigating the effects of COVID 19.","Larrazabal, Ramon B; Chiu, Harold Henrison C; Palileo-Villanueva, Lia Aileen M",Clin Nutr ESPEN,208,1

New loss of smell (anosmia/hyposmia) is now recognized as a COVID­19 related symptom, which may be caused by SARS­CoV­2 infection and damage of the olfactory receptor (OR) cells in the nasal neuro­epithelium and/or central involvement of the olfactory bulb. ORs are also expressed peripherally (e.g., in tissues of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems) and it is possible that their local functions could also be impaired by SARS­CoV­2 infection of these tissues. Using Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, The Cancer Genome Atlas, Genotype­Tissue Expression, cBioPortal and Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool, we highlight the expression of peripheral ORs in both healthy and malignant tissues, and describe their co­expression with key mediators of SARS­CoV­2 infection, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as cathepsin L (CTSL; another cellular protease mediating SARS­CoV­2 infection of host cells). A wide expression profile of peripheral ORs was noted, particularly in tissues such as the prostate, testis, thyroid, brain, liver, kidney and bladder, as well as tissues with known involvement in cardio­metabolic disease (e.g., the adipose tissue, pancreas and heart). Among these, OR51E2, in particular, was significantly upregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and co­expressed primarily with TMPRSS2. Functional networks of this OR were further analysed using the GeneMANIA interactive tool, showing that OR51E2 interacts with a plethora of genes related to the prostate. Further in vitro and clinical studies are clearly required to elucidate the role of ORs, both at the olfactory level and the periphery, in the context of COVID­19.","Kerslake, Rachel; Hall, Marcia; Randeva, Harpal S; Spandidos, Demetrios A; Chatha, Kamaljit; Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil",Int J Mol Med,208,16

Somewhat surprisingly, our analysis found no significant differences between 2019 and 2020 in student achievement growth as measured by progressive achievement tests in mathematics or reading. A more nuanced picture emerges when the sample is examined by dis/advantage (ICSEA) and Year level. The Year 3 cohort in the least advantaged schools (ICSEA < 950) achieved 2 months less growth in mathematics, while the Year 3 students in mid-ICSEA schools (950-1050) achieved 2 months' additional growth. No significant differences were identified for Indigenous students or students located in regional locations. These results provide an important counter-narrative to widespread speculation about alarming levels of 'learning loss' for all students. While the lower achievement growth in mathematics for Year 3 students in lower ICSEA schools must be addressed as a matter of urgency to avoid further inequities, most students are, academically, where they are expected to be. Our findings are a testament to the dedicated work of teachers during the 2020 pandemic to ensure that learning for most students was not compromised, despite unusually trying circumstances.","Gore, Jennifer; Fray, Leanne; Miller, Andrew; Harris, Jess; Taggart, Wendy",Aust Educ Res,208,26

Studies from three countries (China, Belgium and the United States) report the consequences on traumatic bone fractures. COMMENT: The coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a widespread change to a relative sedentary lifestyle and decreased exposure to light (vitamin D). A consequence of the stay-at-home policies is a negative change in bone-health and environmental surroundings that has led to age-related changes in the number of traumatic bone fractures. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: A consequence of stay-at-home policies has been a decline in bone fractures for young and middle-aged adults; but an increase for the elderly. The trends are predicted to reverse, and present new problems, when isolation restrictions are removed.","Umeda-Raffa, Sumiyo; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Raffa, Robert B",J. clin. pharm. ther,208,30

The aim of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on this issue. METHODS: Three databases, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, from inception to 20th January 2021 were searched for relevant literature. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess quality bias, and STATA was employed to pool the effect size by a random effects model. Additionally, potential publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with a total of 23,944 COVID-19 patients, for quantitative analysis. Overall, the pooled prevalence of frailty was 51% (95% CI: 44-59%). Patients with frailty who were infected with COVID-19 had an increased risk of mortality compared to those without frailty, and the pooled hazard ratio (HR) and odds ratio (OR) were 1.99 (95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and 2.48 (95% CI: 1.78-3.46), respectively. In addition, subgroup analysis based on population showed that the pooled ORs for hospitalized patients in eight studies and nursing home residents in two studies were 2.62 (95% CI: 1.68-4.07) and 2.09 (95% CI: 1.40-3.11), respectively. Subgroup analysis using the frailty assessment tool indicated that this association still existed when using the clinical frailty scale (CFS) (assessed in 6 studies, pooled OR = 2.88, 95% CI: 1.52-5.45; assessed in 5 studies, pooled HR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.66-2.38) and other frailty tools (assessed in 4 studies, pooled OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.81-2.16). In addition, these significant positive associations still existed in the subgroup analysis based on study design and geographic region. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that frailty is an independent predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Thus, frailty could be a prognostic factor for clinicians to stratify high-risk groups and remind doctors and nurses to perform early screening and corresponding interventions urgently needed to reduce mortality rates in patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Xiao-Ming; Jiao, Jing; Cao, Jing; Huo, Xiao-Peng; Zhu, Chen; Wu, Xin-Juan; Xie, Xiao-Hua",BMC Geriatr,208,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online study using a validated questionnaire was distributed to doctors (MD), assistant medical officers (AMO), and staff nurses (SN) at an urban tertiary Emergency Department. It comprised of 40 knowledge and 10 confidence-level questions related to resuscitation and airway management steps. RESULTS: A total of 135 from 167 eligible EHCW were enrolled. 68.9% (n = 93) had high knowledge while 53.3% (n = 72) possessed high confidence level. Overall knowledge mean score was 32.96/40 (SD = 3.63) between MD (33.88±3.09), AMO (32.28±4.03), and SN (32.00±3.60), P= 0.025. EHCWs with a length of service (LOS) between 4-10 years had the highest knowledge compared to those with LOS <4-year (33.71±3.39 versus 31.21±3.19 P = 0.002). Airway-related knowledge was significantly different between the designations and LOS (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively). Overall, EHCW confidence level against LOS showed significant difference [F (2, 132) = 5.46, P = 0.005] with longer LOS showing better confidence. MD showed the highest confidence compared to AMO and SN (3.67±0.69, 3.53±0.68, 3.26±0.64) P = 0.049. The majority EHCW were confident in performing high-quality chest-compression, and handling of Personal Protective Equipment but less than half were confident in resuscitating, leading the resuscitation, managing the airway or being successful in first intubation attempt. CONCLUSIONS: EHCW possessed good knowledge in airway and resuscitation of COVID-19 patients, but differed between designations and LOS. A longer LOS was associated with better confidence, but there were some aspects in airway management and resuscitation that needed improvement.","Abd Samat, Azlan Helmy; Isa, Mohd Hisham; Sabardin, Dazlin Masdiana; Jamal, Shamsuriani Md; Jaafar, Mohd Johar; Hamzah, Faizal Amri; Mahmud, Alias; Sanip, Amirudin; Syed Ali, Syed Mohammad; Saiboon, Ismail Mohd",Ann Acad Med Singap,208,3

Breathing exercises and chest physiotherapy are used for managing the patients. These treatments are however not well supported by scientific evidence. In a randomized controlled trial, 80 patients were randomly assigned to planned breathing-exercise (n=40) and control groups (n=40). The participants in the intervention group were instructed to blow into a balloon five times a day while lying down. Other therapies were similar in both groups. The severity of dyspnea at rest/after activity and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) with/without O2 therapy were compared between the two groups on the first, second, and third days. The study findings showed no statistically significant difference in SpO2 with/without O2 therapy on the first, second, and third days between the two groups.

Like with other viruses, the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with host cell proteins is necessary for successful replication, and cleavage of cellular targets by the viral protease also may contribute to the pathogenesis, but knowledge about the human proteins that are processed by the main protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is still limited. We tested the prediction potentials of two different in silico methods for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro cleavage sites in human proteins. Short stretches of homologous host-pathogen protein sequences (SSHHPS) that are present in SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein and human proteins were identified using BLAST analysis, and the NetCorona 1.0 webserver was used to successfully predict cleavage sites, although this method was primarily developed for SARS-CoV. Human C-terminal-binding protein 1 (CTBP1) was found to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, the existence of the cleavage site was proved experimentally by using a His6-MBP-mEYFP recombinant substrate containing the predicted target sequence. Our results highlight both potentials and limitations of the tested algorithms. The identification of candidate host substrates of 3CLpro may help better develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.","Miczi, Márió; Golda, Mária; Kunkli, Balázs; Nagy, Tibor; Tozsér, József; Mótyán, János András",Int. j. mol. sci.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs the human capital approach to estimate the DMVHL (assuming Spain's life expectancy of 83 years and a 3% discount rate) of the 20,453 human lives lost in Spain from COVID-19 as of 19 April 2020. Sensitivity analysis was conducted alternately assuming (a) 5% and 10% discount rate; and (b) global life expectancy of 72 years, and the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years. Findings: The 20,453 human lives lost due to COVID-19 had a total DMVHL of Int$ 9,629,234,112, and an average of Int$ 470,798 per human life lost. Alternate re-estimation of the economic model with a 5% and 10% discount rates led to 19.8% and 47.4% reductions in the DMVHL, respectively. Re-calculation of the economic model using the global life expectancy of 72 years, while holding the discount rate constant at 3%, diminished the DMVHL by 41%. While the re-run of the same model using the world's highest life expectancy of 87.1 years instead, it increased the DMVHL by 18%.

Stone mastic asphalt reducing tire/road noise (SMA LA) layers have also been recently used as low-noise road surfaces.

The reference asphalt mixture was the porous asphalt (PA8). The presented results of water damage resistance, degradation resistance in the Cantabro abrasion loss test, stiffness modulus as a function of temperature and hysteresis loop proved that the amount of rubber granulate and the type of binder significantly affect the values of these parameters. Attention was paid to the possibility of using the results of uniaxial cyclic compression tests when determining the proportion of rubber granulate in SMA8 LA mixtures.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 77 French hospitals from April 22 to May 13 2020. All ICU frontline healthcare workers were eligible. The primary endpoint was the mental health, assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. Sources of stress during the crisis were assessed using the Perceived Stressors in Intensive Care Units (PS-ICU) scale. Epidemic intensity was defined as high or low for each region based on publicly available data from Santé Publique France. Effects were assessed using linear mixed models, moderation and mediation analyses. RESULTS: In total, 2643 health professionals participated; 64.36% in high-intensity zones. Professionals in areas with greater epidemic intensity were at higher risk of mental health issues (p < 0.001), and higher levels of overall perceived stress (p < 0.001), compared to low-intensity zones. Factors associated with higher overall perceived stress were female sex (B = 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.17), having a relative at risk of COVID-19 (B = 0.14; 95%-CI = 0.09-0.18) and working in high-intensity zones (B = 0.11; 95%-CI = 0.02-0.20). Perceived stress mediated the impact of the crisis context on mental health (B = 0.23, 95%-CI = 0.05, 0.41) and the impact of stress on mental health was moderated by positive thinking, b = - 0.32, 95% CI = - 0.54, - 0.11. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 negatively impacted the mental health of ICU professionals. Professionals working in zones where the epidemic was of high intensity were significantly more affected, with higher levels of perceived stress. This study is supported by a grant from the French Ministry of Health (PHRC-COVID 2020).","Laurent, Alexandra; Fournier, Alicia; Lheureux, Florent; Louis, Guillaume; Nseir, Saad; Jacq, Gwenaelle; Goulenok, Cyril; Muller, Grégoire; Badie, Julio; Bouhemad, Bélaïd; Georges, Marjolaine; Mertes, Paul-Michel; Merdji, Hamid; Castelain, Vincent; Abdulmalak, Caroline; Lesieur, Olivier; Plantefeve, Gaëtan; Lacherade, Jean-Claude; Rigaud, Jean-Philippe; Sedillot, Nicholas; Roux, Damien; Terzi, Nicolas; Beuret, Pascal; Monsel, Antoine; Poujol, Anne-Laure; Kuteifan, Khaldoun; Vanderlinden, Thierry; Renault, Anne; Vivet, Bérengère; Vinsonneau, Christophe; Barbar, Saber Davide; Capellier, Gilles; Dellamonica, Jean; Ehrmann, Stephan; Rimmelé, Thomas; Bohé, Julien; Bouju, Pierre; Gibot, Sébastien; Lévy, Bruno; Temime, Johanna; Pichot, Cyrille; Schnell, David; Friedman, Diane; Asfar, Pierre; Lebas, Eddy; Mateu, Philippe; Klouche, Kada; Audibert, Juliette; Ecarnot, Fiona; Meunier-Beillard, Nicolas",Ann Intensive Care,208,24

Inflexible responding is observed early in the course of the illness and contributes to the financial and social morbidities of FTD. Reversal learning is an established cognitive paradigm that indexes flexible responding in the face of feedback signaling a change in reinforcement contingencies, with components of reversal learning associated with specific neurotransmitter systems. The objective of the study was to evaluate the neural mechanisms underlying impaired flexible behavioural responding in FTD using a reversal learning paradigm combined with fMRI. METHODS: Twenty-two patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for FTD and twenty-one healthy controls completed the study. Participants completed an fMRI-adapted reversal learning task that indexes behavioural flexibility when provided positive and negative feedback. RESULTS: Patients with FTD demonstrated poorer behavioural flexibility relative to controls and abnormal BOLD responses within the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses made during the learning phase, and during correct responses when reward contingencies were reversed. As well, patients showed decreased activity within the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex to incorrect responses compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that reversal learning impairments in patients with FTD, in particular those with frontal predominant atrophy, may be related to impaired flexible motor responding when selecting among several choices and deficient attention to relevant stimuli during instances of conflict (i.e., receiving negative feedback). These results and the associated neurotransmitter systems mediating these regions may provide targets for future pharmacological or behavioural interventions mediating these cognitive deficits.","Tavares, Tamara P; Mitchell, Derek G V; Coleman, Kristy K L; Finger, Elizabeth",Cortex,208,1

This article considers if and when it may be ethically acceptable to impose selective liberty-restricting measures in order to reduce the negative impacts of a pandemic by preventing particularly vulnerable groups of the community from contracting the disease. We argue that the commonly accepted explanation-that liberty restrictions may be justified to prevent harm to others when this is the least restrictive option-fails to adequately accommodate the complexity of the issue or the difficult choices that must be made, as illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We introduce a dualist consequentialist approach, weighing utility at both a population and individual level, which may provide a better framework for considering the justification for liberty restrictions. While liberty-restricting measures may be justified on the basis of significant benefits to the population and small costs for overall utility to individuals, the question of whether it is acceptable to discriminate should be considered separately. This is because the consequentialist approach does not adequately account for the value of equality. This value may be protected through the application of an additional proportionality test. An algorithm for making decisions is proposed. Ultimately whether selective liberty-restricting measures are imposed will depend on a range of factors, including how widespread infection is in the community, the level of risk and harm a society is willing to accept, and the efficacy and cost of other mitigation options.","Cameron, James; Williams, Bridget; Ragonnet, Romain; Marais, Ben; Trauer, James; Savulescu, Julian",J Med Ethics,208,7

To continue pharmacy services, it is critical that pharmacists are prepared for disasters. A systematic literature review was conducted to explore pharmacists' and pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters and the factors that affect preparedness. METHODS: This review was conducted in April 2020 through electronic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO, and two disaster journals. Search terms such as 'pharmacist*', 'disaster*' and 'prepared*' were used. The search yielded an initial 1781 titles. Articles were included if they measured pharmacists or pharmacy students' disaster preparedness. After screening and quality appraisal by two researchers, four articles were included in final analysis and review. Data were extracted using a data collection tool formulated by the researchers. Meta-analysis was not possible; instead, results were compared across key areas including preparedness ratings and factors that influenced preparedness. KEY FINDINGS: Three articles focused on pharmacy students' preparedness for disasters, and one on registered pharmacists' preparedness. Preparedness across both groups was poor to moderate with <18% of registered pharmacists found to be prepared to respond to a disaster. Factors that potentially influenced preparedness included disaster competency, disaster interventions and demographic factors. CONCLUSION: For pharmacists, the lack of research around their preparedness speaks volumes about their current involvement and expectations within disaster management. Without a prepared pharmacy workforce and pharmacy involvement in disaster management, critical skill and service gaps in disasters may negatively impact patients.","McCourt, Elizabeth; Singleton, Judith; Tippett, Vivienne; Nissen, Lisa",,208,22

Therefore, available, safe, and inexpensive drugs and supplements such as melatonin are among the proposed options for controlling inflammation. We did a randomized, single-blind study in Imam Khomeini Hospital between June 30, 2020, and August 5, 2020. Mild to moderate COVID-19 patients aged 25-65 years were eligible to enter the study based on chest CT scan, clinical symptoms, and physician diagnosis. The intervention group was prescribed 6 mg of oral melatonin for 2 weeks, which consumed half an hour before bedtime every night in low light conditions. Clinical symptoms and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and after treatment in the melatonin received and control (regular medications) groups. Among screened patients with COVID-19, 14 patients were assigned to receive melatonin, and 17 patients were considered as controls. A significant difference (p=0.005) between CRP 1 and CRP 2 levels (before and after using melatonin) was found in the melatonin group while this difference (p=0.069) was not significant in the control group. Also, the percentage of recovery (based on symptoms) in patients who took melatonin was higher than that of patients in the control group (85.7% VS 47.1%). The result of this study confirmed the effectiveness of melatonin in mild to moderate outpatients with COVID-19. More clinical trials on elderly, diabetic, obese patients and severe cases are suggested in future studies.","Alizadeh, Z.; Keyhanian, N.; Ghaderkhani, S.; Dashti-Khavidaki, S.; Shokouhi Shoormasti, R.; Pourpak, Z.",Iran J Allergy Asthma Immunol,208,26

The G-form is more infectious in vitro and is associated with increased viral loads in the upper airways. To gain insight into the molecular-level underpinnings of these characteristics, we used microsecond all-atom simulations. We show that changes in the protein energetics favor a higher population of infection-capable states in the G-form through release of asymmetry present in the D-form inter-protomer interactions. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive owing to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies. These results are critical for vaccine design.","Mansbach, Rachael A; Chakraborty, Srirupa; Nguyen, Kien; Montefiori, David C; Korber, Bette; Gnanakaran, S",Sci. Adv,208,30

COVID-19 is an unprecedented disaster that has disrupted lives worldwide and led to a rise in the incidence of mental health disorders. Given the widespread economic devastation due to COVID-19, many RA patients, already susceptible to mental illness, maybe at an increased risk of inaccessibility to medical care, accentuated stress, and consequent worsening of existent mental health disorders, or the onset of new mental health disorders such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or depression. The objective of this review is to assess if there is an increased risk of mental health disorders in patients with RA during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine has bridged the transition to remote chronic care in the pandemic period, though certain accessibility and technological challenges are to be addressed. Decreased access to care amid lockdowns and a proposed triggering of disease activity in patients with autoimmune disorders may potentially herald a massive spike in incidence or flares of patients diagnosed with RA in the coming months. Such a deluge of cases may be potentially devastating to an overburdened healthcare system. Rheumatologists may need to prepare for this eventuality and explore techniques to provide adequate care during these challenging times. The authors found that there is a significant association between the adverse impact on the mental health of RA patients and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, more research is needed to highlight individual risk factors.","Bhatia, Ansh; Kc, Manish; Gupta, Latika",Rheumatol Int,208,18

SARS-CoV-2, which crossed species barriers to infect humans, is highly contagious and associated with high lethality due to multi-organ failure, mostly in older patients with other co-morbidities. RECENT FINDINGS: Accumulating clinical evidence demonstrates that the intensity of the infection and its complications are more prominent in men. It has been postulated that potential functional modulation of ACE2 by estrogen may explain the sex difference in morbidity and mortality. We review here the evidence regarding the role of estrogenic hormones in ACE2 expression and regulation, with the intent of bringing to the forefront potential mechanisms that may explain sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes, assist in management of COVID-19, and uncover new therapeutic strategies.","Groban, Leanne; Wang, Hao; Sun, Xuming; Ahmad, Sarfaraz; Ferrario, Carlos M",Curr Hypertens Rep,208,24

We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 immune response via SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection in 23 renal transplant recipients after two doses of the mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BNT162b2 following the standard protocol. The antibody response was evaluated once with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG CLIA 15.8 +/- 3.0 days after the second dose. As a control, SARS-CoV-2 IgG was determined in 23 healthcare workers (HCW) and compared to the patient cohort.

Major concerns over personal hygiene, mandated and ease in lockdown actions and slackening of some policy measures have led to a massive surge in the use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) and other single-use plastic items. This generated an enormous amount of plastic waste from both healthcare and household units, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Apart from the healthcare workers, the general public have become accustomed to using PPE. These habits are threatening the land and marine environment with immense loads of plastic waste, due to improper disposal practices across the world, especially in developing nations. Contaminated PPE has already made its way to the oceans which will inevitably produce plastic particles alongside other pathogen-driven diseases. This study provided an estimation-based approach in quantifying the amount of contaminated plastic waste that can be expected daily from the massive usage of PPE (e.g. facemasks) because of the countrywide mandated regulations on PPE usage. The situation of Bangladesh has been analysed and projections revealed that a total of 3.4 billion pieces of single-use facemask, hand sanitizer bottles, hand gloves and disposable polyethylene bags will be produced monthly, which will give rise to 472.30 t of disposable plastic waste per day. The equations provided for the quantification of waste from used single-use plastic and PPE can be used for other countries for rough estimations. Then, the discussed recommendations will help concerned authorities and policy makers to design effective response plans.

Thus, we investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and further determined the risk factors for cardiac involvement in them. Methods and Results We analyzed data from 102 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (52 women aged 19-87 years). Epidemiologic and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, chest imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes were collected. Patients were divided into acute cardiac injury, with and without cardiac marker abnormities groups according to different level of cardiac markers. In this research, cardiac involvement was found in 72 of the 102 (70.6%) patients: tachycardia (n=20), electrocardiography abnormalities (n=23), echocardiography abnormalities (n=59), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=55), and acute cardiac injury (n=9). Eight patients with acute cardiac injury were aged >60 years; seven of them had &#8805;2 underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic kidney disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia was much more severe in the patients with acute cardiac injury than in patients with nondefinite acute cardiac injury (P<0.001). Multivariate analyses showed that CRP (C-reactive protein) levels, old age, novel coronavirus pneumonia severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions Cardiac involvements are common in patients with COVID-19. Elevated CRP levels, old age, underlying comorbidities, and novel coronavirus pneumonia severity are the main risk factors for cardiac involvement in patients with COVID-19. More attention should be given to cardiovascular protection during COVID-19 treatment for mortality reduction.

Preventive measures like social distancing and mask usage have been taken all around the globe but still, as of September 2020, the number of cases continues to rise in many countries. Evidently, these measures are insufficient. Although decreases in population density and surges in the public's usage of personal protective equipment can mitigate direct transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), indirect transmission of the virus is still probable. By summarizing the current state of knowledge on the stability of coronaviruses on dry materials, this review uncovers the high potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contaminated surfaces (i.e., fomites) and prompts future research. Fully contextualized data on coronavirus persistence are presented. The methods and limitations to testing the stability of coronaviruses are explored, and the SARS-CoV-2 representativeness of different coronaviruses is analyzed. The factors which dictate the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces (media, environmental conditions, and material-type) are investigated, and the review is concluded by encouraging material innovation to combat the current pandemic. To summarize, SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on the timescale of days on hard surfaces under ambient indoor conditions. Similarly, the virus is stable on human skin, signifying the necessity of hand hygiene amidst the current pandemic. There is an inverse relationship between SARS-CoV-2 surface persistence and temperature/humidity, and the virus is well suited to air-conditioned environments (room temperature, ~ 40% relative humidity). Sunlight may rapidly inactivate the virus, suggesting that indirect transmission predominantly occurs indoors. The development of antiviral materials and surface coatings would be an extremely effective method to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To obtain applicable data on the persistence of coronaviruses and the efficiency of virucidal materials, future researchers should understand the common experimental limitations outlined in this review and plan their studies accordingly.","Bueckert, Max; Gupta, Rishi; Gupta, Aditi; Garg, Mohit; Mazumder, Asit",,208,16

The greatest threat that is disrupting the normal functioning of society is the exceptionally high species independent transmission. Drug repurposing is understood to be the best strategy to immediately deploy well-characterized agents against new pathogens. Several repurposable drugs are already in evaluation for determining suitability to treat COVID-19. One such promising compound includes heparin, which is widely used in reducing thrombotic events associated with COVID-19 induced pathology. As part of identifying target-specific antiviral compounds among FDA and world-approved libraries using high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS), we previously evaluated top hits for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we report results of highly efficacious viral entry blocking properties of heparin (IC50 = 12.3 nM) in the complete virus assay, and further, propose ways to use it as a potential transmission blocker. Exploring further, our in-silico analysis indicated that the heparin interacts with post-translational glycoconjugates present on spike proteins. The patterns of accessible spike-glycoconjugates in open and closed states are completely contrasted by one another. Heparin-binding to the open conformation of spike structurally supports the state and may aid ACE2 binding as reported with cell surface-bound heparan sulfate. We also studied spike protein mutant variants' heparin interactions for possible resistance. Based on available data and optimal absorption properties by the skin, heparin could potentially be used to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Studies should be designed to exploit its nanomolar antiviral activity to formulate heparin as topical or inhalation-based formulations, particularly on exposed areas and sites of primary viremia e.g. ACE2 rich epithelia of the eye (conjunctiva/lids), nasal cavity, and mouth.","Gupta, Yash; Maciorowski, Dawid; Zak, Samantha E; Kulkarni, Chandrashekhar V; Herbert, Andrew S; Durvasula, Ravi; Fareed, Jawed; Dye, John M; Kempaiah, Prakasha",Int J Biol Macromol,208,24

Recently, saliva samples have been suggested as an alternative sample. In the present study, we aimed to compare RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients. 98 of 200 patients were positive in RT-PCR analysis performed before the hospitalization. On day 0, at least one sample was positive in 67 % of 98 patients. The positivity rate was 83 % for both oro-nasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 63 % for saliva samples (pâ¯<â¯0.001). On day 5, RT-PCR was performed in 59 patients, 34 % had at least one positive result. The positivity rate was 55 % for both saliva and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 60 % for oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Our study shows that the sampling saliva does not increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests at the early stages of infection. However, on the 5th day, viral RNA detection rates in saliva were similar to nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. In conclusion, we suggest that, in patients receiving treatment, RT-PCR in saliva, in addition to the standard samples, is important to determine the isolation period and control transmission.","Dogan, Ozlem Akgun; Kose, Betsi; Agaoglu, Nihat Bugra; Yildiz, Jale; Alkurt, Gizem; Demirkol, Yasemin Kendir; Irvem, Arzu; Doganay, Gizem Dinler; Doganay, Levent",J Virol Methods,208,33

Manual monitoring of social distancing norms is impractical with a large population moving about and with insufficient task force and resources to administer them. There is a need for a lightweight, robust and 24X7 video-monitoring system that automates this process. This paper proposes a comprehensive and effective solution to perform person detection, social distancing violation detection, face detection and face mask classification using object detection, clustering and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based binary classifier. For this, YOLOv3, Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN), Dual Shot Face Detector (DSFD) and MobileNetV2 based binary classifier have been employed on surveillance video datasets. This paper also provides a comparative study of different face detection and face mask classification models. Finally, a video dataset labelling method is proposed along with the labelled video dataset to compensate for the lack of dataset in the community and is used for evaluation of the system. The system performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, F1 score as well as the prediction time, which has to be low for practical applicability. The system performs with an accuracy of 91.2% and F1 score of 90.79% on the labelled video dataset and has an average prediction time of 7.12 seconds for 78 frames of a video. © 2021 IEEE.","Srinivasan, S.; Rujula Singh, R.; Biradar, R.

The aim of this retrospective single-center study was to investigate the impact of hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism on respiratory outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Three-hundred-forty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milan (Italy) were evaluated for arterial partial pressure oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, serum 25hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inflammatory parameters at study entry and need of ventilation during the hospital stay. RESULTS: In the entire population, vitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D values < 12 ng/mL) was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at the study entry [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.74; P = 0.006], independently of age and sex of subjects, serum calcium and inflammatory parameters. In patients evaluated for serum PTH (97 cases), secondary hyperparathyroidism combined with vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at study entry (P = 0.001) and need of ventilation during the hospital stay (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that vitamin D deficiency, when associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, may negatively impact the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia.","Mazziotti, G; Lavezzi, E; Brunetti, A; Mirani, M; Favacchio, G; Pizzocaro, A; Sandri, M T; Di Pasquale, A; Voza, A; Ciccarelli, M; Lania, A G",J. endocrinol. invest,208,1

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical and imaging data from 262 cases of confirmed viral pneumonia in 20 hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from March 1, 2015 to March 15, 2020. According to the virus responsible for the pneumonia, the pneumonias were divided into non-COVID-19 (141 cases) and COVID-19 (121 cases). The non-COVID-19 pneumonias comprised cytomegalovirus (CMV) (31 cases), influenza A virus (82 cases), and influenza B virus (20 cases). The differences in the basic clinical characteristics, lesion distribution, location and imaging signs among the four viral pneumonias were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Fever and cough were the most common clinical symptoms of the four viral pneumonias. Compared with the COVID-19 patients, the non-COVID-19 patients had higher proportions of fatigue, sore throat, expectorant and chest tightness (all P<0.000). In addition, in the CMV pneumonia patients, the proportions of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and leukopenia were high (all PP<0.000). Comparison of the imaging findings of the four viral pneumonias showed that the pulmonary lesions of COVID-19 were more likely to occur in the peripheral and lower lobes of both lungs, whereas those of CMV pneumonia were diffusely distributed. Compared with the non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to present as ground-glass opacity, intralobular interstitial thickening, vascular thickening and halo sign (all PP<0.05). In addition, in the early stage of COVID-19, extensive consolidation, fibrous stripes, subpleural lines, crazy-paving pattern, tree-in-bud, mediastinal lymphadenectasis, pleural thickening and pleural effusion were rare (all PP<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The HRCT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias overlapped significantly, but many important differential imaging features could still be observed.","Huang, Yilong; Jiang, Yuanming; Li, Zhenhui; Han, Dan; Wu, Li; Ma, Jiyao; Wang, Peng; Xie, Ying; Li, Zhipeng; Li, Xiang; Hong, Minchang; Zhou, Jialong; Duan, Chuwei; Yang, Yunhui; Zhao, Wei; Yuan, Feng; Wang, Kunhua; Yi, Wenfang; He, Bo",Ann Palliat Med,208,29

The number of CoVs present in an area is strongly correlated with local bat species richness, which in turn is affected by climatic conditions that drive the geographical distributions of species. Here we show that the southern Chinese Yunnan province and neighbouring regions in Myanmar and Laos form a global hotspot of climate change-driven increase in bat richness. This region coincides with the likely spatial origin of bat-borne ancestors of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Accounting for an estimated increase in the order of 100 bat-borne CoVs across the region, climate change may have played a key role in the evolution or transmission of the two SARS CoVs.","Beyer, Robert M; Manica, Andrea; Mora, Camilo",Sci Total Environ,208,26

During the pandemic, whole genome sequencing has played an important role in understanding the evolution and genomic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Although an unprecedented number of SARS-CoV-2 full genomes have been submitted in GISAID and NCBI, data from Pakistan is scarce. We report the sequencing, genomic characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from patients in Pakistan. The oropharyngeal swabs of patients that were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 through real-time RT-PCR at National Institute of Health, Pakistan, were selected for whole-genome sequencing. Sequencing was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina (NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Inc., MA, US) and Illumina iSeq 100 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, US). Based on whole-genome analysis, three Pakistani SARS-CoV-2 strains clustered into the 20A (GH) clade along with the strains from Oman, Slovakia, United States, and Pakistani strain EPI_ISL_513925. The two 19B (S)-clade strains were closely related to viruses from India and Oman. Overall, twenty-nine amino acid mutations were detected in the current study genome sequences, including fifteen missense and four novel mutations. Notably, we have found a D614G (aspartic acid to glycine) mutation in spike protein of the sequences from the GH clade. The G614 variant carrying the characteristic D614G mutation has been shown to be more infectious that lead to its rapid spread worldwide. This report highlights the detection of GH and S clade strains and G614 variant from Pakistan warranting large-scale whole-genome sequencing of strains prevalent in different regions to understand virus evolution and to explore their genetic diversity.","Umair, Massab; Ikram, Aamer; Salman, Muhammad; Khurshid, Adnan; Alam, Masroor; Badar, Nazish; Suleman, Rana; Tahir, Faheem; Sharif, Salmaan; Montgomery, Joel; Whitmer, Shannon; Klena, John",PLoS One,208,28

Moreover, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated HCC has a unique molecular pathogenesis. Approximately 25% of all HCCs present with potentially actionable mutations, which are yet to be translated into the clinical practice.

In spite of its clinical relevance and impact on feline health, currently the therapeutic possibilities for treatment of FIP in cats are limited. The emergence of the pandemic Severe Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), etiological agent of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), able to infect a broad spectrum of animal species including cats, triggered the interest for the development of novel molecules with antiviral activity for treatment of CoV infections in humans and animals. Essential oils (EOs) have raised significant attention for their antiviral properties integrating and, in some cases, replacing conventional drugs. Thymus vulgaris EO (TEO) has been previously shown to be effective against several RNA viruses including CoVs. In the present study the antiviral efficacy of TEO against FIPV was evaluated in vitro. TEO at 27 µg/ml was able to inhibit virus replication with a significant reduction of 2 log10 TCID50/50 µl. Moreover, virucidal activity was tested using TEO at 27 and 270 µg/ml, over the cytotoxic threshold, determining a reduction of viral titre as high as 3.25 log10 TCID50/50 µl up to 1 h of time contact.

However, no study has investigated whether maintaining bound representations with more features in WM requires extra object-based attention. We investigated this by examining whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was more disruptive to the maintenance of bindings in WM when more features were stored per object. We instructed participants to memorize three bound representations in a WM task while manipulating the number of features (two vs. three features) contained in each representation. Moreover, we manipulated whether a secondary task consuming object-based attention was interpolated into the maintenance phase of WM. If extra object-based attention was required after the addition of an extra feature in the bound representation, the secondary task would result in a greater disruption of the three- rather than two-featured binding. In two experiments, we found that the added secondary task significantly impaired the binding performance, but the performance of the two- and three-featured bindings was disrupted to the same extent. These results suggest that the presence of more features in a bound representation in WM does not require extra object-based attention.","Zhou, Ying; Wu, Fan; Wan, Xueyi; Shen, Mowei; Gao, Zaifeng",Mem. cogn,208,16

The possible causes of the incidence observed in them are explained and how CF Units have faced this health challenge is detailed. METHODS: Retrospective descriptive observational study, for which a Spanish CF Patients with Confirmed COVID-19 Registry is created, requesting information on number of people affected between 8 March-16 May 2020 and their clinical-demographic characteristics from the CF Units participating in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR). The accumulated incidence is calculated, compared with that of the general population. Additionally, a survey (CF-COVID19-Spain) is carried out on prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, workings of CF Units and possible reasons for the incidence observed. RESULTS: COVID-19 was diagnosed in eight CF patients, one of whom had received a lung transplant. The accumulated incidence was 32/10000 in CF patients and 49/10000 in the general population.

Uncertainty in the timing and degree of surge complicates planning efforts, putting hospitals at risk of being overwhelmed. Many lack access to hospital-specific, data-driven projections of future patient demand to guide operational planning. Our hospital experienced one of the largest surges in New England. We developed statistical models to project hospitalizations during the first wave of the pandemic. We describe how we used these models to meet key planning objectives. To build the models successfully, we emphasize the criticality of having a team that combines data scientists with frontline operational and clinical leadership. While modeling was a cornerstone of our response, models currently available to most hospitals are built outside of their institution and are difficult to translate to their environment for operational planning. Creating data-driven, hospital-specific, and operationally relevant surge targets and activation triggers should be a major objective of all health systems.","Safavi, Kyan C; Prestipino, Ann L; Zenteno Langle, Ana Cecilia; Copenhaver, Martin; Hu, Michael; Daily, Bethany; Koehler, Allison; Biddinger, Paul D; Dunn, Peter F",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,208,1

Parenchymal changes of placentas from COVID-19 infected mothers have been reported by several groups, but the localization and relative abundance of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and cellular entry machinery has not been fully characterized within larger placental tissue cohorts. METHODS: An extended placental tissue cohort including samples from 15 COVID-19 positive maternal-fetal dyads (with n = 5 cases with evidence of fetal transmission) in comparison with 10 contemporary COVID-19 negative controls. Using comparative immunofluorescence, we examined the localization and relative tissue abundance of SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein (CoV2 SP) along with the co-localization of two SARS-CoV2 viral entry proteins angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: CoV2 SP was present within the villous placenta in COVID-19 positive pregnancies with and without evidence of fetal transmission. We further identified the predominance of ACE2 expression in comparison with TMPRSS2. Importantly, both CoV2 SP and ACE2 expression consistently localized primarily within the outer syncytiotrophoblast layer placental villi, a key physiologic interface between mother and fetus. Overall this study provides an important basis for the ongoing evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 physiology in pregnancy and highlights the importance of the placenta as a key source of primary human tissue for ongoing diagnostic and therapeutic research efforts to reduce the global burden of COVID-19.","Taglauer, Elizabeth; Benarroch, Yoel; Rop, Kevin; Barnett, Elizabeth; Sabharwal, Vishakha; Yarrington, Christina; Wachman, Elisha M",Placenta,208,1

Interestingly, CS-induced dysregulation of pulmonary renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in part contributing into the potential pathogenesis COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, CS-mediated ACE2 activations is not the main pathway for increasing the risk of COVID-19, it appeared that AngII/AT1R might induce an inflammatory-burst in COVID-19 response by up-regulating cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4), which hydrolyses specifically the second intracellular messenger 3', 5'-cyclic AMP (cAMP). It must be pointed out that CS might induce PDE4 up-regulation similarly to the COVID-19 inflammation, and therefore could potentiate COVID-19 inflammation opening the potential therapeutic effects of PDE4 inhibitor in both COVID-19-inflammation and CS.","Lugnier, Claire; Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M; Rousseau, Eric",Biochem Pharmacol,208,16

Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. The urokinase receptor system is a key regulator of the intersection between inflammation, immunity, and coagulation, and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) has been identified as an immunologic risk factor for AKI. Whether suPAR is associated with COVID-19-related AKI is unknown. METHODS: In a multinational observational study of adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19, we measured suPAR levels in plasma samples from 352 adult patients that had been collected within 48 hours of admission. We examined the association between suPAR levels and incident in-hospital AKI. RESULTS: Of the 352 patients (57.4% were male, 13.9% were black, and mean age was 61 years), 91 (25.9%) developed AKI during their hospitalization, of whom 25 (27.4%) required dialysis. The median suPAR level was 5.61 ng/ml. AKI incidence rose with increasing suPAR tertiles, from a 6.0% incidence in patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml (first tertile) to a 45.8% incidence of AKI in patients with suPAR levels >6.86 ng/ml (third tertile). None of the patients with suPAR <4.60 ng/ml required dialysis during their hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, the highest suPAR tertile was associated with a 9.15-fold increase in the odds of AKI (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3.64 to 22.93) and a 22.86-fold increase in the odds of requiring dialysis (95% CI, 2.77 to 188.75). The association was independent of inflammatory markers and persisted across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Admission suPAR levels in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 are predictive of in-hospital AKI and the need for dialysis. SuPAR may be a key component of the pathophysiology of AKI in COVID-19.","Azam, Tariq U; Shadid, Husam R; Blakely, Pennelope; O039,; Hayer, Patrick; Berlin, Hanna; Pan, Michael; Zhao, Peiyao; Zhao, Lili; Pennathur, Subramaniam; Pop-Busui, Rodica; Altintas, Izzet; Tingleff, Jens; Stauning, Marius A; Andersen, Ove; Adami, Maria-Evangelia; Solomonidi, Nicky; Tsilika, Maria; Tober-Lau, Pinkus; Arnaoutoglou, Eleni; Keitel, Verena; Tacke, Frank; Chalkias, Athanasios; Loosen, Sven H; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Eugen-Olsen, Jesper; Reiser, Jochen; Hayek, Salim S",J Am Soc Nephrol,208,29

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. RESULTS: Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications. CONCLUSION: The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP can effectively assess disease severity and predict outcome in patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Fang; Li, Lin; Xu, MengDa; Wu, Juan; Luo, Ding; Zhu, YuSi; Li, BiXi; Song, XiaoYang; Zhou, Xiang",J Clin Virol,208,1

Thousands of pigs had to be destroyed on the farm due to reduced slaughter capacity caused by ill workers. In the future, both short-term and long-term remedies will be needed. In the short-term, a portable electrocution unit that uses scientifically validated electrical parameters for inducing instantaneous unconsciousness, would be preferable to some of the poor killing methods. A second alternative would be converting the slaughter houses to carcass production. This would require fewer people to process the same number of pigs. The pandemic revealed the fragility of large centralized supply chains. A more distributed supply chain with smaller abattoirs would be more robust and less prone to disruption, but the cost of pork would be greater. Small abattoirs can coexist with large slaughter facilities if they process pigs for specialized premium markets such as high welfare pork. The pandemic also had a detrimental effect on animal welfare inspection and third party auditing programs run by large meat buyers. Most in-person audits in the slaughter plants were cancelled and audits were done by video. Video audits should never completely replace in-person audits.","Grandin, Temple",,208,12

A reduction in pH from 6.7 to 6 in the lung, as observed in respiratory disease, led to 20-, 4.0- and 2.7-fold increases in lung exposure of CQ, HCQ and AZ, respectively. Simulations indicated that the relatively high concentrations of CQ and HCQ in lung tissue were sustained long after administration of the drugs had stopped. Patients with COVID-19 often present with kidney failure. Our simulations indicate that renal impairment (plus lung pH reduction) caused 30-, 8.0- and 3.4-fold increases in lung exposures for CQ, HCQ and AZ, respectively, with relatively small accompanying increases (20 to 30%) in systemic exposure. Although a number of different dosage regimens were assessed, the purpose of our study was not to provide recommendations for a dosing strategy, but to demonstrate the utility of a PBPK modelling approach to estimate lung concentrations. This, used in conjunction with robust in vitro and clinical data, can help in the assessment of COVID-19 therapeutics going forward.","Rowland Yeo, Karen; Zhang, Mian; Pan, Xian; Ban Ke, Alice; Jones, Hannah M; Wesche, David; Almond, Lisa M",Clin. pharmacol. ther,208,29

The initial management in the trauma bay follows detailed international valid algorithms. This study aims to work out potential adjustments of trauma bay algorithms during a global pandemic in order to reduce contamination and to increase safety for patients and medical personnel. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared patients admitted to the trauma bay of one academic level-one trauma centre in March and April 2019 with patients admitted in March and April 2020. Based on these datasets, possible adjustments of the current international guidelines of trauma bay management were discussed. RESULTS: Group Pan (2020, n = 30) included two-thirds the number of patients compared with Group Ref (2019, n = 44). The number of severely injured patients comparable amongst these groups: mean injury severity score (ISS) was significantly lower in Group Pan (10.5 ± 4.4 points) compared with Group Ref (15.3 ± 9.2 points, p = 0.035). Duration from admission to whole-body CT was significantly higher in Group Pan (23.8 ± 9.4 min) compared with Group Ref (17.3 ± 10.7 min, p = 0.046). Number of trauma bay admissions decreased, as did the injury severity for patients admitted in March and April 2020. In order to contain spreading of SARS Cov-2, the suggested recommendations of adjusting trauma bay protocols for severely injured patients include (1) minimizing trauma bay team members with direct contact to the patient; (2) reducing repeated examination as much as possible, with rationalized use of protective equipment; and (3) preventing potential secondary inflammatory insults. CONCLUSION: Appropriate adjustments of trauma bay protocols during pandemics should improve safety for both patients and medical personnel while guaranteeing the optimal treatment quality. The above-mentioned proposals have the potential to improve safety during trauma bay management in a time of a global pandemic.","Halvachizadeh, Sascha; Teuben, Michel; Berk, Till; Neuhaus, Valentin; Pape, Hans-Christoph; Pfeifer, Roman",Int Orthop,208,25

We suggest the diagnostic serial interval, the time between the diagnosis of the infector and infectee, as a new indicator for the effectiveness of contact tracing. METHODS: Using an agent-based simulation model, we demonstrate how the diagnostic serial interval correlates with the course of the epidemic. We consider four scenarios of how diagnosis and subsequent isolation are triggered: 1. never, 2. by symptoms, 3. by symptoms and loose contact tracing, 4. by symptoms and tight contact tracing. We further refine scenario 3 and 4 with different lengths of target diagnostic serial intervals. RESULTS: Scenarios 1 and 2 did not yield a notable difference. In scenarios 3 and 4, however, contact tracing led to a decrease of the height of the epidemic as well as the cumulative proportion of infected agents. Generally, the shorter the diagnostic serial interval was, the smaller the peak of the epidemic became, and the more proportion of the population remained susceptible at the end of the epidemic. CONCLUSION: A short target diagnosis interval is critical for contact tracing to be effective in the epidemic control. The diagnosis interval can be used to assess and guide the contact tracing strategy.","Mettler, Sofia K; Park, Jewel; Özbek, Orhun; Mettler, Linus K; Ho, Po-Han; Rhim, Hye Chang; Maathuis, Marloes H",Int. j. infect. dis,208,15

This paper presents a supply chain disruption recovery strategy with the motivation of changing the original product type to cope with that. In order to maximize the total profit from product changes, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed with combining emergency procurement on the supply side and product changes by the manufacturer as well as backorder price compensation on the demand side. The model uses a heuristic algorithm based on ILOG CPLEX toolbox. Experimental results show that the proposed disruption recovery strategy can effectively reduce the profit loss of manufacturer due to late delivery and order cancellation. It is observed that the impact of supply chain disruptions is reduced. The proposed model can offer a potentially useful tool to help the manufacturers decide on the optimal recovery strategy whenever the supply chain system experiences a sudden massive disruption.","Chen, Jingzhe; Wang, Hongfeng; Zhong, Ray Y",,208,2

We aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on the HCWs at Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of HCWs using questionnaires in February and March 2020 in Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran. We evaluated depression, stress, and anxiety levels using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using census sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. RESULTS: The study population included 217 HCWs (111 male, 116 female) and the mean age of the study group was 39.6 years old. Approximately two-thirds of the HCWs stayed in the hospital for 2-3 weeks. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a ""severe"" level, while anxiety scores were at an ""extremely severe"" level. The prevalence of severe scores was 38.71%, 2.30%, and 48.97% for depression, anxiety, and stress, and the prevalence of extremely severe scores was 46.54%, 97.24%, and 4.98% depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. In stress subscale, moderate stress was 47.46%. Female HCWs reported higher levels of depression compared with males. CONCLUSION: In this study, HCWs reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological burdens.

This paper uses a simplified yet reliable method to analyse the potential growth and employment effects of this stimulus plan. Based on lower and upper bound values of the country's estimated fiscal multipliers, we built a scenario prediction template with which output and employment expansion can be analysed within specified constraints on the fiscal space and the country's economic dynamics. Our estimation model suggests that with a 50% state participation in the recovery investment, the best case scenario of fiscal stimulation would enable the economy to create 2.23 million jobs over the first 5 years of the stimulus investments (of which 1.74 million would be attributed to the stimulus effect), while the more realistic scenario based of the lower bound value of the fiscal multiplier with only 30% state participation predicts the creation of 1.67 million additional jobs, of which 1.18 million would be attributable to the stimulus. Our analysis also suggests that investing in the types of infrastructure that shift the production technology could change the long-term growth trajectory, while focusing on employment-intensive investment may only generate temporary effects.","Habiyaremye, Alexis; Molewa, Olebogeng; Lekomanyane, Pelontle",Eur J Dev Res,208,16

Here, 10,870 ligands were employed and screened by the molecular docking, which involved 12 kinds of functional foods (carbohydrates, fatty acids, phospholipids, vitamin, ß-sitosterol, flavonoids, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, curcumin, nootkatone, ß-pinene, tincturoid, betulinic acid, and their isomers/analogs/derivatives). Then, 60 ligands were obtained with the good docking affinity. Most of them belong to quercetrin and its isomers/analogs/derivatives, which also showed the highest affinity for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The dynamic simulation indicated that quercetrin-protease and quercetrin-analog-protease showed the excellent stability. Compared with reported docking results, quercetrin should be the best inhibitor for the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the green and white tea are rich in quercetrin and its isomers/analogs/derivatives, tea and relative beverages may become a good option to regulate our metabolism and help us to overcome this special time. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The docking and molecular dynamics technology were combined to screen the functional foods, which would be the potential candidate of the inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2. Many functional foods screened in this work belong to necessary nutrients for body. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 would consume some necessary nutrients, and thus, damage our body. It should be further consideration whether exogenous nutrients should be provided to slow, halt, or reverse biochemical alterations and structural deterioration in our body. On the contrary, this work also provided a new possibility to design a functional food or drug to help us overcome this special time.","Wang, Jiao; Zhang, Xiaoli; Omarini, Alejandra B; Li, Binglin",J Food Biochem,208,16

In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also known as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays an important role in various fields including clinical studies and random sampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers from the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been developed in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the optimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance comparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by developing an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of shrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas for the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation studies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or as well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent meta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical distancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies encounter the zero-event problem.","Wei, Jiajin; He, Ping; Tong, Tiejun",,208,18

METHODS: We summarized the epidemic prevention and control policies in Japan, Italy, China, and Singapore, and analyzed the policy effects of these four countries by using the data published by Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. RESULTS: As of May 27, 2020, the growing trend of new cases in Japan, Italy, China and Singapore has stabilized. However, the cumulative number of confirmed cases (231139) and case-fatality rate (14.3%) in Italy far exceeded those in the other three countries, and the effect of epidemic control was inferior. Singapore began to experience a domestic resurgence after April 5, with a cumulative number of confirmed cases reaching 32,876, but the case-fatality rate remained extremely low (0.1%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in China (84547) was almost stagnant, and the case-fatality rate was low (5.5%). The growth of cumulative confirmed cases in Japan (16661) increased slowly, and the case-fatality rate (4.8%) was slightly lower than that in China. CONCLUSION: This study divided the epidemic prevention and control policies of the four countries into two categories: the blocking measures adopted by China and Singapore, and the mitigation measures adopted by Japan and Italy. According to the Epidemic control results of these four countries, we can conclude that the blocking measures were generally effective. As the core strategy of blocking measures, admitting mild patients into hospital and cases tracing helped curb the spread of the outbreak in Singapore and China. Countries should choose appropriate response strategies on the premise of considering their own situation, increase investment in health resources to ensure global health equity, and eventually control the spread of infectious diseases in the world effectively.","Wang, Xiaohan; Shi, Leiyu; Zhang, Yuyao; Chen, Haiqian; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,208,16

Treg cell development rests on the key activities of the master-switch transcription factor, Foxp3, which establishes the essential core program that defines Treg cell lineage identity in the thymus and peripheral tissues. Moreover, Foxp3+ Treg cells integrate a variety of inflammatory signals from the tissue microenvironment to engage specialized pathways in order to adapt their suppressive functions in situ. CD4 + Treg cell subsets possess mechanisms to control both gene transcription and mRNA translation. Ultimately, the resulting proteome orchestrates distinct cellular processes that poise Treg cell subsets to respond to inflammatory signals in a timely and context-dependent manner in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues for a coordinated modulation of immunity. Thus, understanding how Treg cells control their cellular adaptation in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues may reveal therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory diseases.","Piccirillo, Ciriaco A",Curr Opin Immunol,208,30

Activated macrophages have been shown to produce itaconate, suggesting that these immune cells may employ this metabolite as a weapon against invading bacteria. Here we demonstrate that, in vitro, itaconate can exhibit bactericidal effects under acidic conditions similar to the pH of a macrophage phagosome. In parallel, successful pathogens including Salmonella have acquired a genetic operon encoding itaconate degradation proteins, which are induced heavily in macrophages. We characterize the regulation of this operon by the neighbouring gene, ripR, in specific response to itaconate. Moreover, we develop an itaconate biosensor based on the operon promoter that can detect itaconate in a semi-quantitative manner and, when combined with the ripR gene, is sufficient for itaconate-regulated expression in E. coli Using this biosensor with fluorescence microscopy, we observe bacteria responding to itaconate in the phagosomes of macrophage and provide additional evidence that interferon-Î³ stimulates macrophage itaconate synthesis and that J774 mouse macrophages produce substantially more itaconate than the human THP-1 monocyte cell line. In summary, we examine the role of itaconate as an antibacterial metabolite in mouse and human macrophage, characterize the regulation of Salmonella's defense against it, and develop it as a convenient itaconate biosensor and inducible promoter system.","Hersch, Steven J; Navarre, William Wiley",Infect. immun,208,24

In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at reducing spread of the virus when compliance is high. Given the current shortages of medical masks, we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. Because many respiratory particles become smaller due to evaporation, we recommend increasing focus on a previously overlooked aspect of mask usage: mask wearing by infectious people (""source control"") with benefits at the population level, rather than only mask wearing by susceptible people, such as health care workers, with focus on individual outcomes. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.","Howard, Jeremy; Huang, Austin; Li, Zhiyuan; Tufekci, Zeynep; Zdimal, Vladimir; van der Westhuizen, Helene-Mari; von Delft, Arne; Price, Amy; Fridman, Lex; Tang, Lei-Han; Tang, Viola; Watson, Gregory L; Bax, Christina E; Shaikh, Reshama; Questier, Frederik; Hernandez, Danny; Chu, Larry F; Ramirez, Christina M; Rimoin, Anne W",Proc.

We investigate a novel model for super-spreader events, not based on the contact structure but on a random contact rate: Many individuals become infected synchronously in single contact events. We use the branching-process approach for contact tracing to analyze the impact of super-spreader events on the effect of contact tracing. Roughly speaking, we find that contact tracing is more efficient in the presence of super-spreaders if the fraction of symptomatics is small, the tracing probability is high, or the latency period is distinctively larger than the incubation period. In other cases, the effect of contact tracing can be decreased by super-spreaders. Numerical analysis with parameters suited for SARS-CoV-2 indicates that super-spreaders do not decrease the effect of contact tracing crucially in case of that infection.","Muller, Johannes; Hosel, Volker",,208,16

METHODS: This was a cross sectional analytical study done at a tertiary care teaching hospital in India including patients with RMDs who were not on biological diseases modifying agents. Assessment of disease status, socioeconomic status and economic impact of COVID-19 was done via tele-consultation. RESULTS: Out of the 680 patients satisfying inclusion criteria, 373 completed the study. The format was found easy by 334 (89.6%) of them and 284 (76.1%) considered tele-rheumatology better than in-person consultation. During the pre-COVID months, the median monthly per capita income of the families of our patients and cost of illness was Indian rupees (INR) 2000 (US$ 26) and INR 1685 (US$ 21.91), respectively. Families whose financial needs were met (OR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.239, 0.598) or those with schooling upto at least secondary school (OR = 0.442, 95% CI: 0.260, 0.752) (P =0.002) were less likely to stop prescription drugs. In a hypothetical model, 289 (77.4%) could be successfully switched to tele-rheumatology follow-up. CONCLUSION: The acceptability of tele-rheumatology among socioeconomically marginalized patients with RMDs is good. During times of crisis, patients from poorer strata of society and lower educational background are likely to abruptly stop medications. Switching to a telemedicine-based hybrid model is likely to improve drug adherence with substantial savings on loss of pay and out of pocket expenditure.","Kavadichanda, Chengappa; Shah, Sanket; Daber, Anu; Bairwa, Devender; Mathew, Anoop; Dunga, Saikumar; Das, Anna C; Gopal, Aishwarya; Ravi, Karunya; Kar, Sitanshu Sekhar; Negi, Vir Singh",Rheumatology (Oxford),208,1

The diagnoses of COVID-19 and VTE were of high quality, but the follow-up was often unclear. Most studies reported universal in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. Among all inpatients and among intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients with COVID-19, reported risks of VTE were 4.4&ndash;8.2% (three studies) and 0&ndash;35.3% (six studies), respectively. Two studies at least partially screened for VTE in ICU inpatients with COVID-19, and found risks of 24.7&ndash;53.8%. We found 12 guidelines for thromboprophylaxis of COVID-19 patients. The majority suggested universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients, but there was heterogeneity in the suggested intensity of thromboprophylaxis: seven advised considering intensified doses of heparin according to the clinical or biological severity of the disease, especially in the ICU setting. CONCLUSIONS: Venous thromboembolism very commonly complicates the clinical course of inpatients with COVID-19, despite thromboprophylaxis. The risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients. We found no estimates of risks among outpatients. Many questions remain unresolved, as delineated by the heterogeneity of national and international guidelines. This situation calls for fast randomised clinical trials, comparing different schemes of thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 inpatients.","Fontana, Pierre; Casini, Alessandro; Robert-Ebadi, Helia; Glauser, Frederic; Righini, Marc; Blondon, Marc",Swiss Med Wkly,208,16

Methods: Based on online data released officially by 21 Chinese cities from January 22 to February 15, 2020, the incubation period of COVID-19 patients who had travelled to Hubei was studied according to age. Previous studies were reviewed and compared. Results: The study recruited 136 COVID-19 patients who had travelled to Hubei during January 5-31, 2020, stayed for 1-2 days, and returned with symptom onset during January 10-February 6, 2020. The median age was 50.5 years (range 1-86 years), and 22 patients (16.2%) were aged ≥65 years. The age-stratified incubation period was U-shaped with higher values at extremes of age. The median COVID-19 incubation period was 8.3 (90% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-9.2) days for all patients, 7.6 (90% CI, 6.7-8.6) days for younger adults, and 11.2 (90% CI, 9.0-13.5) days for older adults. The 5th/25th/75th/90th percentiles were 2.3/5.3/11.3/14.2 days for all, 2.0/5.0/10.5/13.2 days for younger adults, and 3.1/7.8/14.4/17.0 days for older adults. There were 11 published studies on COVID-19 incubation periods up to March 30, 2020, reporting means of 1.8-7.2 days, and medians of 4-7.5 days, but there was no specific study on the effect of age on incubation period. One study showed that severe COVID-19 cases, which included more elderly patients, had longer incubation periods. Conclusion: Based on 136 patients with a travel history to Hubei, the epicenter of COVID-19, the COVID-19 incubation period was found to be longer in older adults. This finding has important implications for diagnosis, prevention, and control of COVID-19.","Kong, Tak-kwan",Aging Med.,208,1

The aim of this study was to (i) investigate the spatio-temporal trend of COVID-19 incidence; (ii) describe mobility trends as measured by aggregated mobile phone records; and (iii) investigate the association between deprivation index, population density and COVID-19 cases while accounting for spatial and temporal correlation. Standardised incidence ratios of cases were calculated and mapped at a high spatial resolution (electoral division level) over time. Trends in the percentage change in mobility compared to a pre-COVID-19 period were plotted to investigate the impact of lockdown restrictions. We implemented a hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal model (Besag, York and Mollié (BYM)), commonly used for disease mapping, to investigate the association between covariates and the number of cases. There have been three distinct ""waves"" of COVID-19 cases in Ireland to date. Lockdown restrictions led to a substantial reduction in human movement, particularly during the 1st and 3rd wave. Despite adjustment for population density (incidence ratio (IR) = 1.985 (1.915-2.058)) and the average number of persons per room (IR = 10.411 (5.264-22.533)), we found an association between deprivation index and COVID-19 incidence (IR = 1.210 (CI: 1.077-1.357) for the most deprived quintile compared to the least deprived). There is a large range of spatial heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases in Ireland. The methods presented can be used to explore locally intensive surveillance with the possibility of localised lockdown measures to curb the transmission of infection, while keeping other, low-incidence areas open. Our results suggest that prioritising densely populated deprived areas (that are at increased risk of comorbidities) during vaccination rollout may capture people that are at risk of infection and, potentially, also those at increased risk of hospitalisation.","Madden, Jamie M; More, Simon; Teljeur, Conor; Gleeson, Justin; Walsh, Cathal; McGrath, Guy",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),208,16

The healthcare systems reorganization has had a major impact on the management of cancer patients who are considered at high risk of infection. Recommendations and guidelines on how to manage cancer patients during COVID 19 pandemic have been published. Oral administration of chemotherapy is recommended to limit the access of cancer patients to hospital facilities and in some cases to guarantee the continuum of care. Low-dose metronomic administration of chemotherapy with different drugs and schedules has emerged in the last years as a possible alternative to conventional chemotherapy, due to its promising tumor control rates and excellent safety profiles. Moreover, given that many metronomic schedules use the oral route administration, it could represent a therapeutic strategy to ensure continuum of cancer care during COVID 19 pandemic. In this review we have selected all the clinical studies that have used the metronomic strategy, especially with oral drugs, in order to identify the subgroups of cancer patients who can benefit most from a metronomic approach even during COVID 19 pandemic.","Fedele, Palma; Sanna, Valeria; Fancellu, Alessandro; Marino, Antonella; Calvani, Nicola; Cinieri, Saverio",Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,208,24

The present study adds further understanding to potential psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by comparing self-reported questionnaire data from two groups of Chinese students attending a public university in western United States: the group who participated in the study before the outbreak of COVID-19 (Pre-COVID, N = 134), and the group who participated at the beginning (during-COVID, N = 64). The aim of the study was to: (a) compare mean differences in perceived discrimination and anxiety between the two groups, (b) test whether COVID-19 moderated the link between perceived discrimination and anxiety, and (c) examine whether media exposure portraying Chinese individuals negatively mediated relations between COVID-19 and discrimination. Results showed that the During-COVID group reported higher perceived discrimination and anxiety than the Pre-COVID group. The link between perceived discrimination and anxiety was stronger for the During-COVID group. Mediation analyses suggested that negative Chinese media exposure partly accounted for the group difference in perceived discrimination. Results suggest that future studies on the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the role of discrimination in understanding the mental health of Chinese American college students.","Haft, Stephanie L; Zhou, Qing",,208,24

Life insurance is quite beneficial for insurance customers, but based on the cases that emerged during the COVID-19 Pandemic, one of the life insurance companies, Kresna Life, experienced a default on insurance claims which should be fulfilled by customers who do insurance claim. The problems raised by the authors in this study are: 1) Analyzing the causes of insurance companies that failed to pay the customer;2) Analyzing the liability of the insurance company that failed to pay the customers. The research method used is normative juridical research, namely research conducted by examining library materials which include primary and secondary legal materials. The results showed that the causes of insurance companies experiencing default are poor management, weak insurance governance, a lack of prudential principles in investment placement, and poorly implemented risk management. The responsibility of the insurance company if it fails to pay to customers can offer a restructuring program to policyholders through registration, socialization, and agreement schemes. With restructuring efforts, it is hoped that it can minimize the risks and losses received by policyholders, so that the benefits of the policy will continue.","Sugiyono, H.; Surahmad, Fahrozi M.

METHODS: Anxiety levels in endodontists and dental assistants were recorded weekly during the state of alarm declared because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored using a sphygmomanometer for HR and blood pressure and a pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation. Measurements were taken before and after each root canal treatment as well as on arrival at the clinic and at the end of the working day. Rest data, recorded every Saturday, served as a control. Data analysis was performed using chi-square, paired t, Mann-Whitney, and analysis of variance tests (P < .05). RESULTS: General anxiety decreased over the weeks, with significant differences between weeks 1 and 4 (P < .05). Endodontists perceived higher anxiety levels of anxiety during anesthesia inoculation and dental assistants during the dental unit's disinfection and equipment material (P < .05). There was a significant increase in the cardiovascular response in all endodontists in the clinic registrations compared with rest data (P < .05). Values were higher in the strict confinement period and significant for HR when arriving at the clinic (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of general anxiety were higher during the first weeks. The chief perceived factors related to anxiety in endodontists and dental assistants were the risk of contagion and protection measures.

PURPOSE: To analyze the influence of zirconia implant topography on first bone implant contact (fBIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective two-center cohort investigation 63 zirconia implants were evaluated at implant placement, prosthetic delivery, 1, 3, and 5 years. The distance (DIB) between implant shoulder and fBIC was measured at each time point in periapical radiographs at mesial and distal sites. Two-way ANOVA/Bonferroni was used to analyze the effects of time and center (&#945; < 0.05). RESULTS: Between the centers, the mean DIB varied significantly at implant placement (Freiburg [FR]: 1.4 ± 0.6 mm; Zurich [ZH]: 0.8 ± 0.5 mm). Thereafter, no statistically significant difference in DIB was observed, neither between centers nor between time points (prosthetic delivery: FR: 1.9 ± 0.6 mm, ZH: 1.7 ± 0.8 mm; 1 year: FR: 1.8 ± 0.6 mm, ZH: 1.6 ± 0.8 mm; 3 years: FR: 1.9 ± 0.8 mm, ZH: 1.7 ± 0.8 mm; 5 years: FR: 1.9 ± 0.8 mm, ZH 1.8 ± 0.6 mm). The overall mean DIB at prosthetic delivery to 5 years of both centers (1.8 ± 0.7 mm) is located within the transition zone between the smooth neck and the moderately rough intraosseous part (1.6-2.0 mm from the implant shoulder).

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of mental health symptoms (anxiety, depression, and stress) in Bangladesh and the factors associated with these symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: From 1 to 30 April 2020, we used a validated self-administered questionnaire to conduct a cross-sectional study on 10,609 participants through an online survey platform. We assessed mental health status using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The total depression, anxiety, and stress subscale scores were divided into normal, mild, moderate, severe, and multinomial logistic regression was used to examine associated factors. Findings: The prevalence of depressive symptoms was 15%, 34%, and 15% for mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 59% for severe anxiety symptoms, 14% for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 14% for mild anxiety symptoms, while the prevalence for stress levels were 16% for severe stress level, 22% for moderate stress level, and 13% for mild stress level. Multivariate analyses revealed that the most consistent factors associated with mild, moderate, and severe of the three mental health subscales (depression, anxiety, and stress) were respondents who lived in Dhaka and Rangpur division, females, those who self-quarantined in the previous seven days before the survey, and those respondents who experienced chills, breathing difficulty, dizziness, and sore throat. Conclusion: Our results showed that about 64%, 87%, and 61% of the respondents in Bangladesh reported high levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively. There is a need for mental health support targeting women and those who self-quarantined or lived in Dhaka and Rangpur during the pandemic.","Abir, Tanvir; Kalimullah, Nazmul Ahsan; Osuagwu, Uchechukwu Levi; Nur-A Yazdani, Dewan Muhammad; Husain, Taha; Goson, Piwuna Christopher; Basak, Palash; Rahman, Md Adnan; Al Mamun, Abdullah; Permarupan, P Yukthamarani; Khan, Md Yusuf Hossein; Milton, Abul Hasnat; Agho, Kingsley E",Ann Glob Health,208,26

In the 21st century, three coronaviruses, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have emerged in the human population, presumably evolving from pathogens infecting other animals. Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses responsible for 15-30% of the atypical pneumonia cases in humans worldwide. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the newest SARS virus, SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. As of April 2021, the World Health Organization has reported more than 3 million deaths from COVID-19 and more than 140 million people have been infected with the virus, thereby making it the worst SARS pandemic of all time. Here, I review the current understanding of the molecular biology of coronaviruses and their host interactions, bringing together knowledge of the infection process to aid in the development of therapeutic drugs and/or vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

In this study, data were collected from a national sample of 1141 participants from the United States to examine how beliefs and behavioral responses to COVID-19 have been shaped by sociopolitical characteristics. The relationships between social predictors; perceived severity, knowledge, and fear of the virus; and health behaviors were tested using path analysis. Social characteristics significantly predicted perceived severity, knowledge, and fear, as well as health behaviors, even after controlling for an objective indicator of the risk of contracting the virus. Our findings suggest that perceptions and knowledge of the virus, especially believing that the virus poses a serious threat to one's individual health, are important determinants of behavior, but also that perceptions and knowledge are strongly driven by social and cultural factors above and beyond political affiliation.","Franz, Berkeley; Dhanani, Lindsay Y",J. behav. med,208,16

However, the association between larger-scale environmental factors such as living conditions and mental health problems during the pandemic is currently unknown. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional internet survey was conducted in Japan between August and September 2020 to examine the association between urbanization level and neighborhood deprivation as living conditions and COVID-19 case numbers by prefecture. Prevalence ratios (PRs) for severe psychological distress, suicidal ideation, and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic were adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 24,819 responses analyzed, the prevalence of mental health problems was 9.2% for severe psychological distress and 3.6% for new-onset suicidal ideation. PRs for severe psychological distress were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.08-1.56). PRs for new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly associated with higher urbanization level (highest PR = 1.83, 95% CI = 1.37-2.45) and greater neighborhood deprivation (highest PR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.06-1.72). Severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation were significantly more prevalent when there was higher urbanization plus lower neighborhood deprivation (PR = 1.34 [1.15-1.56], and 1.57 [1.22-2.03], respectively). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that it is not the number of COVID-19 cases by residence area but higher urbanization level and greater neighborhood deprivation (lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status) that are associated with severe psychological distress and new-onset suicidal ideation during the pandemic. These findings differ in part from evidence obtained before the pandemic.","Okubo, Ryo; Yoshioka, Takashi; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Okano, Hiroki; Ikezawa, Satoru; Tsuno, Kanami; Murayama, Hiroshi; Tabuchi, Takahiro",J Affect Disord,208,16

COVID-19 has taken the lives of more than 2.1 million people worldwide, with a global mortality rate of 2.2%. Current COVID-19 treatment options include supportive respiratory care, parenteral corticosteroids, and remdesivir. Although COVID-19 is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with comorbidities, the vulnerability, clinical course, optimal management, and prognosis of COVID-19 infection in patients with organ transplants has not been well described in the literature. The treatment of COVID-19 differs based on the organ(s) transplanted. Preliminary data suggested that liver transplant patients with COVID-19 did not have higher mortality rates than untransplanted COVID-19 patients. Table 1 depicts a compiled list of current published data on COVID-19 liver transplant patients. Most of these studies included both recent and old liver transplant patients. No distinction was made for early liver transplant patients who contract COVID-19 within their posttransplant hospitalization course. This potential differentiation needs to be further explored. Here, we report 2 patients who underwent liver transplantation who acquired COVID-19 during their posttransplant recovery period in the hospital. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two patients who underwent liver transplant and contracted COVID-19 in the early posttransplant period and were treated with hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. This article includes a description of their hospital course, including treatment and recovery. CONCLUSION: The management of post-liver transplant patients with COVID-19 infection is complicated. Strict exposure precaution practice after organ transplantation is highly recommended. Widespread vaccination will help with prevention, but there will continue to be patients who contract COVID-19. Therefore, continued research into appropriate treatments is still relevant and critical. A temporary dose reduction of immunosuppression and continued administration of low-dose methylprednisolone, remdesivir, monoclonal antibodies, and convalescent plasma might be helpful in the management and recovery of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in post-liver transplant patients. Future studies and experiences from posttransplant patients are warranted to better delineate the clinical features and optimal management of COVID-19 infection in liver transplant recipients.","Dale, Miles; Sogawa, Hiroshi; Seyedsaadat, Seyed Mohammad; Wolf, David C; Bodin, Roxana; Partiula, Bernard; Nog, Rajat; Latifi, Rifat; John, Devon; Veillette, Gregory; Diflo, Thomas; Nishida, Seigo",Transplant. proc,208,20

414581,414581,414581,COVID & The Clots,15.187136,8.217277,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the downregulation of all elective interventions during the period from 15 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 in Germany led to a decrease in operations. The impact on the number of specific operations in visceral surgery is so far unknown. METHODS: This retrospective study included 301 patients who underwent a cholecystectomy or appendectomy at a university hospital or a primary care facility between 15 March 2020 and 15 May 2020 (vs. 2018 and 2019). The number of cases and the clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The suspension of elective surgery resulted in a significant reduction in elective cholecystectomy and emergency appendectomy. At the University Hospital the number of appendectomies decreased by 33% from 24 in 2018 to 16 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies declined by 57% from 30 in 2018 to 13 in 2020. At the primary care hospital, the number of appendectomy patients decreased by 48% from 23 in 2018 to 12 in 2020 and the number of cholecystectomies increased from the year 2018 to 2019 and subsequently declined by 30% in 2020. The duration of surgery, length of hospital stay and clinical course of patients did not significantly differ from the previous year time periods. CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdown resulted in a significant reduction in frequently carried out visceral surgical interventions. In order to maintain the optimal medical care for the total population, current options for surgical and conservative treatment must be weighed against each other depending on the numbers of local infections and the individual comorbidities of the patients.","Steffani, Marcella; Merz, Constanze; Stöß, Christian; Landau, Lars; Hüser, Norbert; Hartmann, Daniel; Friess, Helmut; Theisen, Jörg; Novotny, Alexander",Chirurg,208,3

This study retrospectively included 88 patients in the ICU with critically ill COVID-19 at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. All patients underwent compression ultrasonography for identifying DVT. Firth logistic regression was used to examine the association of DVT with sex, age, hypoalbuminemia, D-dimer, and SOFA score. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) age and SOFA score of 88 patients were 63 (55-71) years old and 5 (4-6), respectively. Despite all patients receiving guideline-recommended low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) thromboprophylaxis, the incidence of DVT was 46% (95% CI 35-56%). Proximal DVT was recognized in 9% (95% CI 3-15%) of the patients, while 46% (95% CI 35-56%) of patients had distal DVT. All of the proximal DVT combined with distal DVT. Risk factors of DVT extension occurred in all distal DVT patients. As Padua score &#8805; 4 or IMPROVE score &#8805; 2, 53% and 46% of patients had DVT, respectively. Mortality was higher in patients with acute DVT (30%) compared with non-DVT (17%), but did not reach statistical significance. Hypoalbuminemia (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; 95% CI 0.06-0.05, P = 0.001), higher SOFA score (OR per IQR, 2.07; 95% CI 1.38-3.39, P = 0.001), and elevated D-dimer (OR per IQR, 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.84, P = 0.029) were significant DVT risk factors in multivariable analyses. High incidence of DVT was identified in patients with critically ill COVID-19, despite the use of guideline-recommended pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The presence of hypoalbuminemia, higher SOFA score, and elevated D-dimer were significantly independent risk factors of DVT. More effective VTE prevention and management strategies may need to be addressed.","Chen, Shujing; Zhang, Dingyu; Zheng, Tianqi; Yu, Yongfu; Jiang, Jinjun",J. thromb. thrombolysis,208,1

In this study we analyzed plasma cytokines in COVID-19 patients and investigated their association with respiratory failure (RF) and treatment in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Hospitalized patients (n = 34) with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited into a prospective cohort study. Clinical data and blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 2-5 and 7-10 days. RF was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 40 kPa. Plasma cytokines were analyzed by a Human Cytokine 27-plex assay. COVID-19 patients with RF and/or treated in ICU showed overall increased systemic cytokine levels. Plasma IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1&#945; levels were negatively correlated with P/F, whereas combinations of IL-6, IP-10, IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed the best association with RF in ROC analysis (AUC 0.79-0.80, p < 0.05). During hospitalization the decline was most significant for IP-10 (p < 0.001). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were present in patients with severe COVID-19. IL-6 and MCP-1 were inversely correlated with P/F with the largest AUC in ROC analyses and should be further explored as biomarkers to identify patients at risk for severe RF and as targets for improved treatment strategies.","Jøntvedt Jørgensen, Marthe; Holter, Jan Cato; Christensen, Erik Egeland; Schjalm, Camilla; Tonby, Kristian; Pischke, Søren Erik; Jenum, Synne; Skeie, Linda G; Nur, Sarah; Lind, Andreas; Opsand, Hanne; Enersen, Tone Burvald; Grøndahl, Ragnhild; Hermann, Anne; Dudman, Susanne; Muller, Fredrik; Ueland, Thor; Mollnes, Tom Eirik; Aukrust, Pål; Heggelund, Lars; Holten, Aleksander Rygh; Dyrhol-Riise, Anne Ma",Sci Rep,208,1

Research has found that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. Whether theoretically or clinically, many studies have suggested a close connection between COVID-19 and the digestive system. In this review, we summarize the digestive symptoms reported in existing research, discuss the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and determine the possible mechanisms and aetiology, such as cytokine storm.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine center for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Between March 10th and April 4th, 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","Chau, Nguyen Van Vinh; Thanh Lam, Vo; Thanh Dung, Nguyen; Yen, Lam Minh; Minh, Ngo Ngoc Quang; Hung, Le Manh; Ngoc, Nghiem My; Dung, Nguyen Tri; Man, Dinh Nguyen Huy; Nguyet, Lam Anh; Nhat, Le Thanh Hoang; Nhu, Le Nguyen Truc; Ny, Nguyen Thi Han; Hong, Nguyen Thi Thu; Kestelyn, Evelyne; Dung, Nguyen Thi Phuong; Xuan, Tran Chanh; Hien, Tran Tinh; Thanh Phong, Nguyen; Tu, Tran Nguyen Hoang; Geskus, Ronald B; Thanh, Tran Tan; Thanh Truong, Nguyen; Binh, Nguyen Tan; Thuong, Tang Chi; Thwaites, Guy; Tan, Le Van",Clin. infect. dis,208,16

Teledentistry can contribute to remote assessment (teletriage) and continuity of care (telemonitoring). This evaluation at a distance can be done by sending photos taken by the patient with a smartphone. Providing patients with a simple and reproducible protocol and explaining how to take a photo is important for sufficient image quality.

METHODSUsing the PRISMA 2020 guidance, we first conducted a systematic review of available literature on PubMed, MedRxIV and FDA briefings to identify clinical studies either comparing COVID vaccination to natural immunity or delineating the benefit of vaccination in recovered individuals. After assessing for eligibility, studies were qualitatively appraised and formally graded using the NOS system for observational, case-control and RCTs. Incidence rates were tabulated for the following groups: never infected (NI) and unvaccinated (UV), NI and vaccinated (V), previously infected (PI) and UV, PI and UV. Pooling was performed by grouping the RCTs and observational studies separately, and then all studies in total. Risk ratios and risk differences are reported for individual studies and pooled groups, in 1) NPI/V vs. PI/UV and 2) PI/UV vs. PI/V analysis. In addition, number needed to treat (NNT) analysis was performed for vaccination in naive and previously infected cohorts. RESULTSNine clinical studies were identified including three randomized controlled studies, four retrospective observational cohorts, one prospective observational cohort, and a case-control study. The NOS quality appraisals of these articles ranged from four to nine (out of nine stars). All of the included studies found at least statistical equivalence between the protection of full vaccination and natural immunity; and, three studies found superiority of natural immunity. Four observational studies found a statistically significant incremental benefit to vaccination in the COVID-recovered individuals. In total pooled analysis, incidence in NPI/V trended higher than PI/UV groups (RR=1.86 [95%CI 0.77-4.51], P=0.17). Vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals provided modest protection from reinfection (RR=1.82 [95%CI 1.21-2.73], P=0.004), but the absolute risk difference was extremely small (AR= 0.004 person-years [95% CI 0.001-0.007], P=0.02). The NNT to prevent one annual case of infection in COVID-recovered patients was 218, compared to 6.5 in COVID-naive patients, representing a 33.5-fold difference in benefit between the two populations. CONCLUSIONSWhile vaccinations are highly effective at protecting against infection and severe COVID-19 disease, our review demonstrates that natural immunity in COVID-recovered individuals is, at least, equivalent to the protection afforded by full vaccination of COVID-naive populations. There is a modest and incremental relative benefit to vaccination in COVID-recovered individuals; however, the net benefit is marginal on an absolute basis. COVID-recovered individuals represent a distinctly different benefit-risk calculus. Therefore, vaccination of COVID-recovered individuals should be subject to clinical equipoise and individual preference.","Shenai, Mahesh B; Rahme, Ralph; Noorchasm, Hooman",,208,21

It further calculates the levels of immunity required in order for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number ($r_0 = 1.93$) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-4 lockdown was found to be $1.69$. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally `smarter' than the `harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be $3.09$, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.","Childs, Simon",,208,26

BACKGROUND: Research-based practice relies on agile and nimble methods to investigate, evaluate, and apply research in project work. This requires the ability to scale methodologies, so they can provide actionable insights in often constrained time lines. Surveys, observations, space analytics, and lit reviews often need to be done in extremely short periods of time. In this article, we share how these processes can be condensed to meet time constraints of project time lines, with the critical reminder not to generalize contextually derived insights. CONCLUSION: Combining field research (shadowing and behavior mapping) with user engagement (interviews), user feedback (surveys), and analytics of the plan itself allows designers and owners to understand the relationship between design intent and operational outcome and be resource effective in capital planning projects. Scaling these methods to fit the time and resource availability, and ensuring that results are always reviewed and applied in context, is critical.","Nanda, Upali; Wingler, Deborah",HERD,208,20

We demonstrate over-representation of individuals possessing Oceanian and Indigenous American ancestry in SARS-CoV-2 positive populations. Genome-wide-association disaggregated by admixture mapping reveals regions of chromosomes 5 and 14 associated with COVID19 severity within African and Oceanic local ancestries, respectively, independent of overall ancestry fraction. Phylodynamic tracking of consensus viral genomes reveals no association with disease severity or inferred ancestry. We further present summary data from a multi-omic investigation of human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) typing, nasopharyngeal microbiome and human transcriptomics that reveal metagenomic and HLA associations with severe COVID19 infection. This work demonstrates the power of multi-omic pandemic tracking and genomic analyses to reveal distinct epidemiologic, genetic and biological associations for those at the highest risk.","Parikh, V N; Ioannidis, A G; Jimenez-Morales, D; Gorzynski, J E; Jong, H N De; Liu, X; Roque, J; Cepeda-Espinoza, V P; Osoegawa, K; Hughes, C; Sutton, S C; Youlton, N; Joshi, R; Amar, D; Tanigawa, Y; Russo, D; Wong, J; Lauzon, J T; Edelson, J; Montserrat, D M; Kwon, Y; Rubinacci, S; Delaneau, O; Cappello, L; Kim, J; Shoura, M J; Raja, A N; Watson, N; Hammond, N; Spiteri, E; Mallempati, K C; Montero-Martin, G; Christle, J; Kirillova, A; Seo, K; Huang, Y; Zhao, C; Moreno-Grau, S; Hershman, S; Dalton, K P; Zhen, J; Kamm, J; Bhatt, K; Isakova, A; Morri, M; Ranganath, T; Blish, C A; Rogers, A J; Nadeau, K; Yang, S; Blomkalns, A; OHara, R; Neff, N F; DeBoever, C; Szalma, S; Wheeler, M T; Farh, K; Schroth, G P; Febbo, P; deSouza, F; Fernandez-Vina, M; Kistler, A; Palacios, J; Pinsky, B A; Bustamante, C D; Rivas, M A; Ashley, E A",,208,26

Combined with teleclinics, using drive-up fingerstick International normalized ratio (INR) testing was recommended to decrease exposure risk of anticoagulation patients. Objective: To evaluate the impact of transitioning from clinic-based anticoagulation management services to drive-up and phone-based services during COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar. Methods: The study comprised of two components: a retrospective cohort study of all eligible patients who attended anticoagulation clinic over 1-year period (6 months before and 6 months after service transition) and a cross-sectional survey of eligible patients who agreed to provide data about their satisfaction with the new service. Monitoring parameters, clinical outcomes, and resource utilization related to warfarin therapy were compared before and after service transition. Patients' experience was explored through a structured survey. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between clinic-based and phone-based anticoagulation services in mean time and number of visits within therapeutic range (P = .67; P = .06 respectively); mean number of extreme subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic INR values (P = .32 and P = .34, respectively); incidence of thromboembolic complications and warfarin related hospitalization. There was one reported bleeding and one emergency visit (0.9%) in the phone-based group vs none in the clinic-based group. Frequency of INR testing and compliance to attending clinics appointments declined significantly (P = .002; P = .001, respectively). Overall, patients were highly satisfied with the new service. The majority of patients found it better (51.6%) or just as good as the traditional service (44.5%).

Plans to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have been implemented widely, but few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of these plans in maintaining safe surgical care delivery. AIM: To evaluate the effects of mitigating plans implemented on the delivery of gynecological cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A comparative cohort study of patients treated in a high-volume tertiary gyneoncological centre in the United Kingdom. Prospectively-recorded consecutive operations performed and early peri-operative outcomes during the same calendar periods (January-August) in 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: In total, 585 operations were performed (296 in 2019; 289 in 2020). There was no significant difference in patient demographics. Types of surgery performed were different (p = 0.034), with fewer cytoreductive surgeries for ovarian cancer and laparoscopic procedures (p = 0.002) in 2020. There was no difference in intra-operative complication rates, critical care admission rates or length of stay. One patient had confirmed COVID-19 infection (0.4%). The 30-day post-operative complication rates were significantly higher in 2020 than in 2019 (58 [20.1%] versus 32 [10.8%]; p = 0.002) for both minor and major complications. This increase, primarily from March 2020 onwards, coincided with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining surgical throughput with meticulous and timely planning is feasible during the COVID-19 pandemic but this was associated with an increase in post-operative complications due to a multitude of reasons.","Leung, Elaine; Pervaiz, Zahra; Lowe-Zinola, Jack; Cree, Sian; Kwong, Audrey; Marriott, Natalie; Cole, Florence; Arum, Uchechukwu; Szopinski, Barbara; Elattar, Ahmed; Sundar, Sudha; Kehoe, Sean; Singh, Kavita; Balega, Janos; Yap, Jason",Gynecol. oncol,208,21

On January 23, China raised its national public health response to the highest level. As part of the emergency response, a series of public social distancing interventions were implemented to reduce the transmission rate of COVID-19. In this article, we explored the feasibility of using mobile terminal positioning data to study the impact of some nonpharmaceutical public health interventions implemented by China. First, this article introduced a hybrid method for measuring the number of people in public places based on anonymized mobile terminal positioning data. Additionally, the difference-in-difference (DID) model was used to estimate the effect of the interventions on reducing public gatherings in different provinces and during different stages. The data-driven experimental results showed that the interventions that China implemented reduced the number of people in public places by approximately 60% between January 24 and February 28. Among the 31 provinces in the Chinese mainland, some provinces, such as Tianjin and Chongqing, were more affected by the interventions, while other provinces, such as Gansu, were less affected. In terms of the stages, the phase with the greatest intervention effect was from February 3 to 14, during which the number of daily confirmed cases in China showed a turning point. In conclusion, the interventions significantly reduced public gatherings, and the effects of interventions varied with provinces and time.","Nie, Lei; Guo, Xin; Yi, Cheng Qi; Wang, Ruo Jia",Math Biosci Eng,208,16

DESIGN: This investigation was a retrospective cohort study. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (SEER-18 Regs Custom registry, November 2018) was reviewed for all cases of head and neck malignant teratomas from 1975 to 2016. A log rank test was used to compare survival between infant, pediatric, and adult HNMT, and between head and neck and non-head and neck malignant teratomas. Infant, pediatric, and adult patients were defined as younger than one year old, younger than 18 years old, and older than 18 years old, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty-three malignant teratoma cases (1.96%) occurred in the head and neck region from 1975 to 2016, including 11 adult (17.46%) and 52 (82.54%) pediatric patients. 79.37% (50 patients) were diagnosed during infancy. The most common location was the soft tissue of the head and neck in pediatric patients (65.38%) and the thyroid gland in adults (54.54%). The 5-year survival was 45.83% (±7.19%) in infants and 46.00% (±7.05%) in pediatric patients. There were differences in 1-year and 5-year survival between pediatric HNMT and non-head and neck malignant teratomas, (76.01% versus 86.20%) (p = 0.022) and (46.00% versus 67.10%) (p < 0.001), respectively. There was no difference in 1-year and 5-year survival between pediatric patients and adults with HNMT, (76.01% versus 81.81%) (p = 0.618) and (46.00% versus 54.54%) (p = 0.560), respectively. CONCLUSION: HNMT occurred most frequently in patients under the age of 1. Prognosis of pediatric HNMT is poor in comparison to pediatric non-head and neck malignant teratomas.

But little is known about postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women. AIM: To investigate the status and risk factors of postpartum depression and health care needs among Chinese postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 209 Chinese postpartum women were recruited from May to July 2020 by convenience sampling and assessed online with self-designed Maternal General Information Questionnaire, Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS) and Chinese Version of the Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS). Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, independent samples t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: With the EPDS cut-off value of 10, the incidence of postpartum depressive symptoms was 56.9%. Age, history of abortion and perceived stress were the influencing factors of postpartum depression (adjusted R2 = 0.432, F = 23.611, p < .001). The top three health care needs were infant rearing guidance (78.0%), maternal and infant protection guidance (60.3%) and dietary guidance (45.0%). The proportion of psychological rehabilitation guidance needs in the depressed group was significantly higher than that in the non-depressed group (34.5% vs. 20.0%, p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal postpartum depression in China was at a high level during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women aged 25-34, with a history of abortion and high stress levels were at higher risk for postpartum depression. Timely psychological counselling, intervention and COVID-19-related health education are in great need for postpartum women.","An, Ran; Chen, Xiaoli; Wu, Yuanyuan; Liu, Juan; Deng, Che; Liu, Yanqun; Guo, Hongxia",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,208,24

RA is one of the main reasons for work disability and premature retirement, thus substantially increasing social and economic burden. Biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) were shown to be an effective therapy especially in those rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, who did not adequately respond to conventional synthetic DMARD therapy. However, despite the proven efficacy, the high cost of the therapy resulted in limitation of the widespread use and unequal access to the care. The introduction of biosimilars, which are much cheaper relative to original drugs, may facilitate the achievement of the therapy by a much broader spectrum of patients. In this review we present the properties of original biologic agents based on cytokine-targeted (blockers of TNF, IL-6, IL-1, GM-CSF) and cell-targeted therapies (aimed to inhibit T cells and B cells properties) as well as biosimilars used in rheumatology. We also analyze the latest update of bDMARDs' possible influence on DNA methylation, miRNA expression and histone modification in RA patients, what might be the important factors toward precise and personalized RA treatment. In addition, during the COVID-19 outbreak, we discuss the usage of biologicals in context of effective and safe COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, early diagnosing along with therapeutic intervention based on personalized drugs targeting disease-specific genes is still needed to relieve symptoms and to improve the quality of life of RA patients.","Bonek, Krzysztof; Roszkowski, Leszek; Massalska, Magdalena; Maslinski, Wlodzimierz; Ciechomska, Marzena",,208,16

A survey invitation was emailed using the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine's mailing list. Results: We analyzed 460 valid responses from among 976 responses. The N95/FFP2 mask (77%) was most frequently used than in the international study, although half of our respondents reported reuse of single-use N95/FFP2 masks. The median duration (1 hour) of uninterrupted PPE use per shift was less than that in the international study. The commonest PPE-related adverse event was experiencing intense heat (75%). Logistic regression analysis revealed that being a nurse was independently associated with experiencing intense heat. Conclusion: PPE shortage and frequent mask reuse were prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Intense heat is the most significant symptom, especially for nurses, even with short-duration PPE use.

The association between pre-epidemic health and epidemic mortality can inform a policy response to future outbreaks. METHOD: We conducted an ecological study of the association between the cumulative deaths attributed to Covid-19 epidemic in the 20 Italian regions and nine determinants of population health derived from a systematic review of the literature. We used a multiple least square regression to predict the cross-regional variation in mortality observed from the onset of the epidemic to 23 September 2020. RESULTS: Four independent variables best explained the cross-regional differences in the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19: the force of infection, population density, number of elderly living in assisted facilities and the standard rate of diabetes. The semi-partial correlation coefficients suggest that the force of infection and the number of elderly residents in nursing homes were the dominant predictors of the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19. Statistical controls and validation confirmed the generalizability of the predictive model. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that a significant reduction of social contacts in main metropolitan areas and the timely isolation of elderly and diabetic residents could significantly reduce the death toll of the next wave of Covid-19 infection in Italy.","Oliva, Cristina; Di Maddaloni, Francesco; Marcellusi, Andrea; Favato, Giampiero",J. public health (Oxf),208,30

This meta-analysis aims to evaluate maternal and neonatal outcomes in covid-19 pregnancies and identify factors associated with perinatal viral transmission. Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched to 3 June 2020. Overall, 16 observational studies and 44 case reports/series were included. Fever was the most frequent maternal symptom, followed by cough and shortness of breath, while about 15 % of infected were asymptomatic. Severe disease was estimated to occur in 11 % of women in case reports/series and in 7 % (95 % CI: 4 %-10 %) in observational studies. Two maternal deaths were reported. The rate of neonatal transmission did not differ between women with and without severe disease (OR: 1.94, 95 % CI: 0.50-7.60). Preterm birth occurred in 29.7 % and 16 % (95 % CI: 11 %-21 %) in data obtained from case series and observational studies, respectively. Stillbirth occurred in 3 cases and 2 neonatal deaths were observed. Vertical transmission was suspected in 4 cases. Fever was the most common neonatal symptom (40 %), followed by shortness of breath (28 %) and vomiting (24 %), while 20 % of neonates were totally asymptomatic. In conclusion, the maternal and neonatal clinical course the infection is typically mild, presenting low mortality rates. The risk of vertical transmission is suggested to be low and may not be affected by the severity of maternal disease. Further large-scale studies are needed to clarify the risk factors associated with viral transmission and severe infection in the neonatal population.","Bellos, Ioannis; Pandita, Aakash; Panza, Raffaella",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,208,21

The authors decided to analyze the results of opportunistic screening for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among employees of a COVID-19-dedicated centre. Objectives: The authors aimed to investigate if potential exposition to SARS-CoV-2 antigens is reflected in the results of serological studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Every employee who took at least one test between 21st April and 20th July was included in the study. Every test assessed levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M+A (IgM+IgA). Employees were divided in terms of having contact with COVID-19 patients and participating in aerosol-generating procedures. RESULTS: Results of 2455 tests taken by 1572 persons were analyzed. 357 (22.7%) participants had at least one positive or equivocal result during the observation period. Linear mixed models revealed gradual increases in mean levels of both IgG and IgM+IgA antibodies among employees with all negative results. The rate of change was higher among persons having direct contact with COVID-19 patients and the highest rate of change was observed among person participating in aerosol-generating procedures. CONCLUSIONS: We detected developing humoral immune response to a new set of antigens of coronavirus among studied group. It is possible that employees of COVID-19-dedicated centres have regular contact with non-infectious amounts of SARS-CoV-2 or its antigens.,"Rzeplinski, Radoslaw; Szymanski, Piotr; Hamer, Karolina; Zdziebko, Magdalena; Szarowska, Agnieszka; Korcz, Tomasz; Zaczynski, Artur; Król, Zbigniew; Wierzba, Waldemar",Pol.

But if social learning is indeed more efficient (whether less costly or more accurate) than individual learning, it raises the question of why would anyone engage in individual information seeking, which is a necessary condition for social learning's efficacy. We propose an evolutionary model solving this paradox, provided agents (i) aim not only at information quality but also vie for audience and prestige, and (ii) do not only value accuracy but also reward originality-allowing them to alleviate herding effects. We find that under some conditions (large enough success rate of informed agents and intermediate taste for popularity), both social learning's higher accuracy and the taste for original opinions are evolutionarily-stable, within a mutually beneficial division of labour-like equilibrium. When such conditions are not met, the system most often converges towards mutually detrimental equilibria.","de Courson, Benoît; Fitouchi, Léo; Bouchaud, Jean-Philippe; Benzaquen, Michael",Sci Rep,208,24

Though data exist on the positivity rate of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test as well as COVID-19-related deaths amongst HCWs in South Africa, the overall infection rate remains underestimated by these indicators. It is also unclear whether the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection offers durable protection against reinfection. This study will assess the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence amongst HCWs in the Eastern Cape (EC) and examine the longitudinal changes (rate of decay) in the antibody levels after infection in this cohort. Using a multi-stage cluster sampling of healthcare workers in selected health facilities in the EC, a cross-sectional study of 2250 participants will be recruited. In order to assess the community infection rate, 750 antenatal women in the same settings will be recruited. Relevant demographic and clinical characteristics will be obtained by a self-administered questionnaire. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA) will be used for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. A nested cohort study will be conducted by performing eight-weekly antibody assays (X2) from 201 participants who tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serology. Logistic regression models will be fitted to identify the independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and infection fatality rate among the frontline HCWs will be estimated. In addition, the study will highlight the overall effectiveness of infection prevention and control measures (IPC) per exposure sites/wards at the selected health facilities. Findings will inform the South African Department of Health's policies on how to protect HCWs better as the country prepares for the second wave of the SARS-CoV pandemic.","Adeniyi, Oladele Vincent; Stead, David; Singata-Madliki, Mandisa; Batting, Joanne; Hyera, Leo; Jelliman, Eloise; Abrahams, Shareef; Parrish, Andrew",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),208,16

To meet the global demand, lower cost and faster antigen tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection are a convenient alternative to the gold standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We tested laboratory-based RT-PCR RNA detection and two rapid antigen detection (RAD) tests, based on the immunochromatography test for nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Ag ECO Test, ECO Diagnóstica, and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Abbott). Paired collection and testing were done in a small prospective open study in three clinical services in São Paulo, constituted of mostly symptomatic volunteers at collection (97%, 109/112) for a median of 4 days (interquartile range: 3-6), ranging from 1 to 30. Among the 108 paired RT-PCR/RAD tests, results were concordant in 96.4% (101/108). The test's performance was comparable, with an overall sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 96%. These observations add to other data that suggest that antigen tests may provide reasonable sensitivity and specificity and deserve a role to improve testing strategies, especially in resource-limited settings.","Matsuda, Elaine Monteiro; de Campos, Ivana Barros; de Oliveira, Isabela Penteriche; Colpas, Daniela Rodrigues; Carmo, Andreia Moreira Dos Santos; Brígido, Luís Fernando de Macedo",J Med Virol,208,22

Genomic technologies are vital for enhancing the understanding and development of intervention approaches against these pathogens, including Ebola and the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). DISCUSSION: Africa has contributed few genomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to the global pool in growing open access repositories. To bridge this gap, the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) is coordinating continent-wide initiatives to establish genomic hubs in selected well-resourced African centres of excellence. This will allow for standardisation and efficient and rapid data generation and curation. However, the strategy to ensure capacity for high-throughput genomics at selected hubs should not overshadow the deployment of portable, field-friendly and technically less demanding genomics technologies in all affected countries. This will enhance small-scale local genomic surveillance in outbreaks, leaving validation and large-scale approaches to be taken at central genomic hubs. CONCLUSION: The ACDC needs to scale-up its campaign for government support across African Union countries to ensure the sustainable financing of its strategy for increased pathogen genomic intelligence and other interventions in current and inevitable future epidemics in Africa.","Oboh, Mary Aigbiremo; Omoleke, Semeeh Akinwale; Ajibola, Olumide; Manneh, Jarra; Kanteh, Abdoulie; Sesay, Abdul-Karim; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",Int J Infect Dis,208,16

PURPOSE: Cost-avoidance studies of pharmacist interventions are common and often the first type of study conducted by investigators to quantify the economic impact of clinical pharmacy services. The purpose of this primer is to provide guidance for conducting cost-avoidance studies pertaining to clinical pharmacy practice. SUMMARY: Cost-avoidance studies represent a paradigm conceptually different from traditional pharmacoeconomic analysis. A cost-avoidance study reports on cost savings from a given intervention, where the savings is estimated based on a counterfactual scenario. Investigators need to determine what specifically would have happened to the patient if the intervention did not occur. This assessment can be fundamentally flawed, depending on underlying assumptions regarding the pharmacists' action and the patient trajectory. It requires careful identification of the potential consequence of nonaction, as well as probability and cost assessment. Given the uncertainty of assumptions, sensitivity analyses should be performed. A step-by-step methodology, formula for calculations, and best practice guidance is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-avoidance studies focused on pharmacist interventions should be considered low-level evidence. These studies are acceptable to provide pilot data for the planning of future clinical trials. The guidance provided in this article should be followed to improve the quality and validity of such investigations.","Patanwala, Asad E; Narayan, Sujita W; Haas, Curtis E; Abraham, Ivo; Sanders, Arthur; Erstad, Brian L",Am. j. health system pharm,208,16

In addition, since ES proteins circulate in the extracellular space, they can be more accessible to drugs than other proteins, which makes ES proteins optimal targets for the development of new and better pharmacological strategies. Monogeneans are a group of parasitic Platyhelminthes that includes some pathogenic species problematic for finfish aquaculture. In the present study, 8297 putative ES proteins from four monogenean species which genomic resources are publicly available were identified and functionally annotated by bioinformatic tools. Additionally, for comparative purposes, ES proteins in other parasitic and free-living platyhelminths were identified. Based on data from the monogenean Gyrodactylus salaris, 15 ES proteins are considered potential drug targets. One of them showed homology to 10 cathepsins with known 3D structure. A docking molecular analysis uncovered that the anthelmintic emodepside shows good affinity to these cathepsins suggesting that emodepside can be experimentally tested as a monogenean's cathepsin inhibitor.","Caña-Bozada, Víctor; Chapa-López, Martha; Díaz-Martín, Rubén D; García-Gasca, Alejandra; Huerta-Ocampo, José Ángel; de Anda-Jáuregui, Guillermo; Morales-Serna, F Neptalí",Infect Genet Evol,208,7

In this systematic review, we summarized the available data on clinical features, diagnosis, and therapy of COVID-19-related SE. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature to identify data on demographics, clinical, neurophysiological, and neuroradiological data of patients with COVID-19-related SE. We used regression models (linear or logistic) with a stepwise forward method to identify features associated with mortality or severity of SE. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles were included with a total of 47 cases of SE associated with COVID-19. Age, time between the acute respiratory phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and SE onset, and hospitalization correlated with a higher SE severity as assessed by quantitative validated scales. CONCLUSIONS: SE can be a neurological manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although a possible association between SE and COVID-19 has been reported, the exact mechanisms are still not fully understood. Systemic inflammatory syndrome due to cytokine release could play a role in COVID-19-related SE.","Dono, Fedele; Nucera, Bruna; Lanzone, Jacopo; Evangelista, Giacomo; Rinaldi, Fabrizio; Speranza, Rino; Troisi, Serena; Tinti, Lorenzo; Russo, Mirella; Di Pietro, Martina; Onofrj, Marco; Bonanni, Laura; Assenza, Giovanni; Vollono, Catello; Anzellotti, Francesca; Brigo, Francesco",Epilepsy Behav,208,30

Meanwhile, COVID-19 displayed an immune profile distinguished by increased Th1 (IL-12, IFN-Î³) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13) cytokine levels, along with IL-1ß, IL-6, CCL11, VEGF, TWEAK, TSLP, MMP-1, and MMP-3. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 induces a dysbalanced polyfunctional inflammatory response that is different from the immune response against pandemic influenza A(H1N1). Furthermore, we demonstrated the diagnostic potential of some clinical and immune factors to differentiate both diseases. These findings might be relevant for the ongoing and future influenza seasons in the Northern Hemisphere, which are historically unique due to their convergence with the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choreño-Parra, José Alberto; Jiménez-Álvarez, Luis Armando; Cruz-Lagunas, Alfredo; Rodríguez-Reyna, Tatiana Sofía; Ramírez-Martínez, Gustavo; Sandoval-Vega, Montserrat; Hernández-García, Diana Lizzeth; Choreño-Parra, Eduardo M; Balderas-Martínez, Yalbi I; Martinez-Sánchez, Mariana Esther; Márquez-García, Eduardo; Sciutto, Edda; Moreno-Rodríguez, José; Barreto-Rodríguez, José Omar; Vázquez-Rojas, Hazel; Centeno-Sáenz, Gustavo Iván; Alvarado-Peña, Néstor; Salinas-Lara, Citlaltepetl; Sánchez-Garibay, Carlos; Galeana-Cadena, David; Hernández, Gabriela; Mendoza-Milla, Criselda; Domínguez, Andrea; Granados, Julio; Mena-Hernández, Lula; Pérez-Buenfil, Luis Ángel; Domínguez-Cheritt, Guillermo; Cabello-Gutiérrez, Carlos; Luna-Rivero, Cesar; Salas-Hernández, Jorge; Santillán-Doherty, Patricio; Regalado, Justino; Hernández-Martínez, Angélica; Orozco, Lorena; Ávila-Moreno, Federico; García-Latorre, Ethel A; Hernández-Cárdenas, Carmen M; Khader, Shabaana A; Zlotnik, Albert; Zúñiga, Joaquín",Front Immunol,208,16

However, human data of adipose ACE-2 is rarely available. Considering that, ACE-2 is believed to be the receptor responsible for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, a better understanding of its regulation is desirable. We therefore characterized the modulation of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 mRNA expression during weight loss and the impact of ACE-2 expression on weight loss induced short- and long-term improvements of glucose metabolism. METHODS: 143 subjects (ageâ¯>â¯18; BMIâ¯&#8805;â¯27â¯kg/m2) were analyzed before and after a standardized 12-week dietary weight reduction program. Afterwards subjects were randomized to a 12-month lifestyle intervention or a control group (Maintain-Adults trial). Insulin sensitivity (IS) was estimated by HOMA-IR (as an estimate of liver IS) and ISIClamp (as an estimate of skeletal muscle IS). ACE-2 mRNA expression (ACE-2AT) was measured in subcutaneous adipose tissue before and after weight loss. RESULTS: ACE-2AT was not affected by obesity, but was reduced in insulin resistant subjects. Weight loss resulted in a decline of ACE-2AT (29.0 (20.0-47.9) vs. 21.0 (13.0-31.0); pâ¯=â¯1.6â¯&#8727;â¯10-7). A smaller reduction of ACE-2 AT (&#916;ACE-2AT) was associated with a larger improvement of ISIClamp (pâ¯=â¯0.013) during weight reduction over 3â¯months, but not with the extend of weight loss. The degree of changes in insulin resistance were preserved until month 12 and was also predicted by the weight loss induced degree of &#916;ACE-2AT (pâ¯=â¯0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression correlates with insulin sensitivity. Weight loss induced decline of subcutaneous adipose ACE-2 expression might affect short- and long-term improvement of myocellular insulin sensitivity, which might be also relevant in the context of ACE-2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2.

Reportedly, Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products are more likely to be effective, and a possible explanation is greater bioavailability than other brands. Specifically, the aim was to compare the steady-state pharmacokinetics of Rotta- and non-Rotta-manufactured glucosamine products in healthy volunteers and examine the interindividual variability. METHODS: In a crossover design, healthy adult participants ingested 1500 mg/day of a Rotta (DONA powder sachets; imported by Mylan Health, Carole Park, QLD, Australia) and a non-Rotta (glucosamine sulphate 1500 mg one-a-day tablet; Blackmores, Warriewood, NSW, Australia) glucosamine product/brand individually for 6 days. Blood samples were collected immediately before and for 12 h after the ingestion of the last dose of each brand and analysed to determine plasma levels of glucosamine. The pharmacokinetic parameters at steady state [including the minimum (Css min) and maximum (Css max) plasma concentration of glucosamine, time to reach Css max post-dosing (Tss max) and area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUCss 0-12)] for each brand were calculated and statistically compared. RESULTS: Fourteen participants [mean age 35.5 years (s.d. 8.8)] were recruited (64.2% males). No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the two brands. However, for both brands, the coefficient of variation for Css min, Tss max and AUCss 0-12 exceeded 20%, indicating considerable differences in the parameters between participants. No significant association of the pharmacokinetic parameters was observed with various dosing- and participant-related variables. CONCLUSION: Substantial interindividual differences in the absorption and elimination of glucosamine could be a cause of variable clinical outcomes in OA.

There is little data examining the correlation between serum albumin levels and COVID-19 disease severity. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether admission albumin levels reliably predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 181 patients from two hospitals who had COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and radiologic imaging, who were hospitalized between March and July 2020. We recorded demographics, COVID-19 testing techniques, and day of admission labs. The outcomes recorded included the following: venous thromboembolism (VTE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, discharge with new or higher home oxygen supplementation, readmission within 90 days, in-hospital mortality, and total adverse events. A multivariate modified Poisson regression analysis was then performed to determine significant predictors for increased adverse events in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients (60.2%) had hypoalbuminemia (albumin level < 3.3 g/dL). Patients with higher albumin levels on admission had a 72% decreased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (adjusted relative risk [RR]:0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.14-0.53, p<0.001) for every 1 g/dL increase of albumin. Moreover, higher albumin levels on admission were associated with a lower risk of developing ARDS (adjusted RR:0.73, 95% CI:0.55-0.98, p = 0.033), admission to the ICU (adjusted RR:0.64, 95% CI:0.45-0.93, p = 0.019), and were less likely to be readmitted within 90 days (adjusted RR:0.37, 95% CI:0.17-0.81, p = 0.012). Furthermore, higher albumin levels were associated with fewer total adverse events (adjusted RR:0.65, 95% CI:0.52-0.80, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Admission serum albumin levels appear to be a predictive biomarker for outcomes in COVID-19 patients. We found that higher albumin levels on admission were associated with significantly fewer adverse outcomes, including less VTE events, ARDS development, ICU admissions, and readmissions within 90 days. Screening patients may lead to early identification of patients at risk for developing in-hospital complications and improve optimization and preventative efforts in this cohort.","Kheir, Matthew; Saleem, Farah; Wang, Christy; Mann, Amardeep; Chua, Jimmy",PLoS One,208,33

The emergence or re-emergence of such diseases has revealed the deficiency in our pipeline for the discovery and development of antiviral drugs. One promising solution is the extensive library of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by all eukaryotic organisms. AMPs are widely known for their activity against bacteria, but many possess additional antifungal, antiparasitic, insecticidal, anticancer, or antiviral activities. AMPs could therefore be suitable as leads for the development of new peptide-based antiviral drugs. Sixty therapeutic peptides had been approved by the end of 2018, with at least another 150 in preclinical or clinical development. Peptides undergoing clinical trials include analogs, mimetics, and natural AMPs. The advantages of AMPs include novel mechanisms of action that hinder the evolution of resistance, low molecular weight, low toxicity toward human cells but high specificity and efficacy, the latter enhanced by the optimization of AMP sequences. In this opinion article, we summarize the evidence supporting the efficacy of antiviral AMPs and discuss their potential to treat emerging viral diseases including COVID-19.","Tonk, Miray; Ruzek, Daniel; Vilcinskas, Andreas",Viruses,208,16

Our study aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of repeatedly positive testing after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovery. We performed a systematic literature search following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. With available individual patient data reporting on repeatedly SARS-CoV-2 positive (RSP) patients, case reports, and case series were included in this analysis. We performed a descriptive analysis of baseline characteristics of repeatedly positive cases. We assessed the cases according to the length of their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative interval between the two episodes. Risk factors for the severity of second episodes were evaluated. Overall, we included 123 patients with repeated positivity from 56 publications, with a mean repeated positivity length of 47.8 ± 29.9 days. Younger patients were predominant in the delayed (>90 days) recurrent positive group. Furthermore, comparing patients with RSP intervals of below 60 and above 60 days, we found that a more severe disease course can be expected if the repeated positivity interval is shorter. Severe and critical disease courses might predict future repeatedly positive severe and critical COVID-19 episodes. In conclusion, our results show that the second episode of SARS-CoV-2 positivity is more severe if it happens within 60 days after the first positive PCR. On the other hand, the second episode's severity correlates with the first.","Váncsa, Szilárd; Dembrovszky, Fanni; Farkas, Nelli; Szakó, Lajos; Teutsch, Brigitta; Bunduc, Stefania; Nagy, Rita; Párniczky, Andrea; Eross, Bálint; Péterfi, Zoltán; Hegyi, Péter",Viruses,208,1

As a preventive measure, human movement is restricted in most of the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with the WHO have laid out some therapeutic guidelines for the infected patients. However, other than handwashing and vigilance surrounding commonly encountered oronasal symptoms and fever, no useful prophylactic measure has yet been established. In a pandemic, the accessibility of a prophylactic biologically active substance is crucial. Ideally, it would be something readily available at a low price to a larger percentage of the population with minimal risk. Studies have demonstrated that zinc may reduce viral replication and increase immune responses. For example, in some studies, zinc supplementation used against the influenza virus has been shown to yield clinical benefits with reduced disease burden. While consuming zinc (within the recommended upper safety limits), as a prophylactic might provide an additional shield against the initiation and progression of COVID-19 would need clinical studies, the potential clearly exists.","Razzaque, Mohammed S",,208,21

To prepare for the likelihood of caring for women during labor and cesarean delivery, anesthesia professionals must know how to provide safe, patient-centered care and how to protect every member of the obstetric team from exposure to the virus. In addition, it is paramount that our profession shares our experiences and practices to help guide our multidisciplinary approach in delivering the best care possible to these women.","Harenberg, J.

In this brief communication, the network model of the interactome of these viral proteins with the host proteins is analyzed. The statistical analysis of this network shows that it has a modular scale-free topology in which the virus proteins orf8, M, and Nsp7 are the three nodes with the most connections (links). This result suggests the possibility that a simultaneous pharmacological attack on these hubs could assure the destruction of the network and the elimination of the virus.","Díaz, José",Front.

We systematically reviewed the efficacy of prophylactic hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19. Studies evaluating hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of COVID-19 were searched in several engines until 8 December 2020. Primary outcomes included RT-PCR positivity, COVID-19 infections (positive RT-PCR or compatible COVID-19 symptoms), and all-cause mortality. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for all outcomes. Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 5579) and one cohort (n = 106) were included. Placebo was the comparator in four RCTs, and usual care in one RCT. Compared to the controls, five RCTs showed that hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis did not reduce RT-PCR positivity (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88–1.16), COVID-19 infection (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78–1.22), or all-cause mortality (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.27–1.99). There were no differences of effects by pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis. Prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of diarrhea, abdominal pain, or vomiting (RR 4.56, 95% CI 1.58–13.19). There were no effects of hydroxychloroquine on other secondary outcomes. Quality of evidence was low to very low for all outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine was not efficacious as a prophylaxis for COVID-19 infections, defined either as RT-PCR positivity or as a composite of RT-PCR positivity or compatible symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine did not reduce all-cause mortality, clinical worsening, or adverse events.","Hernandez, Adrian V.; Ingemi, John Sherman Michael Pasupuleti Vinay Barboza Joshuan J.; Piscoya, Alejandro Roman Yuani M.; White, Charles M.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,208,24

Materials and Methods: From January 26, 2019 to February 13, 2020, 70 patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV according to the World Health Organization interim guidance for NCP and divided into diarrhea and non-diarrhea groups. The laboratory tests liver and kidney function, blood routine, coagulation function, and immune status. Results: The study population included 70 hospitalized patients with confirmed CONV-2019. NCP patients (43males and 27 females) with a mean age of 48.57±17.80 (9~82) years and only 4.3% of patients have lung-related diseases. The positive rate of ESR, CRP, PT, IL6, lymphocyte count, GGT, Prealbumin and CD4 was more than 50%. We further analyzed the differences between 8 diarrhea patients and 62 non-diarrhea patients. Among these indicators, only Lymphocyte, CRP, Prealbumin and Cystatin C positive rate is more than 50%. Although there is no statistical difference in GGT, 100% of the 7 patients tested decreased. Conclusion: Our data recommended that the ESR, CRP, PT, IL6, lymphocyte count, GGT, prealbumin and CD4 have important value in the diagnosis of COVID-19, and the decrease of GGT may be an important indicator for judging the intestinal dysfunction of patients.","Wei, Xiao-Yu; Jing, Ding; Jia, Bei; Li, Qing; Zhou, Xia-Qia; Gong, Ming-Feng; Zou, Jing-Bo; Zhang, Qiang; Huang, Wen-Xiang; Tian, Wen-Guang",Int J Med Sci,208,16

While much attention has been paid to health workers in critical care and acute areas, nurses working outside of hospitals are also significantly affected. This study sought to investigate the experience of nurses working in Australian primary healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it sought to understand the implications on their employment status, role, and access to personal protective equipment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nurses employed in primary healthcare across Australia were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey through social media and professional organizations. The survey tool was composed of demographics, and of questions about the nurses' employment, work role, and access to personal protective equipment. FINDINGS: Of the 637 responses received, nearly half (43.7%) reported a decrease in hours and threatened or actual loss of employment. While most respondents felt that they had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19, they expressed concern about work-related risks to themselves and their family. Most respondents described never or only sometimes having sufficient personal protective equipment in their workplace. Just over half of respondents (54.8%) felt well supported by their employer. A third of respondents (34%) perceived that care provided in their workplace was significantly or slightly worse than before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of primary healthcare nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings highlighted a concerning level of insecurity around primary healthcare nursing employment, as well as issues with the availability of personal protective equipment for these nurses. The perception that the pandemic has resulted in reduced quality of care needs further exploration to ensure that those with chronic conditions are supported to maintain and promote health. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the implications of COVID-19 on the primary healthcare nursing workforce is vital to ensure staff retention and care quality. Ensuring that the community remains healthy and supported at home is vital to both reduce the burden on the health system and reduce secondary mortality.","Halcomb, Elizabeth; McInnes, Susan; Williams, Anna; Ashley, Christine; James, Sharon; Fernandez, Ritin; Stephen, Catherine; Calma, Kaara",J. nurs. scholarsh,208,26

This limitation in functionalization is attributed to the difficulty of electron transfer from 2H-TMD to the reacting molecules due to its semiconducting property and neutral charge state. Unfortunately, this is an all too important prerequisite step toward creating chemically reactive radical species for surface functionalization reactions. Herein, an electrochemical approach was developed for facilitating direct surface functionalization of 2H-MoS2 with 4-bromobenzene diazonium tetraborate (4-BBDT). Successful functionalization was characterized using various microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. During the course of investigating the change of optical transition seen for modified 2H-MoS2 using photoluminescence measurement combined with theoretical calculations, our study uncovered that the controlling S-C bond and sulfur vacancy generation could tune the electronic structure of functionalized 2H-MoS2.","Park, Younghee; Shin, Seunghyun; An, Youngjoon; Ahn, Jong-Guk; Shin, Geumbi; Ahn, Chaehyeon; Bang, Jiwon; Baik, Jaeyoon; Kim, Yousoo; Jung, Jaehoon; Lim, Hyunseob",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),208,25

Atmospheric chemical transport models can distinguish between emissions and regional transport sources in air pollutant concentrations. However, quantifying model inventories is challenging due to emission changes caused by the recent strict control measures taken by the Chinese government. In this study, we use NO2 column observations from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument to retrieve top-down nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions and quantify the contributions of local emissions and regional transport to NOx in Beijing (BJ), from 1 November 2018 to 28 February 2019 (W_2018) and 1 November 2019 to 29 February 2020 (W_2019). In W_2018 and W_2019, the BJ bottom-up NOX emissions from the multi-resolution emission inventory for China in 2017 were overestimated by 11.8% and 40.5%, respectively, and the input of NOX from other cities to BJ was overestimated by 10.9% and 51.6%, respectively. The simulation using our adjusted inventory exhibited a much higher spatial agreement (slope = 1.0, R-2 = 0.79) and reduced a mean relative error by 45% compared to those of bottom-up NOX emissions. The top-down inventory indicated that (1) city boundary transport contributes approximately 40% of the NOX concentration in BJ;(2) in W_2019, NOX emissions and transport in BJ decreased by 20.4% and 17.2%, respectively, compared to those of W_2018;(3) in W_2019, NOX influx substantially decreased (-699 g/s) in BJ compared to that of W_2018 despite negative meteorological conditions that should have increased NOx influx by +503 g/s. Overall, the contribution of intercity input to NOx in BJ has declined with decreasing emissions in the surrounding cities due to regional cooperative control measures, and the role of local emissions in BJ NOx levels was more prominent. Our findings indicate that local emissions may play vital roles in regional center city air quality.","Zhu, Y. Z.; Hu, Q. H.; Gao, M.; Zhao, C.; Zhang, C. X.; Liu, T.; Tian, Y.; Yan, L.; Su, W.

The estimation of airway opening pressures and effective mucus clearance are therefore two issues that clinicians are most concerned about during mechanical ventilation. In this study we retrospectively analyzed respiratory data from 24 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechanical ventilation and recruitment maneuver at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, China. Among 24 patients, the mean inspiratory plateau pressure was 52.4 ± 4.4 cmH2O (mean ± [SD]). Particularly, the capnograms presented an upward slope during the expiratory plateau, indicting the existence of airway obstruction. A computational model of airway opening was subsequently introduced to investigate possible fluid dynamic mechanisms for the extraordinarily high inspiratory plateau pressures among these patients. Our simulation results showed that the predicted airway opening pressures could be as high as 40-50 cmH2O and the suction pressure could exceed 20 kPa as the surface tension and viscosity of secretion simulants markedly increased, likely causing the closures of the distal airways. We concluded that, in some critically ill patients with COVID-19, limiting plateau pressure to 30 cmH2O may not guarantee the opening of airways due to the presence of highly viscous lower airway secretions, not to mention spontaneous inspiratory efforts. Active airway humidification and effective expectorant drugs are therefore strongly recommended during airway management.","Chen, Zhenglong; Zhong, Ming; Jiang, Li; Chen, Nanshan; Tu, Shengjin; Wei, Yuan; Sang, Ling; Zheng, Xia; Zhang, Chunyuan; Tao, Jiale; Deng, Linhong; Song, Yuanlin",Ann Biomed Eng,208,6

We conducted a search of the various scientific databases using relevant keywords. All English-language studies involving neonates born to women who had COVID-19 infections were included. The main outcomes were rates of vertical transmission and the characteristics of the affected newborns. Out of 13 selected studies, 103 newborns were involved. The rate of vertical transmission was 5.4%. Of the five infected newborns, four were full-term and one was preterm. All were born by Cesarean section. The clinical symptoms were vomiting, fever, lethargy, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. In four newborns, a chest x-ray showed evidence of pneumonia. The most common laboratory finding was leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase levels. One newborn needed mechanical ventilation. All newborns recovered and were discharged. The findings of this review study showed that the prognosis of newborns of infected mothers was satisfactory, and clinical symptoms of infected neonates did not differ from adults and were nonspecific.

The entire country is considered at risk of the disease. Transmission occurs all year round with peaks occurring from July through October with Plasmodium falciparum as the primary parasite species. Chloroquine (CQ) was the first-line drug against uncomplicated P. falciparum in Guinea until 2005, prior to the adoption of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). In this review, data on therapeutic efficacy of CQ and artemisinin-based combinations reported in published literature is summarized. Against CQ, a failure rate of 27% (12/44) was reported in a study in 1992; a median failure rate of 15.6% [range: 7.7-28.3; 8 studies] was observed during 1996-2001, and 81% (17/21) of the patients failed to clear parasitaemia in a study conducted in 2007.

Frequent repeated dosing can lead to the formation of anti-drug antibodies and patient compliance issues, and it is difficult to identify a single antibody that is broadly efficacious across diverse patient populations. As an alternative to monoclonal antibody therapy, anti-cytokine immunization is a potential means for long-term therapeutic control of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we report a supramolecular peptide-based approach for raising antibodies against IL-17 and demonstrate its efficacy in a murine model of psoriasis. B-cell epitopes from IL-17 were co-assembled with the universal T-cell epitope PADRE using the Q11 self-assembling peptide nanofiber system. These materials, with or without adjuvants, raised antibody responses against IL-17. Exploiting the modularity of the system, multifactorial experimental designs were used to select formulations maximizing titer and avidity. In a mouse model of psoriasis induced by imiquimod, unadjuvanted nanofibers had therapeutic efficacy, which could be enhanced with alum adjuvant but reversed with CpG adjuvant. Measurements of antibody subclass induced by adjuvanted and unadjuvanted formulations revealed strong correlations between therapeutic efficacy and titers of IgG1 (improved efficacy) or IgG2b (worsened efficacy). These findings have important implications for the development of anti-cytokine active immunotherapies and suggest that immune phenotype is an important metric for eliciting therapeutic anti-cytokine antibody responses.","Shores, Lucas S; Kelly, Sean H; Hainline, Kelly M; Suwanpradid, Jutamas; MacLeod, Amanda S; Collier, Joel H",Front Immunol,208,26

Due to the dynamic development of infections and the time lag between when patients are infected and when a proportion of them enters an intensive care unit (ICU), the need for future intensive care can easily be underestimated. To derive future ICU load from reported infections, we suggest a simple statistical model that (1) accounts for time lags and (2) allows for making predictions depending on different future growth rates. We evaluate our model for public data from Berlin, Germany, by first estimating the model parameters (i.e., time lag and average stay in ICU) for March 2020 and then using an exponential model to predict the future ICU load for April and May 2020. Assuming an ICU rate of 5%, a time lag of 5 days and an average stay of 14 days in ICU provide the best fit of the data and is in accord with independent estimates. Our model is then used to predict future ICU load assuming a continued exponential phase with varying growth rates (0-15%). For example, based on our parameters the model predicts that the number of ICU patients at the end of May would be 246 if the exponential growth were to continue at a rate of 3%, 1,056 if the growth rate were 5% and 3,758 if the growth rate were 7%. The model can be adjusted as estimates of parameters develop and can thus also help to predict a potential exceedance of ICU capacity. Although our predictions are based on a small data set, disregard non-stationary dynamics, and have a number of assumptions, especially an exponential development of cases, our model is simple, robust, adaptable and can be up-dated when further data become available.","Ritter, Matthias; Haynes, John-Dylan; Ritter, Kerstin",,208,30

The COVID-19 pandemic clearly shows the lack of resilience in supply chains and the impact that disruptions may have on a global network scale as individual supply chain connections and nodes fail. This cascading failure underscores the need for the network analysis and advanced resilience analytics we find lacking in the existing supply chain literature. This paper reviews supply chain resilience literature that focuses on resilience modeling and quantification and connects the supply chain to other networks, including transportation and command and control. We observe a fast increase in the number of relevant papers (only 47 relevant papers were published in 2007-2016, while 94 were found in 2017-2019). We observe that specific disruption scenarios are used to develop and test supply chain resilience models, while uncertainty associated with threats including consideration of ""unknown unknowns"" remains rare. Publications that utilize more advanced models often focus just on supply chain networks and exclude associated system components such as transportation and command and control (C2) networks, which creates a gap in the research that needs to be bridged. The common goal of supply chain modeling is to optimize efficiency and reduce costs, but trade-offs of efficiency and leanness with flexibility and resilience may not be fully addressed. We conclude that a comprehensive approach to network resilience quantification encompassing the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed to address the emerging challenges in the field.

We examine the performance and effectiveness of three dimension-reduction algorithms: principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP).

The UMAP-assisted K-means clustering enables us to shed light on increasingly large datasets from SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates.","Hozumi, Yuta; Wang, Rui; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",Comput Biol Med,208,26

Giving access to reliable sources of information and resources with minimal barriers comprises cooperation among Librarians and Libraries. This article surveyed the roles of Librarians and Libraries in response to the problems of fake news and misinformation arising from the outbreak of COVID-19 focusing on how librarians and other information professionals in Nigeria have articulated the difficulties and the approaches put in place for combating misinformation. A descriptive research design was adopted for the study, and twenty-four (24) Federal Universities were randomly selected across the six (6) geopolitical zones of the country. Data were analysed using simple descriptive statistics, and presented in tables and graphs. The study showed that Librarians should conduct a background search on sources of information to determine their authenticity and reliability before making them available to the clients. © 2021.

One anti-hexon neutralizing antibody, called 9C12, is known to activate the complement cascade, resulting in the deposition of complement component C4b on the capsid, and the neutralization of the virus. The mechanism of AdV neutralization by C4b is independent of downstream complement proteins and involves the blockage of the release of protein VI, which is required for viral escape from the endosome. To investigate the structural basis underlying how C4b blocks the uncoating of AdV, we built a model for the complex of human adenovirus type-5 (HAdV5) with 9C12, together with complement components C1 and C4b. This model positions C4b near the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) loops of the penton base. There are multiple amino acids in the RGD loop that might serve as covalent binding sites for the reactive thioester of C4b. Molecular dynamics simulations with a multimeric penton base and C4b indicated that stabilizing interactions may form between C4b and multiple RGD loops. We propose that C4b deposition on one RGD loop leads to the entanglement of C4b with additional RGD loops on the same penton base multimer and that this entanglement blocks AdV uncoating.","Emerson, Corey C; Stewart, Phoebe L",Viruses,208,26

Here, we briefly review the mechanistic and target organ effects related to ACE2 activity, and the importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: ACE2 converts angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7), which directly opposes the vasoconstrictive, proinflammatory, and prothrombotic effects of Ang II. ACE2 also facilitates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry into host cells. Drugs that interact with the renin-angiotensin system may impact ACE2 expression and COVID-19 pathogenesis; however, the magnitude and direction of these effects are unknown at this time. High quality research is needed to improve our understanding of how agents that act on the renin-angiotensin system impact ACE2 and COVID-19-related disease outcomes.","Cohen, Jordana B; Hanff, Thomas C; Bress, Adam P; South, Andrew M",Curr Hypertens Rep,208,0

As COVID-19 vaccine research continues to progress, the world's eyes are turning toward medicine regulators. COVID-19 vaccines need to be authorized for use in each country in which the pharmaceutical industry intends to commercialize its product. This results in a patchwork of regulations that can influence the speed at which products are launched and the standards that govern them. In this research forum article, we discuss several key questions about COVID-19 vaccine regulations that should shape research on the next stage of the pandemic response.

The application of PEEK cages has been recommended as it is radiolucent, and it has a modulus of elasticity that is similar to cortical bone. PEEK cages can be either filled with various materials or unfilled cages. Filled PEEK cages can include bone autografts, bone allografts, demineralized bone matrix, and other materials that facilitate fusion.

The new strain 501.V2 in South Africa bears three mutations in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD); K417 N, E484K, and N501Y, while the Brazilian B.1.1.248 lineage has 12 mutations. In the current study, we simulate the complex ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD system in which the RBD is in the wild-type and mutated isoforms. Additionally, the cell-surface Glucose Regulated Protein 78 (CS-GRP78) associated with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD complex (ACE2-S RBD) is modeled at the presence of these mutant variants of the viral spike. The results showed that E484K and N501Y are critical in viral spike recognition through either ACE2 or CS-GRP78. The mutated variants (the UK, South African, and Brazilian) of the spike RBD tightly bind to GRP78 more than in the case of the wild-type RBD. These results point to the potent role of GRP78 with ACE2 in the attachment of the new variants, which could be a key for the design of inhibitors to block SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to the host cell.","Ibrahim, Ibrahim M; Elfiky, Abdo A; Elgohary, Alaa M",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,208,28

This failure cannot be divorced from the broader context of systemic racism in the US that has contributed to Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities bearing a disproportionate toll from COVID-19, being underrepresented in COVID-19 clinical trials, and expressing greater hesitancy about COVID-19 vaccination. We call on research funders and research institutions to take decisive action to make community engagement obligatory, not optional, in all clinical and translational research and to center BIPOC communities in this process. Recommended actions include funding agencies requiring all research proposals involving human participants to include a community engagement plan, providing adequate funding to support ongoing community engagement, including community stakeholders in agency governance and proposal reviews, promoting racial and ethnic diversity in the research workforce, and making a course in community engaged research a requirement for Masters of Clinical Research curricula.","Grumbach, Kevin Cottler Linda B.; Brown, Jen LeSarre Monique Gonzalez-Fisher Ricardo F.; Williams, Carla D.; Michener, J.

However, most studies failed to consider important cofounding factors in the estimation of health effects of air pollution. The objective of the study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 risk and fatality in Lombardy and Veneto. Air pollutants were studied based on monitoring station information in Lombardy and Veneto from January 2013 to May 2020. The daily number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were collected from the reports of the Italian Ministry of Health in Italy. A generalized linear model with the generalized estimating equation method was used to evaluate the effects of short- and long-term exposure to air pollution on the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy and Veneto. After adjusting for other covariates, we found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 had a tendency to increase the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than long-term exposure, while for other air pollutants, including SO2 and NO2, long-term exposure was more significant than short-term exposure. Both short- and long-term exposure of SO2 resulted in increased health effects on COVID-19 pandemic.

A single instance of Protean serves an entire availability zone (10-100k machines), facilitating seamless failover and scale-out to customers. The design has proven robust, enabling a substantial expansion of VM offerings and features with minimal changes to the core infrastructure. In particular, Protean preserves a clear separation between policy and mechanisms. From a policy perspective, a flexible rule-based Allocation Agent (AA) allows Protean to efficiently address multiple constraints and performance criteria, and adapt to different conditions. On the system side, a multi-layer caching mechanism expedites the allocation process, achieving turnaround times of few milliseconds. A slight compromise on allocation quality enables multiple AAs to run concurrently on the same inventory, resulting in increased throughput with negligible conflict rate. Our results from both simulations and production demonstrate that Protean achieves high throughput and utilization (85-90% on a key utilization metric), while satisfying user-specific requirements. We also demonstrate how Protean is adapted to handle capacity crunch conditions, by zooming in on spikes caused by COVID-19.","Hadary, O.; Marshall, L.; Menache, I.; Pan, A.; Greeff, E.

Improved political will and better involvement of HFs management teams in infection prevention and control (IPC) systems are needed to reduce the risk for COVID-19 infection among HCWs. We recommend scale-up training on IPC measures particularly hand washing and use of PPE as well as the development of effective points of care risk assessment with a high index of suspicion in HFs.","Ilesanmi, O S; Afolabi, A A; Akande, A; Raji, T; Mohammed, A",Epidemiol Infect,208,21

METHODS: Mixed-methods research comprising key informant interviews with major stakeholders across both sectors; a survey of people with/without intellectual disability aged 60+ years; qualitative in-depth interviews; and survey of health professionals. RESULTS: There is an urgent need to develop inter-sectoral 'integrated care systems'. Key components include choice in accommodation; regular assessment of health and well-being indicators; development and adoption of nationally consistent policies/standards across integrated aged- and disability-care sectors; improved strategies for workforce planning; and upskilling of existing staff including place-based collaboration.

These strategies, implemented with varying stringency, have imposed substantial social and economic costs to society. As some countries begin to reopen and ease mobility restrictions, lockdowns in smaller geographic areas are increasingly considered an attractive policy intervention to mitigate societal costs while controlling epidemic growth. Nevertheless, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support these decisions. Methods: Drawing from a rich data set of localized lockdowns in Chile, we used econometric methods to measure the reduction in local economic activity from lockdowns when applied to smaller or larger geographical areas. We measured economic activity by tax collection at the municipality-level. Results: Our results show that lockdowns were associated with a 10%-15% drop in local economic activity, which is twice the reduction in local economic activity suffered by municipalities that were not under lockdown. A three-to-four-month lockdown had a similar effect on economic activity than a year of the 2009 great recession. We found costs are proportional to the population under lockdown, without differences when lockdowns were measured at the municipality or city-wide levels. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that localized lockdowns have a large effect on local economic activity, but these effects are proportional to the population under lockdown. Our results suggest that epidemiological criteria should guide decisions about the optimal size of lockdown areas since the proportional impact of lockdowns on the economy seems to be unchanged by scale.","Asahi, Kenzo; Undurraga, Eduardo A; Valdés, Rodrigo; Wagner, Rodrigo",J Glob Health,208,1

He has not developed severe pulmonary disease and was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. Limited data are available on post-transplant patients with COVID-19, and this case of a young patient without metabolic comorbidities did not show any association of severe COVID-19 under tacrolimus treatment.

The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of liver function and its clinical significance in COVID-19 patients. METHOD: This retrospective, single-centre study was conducted on 115 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University from 18 January 2020 to 22 February 2020. Liver function and related indexes were analysed to evaluate its relationship with disease progression in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Part of the COVID-19 patients presented with varying degrees of abnormality in liver function indexes. However, the levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, GGT and LDH in COVID-19 patients were not significantly different when compared with hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia patients, and the levels of albumin is even significantly higher. The levels of ALT, AST, TBIL, LDH and INR showed statistically significant elevation in severe COVID-19 cases compared with that in mild cases. However, the clinical significance of the elevation is unremarkable. Majority of severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly decreasing in albumin level and continuously decreasing in the progress of illness. Most of the liver function indexes in COVID-19 patients were correlated with CRP and NLR, the markers of inflammation. Logistic regression analysis further identified NLR as the independent risk factor for severe COVID-19, as well as age. CONCLUSIONS: Although abnormalities of liver function indexes are common in COVID-19 patients, the impairment of liver function is not a prominent feature of COVID-19, and also may not have serious clinical consequences.","Zhang, Yafei; Zheng, Liang; Liu, Lan; Zhao, Mengya; Xiao, Jun; Zhao, Qiu",Liver Int,208,30

More concretely, we develop a method to infer the global number of new infections from patchy observations of pedestrians. The method relies on ad hoc spatially resolved models for disease transmission via virus-laden respiratory droplets, which are fit to existing exposure studies about Covid-19. The approach is applied to the detailed field data about pedestrian trajectories and orientations that we acquired during the pandemic. This allows us to rank the investigated scenarios by the transmission risks that they present; importantly, the obtained hierarchy of risks is conserved across all our transmission models (except the most pessimistic ones): Street cafes present the largest average rate of new infections caused by an attendant, followed by busy outdoor markets, and then metro and train stations, whereas the risks incurred while walking on fairly busy streets (average density around 0.1 person/m^2) are comparatively quite low. Models that assume isotropic transmission of the virus fail to reproduce these results. In scenarios with a moving crowd, we find that density is the main factor influencing the estimated infection rate. Finally, our study explores the efficiency of street and venue redesigns in mitigating the viral spread: While the benefits of enforcing one-way foot traffic in (wide) walkways are unclear, changing the geometry of queues substantially affects disease transmission risks.","Garcia, Willy; Fray, Baptiste; Nicolas, Alexandre",,208,1

Patients with altered immunologic function are at higher risk of acquiring COVID-19. In patients with psoriasis, inhibition of select pro-inflammatory cytokines through the use of biologic agents has been shown to be an effective treatment option. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have key immunomodulatory effects and are known to be involved in the hosts' immune response to a variety of viral infections. Though little is currently known about the role of inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19, early reports have shown patients with severe disease to have elevated serum levels of select inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha. This review will summarize key information that is currently known about COVID-19, the role of select cytokines in viral defense, and important considerations for patients with psoriasis using biologic agents during this pandemic. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to discontinue biologic therapy in patients with psoriasis who have not tested positive for COVID-19. The decision to pause biologic therapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis in patients in higher risk populations, and should take into account individual risk and benefit. Until more is known about the impact of biologic therapy on COVID-19 outcomes, we recommend patients with psoriasis who test positive for COVID-19 be instructed to discontinue or postpone biologic treatment until they have recovered from infection.","Ladda, Matthew; Lynde, Charles; Fleming, Patrick",J Cutan Med Surg,208,16

The protocol was optimized to improve flexibility and the combination of technical replicates was established as the central strategy to achieve accurate analysis of low-titer/suboptimal samples. We demonstrated the utility of the approach by achieving complete genome reconstruction and the identification of false-positive variants in >170 clinical samples, thus avoiding the generation of inaccurate and/or incomplete sequences.

One-third of patients hospitalized due to severe COVID-19 develops macrovascular thrombotic complications, including venous thromboembolism, myocardial injury/infarction and stroke. Concurrently, the autopsy series indicate multiorgan damage pattern consistent with microvascular injury. PROPHYLAXIS, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT: COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has distinct features, including markedly elevated D-dimers concentration with nearly normal activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and platelet count. The diagnosis may be challenging due to overlapping features between pulmonary embolism and severe COVID-19 disease, such as dyspnoea, high concentration of D-dimers, right ventricle with dysfunction or enlargement, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Both macro- and microvascular complications are associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Therefore, early recognition of coagulation abnormalities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients are critical measures to identify patients with poor prognosis, guide antithrombotic prophylaxis or treatment, and improve patients' clinical outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICIANS: Most of the guidelines and consensus documents published on behalf of professional societies focused on thrombosis and hemostasis advocate the use of anticoagulants in all patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as well as 2-6 weeks post hospital discharge in the absence of contraindications. However, since there is no guidance for deciding the intensity and duration of anticoagulation, the decision-making process should be made in individual-case basis. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we review the mechanistic relationships between inflammation and thrombosis, discuss the macrovascular and microvascular complications and summarize the prophylaxis, diagnosis and treatment of thromboembolism in patients affected by COVID-19.","Gasecka, Aleksandra; Borovac, Josip A; Guerreiro, Rui Azevedo; Giustozzi, Michela; Parker, William; Caldeira, Daniel; Chiva-Blanch, Gemma",Cardiovasc. drugs ther,208,22

As proposals cover also prophylactic use, the treatment could be massive, resulting in unprecedent levels of antiviral emissions to the aquatic environment. We have adapted previous models and used available information for predicting the environmental impact of representative medicinal products, covering the main groups under consideration: multitarget antiparasitic (chloroquines and ivermectin), glucocorticoids, macrolide antibiotics and antiviral drugs including their pharmacokinetic boosters. The retrieved information has been sufficient for conducting a conventional environmental risk assessment for the group of miscellaneous medicines; results suggest low concern for the chloroquines and dexamethasone while very high impact for ivermectin and azithromycin, even at use levels well below the default value of 1% of the population. The information on the ecotoxicity of the antiviral medicines is very scarce, thus we have explored an innovative pharmacodynamic-based approach, combining read-across, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), US EPA's Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) in vitro data, pharmacological modes of action, and the observed adverse effects. The results highlight fish sublethal effects as the most sensitive target and identify possible concerns.

Usually being immunosuppressed due to cancer, these patients are at a higher risk of contracting the disease and with hospitals being a potential source of the infection, an urgent need to reorganise the structure of delivery of cancer care is essential. Cancer departments must balance patient care whilst also minimising transmission among patients and healthcare professionals. The Oxford Sarcoma Service was re-structured based on the guidelines issued by the National Health Service (NHS) and the British Orthopaedic Oncology Society (BOOS) to deliver unhindered care to patients. Prioritising patients who needed urgent surgery, weighing the risk-benefit ratio while delivering adjuvant treatments and conducting regular virtual multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meetings combined with personal protection equipment (PPE) usage by all involved healthcare workers were salient features in terms of ensuring the delivery of effective care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We describe a new approach that forecasts the number of incident cases in the near future given past occurrences using only a small number of assumptions. METHODS: Our approach to forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves 1) modeling the observed incidence cases using a Poisson distribution for the daily incidence number, and a gamma distribution for the series interval; 2) estimating the effective reproduction number assuming its value stays constant during a short time interval; and 3) drawing future incidence cases from their posterior distributions, assuming that the current transmission rate will stay the same, or change by a certain degree. RESULTS: We apply our method to predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in a single state in the U.S. and for a subset of counties within the state to demonstrate the utility of this method at varying scales of prediction. Our method produces reasonably accurate results when the effective reproduction number is distributed similarly in the future as in the past. Large deviations from the predicted results can imply that a change in policy or some other factors have occurred that have dramatically altered the disease transmission over time. CONCLUSION: We presented a modelling approach that we believe can be easily adopted by others, and immediately useful for local or state planning.","Zhao, Hongwei; Merchant, Naveed N.; McNulty, Alyssa; Radcliff, Tiffany A.; Cote, Murray J.; Fischer, Rebecca S.

Due to the significant dispersion of PCDP in the dental environment, the use of equipment such as ultrasonic tips have been inadvisable during the pandemic. Several clinical procedures, however, benefit from the use of such equipment. Thus, using a microbial dispersion model of PCDP, the aim of this study was to compare the dispersion caused by the dental drill (DD) an ultrasonic tip (UT) alone and the UT coupled with a Spray control (SC) device. The DD, UT (with or without the SC) were activated for one minute having had the water from the reservoir replaced with a suspension of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (1.5 x 10(8) CFU/mL). Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned at 50cm, 100cm and 150cm from the headrest of the dental chair at different angles (0 degree and 90 degrees). At 50 cm, the mean CFU (standard deviation) of L. casei Shirota was 13554.60 (4071.03) for the DD, 286.67 (73.99) for the US (97.89% reduction), and 4.5 (0.58) CFU for the UT-SC (p < 0.0001), establishing a further 98.43% reduction between UT and UT with SC.

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions. METHODS: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1–3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70% of people) and inability to socially distance (68% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48% (33%–60%) to 66% (44%–71%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6% gross domestic product (0.1% Pakistan–1.1% Chile). CONCLUSIONS: We illustrate the potential for using publicly available data to rapidly assess the equity implications of social protection and non-pharmaceutical intervention policy. Social protection is likely to mitigate inequitable health and economic impacts of lockdown. Although social protection is usually targeted to the poorest, middle quintiles will likely also need support as they are most likely to suffer income losses and are disproportionately more exposed.","Sweeney, Sedona; Capeding, Theo Prudencio Juhani; Eggo, Rosalind; Huda, Maryam; Jit, Mark; Mudzengi, Don; Naylor, Nichola R; Procter, Simon; Quaife, Matthew; Serebryakova, Lela; Torres-Rueda, Sergio; Vargas, Veronica; Vassall, Anna",BMJ Glob Health,208,1

In 2018–2019, season 1, this ED implemented mandatory vaccine screening and offered the vaccine to all eligible patients; however, only 9% of the eligible population received the vaccine. In 2019–2020, season 2, the team sought to improve influenza vaccination rates from 9% to 15% and administer over 2,000 vaccines to eligible ED patients. METHODS: Key drivers included: identifying vaccine hesitancy, providing counseling, reducing administration delays, and developing reminders for vaccine administration. We tested interventions using plan-do-study-act cycles. We included discharged ED patients, age 6 months–18 years old, emergency severity index score 2–5, and no prior vaccine this season. Process measures included percent of patients screened, eligible, accepting the vaccine, and leaving before vaccination. Outcome measures were the percent of eligible patients vaccinated and the total number of vaccines administered. Vaccination time was the balancing measure. RESULTS: We included 57,804 children in this study. Comparing season 1 to 2, screening rates (84%) and eligibility rates (58%) were similar. Vaccine acceptance rates improved from 13% to 22%, the proportion of patients leaving before vaccination decreased from 32% to 17%, and vaccination rates improved from 9% to 20%.

Social workers are working at the front lines responding to the current COVID-19 pandemic in a variety of health care practice settings, including nursing homes, however it is unclear how social workers perceive their preparedness during this time. METHODS: This study employed a cross-sectional survey to nursing home social workers via social media on feelings of preparedness for COVID-19, what has been most professionally helpful for social workers during these times in their role in COVID-19, as well as demographic questions. Demographic data were analyzed using SPSS and qualitative data were analyzed using the rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR) technique. RESULTS: Data are based on a sample of 63 (N=63) nursing home social workers. Findings revealed that while some social workers felt prepared for the coronavirus, many respondents stated that they were unprepared to meet the demands and challenges they were facing. Moreover, participants shared that professional support was critically important to get through COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These findings are important, as social workers are tasked with ensuring each resident attains their highest level of psychosocial well-being, which can be achieved only when nursing home staff are supported.

To determine the basis for this difference in neurovirulence we have studied the acute central nervous system (CNS) infection of these two viruses by in situ hybridization. Both viruses infected the same, specific neuroanatomical areas, predominantly neurons, and spread via the cerebrospinal fluid, along neuronal pathways and between adjacent cells. The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV-4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS.","Fazakerley, John K.; Parker, Suezanne E.; Bloom, Floyd; Buchmeier, Michael J.",Virology,208,32

The objective of this paper was to analyze the prognostic ability of the pulse oximetry saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (SpO2/FiO2) and the ratio of SpO2/FiO2 to the respiratory rate–ROX index–as predictors of IMV in an emergency department in confirmed COVID-19 patients. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was carried out in four provinces of Spain between March and November 2020. The discriminative power of the predictive variable was assessed through a prediction model trained using a derivation sub-cohort and evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) on the validation sub-cohort. A total of 2040 patients were included in the study. The IMV rate was 10.1%, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 35.3%. The performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was better than the ROX index–AUC = 0.801 (95% CI 0.746–0.855) and AUC = 0.725 (95% CI 0.652–0.798), respectively. In fact, a direct comparison between AUCs resulted in significant differences (p = 0.001). SpO2 to FiO2 ratio is a simple and promising non-invasive tool for predicting risk of IMV in patients infected with COVID-19, and it is realizable in emergency departments.","Alberdi-Iglesias, Ana; Martín-Rodríguez, Francisco; Ortega Rabbione, Guillermo; Rubio-Babiano, Ana I.; Núñez-Toste, María G.; Sanz-García, Ancor; del Pozo Vegas, Carlos; Castro Villamor, Miguel A.; Martín-Conty, José L.; Jorge-Soto, Cristina; López-Izquierdo, Raúl",Biomedicines,208,23

Very few studies have reported association between obesity and severity of COVID‐19. In this meta‐analysis, we assessed the association of obesity and outcomes in COVID‐19 hospitalized patients. METHODS: Data from observational studies describing the obesity or body mass index (BMI) and outcomes of COVID‐19 hospitalized patients from December 1, 2019, to August 15, 2020, was extracted following PRISMA guidelines with a consensus of two independent reviewers. Adverse outcomes defined as intensive care units (ICU), oxygen saturation <90%, invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), severe disease and in‐hospital mortality. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using random‐effects models. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies with 10,233 confirmed COVID‐19 patients were included. The overall prevalence of obesity in our study was 33.9% (3473/10,233). In meta‐analysis, COVID‐19 patient with obesity had higher odds of poor outcomes compared to better outcomes with a pooled OR of 1.88 (95%CI:1.25–2.80; p=0.002), with 86% heterogeneity between studies (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a significant association between obesity and COVID‐19 severity and poor outcomes.

Understanding workers’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding this new infectious disease is crucial to preventing and controlling it. This study aimed to assess KAP regarding COVID-19 during the outbreak among workers in China. The present study was part of a cross-sectional online survey study conducted based on a large labor-intensive factory, which has 180,000 workers from various Chinese provinces, from 2 February 2020 to 7 February 2020. KAP related to COVID-19 were measured by 32 items, each item was measured with an agree/disagree/unclear format, and only correct responses were given 1 point. KAP regarding COVID-19 were measured with 20 items, 6 items and 6 items, respectively. A total of 123,768 valid responses (68.8%) were included in the analysis. Generally, the levels of knowledge (mean: 16.3 out of 20 points), attitudes (mean: 4.5 out of 6 points), and practices (mean: 5.8 out of 6 points) related to COVID-19 were high. Only 36,373 respondents (29.4%) disagreed that gargling with salt water is effective in protecting against COVID-19. Moreover, older respondents had decreased levels of knowledge and practices related to COVID-19 (both P values for the trend <0.001), while better-educated respondents had increased levels of knowledge and practices related to COVID-19 (both P values for the trend <0.001). These results suggest that Chinese workers are highly aware of COVID-19, but health authorities still need to provide correct information on COVID-19 prevention and strengthen health interventions, particularly for older and less-educated workers.","Li, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Xi-Ru; Zhong, Wen-Fang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wang, Zheng-He; Chen, Qing; Liu, Dan; Huang, Qing-Mei; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Mao, Ang; Zhang, Duo; Yang, Xingfen; Wu, Xian-Bo; Mao, Chen",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,208,1

METHODS: We performed a single institution retrospective review of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using real time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) who underwent FDG PET/CT for routine cancer care between March 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020, during the height of the pandemic in New York City, New York, United States. PET/CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for imaging findings suspicious for COVID-19. For positive scans, PET and CT findings were recorded, including location, FDG avidity (SUV(max)) and CT morphology. Patient demographics and COVID-19 specific clinical data were collected and analyzed with respect to PET/CT scan positivity, lung SUV(max), and time interval between PET/CT and RT-PCR. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (21 males and 10 females, mean age 57 years ± 16) were evaluated. Thirteen of 31 patients had positive PET/CT scans, yielding a detection rate of 41.9%. Patients with positive scans had significantly higher rates of symptomatic COVID-19 infection (77% vs 28%, p = 0.01) and hospitalizations (46% vs. 0%, p = 0.002) compared to patients with negative scans. Eleven of 13 patients (84.6%) with positive scans had FDG-avid lung findings, with mean lung SUV(max) of 5.36. Six of 13 patients (46.2%) had extrapulmonary findings of FDG-avid thoracic lymph nodes. The detection rate was significantly lower when the scan was performed before RT-PCR versus after RT-PCR (18.8% (n = 3/16) vs. 66.7% (n = 10/15), p = 0.009). Lung SUV(max) was not associated with COVID-19 symptoms, severity, or disease course. CONCLUSION: FDG PET/CT has limited sensitivity for detecting COVID-19 infection. However, a positive PET scan is associated with higher risk of symptomatic infection and hospitalizations, which may be helpful in predicting disease severity.","Yeh, Randy; Elsakka, Ahmed; Wray, Rick; Johnston, Rocio Perez; Gangai, Natalie C.; Yarmohammadi, Hooman; Schoder, Heiko; Pandit-Taskar, Neeta",Clin Imaging,208,1

We aim to evaluate our implementation of a local protocol for treatment of VDD among patients hospitalized for COVID‐19; to assess the prevalence of VDD among COVID‐19 inpatients, and examine potential associations with disease severity and fatality. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective interim audit of a local clinical care pathway for 134 inpatients with COVID‐19. Prevalence of VDD, compliance with local treatment protocol and relationship of baseline serum 25(OH)D with markers of COVID‐19 severity and fatality were analysed. RESULTS: 55.8% of eligible patients received Colecalciferol replacement, albeit not all according to the suggested protocol. Patients admitted to ITU were younger than those managed on medical wards (61.1 years ± 11.8 vs. 76.4 years ± 14.9, respectively, p<0.001), with greater prevalence of hypertension, higher baseline respiratory rate, National Early Warning Score‐2 and C‐Reactive protein level.

Within the evidence published so far, which is very little, no perforation of the gastrointestinal tract has been reported as a complication of this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: Male neonate born preterm with prenatal diagnosis of pulmonary hypoplasia, polycystic renal dysplasia and severe oligohydramnios (Potter sequence), presented acute respiratory distress syndrome 10 min after birth, requiring mechanical ventilation and admission to the intensive care unit. During her stay in intensive care, he developed abdominal distension and presence of biliary content in the nasogastric tube. An abdominal X-ray was performed and showed signs of pneumoperitoneum, evidencing gastric perforation on exploratory laparotomy. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Gastric perforation in neonates is a condition that causes high health costs, morbidity, high risk of mortality and disability, regardless of the cause. The management of gastric perforation in Potter syndrome, as well as any other complication, represents a challenge due to the prognosis of these patients. Renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome are disorders that compromise the function of various structures and organs such as the heart and brain.

In the case of diabetes, maintaining strong connections among children, their families, and their care team is essential to promote and sustain daily adherence to a complex medical regimen. The purpose of this paper is to describe COVID-19 pandemic-related practices and policies affecting the continuity of behavioral health care among children with diabetes. Challenges and opportunities were encountered at the provider, patient, and family levels throughout the rapid transition period from in-person to online care to ensure continuity of services. Institutional, regional, and national policies that impacted the care team’s capacity to respond swiftly to patients’ changing needs were counterbalanced by those related to standards of care, education and training, and resource constraints. At the policy level, COVID-19 re-exposed a number of long-standing and complicated issues about professional licensure among behavioral health providers at the local and state levels and national long-distance practice restrictions during times of crisis. Issues of insurance reimbursement and regulations intended to protect the public may need to adapt and evolve as the practice of behavioral medicine increasingly takes place remotely, online, and over great distances. The sudden transition to telehealth instigated by COVID-19, in addition to the increasing recognition of the benefits of telehealth to favorably affect the reach and impact of traditional behavioral medicine services, offers an unprecedented opportunity to reimagine the medical home and continuity of care for children with diabetes.","Clary, Lauren; Wang, Christine; Byrne, Meghan E; Monaghan, Maureen",Transl Behav Med,208,16

Silkworm as a model lepidopteran insect and important economic insect, has been widely studied in life science, however, the current knowledge on the glycosylation status of its proteome is not satisfactory, and little is known about how pathogenic infections could affect the glycosylation status. This study performed large scale glycosite mapping for the silkworm Bombyx mori P50 strain, and quantitatively compared with that infected with the Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV). Some 400 glycoproteins were mapped in the silkworm, including N- and O-glycoproteins. Upon virus infection, the glycosylation levels of 41 N-glycopeptides were significantly changed, some of them belonging to transmembrane glycoproteins. The O-glycosylation profiles were also affected. In addition, 4 BmCPV-encoded viral proteins were found to be glycosylated for the first time, including polyhedrin, P101, VP3, and the NS protein. This study drafted a silkworm protein glycosylation map and underlined the potential impact of virus infection on glycosylation. Significance This study reveals the characteristics of the glycoproteome in the silkworm strain P50, and quantitatively compared to that infected by the virus BmCPV, which underlines the impact of virus infection on the alteration of protein glycosylation in invertebrate species. Our findings add to the knowledge of the post translational modifications of this model organism, and also uncovered for the first time the glycosylation status of the viral proteins expressed by BmCPV.","Zhu, Feifei; Li, Dong; Song, Dandan; Huo, Shuhao; Ma, Shangshang; Lü, Peng; Liu, Xiaoyong; Yao, Qin; Chen, Keping",J Proteomics,208,1

Neutrophils may contribute to this through a process referred to as immunothrombosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of neutrophil subpopulations in blood preceding the development of COVID‐19 associated PE. METHODS: We studied COVID‐19 patients admitted to the ICU of our tertiary hospital between 19‐03‐2020 and 17‐05‐2020. Point‐of‐care fully automated flow cytometry was performed prior to ICU admission, measuring the neutrophil activation/maturation markers CD10, CD11b, CD16 and CD62L. Neutrophil receptor expression was compared between patients who did or did not develop PE (as diagnosed on CT angiography) during or after their ICU stay. RESULTS: Among 25 eligible ICU patients, 22 subjects were included for analysis, of whom nine developed PE. The median (IQR) time between neutrophil phenotyping and PE occurrence was 9 (7‐12) days. A significant increase in the immune‐suppressive neutrophil phenotype CD16(bright)/CD62L(dim) was observed on the day of ICU admission (P = 0.014) in patients developing PE compared to patients who did not. CONCLUSION: The increase in this neutrophil phenotype indicates that the increased number of CD16(bright)/CD62L(dim) neutrophils might be used as prognostic marker to predict those patients that will develop PE in critical COVID‐19 patients.","Spijkerman, Roy; Jorritsma, Nikita K.

However, contradictory findings have been reported regarding the impact of glycaemic control on COVID‐19 outcome. The aim of this meta‐analysis was to explore the impact of hospital pre‐admission or at‐admission values of HbA1c on COVID‐19 mortality or worsening in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Scopus up to 30th December 2020. Eligibility criteria for study selection were the following: (1)enrolling patients with any form of diabetes mellitus and hospitalized for COVID‐19 and (2) reporting data regarding HbA1c values before infection or at hospital admission in relation to COVID‐19 mortality or worsening. Descriptive statistics, HbA1c values, odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios were extracted from seven observational studies and generic inverse variance (random effects) of OR was used to estimate the effect of HbA1c on COVID‐19 outcome. RESULTS: HbA1c was linearly associated with an increased COVID‐19 mortality or worsening when considered as a continuous variable (OR 1.01 [1.01, 1.01]; p < 0.00001). Similarly, when analysing studies providing the number of events according to the degree of glycaemic control among various strata, a significantly increased risk was observed with poor glycaemic control (OR 1.15 [1.11, 1.19]; p < 0.00001), a result corroborated by sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Notwithstanding the large heterogeneity in study design and patients' characteristics in the few available studies, data suggest that patients with diabetes and poor glycaemic control before infection might have an increased risk of COVID‐19 related mortality.","Prattichizzo, Francesco; de Candia, Paola; Nicolucci, Antonio; Ceriello, Antonio",Diabetes Metab Res Rev,208,16

Nous avons souhaité évaluer l’impact de cette pandémie sur leurs pratiques professionnelles, leurs conditions de travail, leur formation universitaire et leur santé mentale. Matériel et méthodes Un questionnaire en ligne disponible du 17 au 26 avril a été envoyé à tous les internes français en dermatologie par la mailing list de l’association Futurs dermato-venerologues de France. Le questionnaire comprenait 104 questions dont le questionnaire de burn-out de Maslach. Des régressions logistiques multivariées ont été effectuées pour examiner les facteurs associés au maintien d’une activité de dermatologie, une moins bonne supervision, une dégradation de la formation et les causes rapportées, et l’impact psychologique via un score de burn-out. Résultats Les internes déclarant une moins bonne supervision étaient les internes les plus avancés dans le cursus (OR 3,24 IC [1,65 ; 6,65], p <0,001) ou en stage en CH périphériques (OR 2,21 IC [1,14 ; 4,46], p =0,022).

Ces difficultés n’ont pas été exclusivement du fait du changement d’activité ou de la submersion des services par des patients atteints de la COVID-19, puisque la dégradation de la formation n’était pas corrélée à la situation géographique. La mise en place d’outils dématérialisés pour maintenir un lien et une formation adéquate n’a pas pu être mis en œuvre rapidement et efficacement durant la crise. Des stratégies pour accroître l’utilisation des outils numériques de formation et la télé-dermatologie semblent être des armes essentielles pour lutter en temps de crise épidémique avec le moins de répercussions sur leur travail et leur formation. Ces outils sont également adaptés aux nouvelles générations et aux nouveaux modes d’organisation du travail dans la société, dépassant même le cadre de la médecine et de la dermatologie.","Hamann, P.; Shourick, J.; Laurent, C.; Skayem, C.",Annales de Dermatologie et de Vénéréologie,208,1

To investigate how they managed, this paper draws a subsample of parents in dual earner couples (n=1,536) from a national survey of 2,722 Australian men and women conducted during lockdown in May 2020. It asked how much time respondents spent in paid and unpaid labour, including both active and supervisory care, and about their satisfaction with work‐family balance and how their partner shared the load. Overall, paid work time was slightly lower, and unpaid work time was very much higher, during lockdown than before it. These time changes were most for mothers, but gender gaps somewhat narrowed because the relative increase in childcare was higher for fathers. More mothers than fathers were dissatisfied with their work‐family balance and partner's share before COVID‐19. For some the pandemic improved satisfaction levels, but for most they became worse. Again, some gender differences narrowed, mainly because more fathers also felt negatively during lockdown than they had before.","Craig, Lyn; Churchill, Brendan",Gend Work Organ,208,1

Methods We used publicly available data bases to explore the hypothesis as well as the effect of multiple social and environmental factors in the 20 Italian regions. Results Our results suggest that vaccination against seasonal influenza might beneficially impact on incidence and severity of the novel corona virus epidemic. Population density and vehicular traffic were also moderately associated with cumulative incidence of COVID-19. None of the other variables we considered showed an effect on cumulative incidence, case fatality rate or mortality from COVID-19. Conclusions Extending influenza vaccination coverage particularly among the elderly, vulnerable individuals with specific chronic medical conditions, health care workers, and workers in other essential services, early in the upcoming 2020 influenza season, might help reduce the health impact of a second epidemic wave of COVID-19.","Cocco, P.; Meloni, F.; Coratza, A.; Schirru, D.; Campagna, M.; De Matteis, S.",Prev Med,208,26

It also assessed the impact of social distancing on pathologies presenting to ENT and reviewed the usefulness of telephone consultations in semi-urgent presentations. METHOD: A retrospective review was conducted of 97 instances of patient care carried out in the rapid access ENT clinic at a large district general hospital. RESULTS: Otitis externa and foreign bodies represented 25 per cent and 13 per cent of consultations respectively. Tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess were uncommon, representing 6 per cent of total consultations. Telephone appointments represented only 28 per cent of total consultations; however, they appeared to reduce the number of physical appointments required. CONCLUSION: Otitis externa and foreign bodies continue to be common during the pandemic. Social distancing measures reduced the number of tonsillitis and quinsy presentations. Telephone consultations are effective for certain urgent presentations to ENT, most noticeably nasal trauma and follow up of non-serious pathologies.","Stubington, T J; Morrison, B; Sevilla, C; Judd, O",The Journal of laryngology and otology,208,24

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cardiac involvement and of respiratory failure in a cohort of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in an academic hospital in Lombardy, one of the most affected Italian (and worldwide) regions by the epidemic. The study included 405 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted to a medical ward from February 25th to March 31st, 2020. Follow-up of surviving patients ended either at hospital discharge or by July 30th, 2020. Myocardial injury was defined on the basis of the presence of blood levels of hs-TnI above the 99th percentile upper reference limit. Respiratory function was assessed as PaO(2)/FiO(2) (P/F) ratio. The primary end-point was death for any cause. During hospitalization, 124 patients died. Death rate increased from 7.9% in patients with normal hs-TnI plasma levels and no cardiac comorbidity to 61.5% in patients with elevated hs-TnI and cardiac involvement (p < 0.001). At multivariable analysis, older age, P/F ratio < 200 (both p < 0.001) and hs-TnI plasma levels were independent predictors of death. However, it must be emphasized that the median values of hs-TnI were within normal range in non-survivors. Cardiac involvement at presentation was associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients, but, even in a population of COVID-19 patients who did not require invasive ventilation at hospital admission, mortality was mainly driven by older age and respiratory failure.

Combinations of inhibitors of both the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the exonuclease could overcome this deficiency. Here we report the identification of hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors Pibrentasvir and Ombitasvir as SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease inhibitors. In the presence of Pibrentasvir, RNAs terminated with the active forms of the prodrugs Sofosbuvir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Molnupiravir and AT-527 were largely protected from excision by the exonuclease, while in the absence of Pibrentasvir, there was rapid excision. Due to its unique structure, Tenofovir-terminated RNA was highly resistant to exonuclease excision even in the absence of Pibrentasvir. Viral cell culture studies also demonstrate significant synergy using this combination strategy. This study supports the use of combination drugs that inhibit both the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase and exonuclease for effective COVID-19 treatment.","Wang, Xuanting; Sacramento, Carolina Q.; Jockusch, Steffen; Chaves, Otávio Augusto; Tao, Chuanjuan; Fintelman-Rodrigues, Natalia; Chien, Minchen; Temerozo, Jairo R.; Li, Xiaoxu; Kumar, Shiv; Xie, Wei; Patel, Dinshaw J.; Meyer, Cindy; Garzia, Aitor; Tuschl, Thomas; Bozza, Patrícia T.; Russo, James J.; Souza, Thiago Moreno L.; Ju, Jingyue",bioRxiv,208,12

ERK1/2 activation directly phosphorylates and activates p90RSK, which, in turn, activates various signalling events through selection of different phosphorylation substrates. Upregulation of p90RSK has been reported in numerous human diseases. p90RSK plays an important role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Thus, aberrant activation of p90RSK plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of organ dysfunction and damage. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of p90RSK functions and roles in the development and progression of kidney diseases.

This virus is supposed to be spread by human to human transmission. Cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 which is identical or similar in different species of animals such as pigs, ferrets, cats, orangutans, monkeys, and humans. Moreover, a recent study predicted that dog might be secondary host during the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from bat to human. Therefore, there is a possibility of spreading SARS-CoV-2 through domestic pets. There are now many reports of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in dogs, cats, tigers, lion, and minks. Experimental data showed ferrets and cats are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as infected by virus inoculation and can transmit the virus directly or indirectly by droplets or airborne route. Based on these natural infection reports and experimental data, whether the pets are responsible for SARS-CoV-2 spread to human; needs to be deeply investigated. Humans showing clinical symptoms of respiratory infections have been undergoing for COVID-19 diagnostic test but many infected people and few pets confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 remained asymptomatic. In this review, we summarize the natural cases of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with the latest researches conducted in this field.

Currently, effective anti-SFTSV intervention remains unavailable. Favipiravir (T-705) was recently reported to show in vitro and in animal model antiviral efficacy against SFTSV. Here, we conducted a single-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of T-705 in treating SFTS (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry website, number ChiCTR1900023350). From May to August 2018, laboratory-confirmed SFTS patients were recruited from a designated hospital and randomly assigned to receive oral T-705 in combination with supportive care or supportive care only. Fatal outcome occurred in 9.5% (7/74) of T-705 treated patients and 18.3% (13/71) of controls (odds ratio, 0.466, 95% CI, 0.174–1.247). Cox regression showed a significant reduction in case fatality rate (CFR) with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.366 (95% CI, 0.142–0.944). Among the low-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold ≥26), T-705 treatment significantly reduced CFR from 11.5 to 1.6% (P = 0.029), while no between-arm difference was observed in the high-viral load subgroup (RT-PCR cycle threshold <26). The T-705-treated group showed shorter viral clearance, lower incidence of hemorrhagic signs, and faster recovery of laboratory abnormities compared with the controls. The in vitro and animal experiments demonstrated that the antiviral efficacies of T-705 were proportionally induced by SFTSV mutation rates, particularly from two transition mutation types. The mutation analyses on T-705-treated serum samples disclosed a partially consistent mutagenesis pattern as those of the in vitro or animal experiments in reducing the SFTSV viral loads, further supporting the anti-SFTSV effect of T-705, especially for the low-viral loads.","Li, Hao; Jiang, Xia-Ming; Cui, Ning; Yuan, Chun; Zhang, Shao-Fei; Lu, Qing-Bin; Yang, Zhen-Dong; Xin, Qin-Lin; Song, Ya-Bin; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Liu, Hai-Zhou; Du, Juan; Fan, Xue-Juan; Yuan, Lan; Yuan, Yi-Mei; Wang, Zhen; Wang, Juan; Zhang, Lan; Zhang, Dong-Na; Wang, Zhi-Bo; Dai, Ke; Bai, Jie-Ying; Hao, Zhao-Nian; Fan, Hang; Fang, Li-Qun; Xiao, Gengfu; Yang, Yang; Peng, Ke; Wang, Hong-Quan; Li, Jian-Xiong; Zhang, Lei-Ke; Liu, Wei",Signal Transduct Target Ther,208,5

Despite the overrepresentation of dsRNA viruses, our results show that Santiago’s sewage RNA virosphere was composed mostly of unknown sequences (88%), while known viral sequences were dominated by viruses that infect bacteria (60%), invertebrates (37%) and humans (2.4%). Interestingly, we discovered three novel genogroups within the Picobirnaviridae family that can fill major gaps in this taxa’s evolutionary history. We also demonstrated the dominance of emerging Rotavirus genotypes, such as G8 and G6, that have displaced other classical genotypes, which is consistent with recent clinical reports.

The virus targets cells for entry by high affinity binding of its spike protein to cell-surface angiotensin-converting enzyme- 2 (ACE2). It was not known whether ACE2 is expressed on taste receptor cells (TRCs) nor if TRCs are infected directly. Using an in-situ hybridization (ISH) probe and an antibody specific to ACE2, it seems evident that ACE2 is present on a subpopulation of specialized TRCs, namely, PLCβ(2) positive, Type II cells in taste buds in taste papillae. Fungiform papillae (FP) of a SARS-CoV-2+ patient exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, including taste changes, were biopsied. Based on ISH, replicating SARS-CoV-2 was present in Type II cells of this patient. Therefore, taste Type II cells provide a portal for viral entry that predicts vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity. The continuity and cell turnover of the FP taste stem cell layer of the patient were disrupted during infection and had not fully recovered 6 weeks post symptom onset. Another patient suffering post-COVID-19 taste disturbances also had disrupted stem cells.

Several studies have confirmed that the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) serves a key role in the pathogenesis of PD. Changes to the gastrointestinal microbiome (GM) cause misfolding and abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in the intestine. Abnormal α-syn is not eliminated via physiological mechanisms and is transported into the central nervous system (CNS) via the vagus nerve. The abnormal levels of α-syn aggregate in the substantia nigra pars compacta, not only leading to the formation of eosinophilic Lewis Bodies in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, but also leading to the stimulation of an inflammatory response in the microglia. These pathological changes result in an increase in oxidative stress (OS), which triggers nerve cell apoptosis, a characteristic of PD. This increase in OS further oxidizes and intensifies abnormal aggregation of α-syn, eventually forming a positive feedback loop. The present review discusses the abnormal accumulation of α-syn in the intestine caused by the GM changes and the increased levels of α-syn transport to the CNS via the MGBA, resulting in the loss of DA neurons and an increase in the inflammatory response of microglial cells in the brain of patients with PD. In addition, relevant clinical therapeutic strategies for improving the GM and reducing α-syn accumulation to relieve the symptoms and progression of PD are described.","Lei, Qingchun; Wu, Tingting; Wu, Jin; Hu, Xiaogang; Guan, Yingxia; Wang, Ying; Yan, Jinyuan; Shi, Guolin",Mol Med Rep,208,4

During the pandemic, patients with pulmonary embolism had fewer predisposing conditions (previous pulmonary embolism 5.1% vs. 18.2%, p = .05; previous surgery 2% vs. 35.4%, p = .0001; deep vein thrombosis 11.1% vs. 45.5%, p=.0001); peripheral pulmonary embolisms were the most frequent (73.5% vs. 50%, p =. 029). Conclusions: There is an increased risk of having a pulmonary embolism during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which affects patients with a different clinical profile and more often causes distal pulmonary embolisms.","García-Lledó, A.; del Palacio-Salgado, M.; Álvarez-Sanz, C.; Pérez-Gil, M M; Cruz-Díaz, Á.",Rev Clin Esp,208,30

We evaluated vaccine hesitancy in the US by employment status and occupation category during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout. US adults 18-64 years completed an online COVID-19 survey 3,179,174 times from January 6-May 19, 2021. Data was aggregated by month. Survey weights matched the sample to the US population age, gender, and state profile. Weighted percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Changes in vaccine hesitancy from January-May varied widely by employment status (e.g., -7.8% [95%CI, -8.2--7.5] among those working outside the home, a 26.6% decrease; -13.3% [95%CI, -13.7--13.0] among those not working for pay, a 44.9% decrease), and occupation category (e.g., -15.9% [95%CI, -17.7--14.2] in production, a 39.3% decrease; -1.4% [95%CI, -3.8--1.0] in construction/extraction, a 3.0% decrease). April 20-May 19, 2021, vaccine hesitancy ranged from 7.3% (95%CI, 6.7-7.8) in computer/mathematical professions to 45.2% (95%CI, 43.2-46.8) in construction/extraction. Hesitancy was 9.0% (95%CI, 8.6-9.3) among educators and 14.5% (95%CI, 14.0-15.0) among healthcare practitioners/technicians. While the prevalence of reasons for hesitancy differed by occupation, over half of employed hesitant participants reported concern about side effects (51.7%) and not trusting COVID-19 vaccines (51.3%), whereas only 15.0%) didn’t like vaccines in general. Over a third didn’t believe they needed the vaccine, didn’t trust the government, and/or were waiting to see if it was safe. In this massive national survey of adults 18-64 years, vaccine hesitancy varied widely by occupation. Reasons for hesitancy indicate messaging about safety and addressing trust are paramount.","King, Wendy C.; Rubinstein, Max; Reinhart, Alex; Mejia, Robin J.",Prev Med Rep,208,8

A 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used in a switchback design. From December 1 to February 28, cows grazed dormant upland range in 8 pastures (32 ± 2 ha each). The equivalent of 0.45 kg of supplement/cow per d (42% CP) was provided to half of the cows on a pasture basis 3 d/wk. For 30 d before the beginning of breeding (May 1 to May 31), half of the cows grazed a common subirrigated meadow (58 ha), and the remainder was fed grass hay in a drylot. Cow BW and BCS were monitored throughout the year, and steer calf performance was determined until slaughter. Feeding supplement prepartum improved (P = 0.01 to P < 0.001) BCS precalving (5.1 vs. 4.7) and prebreeding (5.1 vs. 4.9) and increased (P = 0.02) the percentage of live calves at weaning (98.5 vs. 93.6%) but did not affect (P = 0.46) pregnancy rate (93 vs. 90%). Calves born to dams fed supplement prepartum had similar (P = 0.29) birth weight (37 vs. 36 kg) but greater (P = 0.02) weaning weight (218 vs. 211 kg). However, steer feedlot DMI (8.53 vs. 8.48 kg), ADG (1.6 vs. 1.6 kg), and carcass weight (369 vs. 363 kg) were not affected (P = 0.23 to P = 0.89) by prepartum supplementation.

This is a relevant issue when millions of vapers (and smokers) must remain under indoor confinement and/or share public outdoor spaces with non-users. The fact that the respiratory flow associated with vaping is visible (as opposed to other respiratory activities) clearly delineates a safety distance of 1–2 m along the exhaled jet to prevent direct exposure. Vaping is a relatively infrequent and intermittent respiratory activity for which we infer a mean emission rate of 79.82 droplets per puff (6–200, standard deviation 74.66) comparable to mouth breathing, it adds into shared indoor spaces (home and restaurant scenarios) a 1% extra risk of indirect COVID-19 contagion with respect to a “control case” of existing unavoidable risk from continuous breathing. As a comparative reference, this added relative risk increases to 44–176% for speaking 6–24 min per hour and 260% for coughing every 2 min. Mechanical ventilation decreases absolute emission levels but keeps the same relative risks. As long as direct exposure to the visible exhaled jet is avoided, wearing of face masks effectively protects bystanders and keeps risk estimates very low. As a consequence, protection from possible COVID-19 contagion through vaping emissions does not require extra interventions besides the standard recommendations to the general population: keeping a social separation distance of 2 m and wearing of face masks.","Sussman, Roberto A.; Golberstein, Eliana; Polosa, Riccardo",Int J Environ Res Public Health,208,32

METHODS: This is a conceptual article. The literature search is based on Pubmed, including articles published between January 2015 and December 2020. The purpose was to determine whether telemedicine is effective in the management of chronic diseases in the epidemic situation and to develop telemedicine and chronic disease management for long-term epidemic situations in the future. FINDINGS: Telemedicine has demonstrated its advantages during the COVID-19 epidemic and can provide diversified clinical care services for patients with chronic diseases; these services have played a vital role in epidemic prevention and control, greatly alleviated the shortage of medical resources, increased the utilization level of medical resources, and reduced the cross-infection risk during treatment in hospitals.

Due to this infection, many countries of the world suffers from great economic loss. The researchers around the world are very active to make a plan and policy for its early eradication. The government officials have taken full action for the eradication of this virus using different possible control strategies. It is the first priority of the researchers to develop safe vaccine against this deadly disease to minimize the infection. Different approaches have been made in this regards for its elimination. In this study, we formulate a mathematical epidemic model to analyze the dynamical behavior and transmission patterns of this new pandemic. We consider the environmental viral concentration in the model to better study the disease incidence in a community. Initially, the model is constructed with the derivative of integer-order. The classical epidemic model is then reconstructed with the fractional order operator in the form of Atangana–Baleanu derivative with the nonsingular and nonlocal kernel in order to analyze the dynamics of Coronavirus infection in a better way. A well-known estimation approach is used to estimate model parameters from the COVID-19 cases reported in Saudi Arabia from March 1 till August 20, 2020. After the procedure of parameters estimation, we explore some basic mathematical analysis of the fractional model. The stability results are provided for the disease free case using fractional stability concepts. Further, the uniqueness and existence results will be shown using the Picard–Lendelof approach. Moreover, an efficient numerical scheme has been proposed to obtain the solution of the model numerically. Finally, using the real fitted parameters, we depict many simulation results in order to demonstrate the importance of various model parameters and the memory index on disease dynamics and possible eradication.","Alzahrani, Ebraheem; El-Dessoky, M.M.; Baleanu, Dumitru",Results Phys,208,1

Gene expression profiling provides information on potential modes of action and human relevance, and tools have recently become available for pathway-based quantitative risk assessment. The objective of this study was to use toxicogenomics in the context of human health risk assessment. We explore the utility of toxicogenomics in risk assessment, using published gene expression data from C57BL/6 mice exposed to 18, 54 and 162 μg Printex 90 carbon black nanoparticles (CBNP). Analysis of CBNP-perturbed pathways, networks and transcription factors revealed concomitant changes in predicted phenotypes (e.g., pulmonary inflammation and genotoxicity), that correlated with dose and time. Benchmark doses (BMDs) for apical endpoints were comparable to minimum BMDs for relevant pathway-specific expression changes. Comparison to inflammatory lung disease models (i.e., allergic airway inflammation, bacterial infection and tissue injury and fibrosis) and human disease profiles revealed that induced gene expression changes in Printex 90 exposed mice were similar to those typical for pulmonary injury and fibrosis. Very similar fibrotic pathways were perturbed in CBNP-exposed mice and human fibrosis disease models. Our synthesis demonstrates how toxicogenomic profiles may be used in human health risk assessment of nanoparticles and constitutes an important step forward in the ultimate recognition of toxicogenomic endpoints in human health risk. As our knowledge of molecular pathways, dose–response characteristics and relevance to human disease continues to grow, we anticipate that toxicogenomics will become increasingly useful in assessing chemical toxicities and in human health risk assessment.","Bourdon, Julie A.; Williams, Andrew; Kuo, Byron; Moffat, Ivy; White, Paul A.; Halappanavar, Sabina; Vogel, Ulla; Wallin, Håkan; Yauk, Carole L.",Toxicology,208,16

However, time trends in the USA and Canada remain uncertain because the most recent analyses of PE-related mortality were published in the early 2000s. METHODS: For this retrospective epidemiological study, we accessed medically certified vital registration data from the WHO Mortality Database (USA and Canada, 2000–17) and the Multiple Cause of Death database produced by the Division of Vital Statistics of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; US, 2000–18). We investigated contemporary time trends in PE-related mortality in the USA and Canada and the prevalence of conditions contributing to PE-related mortality reported on the death certificates. We also estimated PE-related mortality by age group and sex. A subgroup analysis by race was performed for the USA. FINDINGS: In the USA, the age-standardised annual mortality rate (PE as the underlying cause) decreased from 6·0 deaths per 100 000 population (95% CI 5·9–6·1) in 2000 to 4·4 deaths per 100 000 population (4·3–4·5) in 2006. Thereafter, it continued to decrease to 4·1 deaths per 100 000 population (4·0–4·2) in women in 2017 and plateaued at 4·5 deaths per 100 000 population (4·4–4·7) in men in 2017. Among adults aged 25–64 years, it increased after 2006. The median age at death from PE decreased from 73 years to 68 years (2000–18). The prevalence of cancer, respiratory diseases, and infections as a contributing cause of PE-related death increased in all age categories from 2000 to 2018. The annual age-standardised PE-related mortality was consistently higher by up to 50% in Black individuals than in White individuals; these rates were approximately 50% higher in White individuals than in those of other races. In Canada, the annual age-standardised mortality rate from PE as the underlying cause of death decreased from 4·7 deaths per 100 000 population (4·4–5·0) in 2000 to 2·6 deaths per 100 000 population (2·4–2·8) in 2017; this decline slowed after 2006 across age groups and sexes. INTERPRETATION: After 2006, the initially decreasing PE-related mortality rates in North America progressively reached a plateau in Canada, while a rebound increase was observed among young and middle-aged adults in the USA. These findings parallel recent upward trends in mortality from other cardiovascular diseases and might reflect increasing inequalities in the exposure to risk factors and access to health care.

High-affinity variants of sACE2, engineered using high-throughput mutagenesis, are capable of neutralizing COVID-19 infection as decoy receptors. These variants compete with native ACE2 present on cells by binding with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, making native ACE2 on cell surfaces available to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-1,7, thus alleviating the exaggerated inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 infection.

Asthma is remarkably heterogenous and it is currently unclear how patient intrinsic factors may relate to COVID-19. Objective Identify and characterize subsets of asthmatics at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Participants from 2 large asthma cohorts were stratified using clinically relevant parameters to identify factors related to ACE2 expression within bronchial epithelium. ACE-2 correlated gene signatures were used to interrogate publicly available databases to identify upstream signaling events and novel therapeutic targets. Results Stratifying by Type 2 inflammatory biomarkers, we identified subjects who demonstrated low peripheral blood eosinophils accompanied by increased expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in bronchial epithelium. Genes highly correlated with ACE2 overlapped with Type 1 and 2 interferon signatures, normally induced by viral infections. T cell recruitment and activation within bronchoalveolar lavage cells of ACE2-high subjects was reciprocally increased. These patients demonstrated characteristics corresponding to risk factors for severe COVID-19, including male sex, history of hypertension, low peripheral blood and elevated BAL lymphocytes. Conclusion ACE2 expression is linked to upregulation of viral response genes in a subset of Type-2 low asthmatics with characteristics resembling known risk factors for severe COVID-19. Therapies targeting the interferon family and T cell activating factors may therefore be of benefit in a subset of patients. Clinical Implication Type-2 low asthmatics may be at increased risk for adverse outcome from COVID-19 and deserve increased vigilance upon developing symptoms.","Camiolo, Matthew J.; Gauthier, Marc; Kaminski, Naftali; Ray, Anuradha; Wenzel, Sally E.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,208,12

During the pandemic, University students suffer from adverse mental health outcomes resulted from the continuous spread of the disease, sensational media reporting, and implementation of social lockdown. Graduating class students are more affected due to cancellation and postponing of anticipated events such as exchange studies and graduation ceremonies. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety, depression, and stress among graduating class students. METHODS: Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 10 to 30, 2020 at the University of Gondar. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 350 students. Data were collected using a structured self-administered questionnaire, entered in EPI DATA version 3, analyzed using SPSS version 21, and presented in frequencies, percentages, tables, and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable analysis was investigated using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS: The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among graduating class students was 22.2%, 39.6%, and 40.2% respectively. Living in an urban area, living with a family, sedentary lifestyle, unable to practice COVID-19 preventive measures, and having a contact history increases the risk of developing stress. Living in an urban area, substance use, sedentary lifestyle, and fear of infecting family increase the risk of developing anxiety. Students who came from an urban area, live with a family, study non-health departments, had confirmed cases in the family and did not perform physical exercise had higher odds of developing depression. CONCLUSION: More than one-fifth, more than one-third, and nearly two-fifths of graduating students had stress, anxiety, and depression respectively. It is better to develop effective strategies and interventions, train students about self-protection, and establish a psychological crisis intervention team to minimize the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mekonen, Enyew Getaneh; Workneh, Belayneh Shetie; Ali, Mohammed Seid; Muluneh, Niguse Yigzaw",Psychol Res Behav Manag,208,3

Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated. Here we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the SC2 receptor ACE2 and viral spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin and inhibitors of phosphorylation, abrogate these ACE2- and SPP-inductive events. Human studies also demonstrated that the levels of circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and patients with CM where they correlate with COVID-19 severity. These studies demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of ACE2 and SPP; that this induction is a major mechanism contributing to the effects of aging during SC2 infection and that CHI3L1 coopts the CHI3L1 axis to augment SC2 infection. CHI3L1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of and is an attractive therapeutic target in COVID-19.","Kamle, Suchitra; Ma, Bing; He, Chuan Hua; Akosman, Bedia; Zhou, Yang; Lee, Chang Min; El-Deiry, Wafik S.; Huntington, Kelsey; Liang, Olin; Machan, Jason T.; Kang, Min-Jong; Shin, Hyeon Jun; Mizoguchi, Emiko; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A.",bioRxiv,208,19

The aerosol transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 is observed often associated with infection clusters under poorly ventilated environment. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, significant transformation and optimization of traditional ventilation systems are needed. This paper is aimed to offer better understanding and insights into effective ventilation design to maximize its ability in airborne risk control, for particularly the COVID-19. Comprehensive reviews of each phase of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from source to receptor were conducted, so as to provide a theoretical basis for risk prediction and control. Infection risk models and their key parameters for risk assessment of SARS-CoV-2 are analyzed. Special focus is given on the efficacy of different ventilation strategies in mitigating airborne transmission. Ventilation interventions are found mainly impacting on the dispersion and inhalation phases of aerosol transmission. The airflow patterns become a key factor in controlling the aerosol diffusion and distribution. Novel and personalized ventilation design, effective integration with other environmental control techniques and resilient HVAC system design to adapt both common and epidemic conditions are still remaining challenging and need to be solved with the aid of multidisciplinary research and intelligent technologies.","Xu, Chunwen; Liu, Wenbing; Luo, Xilian; Huang, Xingyu; Nielsen, Peter V.",Sustain Cities Soc,208,4

Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search of electronic information was conducted to identify studies comparing the diagnostic performance within the same patient cohort of chest CT scan versus RT-PCR in COVID-19 suspected cases. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other test performance characteristics, discrepant findings between both investigations and main chest CT findings. Random effects modelling was used for the analyses. Results Thirteen non-randomised studies enrolling 4092 patients were identified. Accuracy was statistically significantly higher for RT-PCR versus chest CT (Odds Ratio [OR] = 0.22, P = 0.001). Chest CT is also less specific than RT-PCR. Ground-glass opacities and consolidations were the most common chest CT manifestations. Importantly, early small studies tended to favour chest CT versus later larger studies. Conclusion Chest CT is inferior to RT-PCR for the initial detection of COVID-19 and has more false positives. It may still be useful in confirming COVID-19, however, in patients with a suspicious clinical presentation, but who have a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test.","Karam, M.; Althuwaikh, S.; Alazemi, M.; Abul, A.; Hayre, A.; Gavin, B.",,208,16

He visited an ENT clinic and was diagnosed as chronic left purulent otitis media. He began at-home antibiotic therapy with poor benefit. On 09/13/18, he was admitted to the hospital “S. Maria ”of Terni for persistence of left ear pain and complete hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed “in correspondence of the petrous rock and the mastoid…presence of flogistic tissue.” Auricular swabs and later surgical drainage of the purulent material were performed and both were positive for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive only to colistin in absence of synergism with rifampin. The patient underwent antibiotic therapy with ceftolozane-tazobactam, a new generation cephalosporin with anti-Pseudomonas activity and a β-lactamase inhibitor, that currently is indicated for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections, with complete healing. In literature, it is described a series of 12 patients with severe MDR (multidrug-resistant) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections (6 pneumonia) who received salvage therapy with ceftolozane-tazobactam after inappropriate empirical and/or suboptimal treatment. This study included a case of a male patient of 45 years, affected by Burkitt lymphoma and severe neutropenia, who presented with otitis and mastoiditis, and isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in surgical drainage of the purulent material of the ear (blood cultures were negative). He underwent antibiotic therapy with ceftolozane–tazobactam at a dosage of 3 g/8 h for 21.3 days. The patient was healed, but a late recurrence was described because of isolation of ceftolozane-tazobactam-resistant Pseudomonas after therapy. The possibility of acquiring resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam should be considered in patients with previous exposure to beta-lactams and with poor response to these antibiotics.","Saraca, L.

Studies have assessed the effects of a given vertical health programme on a health system separately from the goals of the vertical programme itself. Further, these health system effects are often categorised as either positive or negative. Yet health systems are in fact complex, dynamic and tightly linked. Relationships between elements of the system determine programme and system-level outcomes over time. METHODS: We constructed a causal loop diagram of the interactions between mass polio vaccination campaigns and government health systems in Ethiopia, India and Nigeria, working inductively from two qualitative datasets. The first dataset was 175 interviews conducted with policymakers, officials and frontline staff in these countries in 2011–2012. The second was 101 interviews conducted with similar groups in 2019, focusing on lessons learnt from polio eradication. RESULTS: Pursuing high coverage in polio campaigns, without considering the dynamic impacts of campaigns on health systems, cost campaign coverage gains over time in weaker health systems with many campaigns. Over time, the systems effects of frequent campaigns, delivered through parallel structures, led to a loss of frontline worker motivation, and an increase in vaccine hesitancy in recipient populations. Co-delivery of interventions helped to mitigate these negative effects. In stronger health systems with fewer campaigns, these issues did not arise. CONCLUSION: It benefits vertical programmes to reduce the construction of parallel systems and pursue co-delivery of interventions where possible, and to consider the workflow of frontline staff. Ultimately, for health campaign designs to be effective, they must make sense for those delivering and receiving campaign interventions, and must take into account the complex, adaptive nature of the health systems in which they operate.","Neel, Abigail H; Closser, Svea; Villanueva, Catherine; Majumdar, Piyusha; Gupta, S D; Krugman, Daniel; Akinyemi, Oluwaseun Oladapo; Deressa, Wakgari; Kalbarczyk, Anna; Alonge, Olakunle",BMJ Glob Health,208,8

Anti-CD13 antibodies can neutralize HCMV infectivity, and HCMV viremia after bone marrow transplantation induces anti-CD13 autoantibodies which correlate with development of chronic graft vs. host disease. We examined whether murine CD13/APN was similarly implicated in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) disease. MCMV infection did induce anti-CD13 antibodies in mice in a strain-specific manner. ICR and 129S mice developed high titers of anti-CD13 antibodies and anti-MCMV antibodies after MCMV infection, whereas CBA and CBAxC57BL/6 f1 hybrid mice produced antibodies against MCMV only. Unlike HCMV, no evidence was found for a correlation between host cell CD13/APN expression and infection, or for the presence of CD13/APN on MCMV particles, although APN inhibitors decreased MCMV plaque formation. Reproduction of CD13/APN autoantibody production in the murine system should make it possible to determine if these antibodies contribute to CMV pathogenesis.","Kasman, Laura M.",Virology,208,17

Nowadays, the world encounters a huge health crisis by the COVID-19 viral infection. Nucleotide inhibitors gave a lot of promising results in terms of its efficacy against different viral infections. In this work, molecular modeling, docking, and dynamics simulations are used to build a model for the viral protein RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and test its binding affinity to some clinically approved drugs and drug candidates. Molecular dynamics is used to equilibrate the system upon binding calculations to ensure the successful reproduction of previous results, to include the dynamics of the RdRp, and to understand how it affects the binding. The results show the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Cefuroxime, Tenofovir, and Hydroxychloroquine, in binding to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Additionally, Setrobuvir, YAK, and IDX-184, show better results, while four novel IDX-184 derivatives show promising results in attaching to the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. There is an urgent need to specify drugs that can selectively bind and subsequently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The availability of a punch of FDA-approved anti-viral drugs can help us in this mission, aiming to reduce the danger of COVID-19.

The pollution haven hypothesis caused by trade has aroused wide attention. The fragmentation of international production has reshaped trade patterns. The proportion of intermediate product trade in global trade is increasing. However, little has been done to study the pollution haven of different pollutants under different trade patterns. In this paper, major environmental pollutants CO(2) (carbon dioxide), SO(2) (sulfur dioxide), and NO(x) (nitrogen oxides) are selected as the research objects. This study investigated the global pollution haven phenomenon in 43 countries and 56 major industries from 2000 to 2014. Based on the MRIO model, the trade mode is divided into three specific patterns: final product trade, intermediate product trade in the last stage of production, and the trade related to the global value chain. The results show that trade liberalization could reduce global CO(2), SO(2), and NOx emissions, and intermediate product trade has a more significant emission reduction effect than final product trade. Trade’s impacts on each country are various, and the main drivers are also different. For example, the European Union avoids becoming a pollution haven mainly through the trade related to the global value chain. The suppressed emissions under this trade pattern are 71.8 Mt CO(2), 2.2 Mt SO(2), 2.2 Mt NO(x). India avoids most pollutants emissions through intermediate product trade. China has become the most serious pollution haven through final product trade. The trade pattern could increase China 829.4 Mt CO(2), 4.5 Mt SO(2), 2.6 Mt NO(x) emissions in 2014.","Zhang, Ke; Wang, Xingwei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,208,2

Background Studies in areas with high COVID-19 infection rates indicate that the pandemic has had direct and indirect effects on community response to OHCA and negative impacts on survival. Data from areas with lower infection rates are lacking. Methods In Multnomah County, OR and Ventura County, CA, we evaluated OHCA with attempted resuscitation by EMS from March 1 – May 31, 2020 and March 1 – May 31, 2019. Results Comparing 231 OHCA in 2019 to 278 in 2020, the proportion receiving bystander CPR was lower in 2020 (61% to 51%, p=0.02) and bystander use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) declined (5% to 1%, p=0.02). EMS response time increased (6.6 ± 2.0 to 7.6 ± 3.0 minutes, p<0.001), and fewer OHCA survived to hospital discharge (14.7% to 7.9%, p=0.02). Incidences rates did not change significantly (p>0.07), and coronavirus infection rates were low (Multnomah 143/100,000, Ventura 127/100,000 as of May 31), compared to rates of ∼1600-3000/100,000 in the New York City region at that time. Conclusions The community response to OHCA was altered from March to May 2020, with less bystander CPR, delays in EMS response time, and reduced survival from OHCA. These results highlight the pandemic’s indirect negative impact on OHCA even in communities with relatively low incidence of COVID-19 and point to potential opportunities for countering the impact.","Uy-Evanado, Audrey; Chugh, Harpriya S.; Sargsyan, Arayik; Nakamura, Kotoka; Mariani, Ronald; Hadduck, Katy; Salvucci, Angelo; Jui, Jonathan; Chugh, Sumeet S.; Reinier, Kyndaron",JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology,208,26

The electronic survey consisted of 22 questions related to demographic profile, knowledge, clinical practice and anxiety level of the participants towards dental management of COVID-19. The survey was sent to participants by email and mobile phone messages to be filled electronically. RESULTS: Majority of respondents pointed to aerosol (98.5%), saliva (90.6%) and mucosal contact (71.4%) as the transmission routes of COVID-19. Amongst all clinical symptoms of the disease questioned, fever (99.8%), dry cough (99.1%), fatigue (90.0%) were associated with COVID-19 by vast majority of population. 96.4% of respondents agreed the usage of gloves as personal protective equipment and it was followed by face shield (88.1%), disposable gown (83.4%), protective goggles (73.9%). Increased usage of FFP2/N95 (33.9%) and FFP3/N99 (10.9%) respirators, contrary to reduction of surgical mask usage (50.7%), were observed in aerosolgenerating procedures comparing to dental procedures without producing aerosol and these differences were highly significant (p<0.001, p=0.004, p<0.001). The mean anxiety level of respondents was 3.35 ± 1.18 (ranging from 0 to 5). CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated an adequate knowledge, especially in clinical symptoms of COVID-19 amongst dentists.

Using maximum-likelihood approaches and generalized linear mixed models, we analysed the proportion of infected residents in ACFs and identified covariates associated with the proportion of infected residents. RESULTS: The secondary-attack risk was estimated at 4.1%, suggesting a high efficiency of the IPC measures implemented in the region. Mask wearing and the establishment of COVID-19 zones for infected residents were the two main covariates associated with lower secondary-attack risks. CONCLUSIONS: Wearing masks and isolating potentially infected residents appear to be associated with a more limited spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ACFs.","Reyné, Bastien; Selinger, Christian; Sofonea, Mircea T; Miot, Stéphanie; Pisoni, Amandine; Tuaillon, Edouard; Bousquet, Jean; Blain, Hubert; Alizon, Samuel",Int J Epidemiol,208,26

The transportation equation for the negative ions was resolved combined with the bulk air velocity and the electric field. The bacteria distribution was solved numerically by integrating the susceptibility constant, which was acquired from the experiments. Two types of bacteria (Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis) were aerosolized and released into a 9-m ventilation duct system. Inactivation efficiencies were calculated for inlet velocities from 2 to 6.5 m/s and for various ion intensities. The efficiencies for S. marcescens and S. epidermidis were 31.53% (SD, 11.4%) and 12.17% (SD, 0.43%), respectively, with susceptibility constants of 8.67 × 10(−11) Colony-Forming Units (CFU)/ions and 2.72 × 10(−11) CFU/ions, respectively.

The fluorescence of this rkDNA was perfectly quenched in the presence of GO. When the quenched rkDNA–GO system was added to the RPA-amplified sequence of the target SARS-CoV-2, the fluorescence recovered dramatically. The combined RPA/rkDNA–GO system exhibited extremely high selectivity (discrimination factor: 17.2) and sensitivity (LOD = 6.0 aM) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to explore the association of personal virus exposure, regional epidemic condition, and social support with medical students' depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Methods: In February 2020, 5,982 medical students (60.0% females, Mean(age) = 21.7 years, Median(age) = 22 years) completed an online survey consisting of demographics, personal virus exposure, the Patient Health Questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, and the Social Support Rating Scale. Results: The prevalence rates of mild to severe depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms were 35.2 and 22.8%, respectively. Multivariate linear regression showed that students with low- or medium-level social support had a higher risk of experiencing depressive or anxiety symptoms than those with high-level social support. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with mild to severe depressive or anxiety symptoms. Respondents living in provinces with 500–1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases had an increased risk of experiencing mild to severe depressive symptoms compared with those living in provinces with <100 cases. Other related factors were gender and years of training. Conclusions: Some medical students suffered from a poor psychological status during the COVID-19 outbreak. Low social support was a stronger factor related to poor mental status compared with COVID-19 exposure or the provincial epidemic condition. Thus, we suggest that colleges or universities provide social support and mental health screening.","Yin, Yi; Yang, Xingjie; Gao, Lan; Zhang, Suoyuan; Qi, Meng; Zhang, Ligang; Tan, Yunlong; Chen, Jingxu",Front Psychiatry,208,20

Consequently, much research has gone into the development of pre-clinical assays for the discovery of new or repurposing of FDA-approved therapies. Preventing viral entry into a host cell would be an effective antiviral strategy. One mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 entry occurs when the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to an ACE2 receptor followed by cleavage at two cut sites (“priming”) that causes a conformational change allowing for viral and host membrane fusion. This fusion event is proceeded by release of viral RNA within the host cell. TMPRSS2 has an extracellular protease domain capable of cleaving the spike protein to initiate membrane fusion. Additionally, knock-out studies in mice have demonstrated reduced infection in the absence of TMPRSS2 with no detectable physiological impact; thus, TMPRSS2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. A validated inhibitor of TMPRSS2 protease activity would be a valuable tool for studying the impact TMPRSS2 has in viral entry and potentially be an effective antiviral therapeutic. To enable inhibitor discovery and profiling of FDA-approved therapeutics, we describe an assay for the biochemical screening of recombinant TMPRSS2 suitable for high throughput application. We demonstrate effectiveness to quantify inhibition down to subnanomolar concentrations by assessing the inhibition of camostat, nafamostat and gabexate, clinically approved agents in Japan for pancreatitis due to their inhibition of trypsin-like proteases. Nafamostat and camostat are currently in clinical trials against COVID19. The rank order potency for the three inhibitors is: nafamostat (IC(50) = 0.27 nM), camostat (IC(50) = 6.2 nM) and gabexate (IC(50) = 130 nM). Further profiling of these three inhibitors against a panel of proteases provides insight into selectivity and potency.","Shrimp, Jonathan H.; Kales, Stephen C.; Sanderson, Philip E.; Simeonov, Anton; Shen, Min; Hall, Matthew D.",bioRxiv,208,20

In fact, viruses interact with epigenetic factors to promote the viral replication by stimulating the entry into the lytic cycle, but also by promoting viral latency. Furthermore, epigenetics control the immune response implemented by the host to counteract viral infections. Thus, epigenetic modifications are identified as potential therapeutic targets to control viral infections. Several studies have already shown the efficiency of inhibitors of histone deacetylases, demethylases, acetyltransferases and methyltransferases, as well as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases in viral infections repression or in latency reactivation. In this review, we will examine the epigenetic regulation of viral infections by several DNA viruses, e.g. HSV, EBV, HCMV, KSHV, HBV, HPV and HAdV, and RNA viruses, e.g. HCV, HIV, IAV and CoV. Also, we will discuss the potential use of therapeutic approaches targeting epigenetics for the control of viral infections.","Ahmad, Sandy Haidar; Assaf, Mona Diab; Herbein, Georges",Virologie (Montrouge),208,1

However, some of these policies prevent people from physical contact. Consequently, many individuals may rely on social media to obtain information concerning COVID-19. Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia. Methods Utilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n=1078 with 628 males; mean age=26.24 years [SD±7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding. Results Problematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were through fear of COVID-19 (unstandardized coefficient [B]=0.177; Bootstrapping SE=0.026) and COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.060; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Problematic social media use was significantly associated with insomnia both directly and indirectly. The indirect effect was through fear of COVID-19 (B=0.062; Bootstrapping SE=0.019) but not COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.012; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Discussion/Conclusion Due to the pressure of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals are highly likely to develop psychological distress and insomnia. Apart from developing appropriate health policies to minimize the spread of COVID-19 infection, healthcare providers should design appropriate online campaigns to eliminate people’s fear of COVID-19 and to diminish misunderstanding concerning COVID-19.","Lin, Chung-Ying; Broström, Anders; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.",Internet Interv,208,24

Currently available guidelines generally recommend empiric antimicrobial therapy when the specific etiology is unknown. However, shifts in epidemiology, emergence of new pathogens, and increasing antimicrobial resistance underscore the importance of identifying causative pathogen(s). Although viral CAP among children is increasingly recognized, distinguishing viral from bacterial etiologies remains difficult. Obtaining high quality samples from infected lung tissue is typically the limiting factor. Additionally, interpretation of results from routinely collected specimens (blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal swabs) is complicated by bacterial colonization and prolonged shedding of incidental respiratory viruses. Using current literature on assessment of CAP causes in children, we developed an approach for identifying the most likely causative pathogen(s) using blood and sputum culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and paired serology.

BRD causes a significant health and economic burden worldwide that partially stems from the challenges involved in determining the pathogens causing the disease. Methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have the potential to identify the causative pathogens but require lab equipment and extensive sample processing making the process lengthy and expensive. To combat this limitation, LAMP allows accurate pathogen detection in unprocessed samples by the naked eye allowing for potentially faster and more precise diagnostics on the farm. The assay developed here offers 66.7–100% analytical sensitivity, and 100% analytical specificity (using contrived samples) while providing 60–100% concordance with PCR results when tested on five steers in a feedlot. The use of a consumer-grade water bath enabled on-farm execution by collecting a nasal swab from cattle and provided a colorimetric result within 60 min.

This study compares the changes in epidemiology and trauma patient access to emergency imaging and surgery during the pandemic response. METHODS: The population of interest was all trauma patients captured in the hospital's Trauma Registry from March 16(th) ‐September 10(th), 2016‐2020. Regression modelling assessed changes in mechanism and severity of the injury, and mortality during two lockdowns compared with the proceeding four years. Cases were matched with Hospital Administrative databases, to assess median time from admission to emergency CT scan, operating theatre, length of stay, and immediate surgery (OPSTAT). RESULTS: Throughout 2020, the hospital treated 525 COVID‐19 patients. Compared with previous years, there was up to a 34% reduction in major trauma and a 28% reduction in minor trauma admissions during the pandemic (p<0.05). ICU admissions were almost half of predicted. Some of the largest reductions were seen in motor vehicle crashes (49%) and falls (28%) (p<0.05). Time to CT, surgery and immediate surgery (OPSTAT) showed no change and having a suspected COVID‐19 diagnosis did not prolong any of these times except for the length of stay. Mortality was similar to previous years. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had widespread societal changes, resulting in a substantial decrease in trauma presentations. Despite COVID's immense impact on the hospital's trauma service, the quality of care was not impaired.","Saxon, Leanne; Fazio, Timothy N; Gumm, Kellie; Tong, Steven Y.

In Australia and Canada, the dominant narrative of resource extraction is that most of the benefits flow away from host regions. This paper draws on evolutionary economic geography, presenting a case study of the Limestone Coast in South Australia, which previously extracted and distributed gas locally to food and fibre manufacturing industries. New policies seeking to renew the gas industry in the region, provide subsidies for exploration. Scenarios were developed to help inform decisions about the role of gas within this region. Qualitative analysis of the scenarios emphasised that gas needs to be affordable and locally accessible. Quantitative modelling showed that using the gas locally by manufacturing industries as part of broader industrial expansion would lead to greater benefits compared with exporting all gas outside the region. We conclude that policy settings have gone some way towards realising increased benefits for the region. Regional stakeholders clearly favoured the local use scenario but saw it as unlikely in the context of current infrastructure limitations. Stakeholders sought policy support for infrastructure to enable the preferred scenario to be realised.","Measham, Thomas G.; Poruschi, Lavinia; Marcos-Martinez, Raymundo",Extr Ind Soc,208,20

Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, and virtually completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if ACEIs and ARBs are associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization overall, or hospitalization involving intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. DESIGN: Observational case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥ 66 years with hypertension, treated with ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), or thiazide diuretics. MAIN MEASURES: Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcomes of Covid-19 hospitalization, or hospitalization involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. RESULTS: A total of 35,300 cases of hospitalized Covid-19 were matched to 228,228 controls on calendar date and neighborhood of residence. The median age of cases was 79 years, 57.4% were female, and the median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (interquartile range 5–12). ACEIs and ARBs were associated with a slight reduction in Covid-19 hospitalization risk compared with treatment with other first-line antihypertensives (OR for ACEIs 0.95, 95% CI 0.92–0.98; OR for ARBs 0.94, 95% CI 0.90–0.97). Similar results were obtained for hospitalizations involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. There were no meaningful differences in risk for ACEIs compared with ARBs. In an analysis restricted to monotherapy with a first-line agent, CCBs were associated with a small increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization compared with ACEIs (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.04–1.14), ARBs (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05–1.15), or thiazide diuretics (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03–1.19). CONCLUSIONS: ACEIs and ARBs were not associated with an increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization or with hospitalization involving ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death. The finding of a small increased risk of Covid-19 hospitalization with CCBs was unexpected and could be due to residual confounding.

Methods (1) Paired t‐tests to compare mean daily deaths and hospital admissions during and after weekends (Saturday–Tuesday) with means for the week, in south‐east England; (2) Linear regressions to see whether trends of daily deaths change when admissions are reduced at Christmas. Results Neither mean daily all‐cause, respiratory or ischaemic heart deaths exceeded weekly averages during weekends, or during Saturday–Monday or Saturday–Tuesday, despite falls in daily elective and daily emergency hospital admissions at weekends that averaged 61–72% and 14–22%, respectively. During 19–24 December, daily deaths were above annual means, respiratory deaths by 49% (29, 1–58), but elective admissions fell and although emergency admissions tended to rise, total admissions rose only for respiratory disease, and only by 33% (376, −47 to 799). On Christmas Day (25 December), even emergency admissions fell sharply below previous trends, respiratory emergency admissions by 18% (P < 0.01). Respiratory deaths alone then immediately increased (P < 0.01) above trend, by 5.9% (5.8 deaths/day) on 26 December and by 12.9% (12.9) on 27 December. Conclusions No adverse effect on mortality was apparent within 2 days from reduction in medical services at weekends. However, respiratory deaths accelerated sharply after reduction in elective and emergency admissions at Christmas, when rates of infection and mortality from respiratory disease were high.

Inosine pranobex (IP) has been previously demonstrated to be effective in treating acute viral respiratory infections. In three NH experiencing the SARS-CoV-2 virus epidemic, we started treatment with IP as soon as clients tested PCR+. In Litovel, CZ, the difference in case-fatality rate (CFR) for the PCR+ group using vs. not using IP was statistically significant, and the odds ratio (OR) was 7.2. When comparing all those taking IP in the three NH vs. the non-drug PCR+ group in Litovel, the odds ratio was lower for all three NH, but still significant at 2.9. The CFR in all three tested NHs, age range 75–84, compared to the CFR in all NHs in the Czech Republic, was significantly reduced (7.5% vs. 18%) (OR: 2.8); there was also a significant difference across all age groups (OR: 1.7). In our study with 301 residents, the CFR was significantly reduced (OR: 2.8) to 11.9% (17/142) in comparison to a study in Ireland with 27.6% (211/764). We think the effect of IP was significant in this reduction; nevertheless, these are preliminary results that need larger-scale trials on COVID-19 patients.","Beran, Jiří; Špajdel, Marian; Katzerová, Věra; Holoušová, Alena; Malyš, Jan; Finger Rousková, Jana; Slíva, Jiří",Pathogens,208,28

So far > 162 million cases have been confirmed, including > 3 million deaths. Because of the pandemic still spreading across the globe the accomplishment of computational methods to find new potential mechanisms of virus inhibitions is necessary. According to the fact that C(60) fullerene (a sphere-shaped molecule consisting of carbon) has shown inhibitory activity against various protein targets, here the analysis of the potential binding mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with C(60) fullerene was done; it has resulted in one and two possible binding mechanisms, respectively. In the case of 3CLpro, C(60) fullerene interacts in the catalytic binding pocket. And for RdRp in the first model C(60) fullerene blocks RNA synthesis pore and in the second one it prevents binding with Nsp8 co-factor (without this complex formation, RdRp can’t perform its initial functions). Then the molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of created complexes. The obtained results might be a basis for other computational studies of 3CLPro and RdRp potential inhibition ways as well as the potential usage of C(60) fullerene in the fight against COVID-19 disease.","Hurmach, Vasyl V.; Platonov, Maksim O.; Prylutska, Svitlana V.; Scharff, Peter; Prylutskyy, Yuriy I.; Ritter, Uwe",Sci Rep,208,18

One of the main sources of household air pollution (HAP) is the traditional stove. So-called improved cookstoves (ICS) do not reduce emissions to levels that benefit health, but the poorest communities are unlikely to have access to cleaner cooking in the medium term. Therefore, ICS are being promoted as an intermediate step. This paper summarises the current evidence on the ICS available to the global poorest, utilising data from the Clean Cookstoves Catalog and systematic review evidence from the field. The cheapest stoves offer little reduction in HAP. Only one ICS, available at US$5 or less, (the canarumwe) minimally reduced pollutants based on ISO testing standards and no studies included in the systematic reviews reported tested this stove in the field. We recommend field testing all ICS as standard, and clear information on stove characteristics, sustainability, safety, emissions efficiency, in-field performance, affordability, availability in different settings, and the ability of the stove to meet community cooking needs. In addition, ICS should be promoted alongside a suite of measures, including improved ventilation and facilities to dry wood, to further reduce the pollutant levels.","Stanistreet, Debbi; Phillip, Eunice; Kumar, Nitya; Anderson de Cuevas, Rachel; Davis, Megan; Langevin, Jessica; Jumbe, Vincent; Walsh, Aisling; Jewitt, Sarah; Clifford, Mike",Int J Environ Res Public Health,208,23

METHODS: Here, we developed a duplex digital PCR assay to examine ΔPRRA variants in Vero-E6-propagated isolates, human organoids, experimentally infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: We found that currently transmitting SARS-CoV-2 contained a quasispecies of wildtype, ΔPRRA variants and upstream variants that have mutations upstream the PRRA motif. Moreover, the ΔPRRA variants were readily detected despite at a low intra-host frequency in transmitted founder viruses in hamsters and in COVID-19 patients including acute cases and a family cluster with a prevalence rate of 52.9%.

Algorithms and decision-making procedures have been modified, not only to treat new clinical findings in COVID-19 positive patients, but also to avoid complications related to pulmonary and systemic infections. Additionally, COVID-19 negative patients experienced challenging management, due to hospital crowding, the risk of nosocomial COVID-19 transmission, and pandemic emergencies. In this context, aortic interventions were subject to several difficulties. First, in COVID-19 positive patients, there was the onset of new pathological scenarios including thrombotic manifestations and the subsequent complications. Second, in both COVID-19 negative and positive patients, there was a need to deliver optimal treatment with acceptable perioperative risks, forcing a rethinking of decisionmaking especially in terms of indications for treatments.

Individuals were randomly allowed to participate from April 29th to May 17th, namely 50 days after the lockdown imposition and the day before its abrogation. RESULTS: 58.84% of respondents experienced a change in their sleep habits. 71% of those whose sleep changed showed a delayed sleep pattern. Overall, a two-fold risk of delayed sleep pattern without any change in total sleep time emerged during the investigation period. Females emerged almost 2 times more likely to modify their sleep habits than males. Youths were also more likely to experience modifications than old people, who conversely appeared protected. A significant improvement in daytime sleepiness occurred during the home isolation which additionally correlated with delayed bedtime and less sleep time.

The specific aim of our account is to provide a methodological prescription for developing measurement processes in the context of limited theory. The account should be useful to philosophers of science, who are interested in the intersection between representation and intervention; scientists, who are interested in methodological suggestions for theory-development and reliability; and interdisciplinary researchers, who are interested in the intersections between the pandemic, built environments, and social processes.

With Ebola virus, Marburg virus is a member of the family Filoviridae that causes severe hemorrhagic fever disease in humans and nonhuman primates, but results in little to no pathological consequences in bats. Understanding host-pathogen interactions within reservoir host species and how it differs from hosts that experience severe disease is an important aspect of evaluating viral pathogenesis and developing novel therapeutics and methods of prevention. RESULTS: Progress in studying bat reservoir host responses to virus infection is hampered by the lack of host-specific reagents required for immunological studies. In order to establish a basis for the design of reagents, we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome. We performed de novo transcriptome assembly using deep RNA sequencing data from 11 distinct tissues from one male and one female bat. We observed high similarity between this transcriptome and those available from other bat species. Gene expression analysis demonstrated clustering of expression profiles by tissue, where we also identified enrichment of tissue-specific gene ontology terms. In addition, we identified and experimentally validated the expression of novel coding transcripts that may be specific to this species. CONCLUSION: We comprehensively characterized the R. aegyptiacus transcriptome de novo. This transcriptome will be an important resource for understanding bat immunology, physiology, disease pathogenesis, and virus transmission.

We applied our new model to study the adsorption of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to silica nanoparticles. Due to its abundance and extensive use in manufacturing, silica represents a reservoir where the virus can accumulate. It is therefore important to study the adsorption and the persistence of viral components on inanimate surfaces. EXPERIMENTS We used previously published datasets of nanoparticle-adsorbed proteins to validate the new model. We then used integrated experimental methods and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to characterise binding of the RBD to silica nanoparticles and the effect of such binding on RBD structure. FINDINGS The new model showed excellent fit with existing datasets and, combined to new RBD-silica nanoparticles binding data, revealed a surface occupancy of 32% with respect to the maximum RBD packing theoretically achievable. Up to 25% of RBD's secondary structures undergo conformational changes as a consequence of adsorption onto silica nanoparticles. Our findings will help developing a better understanding of the principles governing interaction of proteins with surfaces and can contribute to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through contaminated objects.","Soloviev, Mikhail; Siligardi, Giuliano; Roccatano, Danilo; Ferrari, Enrico",Journal of colloid and interface science,208,16

The current body of knowledge may also lack plausible mechanisms linking ACEs to mental health in young adulthood. This study aims to identify early adversity patterns using expanded ACEs items and investigate the pathway of ACEs and self-esteem to depressive symptoms in young adulthood. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health, including a nationally representative sample in the U.S. (N = 10,702). We identified the ACEs patterns and estimated the direct and indirect associations between ACEs and depressive symptoms through self-esteem, using a latent class analysis with a distal outcome. RESULTS: This study identified four distinct groups of ACEs that include Child Maltreatment, Household Dysfunction, Violence, and Low Adversity. The Child Maltreatment class showed a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms compared to other ACEs groups. Self-esteem mediated the negative association of child maltreatment with depressive symptoms. The Violence class presented a significantly higher risk of depressive symptoms than Low Adversity, but no mediation of self-esteem was found. CONCLUSION: The study highlights the profound consequence of child abuse/neglect and identifies self-esteem as a plausible mediating mechanism.

In conclusion, according to the requirements of speed and low cost of the methods, and to achieve the highest rate of detection of respiratory viruses, the combined use of DFA and m‐PCR is today likely to be the best way to improve diagnosis of respiratory illnesses in children.

Binding constant, number of binding sites, and thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures were measured. Results of fluorescence quenching and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy showed that changes occurred in the microenvironment of tryptophan residues and the molecular conformation of pepsin. Molecular interaction distance and energy-transfer efficiency between pepsin and NIC were determined based on Förster nonradiative energy-transfer mechanism. Furthermore, the binding of NIC inhibited pepsin activity in vitro. All these results indicated that NIC bound to pepsin mainly through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds at a single binding site. In conclusion, this study provided substantial molecular-level evidence that NIC could induce changes in pepsin structure and conformation.","Guo, Liuqi; Ma, Xiaoli; Yan, Jin; Xu, Kailin; Wang, Qing; Li, Hui",J Fluoresc,208,26

The detection of specific CXR findings has been the main focus of several artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the wide range of possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to detect every possible condition by building multiple separate systems, each of which detects one or more pre-specified conditions. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For training and tuning the system, we used a de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6 international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2 datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019. Our results suggest that the AI system trained using a large dataset containing a diverse array of CXR abnormalities generalizes to new patient populations and unseen diseases. In a simulated workflow where the AI system prioritized abnormal cases, the turnaround time for abnormal cases reduced by 7–28%. These results represent an important step towards evaluating whether AI can be safely used to flag cases in a general setting where previously unseen abnormalities exist. Lastly, to facilitate the continued development of AI models for CXR, we release our collected labels for the publicly available dataset.","Nabulsi, Zaid; Sellergren, Andrew; Jamshy, Shahar; Lau, Charles; Santos, Edward; Kiraly, Atilla P.; Ye, Wenxing; Yang, Jie; Pilgrim, Rory; Kazemzadeh, Sahar; Yu, Jin; Kalidindi, Sreenivasa Raju; Etemadi, Mozziyar; Garcia-Vicente, Florencia; Melnick, David; Corrado, Greg S.; Peng, Lily; Eswaran, Krish; Tse, Daniel; Beladia, Neeral; Liu, Yun; Chen, Po-Hsuan Cameron; Shetty, Shravya",Sci Rep,208,5

It is therefore not surprising that insufficient sleep quality or quantity are associated with greater self-reported stress levels. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a particularly stressful and unprecedented time in history. While stress has been undoubtedly high during the past year, it’s less clear to what extent sleep has affected people’s perceived stress on a daily basis. The aim of this research was to estimate whether daily variations in sleep quality and duration were associated with general stress and/or stress related to COVID-19. METHODS: The study used a nationally representative sample to assess daily variations in sleep and stress for a period of two weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Morning assessments were conducted using online sleep diaries. These diaries were used to estimate sleep duration (in minutes) and sleep quality (subjective rating on a 5-point Likert scale). Evening assessments were also completed online and prompted participants to rate (0 to 100) their current “general” stress level, as well as their current anxiety in relation to COVID-19. Separate mixed effects models were conducted with days (Level 1) nested within participants (Level 2). Stress variables were lagged by a day to estimate the association between sleep (AM assessment) and stress (PM assessment). TST and SQ were entered as fixed effects and intercepts were allowed to vary randomly. RESULTS: 4,048 participants (Mage = 46.3 years; 78% women) were included as part of the analyses. The results supported that lower self-reported sleep quality predicted greater general stress levels (b = -1.43, p < 0.001). Lower self-reported sleep quality also predicted greater COVID-19 related anxiety (b = -0.543, p < 0.001). In contrast, sleep duration was not significantly related to general stress or COVID-19 anxiety after controlling for sleep quality. CONCLUSION: The present data supports that daily variations in sleep quality are related to a person’s overall stress levels and COVID-19 anxiety. These findings may have implications for the role of good sleep in mitigating the increases in stress that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schistosomiasis affects all age groups, however, school children are at the highest risk of the disease. In the past years, global partners in schistosomiasis control have renewed their commitments. Many countries including few in Africa are working towards eliminating the disease. In Nigeria, the transmission of schistosomiasis is still active. This poses a serious health challenge as morbidity builds up in infected individuals. Mass drug administration (MDA) has helped to reduce morbidity but it is not adequate to abate transmission in many areas of the country. The integration of other aspects of control will provide a more sustainable result. This review attempted to discuss schistosomiasis transmission patterns in Nigeria in different eras. We identified some pitfalls in efforts towards the control of schistosomiasis in Nigeria.

A simple point-of-care diagnostic test to screen for ventricular dysfunction would be clinically useful to guide management. We sought to review the clinical experience with an artificial intelligence ECG (AI ECG) to screen for ventricular dysfunction in patients with documented COVID-19. We examined all patients in the Mayo Clinic system who underwent clinically indicated electrocardiography and echocardiography within 2 weeks following a positive COVID-19 and had permitted use of their data for research were included. Of the 27 patients who met the inclusion criteria, one had a history of normal ventricular function who developed COVID-19 myocarditis with rapid clinical decline. The initial AI ECG in this patient indicated normal ventricular function. Repeat AI-ECG demonstrated a probability of ejection fraction (EF) < =40 % of 90.2%, corroborated with an echocardiogrpahic EF of 35%. One other patients had a pre -existing EF <=40%, accurately detected by the algorithm before and after COVID diagnosis, and another was found to have a low EF by AI ECG and echocardiography with the COVID diagnosis. The AUC for detection of EF < =40% was 0.95. This case series suggests that the AI ECG, previously demonstrated to detect ventricular dysfunction in a large general population, may be useful as a screening tool for the detection of cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.","Attia, Zachi I.; Kapa, Suraj; Noseworthy, Peter A.; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Friedman, Paul A.",Mayo Clin Proc,208,21

We measured COVID-19 lockdown-induced stress levels and the severity of depressive symptoms prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown in different age groups and then searched for potential risk factors in a well-characterized general population-based sample. A total of 715 participants were tested for mental distress and related risk factors at two time-points, baseline testing prior to COVID-19 and follow-up testing during COVID-19, using a battery of validated psychological tests including the Perceived Stress Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire. Longitudinal measurements revealed that the prevalence of moderate to high stress and the severity of depressive symptoms increased 1.4- and 5.5-fold, respectively, during the COVID-19 lockdown. This surge in mental distress was more severe in women, but was present in all age groups with the older age group exhibiting, cross-sectionally, the lowest levels of mental distress prior to and during the lockdown. Illness perception, personality characteristics such as a feeling of loneliness, and several lifestyle components were found to be associated with a significant increase in mental distress.

This paper is an attempt to illustrate the potential impact of the new surveillance system through a description of the existing surveillance system and data before and after the revision. METHODS: After a historical review of surveillance system in Japan, the current surveillance system is described. Data sets of actual case numbers reported and incidence rate per 1,000,000 population are compared before and after the revision. RESULTS: Comparison of the data between the 2 periods revealed that most of the diseases have had declining trends after the new law was enacted with several exceptions. However, although no major break in continuity is observed in seriously perceived disease, in milder diseases there are striking gaps between the numbers reported in the mandatory and sentinel reporting framework. Sentinel reporting framework maintained the continuity of data without major gaps. CONCLUSIONS: From this perspective, the new surveillance system with two different frameworks of mandatory reporting for severe diseases and sentinel reporting for milder diseases seems to be working well. But continuous efforts should be made for evaluation and improvement of surveillance system and risk communication through the research on data analysis and effective communication method.","Taniguchi, Kiyosu; Hashimoto, Shuji; Kawado, Miyuki; Murakami, Yoshitaka; Izumida, Michiko; Ohta, Akiko; Tada, Yuki; Shigematsu, Mika; Yasui, Yoshinori; Nagai, Masaki",J Epidemiol,208,1

We find eight interactions, of which three are between pairs where one locus lies in gene ORF3a, both loci holding nonsynonymous mutations. We also find interactions between two loci in gene nsp13, both holding nonsynonymous mutations, and four interactions involving one locus holding a synonymous mutation. Altogether, we infer interactions between loci in viral genes ORF3a and nsp2, nsp12, and nsp6, between ORF8 and nsp4, and between loci in genes nsp2, nsp13, and nsp14.

This study aimed to extend current knowledge by investigating the potential mediating roles of resilience and anxiety in the association between physical fitness and mental health in children. A total of 269 children were selected by stratified random sampling from three primary schools in China. Physical fitness was scored using the Chinese National Student Physical Fitness Standard. Resilience, anxiety, and mental health data were collected using the following questionnaires: Resilience Scale for Chinese Adolescents, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and the Mental Health Test. The PROCESS macro developed by Hayes was used to conduct serial multiple mediation analysis. We found that physical fitness, resilience, anxiety, and mental health were significantly correlated. Children with higher physical fitness had lower mental health problems; however, this statistical significance was not detectable after controlling for resilience and anxiety. Serial multiple mediation analysis revealed that the association of physical fitness with mental health was partially mediated by resilience and anxiety. These results indicate that the positive association of physical fitness with mental health in children may be changed through resilience and anxiety, which appear to play serial multiple mediating roles in this association. These findings contribute to deeper understanding of the associations between these factors and suggest that promoting physical fitness independent of considering resilience and anxiety may be insufficient to achieve good mental health in children.","Li, Yansong; Xia, Xue; Meng, Fanying; Zhang, Chunhua",Curr Psychol,208,16

Investigating presence of and associations between these pathogens in healthy individuals is still a rather unexplored field of research, but may have implications for interpreting findings during disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We selected 986 nasopharyngeal samples from 433 6- to 24-month-old healthy children that had participated in a randomized controlled trial. We determined the presence of 20 common respiratory viruses using real-time PCR. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus were identified by conventional culture methods. Information on risk factors was obtained by questionnaires. We performed multivariate logistic regression analyses followed by partial correlation analysis to identify the overall pattern of associations. S. pneumoniae colonization was positively associated with the presence of H. influenzae (adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval 1.18–2.16), M. catarrhalis (1.78, 1.29–2.47), human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.19–2.22) and enteroviruses (1.97, 1.26–3.10), and negatively associated with S. aureus presence (0.59, 0.35–0.98). H. influenzae was positively associated with human rhinoviruses (1.63, 1.22–2.18) and respiratory syncytial viruses (2.78, 1.06–7.28). M. catarrhalis colonization was positively associated with coronaviruses (1.99, 1.01–3.93) and adenoviruses (3.69, 1.29–10.56), and negatively with S. aureus carriage (0.42, 0.25–0.69).

Cannabis users may be especially vulnerable, having been previously shown to have higher levels of apathy and anhedonia than non-users. METHODS: In this survey study, we measured apathy and anhedonia before and after lockdown measures were implemented, in n=256 adult and n=200 adolescent cannabis users, and n=170 adult and n=172 adolescent controls. Scores on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) were investigated with mixed measures Analyses of Covariance, with factors User-Group, Age-Group, and Time, controlling for depression, anxiety, and other drug use. RESULTS: Adolescent cannabis users had significantly higher SHAPS scores before lockdown, indicative of greater anhedonia, compared to adolescent controls (p=.03, η(p) (2)=.013). Contrastingly, adult users had significantly lower scores on both the SHAPS (p<.001, η(p) (2)=.030) and AES (p<.001, η(p) (2)=.048) after lockdown, compared to adult controls. Scores on both scales increased during lockdown across groups, and this increase was significantly smaller for cannabis users (AES p=.001, η(p) (2)=.014; SHAPS p=.01, η(p) (2)=.008). Exploratory analyses revealed that dependent cannabis users had significantly higher scores overall (AES p<.001, η(p) (2)=.037; SHAPS p<.001, η(p) (2)=.029), and a larger increase in scores (AES p=.04, η(p) (2) .010; SHAPS p=.04, η(p) (2)=.010), compared to non-dependent users. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adolescents and adults have differential associations between cannabis use, and apathy and anhedonia. Within users, dependence may be associated with higher levels of apathy and anhedonia regardless of age, and a greater increase in levels during the COVID-19 lockdown.","Skumlien, Martine; Langley, Christelle; Lawn, Will; Voon, Valerie; Sahakian, Barbara J",Int J Neuropsychopharmacol,208,1

The capacity to precisely control variables, such as the flow rate ratio, temperature, total flow rate, etc., allows for greater tunability of the NMed systems that are more standardized and automated than the ones obtained by well-known benchtop protocols. However, it is a crucial aspect to be able to obtain NMeds with the same characteristics of the previously optimized ones. In this study, we focused on the transfer of a production protocol for hybrid NMeds (H-NMeds) consisting of PLGA, Cholesterol, and Pluronic(®) F68 from a benchtop nanoprecipitation method to a microfluidic device. For this aim, we modified parameters such as the flow rate ratio, the concentration of core materials in the organic phase, and the ratio between PLGA and Cholesterol in the feeding organic phase. Outputs analysed were the chemico–physical properties, such as size, PDI, and surface charge, the composition in terms of %Cholesterol and residual %Pluronic(®) F68, their stability to lyophilization, and the morphology via atomic force and electron microscopy. On the basis of the results, even if microfluidic technology is one of the unique procedures to obtain industrial production of NMeds, we demonstrated that the translation from a benchtop method to a microfluidic one is not a simple transfer of already established parameters, with several variables to be taken into account and to be optimized.","Ottonelli, Ilaria; Duskey, Jason Thomas; Rinaldi, Arianna; Grazioli, Maria Vittoria; Parmeggiani, Irene; Vandelli, Maria Angela; Wang, Leon Z.; Prud’homme, Robert K.; Tosi, Giovanni; Ruozi, Barbara",Pharmaceutics,208,21

However, according to several reports, RT-PCR showed a low sensitivity and multiple tests may be required to rule out false negative results. Recently, chest computed tomography (CT) has been an efficient tool to diagnose COVID-19 as it is directly affecting the lungs. In this paper, we investigate the application of pre-trained models in diagnosing patients who are positive for COVID-19 and differentiating it from normal patients, who tested negative for coronavirus. The study aims to compare the generalization capabilities of deep learning models with two thoracic radiologists in diagnosing COVID-19 chest CT images. A dataset of 3000 images was obtained from the Near East Hospital, Cyprus, and used to train and to test the three employed pre-trained models. In a test set of 250 images used to evaluate the deep neural networks and the radiologists, it was found that deep networks (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and DenseNet-201) can outperform the radiologists in terms of higher accuracy (97.8%), sensitivity (98.1%), specificity (97.3%), precision (98.4%), and F1-score (198.25%), in classifying COVID-19 images.","Helwan, Abdulkader; Ma'aitah, Mohammad Khaleel Sallam; Hamdan, Hani; Ozsahin, Dilber Uzun; Tuncyurek, Ozum",Comput Math Methods Med,208,1

Some 265 insert-containing clones were studied. Hybridization of these inserts with poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells led to the conclusion that they were located at the 3′-end of the genome. After subcloning in M13 phage DNA, clones were sequenced by the Sanger technique. A 1,710-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the gene coding for the viral N-protein was established. It shows 2 overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The 3′-non-coding end of the gene has an 8-nucleotide sequence in common with the homologous genome areas of MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. This sequence may represent the polymerase RNA binding site. An upstream sequence surrounding the first AUG of the smaller ORF corresponds to a potentially functional initiation codon. The sequence of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence predicts a polypeptide of 207 amino acids (22.9 Kd) with a high leucine (19.8%) content, possessing a hydrophobic N-terminal end. The larger ORF has a coding capacity of 448 amino acids (49.4 Kd), corresponding to the N-protein molecular weight. The deduced protein possesses 43 serine residues (9.6% of the total amino acid content) which may be phosporylated and involved in N-protein/RNA binding. N-protein also has 5 regions with a high basic amino acid content. One of them is also serine-rich and has a strong homology site with MHV, TGE and IBV viruses. In the first part of the N-terminal, a 12-amino-acid sequence (PRWYFYYLGTGP) is highly conserved for BECV-F15, JHM, TGE and IBV viruses. BCV Mebus strain and BECV-F15 have only minor differences in their N-protein sequence.","Crucière, C.; Laporte, J.",Annales de l'Institut Pasteur / Virologie,208,24

Effective countermeasures require the rapid development of data and tools to monitor its spread and better understand immunogenic profile. However, limited information is available about the tools and target of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we excogitated a new approach for analyzing phylogenetic relationships by using the whole prototype proteome sequences. Phylogenetic analysis on the whole prototype proteome sequences showed that SARS-CoV-2 was a direct descendant of Bat-CoV and was closely related to Pangolin-CoV, Bat-SL-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The pairwise comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with Bat-CoV showed an unusual replacement of the motif consisting of seven amino acids (NNLDSKV) within the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The replaced motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was found in 12 other species, including a conserved surface protein of a malaria-causing pathogen, Plasmodium malariae. We further identified the T and B cell epitope sequence homology of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with conserved surface protein of P. malariae using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB). The shared immunodominant epitopes may provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection to those previously infected with P. malariae.","Hassan, Md.

In this study, a total of 3229 students in Chinese universities completed an online survey about their knowledge on transmission and personal protective behavior before and after COVID-19 vaccination. Of the respondents, 87.6% had been vaccinated. Most students believed that the large droplet (97.0%) and short-range airborne (89.3%) routes were the two most likely SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes, whereas only 24.1% considered long-range airborne transmission to be possible. Students who would be expected to possess better knowledge about virus transmission (e.g., students of medicine) reported better personal protective behaviors. Female students reported relatively better personal hygiene practices than male students, so did the confident students than their diffident peers. Students washed their hands on average of 5.76 times per day during the pandemic. Students at universities in southern regions washed their hands more frequently but paid less attention to indoor ventilation than did their northern counterparts. Interestingly, students who are fear of being infected had the bad personal hygiene. University students wore 22% less masks in public indoor environments after vaccination. Chinese university students weakened their personal protective behavior after vaccination and it may increase the potential risk of infection in the new waves of variant virus (e.g. delta).","Zhang, Nan; Liu, Xiyue; Jin, Tianyi; Zhao, Pengcheng; Miao, Doudou; Lei, Hao; Su, Boni; Xue, Peng; Xie, Jingchao; Li, Yuguo",Build Environ,208,6

At the end of January 2020, 2519 laboratory confirmed cases with a case-fatality rate of 34.3% have been reported. Approximately 84% of human cases have been reported in the tropical region of Saudi Arabia. The emergence of MERS-CoV has highlighted need for a rapid and accurate assay to triage patients with a suspected infection in a timely manner because of the lack of an approved vaccine or an effective treatment for MERS-CoV to prevent and control potential outbreaks. In this study, we present two rapid and visual nucleic acid assays that target the MERS-CoV UpE and N genes as a panel that combines reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification with a closed vertical flow visualization strip (RT-RPA-VF). This test panel was designed to improve the diagnostic accuracy through dual-target screening after referencing laboratory testing guidance for MERS-CoV. The limit of detection was 1.2×10(1) copies/μl viral RNA for the UpE assay and 1.2 copies/μl viral RNA for the N assay, with almost consistent with the sensitivity of the RT-qPCR assays. The two assays exhibited no cross-reactivity with multiple CoVs, including the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV), the bat coronavirus HKU4, and the human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, HKU1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the panel does not require sophisticated equipment and provides rapid detection within 30 min. This panel displays good sensitivity and specificity and may be useful to rapidly detect MERS-CoV early during an outbreak and for disease surveillance.","Huang, Pei; Jin, Hongli; Zhao, Yongkun; Li, Entao; Yan, Feihu; Chi, Hang; Wang, Qi; Han, Qiuxue; Mo, Ruo; Song, Yumeng; Bi, Jinhao; Jiao, Cuicui; Li, Wujian; He, Hongbin; Wang, Hongmei; Ma, Aimin; Feng, Na; Wang, Jianzhong; Wang, Tiecheng; Yang, Songtao; Gao, Yuwei; Xia, Xianzhu; Wang, Hualei",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,208,16

This association has been documented in various case reports/case series and institutional experiences, and the mortality associated with this fungal infection is emerging as a cause of concern. The aim of the present paper is to provide a scientific overview on the pathogenesis of mucormycosis in COVID-19 beyond the conventional understanding of the disease process, which may not otherwise explain the increased incidence of mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2. METHODOLOGY: This paper is structured as a narrative review of the published literature on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 which contributes to the development of mucormycosis. Apart from the acknowledged role of ketoacidosis, high blood sugar, and iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis, other factors involved in pathophysiology of COVID-19 which might alter or enhance the mucormycosis infection such as (1) the role of ferritin, (2) high serum iron, (3) free radical-induced endothelitis, (4) hepcidin activation, (5) upregulation of glucose receptor protein (GRP78) are discussed in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis. CONCLUSION: A new proposal for the pathogenesis based on the ferritin, viral mimicry of hepcidin and GRP78–CotH3 interaction, which clearly explains the surge in mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been explained.","Jose, Anson; Singh, Shagun; Roychoudhury, Ajoy; Kholakiya, Yathin; Arya, Saurabh; Roychoudhury, Sunanda",J Maxillofac Oral Surg,208,16

Objective Our study investigates the correlation between calcium levels at presentation as a primary endpoint, and pre-existing calcium levels as a secondary endpoint, to severity of disease presentation and progression. Method Observational cohort study in adults admitted with COVID-19 from March till September 2020. Multiple clinical scales, laboratory parameters, were used to correlate corrected calcium and vitamin D associations with risk factors and outcomes. Results Around 445 patients were included in the study. Hypocalcemic patients had more abnormal laboratory parameters and longer hospitalization duration. Hypocalcemia was in 60-75% of all age groups (p-value 0.053), for which 77.97% were ICU admissions (p-value 0.001) and 67.02% were diabetic (p-value 0.347). There were non-significant correlations between Vitamin D and almost all the parameters except for chronic respiratory diseases with P value of 0.024. Conclusion It can be concluded that hypocalcemia is a significant and reliable marker of disease severity and progression regardless of underlying comorbidities. Meanwhile, Vitamin D levels fail to reflect correlation with severity of COVID-19 infections.","Osman, Wessam; Al Fahdi, Fatma; Khamis, Faryal; Salmi, Issa Al; Khalili, Huda Al; Gokhale, Antara",Int J Infect Dis,208,20

Cryo-EM structures reveal altered RBD disposition; antigenicity and proteolysis experiments reveal structural changes and enhanced furin cleavage efficiency of the G614 variant. Furthermore, furin cleavage alters the up/down ratio of the Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) in the G614 S ectodomain, demonstrating an allosteric effect on RBD positioning triggered by changes in the SD2 region, that harbors residue 614 and the furin cleavage site.

Through a combined modelling approach, we estimate the rates of generation of cases along the zoonotic and human-to-human transmission routes and assess their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We consider all cases notified to WHO from March 2012 to mid-September 2014. We use a stochastic modelling of the time series of case incidence in the Middle East region to estimate time- and space-dependent zoonotic and human-to-human transmission parameters. The model also accounts for possible lack of identification of secondary transmissions among notified cases. This approach is combined with the analysis of imported cases out of the region to assess the rate of underreporting of cases. Out of a total of 32 possible models, based on different parameterisation and scenario considered, the best-fit model is characterised by a large heterogeneity in time and across space for both zoonotic and human-to-human transmission. The variation in time that occurred during Spring 2014 led to a 17-fold and 3-fold increase in the two transmissions, respectively, bringing the reproductive rate to values above 1 during that period for all regions under study. The model suggests that 75% of MERS-CoV cases are secondary cases (human-to-human transmission), which is substantially higher than the 34% of reported cases with an epidemiological link to another case. Overall, estimated reporting rate is 0.26. Our findings show a higher level of spatial heterogeneity in zoonotic transmission compared to human-to-human, highlighting the strong environmental component of the epidemic. Since sporadic introductions are predicted to be a small proportion of notified cases and are responsible for triggering secondary transmissions, a more comprehensive understanding of zoonotic source and path of transmission could be critical to limit the epidemic spread.","Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves",Epidemics,208,24

Despite greater opportunities to join medical education curriculum development, medical students' engagement in these activities remains limited. A recent national study on student leadership in curricular change revealed a formal lack of leadership and training in medical education as significant barriers. Medical students' unawareness of how to disseminate curricula as educational scholarship and its value to their careers also restricts the fullness of their formation as educators. METHODS: We designed a 3-hour, interactive, project-focused conference workshop for medical students without prior knowledge in curriculum development. Of participants, 64 worked in 10 groups creating medical curricula using Kern's six-step approach in student-facilitated breakout sessions. Completed group projects were presented, including brief action plans for transforming their work into scholarship. The workshop was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach. RESULTS: Of survey respondents, 44 mostly medical students, faculty, and administrators from different institutions rated the workshop as a very positive experience, and the pacing of the breakout groups as effective. A notable increase in self-reported mastery, as measured by learning objectives aligned with Kern's six-step model, was recorded from student respondents as compared to faculty. A sense of readiness to participate in curricular decisions either at the home institution or in individual career paths was evident from narrative comments.

GDM is associated with short-term and long-term consequences for both mother and child. Therefore, it is crucial we efficiently identify all cases and initiate early treatment, reducing fetal exposure to hyperglycemia and reducing GDM-related adverse pregnancy outcomes. For this reason, GDM screening is recommended as part of routine pregnancy care. The current screening method, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), is a lengthy, cumbersome and inconvenient test with poor reproducibility. Newer biomarkers that do not necessitate a fasting sample are needed for the prompt diagnosis of GDM. The aim of this scoping review is to highlight and describe emerging protein biomarkers that fulfill these requirements for the diagnosis of GDM. Materials and Methods: This scoping review was conducted according to preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for scoping reviews using Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, Embase and Web of Science with a double screening and extraction process. The search included all articles published in the literature to July 2020. Results: Of the 3519 original database citations identified, 385 were eligible for full-text review. Of these, 332 (86.2%) were included in the scoping review providing a total of 589 biomarkers studied in relation to GDM diagnosis. Given the high number of biomarkers identified, three post hoc criteria were introduced to reduce the items set for discussion: we chose only protein biomarkers with at least five citations in the articles identified by our search and published in the years 2017–2020. When applied, these criteria identified a total of 15 biomarkers, which went forward for review and discussion. Conclusions: This review details protein biomarkers that have been studied to find a suitable test for GDM diagnosis with the potential to replace the OGTT used in current GDM screening protocols. Ongoing research efforts will continue to identify more accurate and practical biomarkers to take GDM screening and diagnosis into the 21st century.","Bogdanet, Delia; Reddin, Catriona; Murphy, Dearbhla; Doheny, Helen C.; Halperin, Jose A.; Dunne, Fidelma; O’Shea, Paula M.",J Clin Med,208,1

METHODS: From January 19 to February 6, 2020, 88 confirmed COVID-19 patients presenting with pneumonia and 80 non-COVID-19 patients suffering from pneumonia of other origins were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory results were collected. CT features and scores were evaluated at the segmental level according to the lesions’ position, attenuation, and form. Scores were calculated based on the size of the pneumonia lesion, which graded at the range of 1 to 4. Air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, crazy-paving pattern, subpleural curvilinear line, bronchiectasis, air space, pleural effusion, and mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy were also evaluated. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that history of exposure (β = 3.095, odds ratio (OR) = 22.088), leukocyte count (β = − 1.495, OR = 0.224), number of segments with peripheral lesions (β = 1.604, OR = 1.604), and crazy-paving pattern (β = 2.836, OR = 2.836) were used for establishing the predictive model to identify COVID-19-positive patients (p < 0.05). In this model, values of area under curve (AUC) in the training and testing groups were 0.910 and 0.914, respectively (p < 0.001). A predicted score for COVID-19 (PSC-19) was calculated based on the predictive model by the following formula: PSC-19 = 2 × history of exposure (0–1 point) − 1 × leukocyte count (0–2 points) + 1 × peripheral lesions (0–1 point) + 2 × crazy-paving pattern (0–1 point), with an optimal cutoff point of 1 (sensitivity, 88.5%; specificity, 91.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Our predictive model and PSC-19 can be applied for identification of COVID-19-positive cases, assisting physicians and radiologists until receiving the results of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. KEY POINTS: • Prediction of RT-PCR positivity is crucial for fast diagnosis of patients suspected of having coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). • Typical CT manifestations are advantageous for diagnosing COVID-19 and differentiation of COVID-19 from other types of pneumonia. • A predictive model and scoring system combining both clinical and CT features were herein developed to enable high diagnostic efficiency for COVID-19.","Qin, Le; Yang, Yanzhao; Cao, Qiqi; Cheng, Zenghui; Wang, Xiaoyang; Sun, Qingfeng; Yan, Fuhua; Qu, Jieming; Yang, Wenjie",Eur Radiol,208,15

Although the numbers of infections are declining in some parts of the World, new infections are steadily rising in India. Nutrition and immune status are two critical aspects of fighting the virus successfully. Recently, the selenium status was reported to positively correlate with the survival of COVID patients as compared with non-survivors. We analysed the blood serum levels in apparently healthy (N=30) individuals and those with confirmed COVID -19 infection(N=30) in the southern part of India. Patients showed a significantly lower selenium level of 69.2 ±8.7 ng/ml than controls 79.1 ± 10.9 ng/ml, the difference was statistically significant (P=0.0003). Interestingly the controls showed a borderline level of selenium, suggesting that the level of this micronutrient is not optimum in the population studied. The results of this exploratory study pave the way for further research in a larger population and suggest that selenium supplementation may be helpful to reduce the impact of the virus.","Majeed, Muhammed; Nagabhushanam, Kalyanam; Gowda, Sujay; Mundkur, Lakshmi",Nutrition,208,33

In addition to dealing with the pandemic’s impact on mental health, parents need to cope with specific changes in their routines caused by social distance measures. This study aimed to investigate common mental disorders (CMD) symptoms in Brazilian parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors. A total of 232 Brazilian parents ranging from 20 to 48 years old (M = 33.85; SD = 4.83) with children aged 1–36 months (M = 17.00; SD = 9,87) participated in an online survey. Parents answered a sociodemographic questionnaire, Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4), and Parenting Sense of Competence Scale. Chi-square tests, correlations, and multiple linear regression were performed. Results showed that parents’ symptoms of CMD were negatively associated to perceived parental competence (β =− 0.130; p = 0.011) and family income (β =− 0.190; p = 0.024). Furthermore, perceived stress was the most related variable to parents’ symptoms of CMD (β = 0.618; p < 0.001), showing a positive association. The model explained 49.5% of the variation. Results suggest that lower family income may increase symptoms of CMD in Brazilian parents, which is a concern in a country of high social inequality. Parental sense of competence may be a relevant protective factor. Interventions targeting parental competence and stress reduction should be considered to address the mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Riter, Helena da Silveira; Almeida, Maíra Lopes; Vescovi, Gabriela; Marques, Fernanda Martins; Pedrotti, Bruna Gabriella; Mallmann, Manoela Yustas; Pieta, Maria Adélia Minghelli; Frizzo, Giana Bitencourt",Psychol Stud (Mysore),208,16

In the present study, we examined the provision of stroke care in Kobe City during the COVID-19 epidemic, where some major stroke centers ceased to provide emergency care. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. The Kobe Stroke Network surveyed the number of stroke patients admitted to all primary stroke centers (PSCs) in the city between March 1 and May 23, 2020, and between March 3 and May 25, 2019. In addition, online meetings between all PSC directors were held regularly to share information. The survey items included emergency response system characteristics, number of patients with stroke hospitalized within 7 days of onset, administered treatment types (IV rt-PA, mechanical thrombectomy, surgery, and endovascular therapy), and stroke patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: During the period of interest in 2020, the number of stroke patients hospitalized across 13 PSCs was 813, which was 15.5% lower than that during the same period of 2019 (p=0.285). The number of patients admitted with cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage decreased by 15.4% (p=0.245), 16.1% (p=0.659), and 14.0% (p=0.715), respectively. However, the rates of mechanical thrombectomy and surgery for intracerebral hemorrhage were slightly increased by 12.1% (p=0.754) and 5.0% (p=0.538), respectively. PSCs that ceased to provide emergency care reported a decrease in the number of stroke cases of 65.7% compared with the same period in 2019, while other PSCs reported an increase of 0.8%. No case of a patient with stroke and confirmed COVID-19 was reported during the study period. CONCLUSION: Kobe City was able to maintain operation of its stroke care systems thanks to close cooperation among all city PSCs and a temporal decrease in the total number of stroke cases.","Ohara, Nobuyuki; Imamura, Hirotoshi; Adachi, Hidemitsu; Hara, Yoshie; Hosoda, Kohkichi; Kimura, Hidehito; Kuwayama, Kazuyuki; Mizowaki, Takashi; Motooka, Yasuhiko; Nakashima, Kazuya; Shinoda, Narihide; Takamoto, Takeshi; Ueno, Yasushi; Yamaura, Ikuya; Yanagihara, Chie; Yoshida, Yasuhisa; Kawamoto, Michi; Sakai, Nobuyuki",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,208,26

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which can follow SARS-CoV-2 infection, disproportionately affects older persons and males as well as people living in temperate zone countries with a tropical ancestry. Recent evidence on the importance of adequately warming and humidifying (conditioning) inhaled air in the nasal cavity for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is discussed, with particular reference to: (i) the relevance of air-borne SARS-CoV-2 transmission, (ii) the nasal epithelium as the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 infection, (iii) the roles of type 1 and 3 interferons for preventing viral infection of URT epithelial cells, (iv) weaker innate immune responses to respiratory viral infections in URT epithelial cells at suboptimal temperature and humidity, and (v) early innate immune responses in the URT for limiting and eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The available data are consistent with optimal nasal air conditioning reducing SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of the URT and, as a consequence, severe COVID-19. Further studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection rates and viral loads in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in relation to inhaled air temperature, humidity, age, gender, and genetic background are needed in this context. Face masks used for reducing air-borne virus transmission can also promote better nasal air conditioning in cold weather. Masks can, thereby, minimise SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and are particularly relevant for protecting more vulnerable persons from severe COVID-19.","Ramasamy, Ranjan",Int J Mol Sci,208,16

Existing surveillance systems are not based on population samples and are generally not longitudinal in design. MethodsFrom 26 April to 19 September2020, 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals were collected from individuals aged 2 years and over from a representative sample of private households from England. Participants completed a questionnaire and nose and throat swab were taken. The percentage of individuals testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was estimated over time using dynamic multilevel regression and post-stratification, to account for potential residual non-representativeness. Potential changes in risk factors for testing positive over time were also evaluated using multilevel regression models. FindingsBetween 26 April and 19 September 2020, in total, results were available from 514,794 samples from 123,497 individuals, of which 489 were positive overall from 398 individuals. The percentage of people testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 changed substantially over time, with an initial decrease between end of April and June, followed by low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Having a patient-facing role and working outside your home were important risk factors for testing positive in the first period but not (yet) in the second period of increased positivity rates, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. A substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms (53%-70%, dependent on calendar time). InterpretationImportant risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSUnprecedented control measures, such as national lockdowns, have been widely implemented to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Decisions regarding the continued need for social distancing measures in the overall population, specific subgroups and geographic areas heavily rely on accurate and up-to-date information about the number of people and risk factors for testing positive. We searched PubMed and medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint servers up to 6 June 2020 for epidemiological studies using the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"" and ""prevalence"" or ""incidence"" without data or language restrictions. Most studies were small or had only information about current presence of the virus for a small subset of patients, or used data not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions, deaths or self-reported symptoms. Large population-based studies, such as the current study, are required to understand risk factors and the dynamics of the epidemic. Added value of this studyThis is the first longitudinal community survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection at national and regional levels in the UK. With more than 500,000 swabs from more than 120,000 individuals this study provides robust evidence that the percentage of individuals from the general community in England testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 clearly declined between end of April and June 2020,, followed by consistently low levels during the summer, before marked increases end of August and September 2020. Risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, with having a patient-facing role and working outside your home being important risk factors in the first period but not (yet) in the second period, and age (young adults) being an important driver of the second period of increased positivity rates. Positive tests commonly occurred without symptoms being reported. Implications of all the available evidenceThe observed decline in the percentage of individuals testing positive adds to the increasing body of empirical evidence and theoretical models that suggest that the lockdown imposed on 23 March 2020 in England was associated, at least temporarily, with a decrease in infections. Important risk factors for testing positive varied substantially between the initial and second periods of higher positivity rates, and a substantial proportion of infections were in individuals not reporting symptoms, indicating that continued monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in the community will be important for managing the epidemic moving forwards.","Pouwels, Koen B; House, Thomas; Pritchard, Emma; Robotham, Julie V; Birrell, Paul; Gelman, Andrew; Vihta, Karina-Doris; Bowers, Nikola; Boreham, Ian; Thomas, Heledd; Lewis, James; Bell, Iain; Bell, John I; Newton, John N; Farrar, Jeremy; Diamond, Ian; Benton, Pete; Walker, Ann Sarah",,208,9

Aim: To set up, optimize and evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of a new in-house microsphere immunoassay for measurement of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein for assessment of population seroprevalence in Finland. Methods: We set up a new in-house microsphere immunoassay (FMIA) with SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein and optimized its analytical performance. For evaluation of clinical performance, we tested sera collected in a well-characterized cohort of PCR positive-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n=89) with mostly mild symptoms, and before the COVID-19 pandemic (n=402), for nucleoprotein specific IgG concentrations by FMIA and a commercial chemiluminescent immunoassay and for neutralizing antibodies by the microneutralization test. Results: The analytical performance of FMIA was established in terms of sensitivity, linearity and precision. FMIA discriminated between COVID-19 patient and control samples with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (100%). We generated FMIA seropositivity cut-offs, 0.46 and 1.71 U/ml, for low- and high-seroprevalence settings, respectively. In addition, we obtained high level of agreement between FMIA results and results by the microneutralization test. Conclusion: The fluorescent microsphere immunoassay showed excellent analytical and clinical performance and is well suited for serosurveillance studies of SARS-CoV-2. However, to optimize analytical sensitivity and clinical specificity of the assay, different seropositivity thresholds depending on the intended use of the assay and the target population, may be needed.","EkstroÌm, N.; Virta, C.; Haveri, A.; Dub, T.; Hagberg, L.; Solastie, A.; OÌsterlund, P.; Vihervaara, T.; Erlund, I.; Nohynek, H.; Melin, M.",,208,17

We validate these gene targets using several orthogonal methods such as CRISPR knock-out, RNA interference knock-down, and small-molecule inhibitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes.

It is required for the safe reuse of contaminated medical, laboratory, and personal protective equipment, and for the safe handling of biological samples. Heat treatment is a common decontamination method, notably used for viruses. We show that for liquid specimens (here, solution of SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture medium), the virus inactivation rate under heat treatment at 70°C can vary by almost two orders of magnitude depending on the treatment procedure, from a half-life of 0.86 min (95% credible interval [CI] 0.09, 1.77) in closed vials in a heat block to 37.04 min (95% CI 12.64, 869.82) in uncovered plates in a dry oven. These findings suggest a critical role of evaporation in virus inactivation via dry heat. Placing samples in open or uncovered containers may dramatically reduce the speed and efficacy of heat treatment for virus inactivation. Given these findings, we reviewed the literature on temperature-dependent coronavirus stability and found that specimen container types, along with whether they are closed, covered, or uncovered, are rarely reported in the scientific literature. Heat-treatment procedures must be fully specified when reporting experimental studies to facilitate result interpretation and reproducibility, and must be carefully considered when developing decontamination guidelines. IMPORTANCE Heat is a powerful weapon against most infectious agents. It is widely used for decontamination of medical, laboratory, and personal protective equipment, and for biological samples. There are many methods of heat treatment, and methodological details can affect speed and efficacy of decontamination. We applied four different heat-treatment procedures to liquid specimens containing SARS-CoV-2. Our results show that the container used to store specimens during decontamination can substantially affect inactivation rate; for a given initial level of contamination, decontamination time can vary from a few minutes in closed vials to several hours in uncovered plates. Reviewing the literature, we found that container choices and heat treatment methods are only rarely reported explicitly in methods sections. Our study shows that careful consideration of heat-treatment procedure—in particular the choice of specimen container and whether it is covered—can make results more consistent across studies, improve decontamination practice, and provide insight into the mechanisms of virus inactivation.","Gamble, Amandine; Fischer, Robert J.; Morris, Dylan H.; Yinda, Claude Kwe; Munster, Vincent J.; Lloyd-Smith, James O.",Appl Environ Microbiol,208,1

They are natural hosts for viruses as they carry their own indigenous viruses. Both yeasts have been used for studies of plant, animal and human viruses. Many positive sense (+) RNA viruses and some DNA viruses replicate with various levels in yeasts, thus allowing study of those viral activities during viral life cycle. Yeasts are single cell eukaryotic organisms. Hence, many of the fundamental cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation or programed cell death are highly conserved from yeasts to higher eukaryotes. Therefore, they are particularly suited to study the impact of those viral activities on related cellular activities during virus-host interactions. Yeasts present many unique advantages in virus research over high eukaryotes. Yeast cells are easy to maintain in the laboratory with relative short doubling time. They are non-biohazardous, genetically amendable with small genomes that permit genome-wide analysis of virologic and cellular functions. In this review, similarities and differences of these two yeasts are described. Studies of virologic activities such as viral translation, viral replication and genome-wide study of virus-cell interactions in yeasts are highlighted. Impacts of viral proteins on basic cellular functions such as cell cycle regulation and programed cell death are discussed. Potential applications of using yeasts as hosts to carry out functional analysis of small viral genome and to develop high throughput drug screening platform for the discovery of antiviral drugs are presented.","Zhao, Richard Yuqi",Microbial cell,208,16

The aim of our exploratory study was to assess the diagnostic delay of PE in COVID-19 patients, and to identify potential associations between patient- or physician-related variables and the delay. This is a single-center observational retrospective study that included 29 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to the San Matteo Hospital Foundation between February and May 2020, with a diagnosis of PE, and a control population of 23 non-COVID-19 patients admitted at our hospital during the same time lapse in 2019. We calculated the patient-related delay (i.e., the time between the onset of the symptoms and the first medical examination), and the physician-related delay (i.e., the time between the first medical examination and the diagnosis of PE). The overall diagnostic delay significantly correlated with the physician-related delay (p < 0.0001), with the tendency to a worse outcome in long physician-related diagnostic delay (p = 0.04). The delay was related to the presence of fever, respiratory symptoms and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase. It is important to rule out PE as soon as possible, in order to start the right therapy, to improve patient's outcome and to shorten the hospitalization.","Melazzini, Federica; Reduzzi, Margherita; Quaglini, Silvana; Fumoso, Federica; Lenti, Marco Vincenzo; Di Sabatino, Antonio",Front Med (Lausanne),208,24

We have characterized the specificity of a set of region-specific antisera raised against the 5′-portion of ORF 1a by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-synthesized, C-terminally truncated 1a polypeptides and used these antisera to detect virus-specific proteins in IBV-infected Vero cells. Two antisera, which had specificity for IBV sequences from nucleotides 710 to 2079 and 1355 to 2433, respectively, immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of approximately 87 kDa from IBV-infected Veto cells. In vitro translation of ORF 1a sequence terminating at nucleotide 5763 did not produce this protein unless the in vitro translation products were incubated with Vero cell S10 extracts prepared from either IBV-infected or mock-infected Vero cells. However, processing of the 87-kDa protein was also observed when the same region was expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system. This observation indicates that the 87-kDa polypeptide is encoded within the 5′-most 3000 nucleotides of mRNA 1 and that it might be cleaved from the 1a polyprotein by viral and cellular proteinases.","Liu, D.

There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for dementia. Impairment of nutrient sensing pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dementia, and may offer a novel treatment approach for dementia. AIMS This systematic review collates all available evidence for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutics that modify nutrient sensing in the context of preventing cognitive decline or improving cognition in ageing, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia populations. METHODS PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched using key search terms focusing on available therapeutics such as 'metformin', 'GLP1', 'insulin' and the dementias including 'Alzheimer's disease' and 'Parkinson's disease'. Articles were screened using Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool v 2.0 for human studies and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS Out of 2619 articles, 114 were included describing 31 different 'modulation of nutrient sensing pathway' therapeutics, 13 of which specifically were utilised in human interventional trials for normal ageing or dementia. Growth hormone secretagogues improved cognitive outcomes in human mild cognitive impairment, and potentially normal ageing populations. In animals, all investigated therapeutic classes exhibited some cognitive benefits in dementia models. While the risk of bias was relatively low in human studies, this risk in animal studies was largely unclear. CONCLUSIONS Modulation of nutrient sensing pathway therapeutics, particularly growth hormone secretagogues, have the potential to improve cognitive outcomes. Overall, there is a clear lack of translation from animal models to human populations.","Kioussis, Benjamin; Tuttle, Camilla S L; Heard, Daniel S; Kennedy, Brian K; Lautenschlager, Nicola T; Maier, Andrea B",Ageing research reviews,208,27

G4s have been extensively described in the human genome, especially in telomeres and oncogene promoters; in recent years the presence of G4s in viruses has attracted increasing interest. Indeed, G4s have been reported in several viruses, including those involved in recent epidemics, such as the Zika and Ebola viruses. Viral G4s are usually located in regulatory regions of the genome and implicated in the control of key viral processes; in some cases, they have been involved also in viral latency. In this context, G4 ligands have been developed and tested both as tools to study the complexity of G4-mediated mechanisms in the viral life cycle, and as therapeutic agents. In general, G4 ligands showed promising antiviral activity, with G4-mediated mechanisms of action both at the genome and transcript level. This review aims to provide an updated close-up of the literature on G4s in viruses. The current state of the art of G4 ligands in antiviral research is also reported, with particular focus on the structural and physicochemical requirements for optimal biological activity. The achievements and the to-dos in the field are discussed.","Ruggiero, Emanuela; Richter, Sara N",Nucleic Acids Res,208,26

During neurotropic coronavirus virus (JHMV) induced encephalomyelitis, MMP9 activity is restricted to neutrophils. Furthermore, myeloid cell depletion implicated MMP9 in facilitating leukocyte central nervous system (CNS) infiltration via loss of BBB integrity. The requirement of MMP9 in BBB disruption was thus assessed in JHMV infected MMP9 deficient (MMP9(−/−)) mice. Depletion of neutrophils reduced CNS accumulation of monocytes and T cells, albeit without affecting overall pathogenesis. By contrast, infected MMP9(−/−) mice revealed no differences in CNS leukocyte infiltration, composition or localization, consistent with BBB disruption similar to wild type (WT) mice. Unimpaired T cell mediated virus control supported an unexpectedly redundant role of MMP9 in promoting leukocyte access to the brain parenchyma. While MMP9 deficiency did not expand the overall limited pattern of MMP expression during JHMV infection, it coincided with MMP3 upregulation. MMP3 expression remained largely confined to astrocytes, similar to WT mice. These data demonstrate that neutrophil-derived MMP9 is not the sole mediator facilitating parenchymal leukocyte entry via BBB disruption during viral encephalomyelitis. Moreover, significantly enhanced MMP3 expression by astrocytes in infected MMP9(−/−) mice suggests an active role of resident cells in participating and potentially collaborating with infiltrating cells in regulating BBB permeability. Overall, these results highlight the complexity of targeting individual MMPs as a strategy to regulate inflammation.","Savarin, Carine; Stohlman, Stephen A.; Rietsch, Anna M.; Butchi, Niranjan; Ransohoff, Richard M.; Bergmann, Cornelia C.",Glia,208,15

These entities may appear after resolution of the respiratory syndrome. CASE REPORT: A previously healthy 64-year-old male patient came to the hospital reporting severe chest pain. He had a history of a COVID-19 pneumonia with PCR confirmation 4 weeks before. On admission to the Coronary Care Unit (CCU), the patient had a negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2; the following tests were performed: total T3 643.4 ng/dl (reference 35–193 ng/dl), total thyroxine 12.0 μg/dl (reference 4.8–11.7 μg/dl), free T4 1.85 ng/dl (reference 0.7–1.48 ng/dl), TSH 0.01 μIU/ml (reference 0.35–4.94 μIU/ml); total bilirubin 0.76 mg/dl (reference 0.0–1.5 mg/dl), alkaline phosphatase 185 U/L (reference 40–150 U/L), alanine aminotransferase 194.6 U/L (reference 6–66 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase 93.4 U/L (reference 9–55 U/L); on admission to the CCU high-sensitivity troponin I 548.3 pg/ml (reference 0.0–34.2 pg/ml), after 24 h in the CCU 801 pg/ml, and after 11 days (as an outpatient) 4.5 pg/ml. A thyroid gammagram revealed absent uptake of the radionuclide. Normal cardiac gammagraphy and cardiac enzymes ruled out myocardial ischemia and infarction. The following diagnoses were made: myocarditis, subacute thyroiditis, and reactive hepatitis due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been demonstrated to be a multisystemic inflammatory disorder. The serious illness that developed in our patient after relief of his pulmonary disease underlines this nature. We suggest close follow-up of patients even after apparent clinical resolution, and performing thyroid, myocardial, and liver tests if clinically indicated.","Martínez, Alejandra Osorio; González-Razo, Victoria Taís; Navarro-Sánchez, Valeria; Souto Meiriño, Carlos A.; Ahumada-Ayala, Miguel",Am J Case Rep,208,10

There is therefore a tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19's informational crisis and gauge public sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented. In this research article, we identify public sentiment associated with the pandemic using Coronavirus specific Tweets and R statistical software, along with its sentiment analysis packages. We demonstrate insights into the progress of fear-sentiment over time as COVID-19 approached peak levels in the United States, using descriptive textual analytics supported by necessary textual data visualizations. Furthermore, we provide a methodological overview of two essential machine learning (ML) classification methods, in the context of textual analytics, and compare their effectiveness in classifying Coronavirus Tweets of varying lengths. We observe a strong classification accuracy of 91% for short Tweets, with the Na""ive Bayes method. We also observe that the logistic regression classification method provides a reasonable accuracy of 74% with shorter Tweets, and both methods showed relatively weaker performance for longer Tweets. This research provides insights into Coronavirus fear sentiment progression, and outlines associated methods, implications, limitations and opportunities.","Samuel, J.; G. G. Md.

Mitigation policies during an outbreak or pandemic are guided by the analysis of data of ongoing or preceding epidemics.

For typical compartmental models such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) [Formula: see text] represents the severity of an epidemic. It is an estimate of the early-stage growth rate of an epidemic and is an important threshold parameter used to gain insights into the spread or decay of an outbreak. Models typically use incidence counts as indicators of cases within a single large population; however, epidemic data are the result of a hierarchical aggregation, where incidence counts from spatially separated monitoring sites (or sub-regions) are pooled and used to infer [Formula: see text]. Is this aggregation approach valid when the epidemic has different dynamics across the regions monitored? We characterize bias in the estimation of [Formula: see text] from a merged data set when the epidemics of the sub-regions, used in the merger, exhibit delays in onset.

As programs have begun to reopen, potential donor candidates often inquire about their risk of a COVID‐19 infection and its potential impact on kidney function after donation. To address their concerns, we surveyed 1740 former live kidney donors at four transplant centers located in New York and Michigan. Of these, 839 (48.2%) donors responded, their mean age was 46 ± 12.5 years, 543 (65%) were females, and 611 (73%) were white. Ninety‐two donors (11%) had symptoms suggestive of a COVID‐19 infection with fever (48%) and fatigue (43%) being the most common. Among those with symptoms, 42 donors underwent testing and 16 tested positive. Testing was more common among donors with private insurance, and a positive test result was more common among young black donors. Only one donor surveyed required hospitalization and none required dialysis. Fourteen donors have recovered completely and two partially. Our survey highlights that a COVID‐19 infection in former donors results in a mild disease with good recovery. These data will be useful for transplant programs to counsel living donors who are considering kidney donation during this pandemic.","Doshi, Mona D.; Tsapepas, Demetra; Prashar, Rohini; Mohan, Sumit; Edusei, Emmanuel; Aull, Meredith J.; Sherman, Eric; Dadhania, Darshana M.",Clin Transplant,208,28

The importance of H. somni diseases can be attributed to improved clinical and laboratory recognition, combined with the growth in intensive management practices for cattle. Although outbreaks of bovine histophilosis can occur year-round, in northern and southern hemispheres, it is most frequent in late fall and early winter. Weather, stress, dietary changes, and comingling of cattle are likely to be major triggers for outbreaks. The most frequent clinical expressions of histophilosis include undifferentiated fever, fibrinosuppurative pneumonia, encephalitis-leptomeningitis, necrotizing myocarditis, and diffuse pleuritis. Neurological disease occurs either as thrombotic meningoencephalitis (TME) or as suppurative meningitis with ventriculitis. Acute myocarditis is characteristically necrotizing and generally involves one or both papillary muscles in the left ventricular myocardium. Biofilm-like aggregates of bacteria occur in capillaries and veins in myocardium, in the central nervous system, and on endocardial surfaces. H. somni is a component of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex. In our experience, it is most commonly diagnosed in subacute-to-chronic polymicrobial pulmonary infections in combination with Mannheimia haemolytica, Trueperella pyogenes, Pasteurella multocida, or Mycoplasma bovis. Other, less common forms of H. somni disease present as polyarthritis/tenosynovitis, abortion with placentitis and fetal septicemia, epididymitis-orchitis, and ocular infections. It is likely that H. somni is under-recognized clinically and diagnostically. Most state and provincial laboratories in North America rely on bacterial isolation to confirm infection. The use of more sensitive detection methods on field cases of histophilosis will help resolve the pathogenesis of H. somni in natural outbreaks, and whether the disease is as common elsewhere as it is in Canada.","O’Toole, D.; Sondgeroth, K.

Our objective was to develop and validate a strategy to assess risk for adverse drug events (ADE) associated with COVID-19 repurposed drugs using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ), alone or in combination with azithromycin (AZ), and the combination lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r). These medications were virtually added, one at a time, to drug regimens of 12,383 participants of the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly. The MedWise Risk Score (MRS(TM)) was determined from 198,323 drug claims. Results demonstrated that the addition of each repurposed drug caused a rightward shift in the frequency distribution of MRS(TM) values (p < 0.05); the increase was due to an increase in the drug-induced Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) or CYP450 drug interaction burden risk scores. Increases in LQTS risk observed with HCQ + AZ and CQ + AZ were of the same magnitude as those estimated when terfenadine or terfenadine + AZ, used as positive controls for drug-induced LQTS, were added to drug regimens. The simulation-based strategy performed offers a way to assess risk of ADE for drugs to be used in people with underlying medical comorbidities and polypharmacy at risk of COVID-19 infection without exposing them to these drugs.","Al Rihani, Sweilem B.; Smith, Matt K.; Bikmetov, Ravil; Deodhar, Malavika; Dow, Pamela; Turgeon, Jacques; Michaud, Veronique",J Clin Med,208,1

Yet, not all people are being affected by this crisis equally. In the United States, this pandemic has exacerbated long-standing inequities and entrenched structural racism. At the onset of the crisis, few data were available detailing the demographic characteristics of individuals with COVID-19. However, as data emerged, it became apparent that communities of color were disproportionately affected. To illustrate these inequities, we analyzed publicly available race and ethnicity data on COVID-19 cases and deaths and were one of the first groups to compile these findings. We launched a social media campaign to highlight these racial and ethnic inequities and raise awareness among public and elected officials. Given the tremendous amount of missing data, we demanded transparency in state reporting of race and ethnicity data. Using both messaging and mapping tools, we publicized state and city efforts to address these inequities, focusing on the creation of task forces tackling the racial inequities of COVID-19. As racial and ethnic data on COVID-19 cases and mortality became more widely reported, statistics emerged about the downstream effects of these inequities.

RECENT FINDINGS Early reports suggested that COVID-19 is an 'atypical ARDS' with profound hypoxemia with normal respiratory system compliance (Crs). Contrarily, several more populated analyses showed that COVID-19 ARDS has pathophysiological features similar to non-COVID-19 ARDS, with reduced Crs, and high heterogeneity of respiratory mechanics, hypoxemia severity, and lung recruitability. There is no evidence supporting COVID-19-specific ventilatory settings, and the vast amount of available literature suggests that evidence-based, lung-protective ventilation (i.e. tidal volume ≤6 ml/kg, plateau pressure ≤30 cmH2O) should be enforced in all mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS. Mild and moderate COVID-19 can be managed outside of ICUs by noninvasive ventilation in dedicated respiratory units, and no evidence support an early vs. late intubation strategy. Despite widely employed, there is no evidence supporting the efficacy of rescue therapies, such as pronation, inhaled vasodilators, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. SUMMARY Given the lack of evidence-based specific ventilatory strategies and a large amount of literature showing pathophysiological features similar to non-COVID-19 ARDS, evidence-based lung-protective ventilatory strategies should be pursued in all patients with COVID-19 ARDS.","Grasselli, Giacomo; Cattaneo, Emanuele; Scaravilli, Vittorio",Current opinion in critical care,208,21

With Germany’s lockdown as one of the more severe governmentally imposed epidemic-control-decisions, we tested to what extent the frequency of outdoor cycling activities changed from March to June 2020. METHODS: User behaviour and frequency in 15 urban and 7 rural German public green spaces was quantified using cycling data from the fitness application Strava. Changes in cycling activities were analysed with four different generalised linear models, correcting for factors like weather conditions and temporal changes in the user base of the fitness application. RESULTS: We found a clear increase in outdoor cycling sport activities in urban public green spaces in response to epidemic-control decisions (e.g. increase by 81% in April relative to the expected value (95% CI [48%, 110%])). In contrast, biking in rural areas showed no significant change with epidemic-control-decisions in place. CONCLUSION: Fitness App data, e.g. from Strava, can be used to monitor visitor behaviour and frequency. The increase in outdoor cycling activities during epidemic control decisions likely reflects a shift of sport activities from indoor and team sports to outdoor and individual sports. This highlights the importance of accessible green space for maintaining physical fitness and health. Beyond this shift, it is likely that outdoor activities may be of particularly importance for stress relief in times of crisis such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Schweizer, Anne-Maria; Leiderer, Anna; Mitterwallner, Veronika; Walentowitz, Anna; Mathes, Gregor Hans; Steinbauer, Manuel Jonas",PLoS One,208,24

Prevalence of COVID-19 by sexes differs between countries. The trend in Spain shows an unequal pattern, initially more frequent in men, but women outnumbered them from March 31, after two weeks lockdown. Infections are more frequent in women than in men in close contact with probable/confirmed COVID-19 cases. Consistent with deaths in men, they are hospitalized more frequently than women: Significant gender differences in signs/symptoms can drive this pattern, already observed in other pathologies. In late April, excess mortality is the same in women (67%) than in men (66%). But, lack of exhaustive information on deaths from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients may contribute to lower notification of deaths in women.

The outbreak initially infected farm pigs and then moved to humans from pigs with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of about 40%. After 2001, regular outbreaks occurred with higher CFRs (~71%, 2001–5, ~93%, 2008–12). The spread arose from drinking virus-laden palm date sap and human-to-human transmission. Intrinsic disorder analysis revealed strong correlation between the percentage of disorder in the N protein and CFR (Regression: r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01, ANOVA: p < 0.01). Distinct disorder and, therefore, genetic differences can be found in all three group of strains. The fact that the transmission modes of the Malaysia strain are different from those of the Bangladesh strains suggests that the correlations may also be linked to the modes of viral transmission. Analysis of the NiV and related viruses suggests links between modes of transmission and disorder of not just the N protein but, also, of M shell protein. The links among shell disorder, transmission modes, and virulence suggest mechanisms by which viruses are attenuated as they passed through different cell hosts from different animal species.

This study aimed to assess ever and/or current infection prevalence in this population. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted during July 26-September 09, 2020 to assess both anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity through serological testing and current infection positivity through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Associations with antibody and PCR positivity were identified through regression analyses. RESULTS: Study included 2,641 participants, 69.3% of whom were <40 years of age. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 55.3% (95% CI: 53.3-57.3%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, educational attainment, occupation, and previous infection diagnosis. PCR positivity was 11.3% (95% CI: 9.9-12.8%) and was significantly associated with nationality, geographic location, occupation, contact with an infected person, and reporting two or more symptoms. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) was 60.6% (95% CI: 58.6-62.5%). The proportion of antibody-positive CMWs that had a prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was 9.3% (95% CI: 7.9-11.0%). Only seven infections were ever severe and one was ever critical—an infection severity rate of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0%).

One policy that public health officials put in place to help stop the spread of the virus were stay-at-home/shelter-in-place lockdown-style orders. While designed to protect people from the coronavirus, one potential and unintended consequence of such orders could be an increase in domestic violence – including abuse of partners, elders or children. Stay-at-home orders result in perpetrators and victims being confined in close quarters for long periods of time. In this study, we use data from Dallas, Texas to examine the extent to which a local order was associated with an increase in domestic violence. Our results provide some evidence for a short-term spike in the 2 weeks after the lockdown was instituted but a decrease thereafter. We note that it is difficult to determine just how much the lockdown was the cause of this increase as the domestic violence trend was increasing prior to the order.","Piquero, Alex R.; Riddell, Jordan R.; Bishopp, Stephen A.; Narvey, Chelsey; Reid, Joan A.; Piquero, Nicole Leeper",Am J Crim Justice,208,16

It is the latter that is most intimately associated in the minds of most modern consumers. Despite this, there is little flavor commonality on which pairing could be based. The first section of the chapter examines this feature, and wine’s primary role as a palate cleanser and food condiment. The synergistic role of food and wine in suppressing each other’s least pleasant attributes is also explained. The final section deals with the latest evidence relating to the many beneficial health effects of moderate wine consumption, shortfalls in the data, headache induction, dental erosion, and conditions under which wine intake is contraindicated.","Jackson, Ronald S.",Wine Science,208,1

On presentation, her physical examination was benign, except for sinus tachycardia, and she was oxygenating adequately on room air. Laboratory studies were unremarkable, except a PCR test positive for SARS-COV2, and a CT scan of her chest showed bilateral multi-focal ground-glass opacities. A fetal non-stress test was reassuring. She was treated with intravenous fluids, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and hydroxychloroquine. During her hospital stay, she developed progressively worsening respiratory failure, initially requiring non-invasive ventilation, and subsequently progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation. She then suffered from sudden hypoxemia and hemodynamic collapse, on maximal ventilatory support, prompting an emergency cesarean section at bedside. This led to rapid stabilization of hemodynamic parameters, and of her overall respiratory status. Both the twins were born prematurely, and one of them tested positive for SARS-COV2.","Mehta, Harsh; Ivanovic, Sasa; Cronin, Amanda; VanBrunt, Lindsey; Mistry, Nirav; Miller, Richard; Yodice, Paul; Rezai, Fariborz",Case Rep Womens Health,208,16

There are a great number of studies in the extant literature on RLMHW, with many and diverse research topics; however, a concise and complete overview of the research works already conducted in this particular area is conspicuous by its absence. This paper strives to fill the gap through the conduct of rigorous systematic literature review of RLMHW in the past three decades, and then establish a framework of studies on RLMHW. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (1) to identify the trend of journals publishing research papers on RLMHW; (2) to extract the main topics in studies on RLMHW; (3) to locate the most popular research areas of RLMHW; (4) to summarize the methods adopted in studies on RLMHW; (5) to identify research deficiencies in certain categories of RLMHW; and (6) to establish the future research directions of RLMHW. The main implications of the study are to offer a better understanding of RLMHW by systematic crystallization of archival data in a systematic chronological order across central issues. This study contributes to scholarly debate in this field by serving as a snapshot paper to document the development of the field and gives input to policymakers in process design and policy making in the domain of RLMHW.","Xin, Chunlin; Wang, Jie; Wang, Ziping; Wu, Chia-Huei; Nawaz, Muhammad; Tsai, Sang-Bing",Environ Dev Sustain,208,10

Various research revealed that COVID-19 main protease (M(pro)) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are responsible for viral replication and entry into the human body, respectively. Blocking the activity of these enzymes gives a potential therapeutic target for the COVID-19. The objective of the study was to explore phytochemicals from Ageratina adenophora against SARS-CoV-2 through in-silico studies. In this study, 34 phytochemicals of A. adenophora were docked with M(pro) and ACE2 through AutoDock Tools-1.5.6 and their binding affinity was studied. Phytochemicals with higher affinity have been chosen for further molecular dynamics simulations to determine the stability with target protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were studied on GROMACS 5.1.4 version. Furthermore, 5-β-glucosyl-7-demethoxy-encecalin (5GDE) and 2-oxocadinan-3,6(11)-dien-12,7-olide (BODO) were found to be potential blockers with excellent binding affinity with M(pro) and ACE2 than their native inhibitors remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine respectively. The drug likeness study and pharmacokinetics of the phytoconstituents present in A. adenophora provide an excellent support for the lead drug discovery against COVID-19.","Neupane, Netra Prasad; Karn, Abhishek Kumar; Mukeri, Imdad Husen; Pathak, Prateek; Sharma, Praveen Kumar; Singh, Samayaditya; Qureshi, Insaf Ahmed; Jha, Tarun; Verma, Amita",Biocatal Agric Biotechnol,208,26

For this purpose, an oomycete water mould (strain SC) isolated from Prussian carp [Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782)] eggs suffering from saprolegniosis was characterised morphologically as well as from ITS rDNA sequence data. Initially identified as a Saprolegnia sp. based on its morphological features, the constructed phylogenetic tree using the neighbour joining method further indicated that the SC strain was closely related to Saprolegnia australis R. F. Elliott 1968 strain VI05733 (GenBank accession no. HE798564), and which could form biofilm communities as virulence factors. In addition, aqueous extracts from forty Chinese herbs were screened as possible anti‐Saprolegnia agents. Among them, a 1 g ml(−1) extract from Radix sanguisorbae was the most efficacious anti‐Saprolegnia agent, indicated by the minimum inhibitory concentration that was as low as 256 mg L(−1). Relative survival of 73 and 88% was obtained against the SC strain in fish eggs at concentrations of 256 and 1280 mg L(−1), respectively. This is the first known report of Saprolegnia australis R. F. Elliott 1968 infection in C. gibelio (Bloch, 1782) eggs involving the screening of R. sanguisorbae extracts as potential anti‐Saprolegnia agents.","Cao, H.; Ou, R.; Li, G.; Yang, X.; Zheng, W.; Lu, L.",J Appl Ichthyol,208,0

METHODS: The lack of labor activity, social constraints, and a strong sense of helplessness, combined with a complex economic scenario with recession, inflation, and devaluation, led to the emergence of a dense climate of discontent. RESULTS: After a second wave hit the country, several measures were reinstalled. The Argentine society, polarized in many aspects, was further divided between those who supported the re-establishment of strict measures to help prevent further infections and those who desperately claimed for the urgent need to return to work to sustain their livings. CONCLUSIONS: The preexisting problems to which developing countries are usually exposed have been sharpened over the last year, determining a very complex scenario where every decision is important for the country’s future. An updated report of the current situation and its management in different countries is of vital importance regarding global health issues and may serve for feedback and decision-making.","Cereghini, Julian; Gemelli, Nicolás",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,208,16

The UK has been one of the most affected countries in Europe. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions and experiences of healthcare workers (HCWs) in relation to COVID-19 and care delivery models implemented to deal with the pandemic in the UK. METHODS: The study was designed as a rapid appraisal combining: (1) a review of UK healthcare policies (n=35 policies), (2) mass media and social media analysis of front-line staff experiences and perceptions (n=101 newspaper articles, n=1 46 000 posts) and (3) in-depth (telephone) interviews with front-line staff (n=30 interviews). The findings from all streams were analysed using framework analysis. RESULTS: Limited personal protective equipment (PPE) and lack of routine testing created anxiety and distress and had a tangible impact on the workforce. When PPE was available, incorrect size and overheating complicated routine work. Lack of training for redeployed staff and the failure to consider the skills of redeployed staff for new areas were identified as problems. Positive aspects of daily work reported by HCWs included solidarity between colleagues, the establishment of well-being support structures and feeling valued by society. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the experiences and concerns of front-line staff during a pandemic. Staff working in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic advocated clear and consistent guidelines, streamlined testing of HCWs, administration of PPE and acknowledgement of the effects of PPE on routine practice.","Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia; Andrews, Lily; Dowrick, Anna; Djellouli, Nehla; Fillmore, Harrison; Bautista Gonzalez, Elysse; Javadi, Dena; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Manby, Louisa; Mitchinson, Lucy; Mulcahy Symmons, Sophie; Martin, Sam; Regenold, Nina; Robinson, Hannah; Sumray, Kirsi; Singleton, Georgina; Syversen, Aron; Vanderslott, Samantha; Johnson, Ginger",BMJ Open,208,26

Because recombinant CoVs with reporter proteins fused with viral proteins are usually non-viable or unstable, a small and quantifiable epitope tag would be beneficial to CoV research. In this study, we integrated the NanoLuc Binary Technology to the reverse genetics of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototypic gammacoronavirus. The 11-amino-acid HiBiT tag was inserted to the spike (S) or membrane (M) protein, and the recombinant IBVs (rS-HiBiT and rM-HiBiT) were characterized. Compared with the rIBV-p65 control, rS-HiBiT exhibited comparable growth kinetics, whereas rM-HiBiT replicated slightly slower. The levels of HiBiT-tagged S and M proteins in the infected cells or the culture supernatant could be both rapidly (~15 min) and efficiently (30 μL sample volume) determined using the HiBiT luminescence assay. Notably, replication of the HiBiT-tagged IBV could be monitored continuously in an infected chicken embryo, and rS-HiBiT was genetically stable for at least 20 passages. By integrating the HiBiT tagging system with CoV reverse genetics, this new reporter system may facilitate future study of CoV replication and pathogenesis.","Liang, Xiao Ying; Zhu, Qing Chun; Liang, Jia Qi; Liu, Si Ying; Liu, Ding Xiang; Fung, To Sing",Front Microbiol,208,24

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Candidates planning to apply to the otolaryngology 2020-21 match were invited to complete a cross-sectional online survey. Distribution was via otomatch.com and word of mouth. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Of 85 eligible responses (estimated 18.9% of all applicants), many have had at least one board examination (71.8%) disrupted. A majority (85.9%) believe evaluation of candidates will change due to the pandemic, and 54.1% report they were now less confident in matching. Female applicants (37.6% of respondents) were found to have significantly higher odds of decreased confidence in matching (OR 2.781 [95% CI 1.045-7.4044]; P = .041). Many report a move to virtual interviews would increase the number of applications submitted (45.9%) and the number of interviews attended (77.6%). Some applicants (36.5%) did not believe residency programs would gather sufficient information about their candidacy to make an informed decision, and most (62.4%) did not believe that they would gather sufficient information to inform their own rank list. CONCLUSIONS: We find that candidates believe their candidacy will be assessed differently in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, are largely less confident in successfully matching, and are planning to apply and interview more broadly. These data are relevant to otolaryngology residency leadership to inform clear dialogue and a smooth transition into an unprecedented application cycle.","Izreig, Said; Torabi, Sina J.; Kasle, David A.; Rahmati, Rahmatullah W.; Manes, R.

It is accompanied by psychological problems and the fear of infection or of a severe course of the disease. This paper examines the relationship between fear of infection and adherence to rules of hygiene as well as the utilization of medical services. Methods 1005 patients (20–79 years, 626=62.4% female) were interviewed by online questionnaire before starting a psychosomatic rehabilitation program. Data are presented descriptively and analysed by variance analyses. Results 68.6% were rarely/sometimes afraid and 17.9% were always afraid of contracting coronavirus or of a severe course of the disease. Those who were afraid intended to wash their hands more frequently (97.2%) than those who were not afraid. Regardless of any change in their physical and mental health status, participants felt it to be risky to seek medical care. Conclusion The intention to follow hygiene rules in people with pre-existing mental illness depends on a fear of infecting oneself or others with the coronavirus or of contracting a severe form of the disease. Especially mentally or psychosomatically affected individuals need to be informed adequately about the coronavirus and the necessary individual protective measures in order to reduce resistance and to increase willingness to seek medical help.","Dahmen, Alina; Keller, Franziska; Kötting, Lukas; Derksen, Christina; Lippke, Sonia",Gesundheitswesen,208,7
