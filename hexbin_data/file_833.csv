68352,A roadmap towards predicting species interaction networks (across space and time).,2021-11-08,"OBJECTIVE Current evidence supports centralization of patients with refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to institutions with a high level of expertise and with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) capabilities. The aim of this study was to analyze and report the data of transferred refractory ARDS patients managed with venovenous (VV) ECMO at a national referral center over the last 11 years. DESIGN Observational study. SETTING Referral center in Italy. PARTICIPANTS The study comprised 100 patients treated from May 2009-November 2020. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The mean age was 54 ± 14 years, and 65% of patients were male. Patients were treated throughout the year, with seasonal peaks in the winter months. The majority of patients were referred from hospitals within the Lombardia region (81%), mainly from the city of Milan and surrounding area (36% of the total). The most common etiology of refractory ARDS was H1N1 influenza A (42 patients [42%]), followed by bacterial pneumonia (35 patients [35%]), and severe acute respiratory syndrome due to Sars-CoV-2 infection (five patients [5%]). All patients were severely hypoxic at the time of VV ECMO treatment. No transport-related complication was recorded. The most common configuration used in the authors' clinical practice was a bicaval dual-lumen configuration (61 patients [61%]), followed by a femoro-jugular configuration (38 patients [38%]). The intensive care unit survival rate was 55%. CONCLUSIONS Referral to a specialized center for VV ECMO treatment should be considered expeditiously in case of refractory ARDS, which often is lethal. Transport of patients with an unstable condition, although challenging, is feasible, and centralization of patient care is associated with good outcomes.","Pieri, Marina; Vettorello, Francesco; Calabrò, Maria Grazia; Zangrillo, Alberto; Scandroglio, Anna Mara",Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jvca.2021.04.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088553/,833

78150,"The contribution of vaccination to global health: past, present and future.",2014,"BACKGROUND The principality of Liechtenstein had its first COVID-19 case at the beginning of March 2020. After exponential growth, the pandemic’s first wave was contained, with the last case being diagnosed 52 days after the initial occurrence. AIM To characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Liechtenstein. METHODS All patients diagnosed in Liechtenstein were followed up until recovery and again 6–8 weeks after symptom onset. They were contacted every 2 days to record their clinical status until the resolution of their symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on clinical symptoms and molecular testing. Household and close workplace contacts were included in the follow-up, which also comprised antibody testing. In addition, public health measures installed during the pandemic in Liechtenstein are summarised. RESULTS During the first wave, 5% of the population obtained a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. A total of 95 patients (median age 39 years) were diagnosed with COVID-19 (82 who resided in Liechtenstein), resulting in an incidence in Liechtenstein of 0.211%. One patient, aged 94, died (mortality rate 1%). Only 62% of patients could retrospectively identify a potential source of infection. Testing the patients’ household and close workplace contacts (n = 170) with antibody tests revealed that 25% of those tested were additional COVID-19 cases, a quarter of whom were asymptomatic. Those households which adhered to strict isolation measures had a significantly lower rate of affected household members than those who didn’t follow such measures. The national public health measures never restricted free movement of residents. Masks were only mandatory in healthcare settings. The use of home working for the general workforce was promoted. Gatherings were prohibited. Schools, universities, certain public spaces (like sports facilities and playgrounds), childcare facilities, nonessential shops, restaurants and bars were closed. Social distancing, hygienic measures, solidarity and supporting individuals who were at risk were the main pillars of the public health campaigns. CONCLUSION The close collaboration of all relevant stakeholders allowed for the complete workup of all COVID-19 patients nationwide. A multitude of factors (e.g., young age of the patients, low-threshold access to testing, close monitoring of cases, high alertness and adherence to public health measures by the population) led to the early containment of the first wave of the pandemic, with a very low rate of serious outcomes. Antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 revealed a substantial proportion of undiagnosed COVID-19 cases among close contacts of the patients.","Thiel, Sarah Lucia; Weber, Myriam Carol; Risch, Lorenz; Wohlwend, Nadia; Lung, Thomas; Hillmann, Dorothea; Ritzler, Michael; Risch, Martin; Kohler, Philipp; Vernazza, Pietro; Kahlert, Christian R; Fleisch, Felix; Cusini, Alexia; Karajan, Tomas V; Copeland, Sandra; Paprotny, Matthias",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20361; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33105020/,833

82729,Imperfect synchrony in animal displays: why does it occur and what is the true role of leadership?,2021-10-11,"In this study, we present deep learning-based approaches to automatic segmentation and applicator reconstruction with high accuracy and efficiency in the planning computed tomography (CT) for cervical cancer brachytherapy (BT). A novel three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed and referred to as DSD-UNET. The dataset of 91 patients received CT-based BT of cervical cancer was used to train and test DSD-UNET model for auto-segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Automatic applicator reconstruction was achieved with DSD-UNET-based segmentation of applicator components followed by 3D skeletonization and polynomial curve fitting. Digitization of the channel paths for tandem and ovoid applicator in the planning CT was evaluated utilizing the data from 32 patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy. The segmentation performance of DSD-UNET was compared with that of 3D U-Net. Results showed that DSD-UNET method outperformed 3D U-Net on segmentations of all the structures. The mean DSC values of DSD-UNET method were 86.9%, 82.9%, and 82.1% for bladder, HR-CTV, and rectum, respectively. For the performance of automatic applicator reconstruction, outstanding segmentation accuracy was first achieved for the intrauterine and ovoid tubes (average DSC value of 92.1%, average HD value of 2.3 mm). Finally, HDs between the channel paths determined automatically and manually were 0.88 ± 0.12 mm, 0.95 ± 0.16 mm, and 0.96 ± 0.15 mm for the intrauterine, left ovoid, and right ovoid tubes, respectively. The proposed DSD-UNET method outperformed the 3D U-Net and could segment HR-CTV, bladder, and rectum with relatively good accuracy. Accurate digitization of the channel paths could be achieved with the DSD-UNET-based method. The proposed approaches could be useful to improve the efficiency and consistency of treatment planning for cervical cancer BT.","Zhang, Daguang; Yang, Zhiyong; Jiang, Shan; Zhou, Zeyang; Meng, Maobin; Wang, Wei",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.13024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991783/,833
90643,Evolutionary epidemiology: preparing for an age of genomic plenty.,2013,"BACKGROUND Early prognostication of long-term outcomes following ischemic stroke can facilitate medical decision-making. We hypothesized that the 24-hour National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) predicts 3-month clinical outcomes in anterior circulation stroke. METHODS Secondary analyses of the Interventional Management of Stroke 3 (IMS3) and intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) for acute ischemic stroke [National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) IV tPA] trials were performed. In participants with documented 24-hour NIHSS and 3-month Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), the predictive power of the 24-hour NIHSS and 24-hour NIHSS improvement for 3-month outcomes [mRS 0-2 and Barthel Index (BI) ≥95] was assessed. Percentages of good outcome (mRS 0-2 or BI ≥95) at 3, 6, and 12 months and mean quality of life (EQ5D™) index at 3 months across 24-hour NIHSS quartiles were compared. RESULTS The majority of the study participants were included (IMS3 n = 587/656, NINDS IV tPA n = 619/624). The 24-hour NIHSS was correlated with 3-month mRS (R = 0.73) with excellent predictive power for mRS 0-2 [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.91] and BI ≥95 (AUC = 0.9) in both cohorts. A model with the 24-hour NIHSS alone correctly classified 82-84% of patients in both cohorts. The percentages of good outcomes at 3-12 months across 24-hour NIHSS quartiles were similar in both cohorts. mRS 0-2 was achieved by 75.6-77.7% of patients with 24-hour NIHSS ≤11 but by only 1.4-3.6% with 24-hour NIHSS ≥20. The EQ5D index at 3 months varied among NIHSS 0-4 (mean 0.86 ± 0.16), 5-11 (0.77 ± 0.18), and 12-19 (0.59 ± 0.26) quartiles. CONCLUSIONS The 24-hour NIHSS strongly predicts long-term stroke outcomes and is associated with quality of life. Its easy availability, reliability, and validity support its use as an early prognostic marker and surrogate of clinical outcome in ischemic stroke.","Rangaraju, Srikant; Frankel, Michael; Jovin, Tudor G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000443801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27051408/,833
92901,Sex in a test tube: testing the benefits of in vitro recombination.,2016,"Background Sulodexide has pleiotropic properties within the vascular endothelium that can prove beneficial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. We aimed to evaluate the effect of sulodexide when used in the early clinical stages of COVID-19. Methods In an outpatient setting, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design. Including patients within three days of clinical onset, who were at a high risk of severe clinical progression due to chronic comorbidities. Participants were randomly assigned to receive an oral dose of sulodexide (500 LRU twice a day) or placebo for 21 days. Primary outcomes were need-length of hospitalization and need-length of oxygen support. Results Between June 5 and August 30, 2020, 243 patients were included in the per-protocol analysis. 124 of them received sulodexide, while 119 received placeboes. At 21 days follow-up, 17.7% patients required hospitalization in the sulodexide group compared to 29.4% in the placebo group, p=0.03. 29.8% required oxygen support in the sulodexide group vs 42% in the placebo group, p=0.05 and for fewer days [9 (7.2 SD) in the sulodexide group vs. 11.5 (9.6 SD) in the placebo group; p=0.02]. There was no between-group difference concerning the length of hospital stay. Interpretation Early intervention in COVID-19 patients with sulodexide reduced hospital admissions and oxygen support requirements. This has beneficial implications in the patient's well-being, making sulodexide a favorable medication until an effective vaccine or an antiviral becomes available.

106162,"The role of soils in the disposition, sequestration and decontamination of environmental contaminants.",2021-09-27,"RATIONALE Cerebral carbon dioxide embolism (CCDE) is a rare cause of stroke and is a recognized life-threatening complication.CCDE may result from direct intravascular CO2 insufflation during surgery. Due to the lack of typical clinical manifestations, the disease is often missed or mistaken for another condition. The clinical signs and symptoms depend on the speed and volume of embolized gas entering the blood and the patient's condition. In particular, patent foramen ovale has been found to be associated, in rare cases, with the intraoperative entry of gas into the arterial system. PATIENT CONCERNS In this report, we present the case of a 35-year-old woman with kidney cancer who underwent laparoscopic right partial nephrectomy. DIAGNOSIS After the laparoscopic surgery, the patient was initially diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction. INTERVENTIONS The patient was treated according to the standard method for treatment of acute cerebrovascular disease. OUTCOMES Three days after the laparoscopic procedure, the patient gained consciousness, and she was discharged without any neurologic sequelae on postoperative day 12. LESSONS SUBSECTIONS AS PER STYLE Due to the low incidence and sudden occurrence of CCDE, there is a strong likelihood of missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis, and it is; therefore, important to be aware of the risk. The findings from this report would be highly useful as a reference to clinicians in the future.","Li, Yuan; Zhang, Enlong; Yuan, Huishu",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000020986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629713/,833
106884,The role of soils in the regulation of air quality.,2021-09-27,"BACKGROUND Bacillus thuringiensis bacteria share similar genetic, physiological, and biochemical characteristics with other members of the Bacillus cereus group. Their diversity and entomopathogenic origin are related to their mobile genetic elements. However, the effects of wide-spread application of B. thuringiensis-based pesticides on genetically related B. cereus group populations present in the environment remain poorly understood. RESULTS We first identified pBMB76 from B. thuringiensis tenebrionis as a new conjugative plasmid. Mixed mating experiments suggested that pBMB76 may compete with pHT73, another known conjugative plasmid. Applications of single (tenebrionis 4AA1 and kurstaki HD73 carrying pBMB76 and pHT73, respectively) and mixed (4AA1 + HD73) B. thuringiensis strains were performed in confined plot habitats (soil and leaf) over two planting seasons. In total, 684 B. cereus group isolates were randomly selected from different treatment sets, and the transmissibility and occurrence rate of potential conjugative plasmids were surveyed. Results showed that the percentage of isolates with plasmid mobility was markedly enhanced in the B. thuringiensis-sprayed groups. Furthermore, we performed multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) for a subset of 291 isolates, which indicated that the dominant sequence types in the treated habitats were identical or related to the corresponding sprayed formulations. CONCLUSIONS The application of B. thuringiensis strains with conjugal and mobilizing capability drove gene transmissibility within the B. cereus group populations in confined habitats and potentially modified the population structure.","Hu, Xiaomin; Huang, Doudou; Ogalo, Joseph; Geng, Peiling; Yuan, Zhiming; Xiong, Hairong; Wan, Xiaofu; Sun, Jiahui",BMC microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-020-02047-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243143/,833
107523,Earth as construction material in the circular economy context: practitioner perspectives on barriers to overcome.,2021-09-27,"BACKGROUND Pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery leads to atelectasis and impairment of oxygenation. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is supposed to counteract atelectasis. We hypothesized that the derecruiting effects of pneumoperitoneum would deteriorate the intratidal compliance profile in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS In 30 adult patients scheduled for surgery with pneumoperitoneum, respiratory variables were measured during mechanical ventilation. We calculated the dynamic compliance of the respiratory system (C RS) and the intratidal volume-dependent C RS curve using the gliding-SLICE method. The C RS curve was then classified in terms of indicating intratidal recruitment/derecruitment (increasing profile) and overdistension (decreasing profile). During the surgical interventions, the PEEP level was maintained nearly constant at 7 cm H2O. Data are expressed as mean [confidence interval]. RESULTS Baseline C RS was 60 [54-67] mL cm H2O-1. Application of pneumoperitoneum decreased C RS to 40 [37-43] mL cm H2O-1 which partially recovered to 54 [50-59] mL cm H2O-1 (P < 0.001) after removal but remained below the value measured before pneumoperitoneum (P < 0.001). Baseline compliance profiles indicated intratidal recruitment/derecruitment in 48 % patients. After induction of pneumoperitoneum, intratidal recruitment/derecruitment was indicated in 93 % patients (P < 0.01), and after removal intratidal recruitment/derecruitment was indicated in 59 % patients. Compliance profiles showing overdistension were not observed. CONCLUSIONS Analyses of the intratidal compliance profiles reveal that pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery causes intratidal recruitment/derecruitment which partly persists after its removal. The analysis of the intratidal volume-dependent C RS profiles could be used to guide intraoperative PEEP adjustments during elevated intraabdominal pressure.","Wirth, Steffen; Biesemann, Andreas; Spaeth, Johannes; Schumann, Stefan",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5029-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324326/,833

108319,"Hospital-based zoonotic disease surveillance in Bangladesh: design, field data and difficulties.",2019,"BACKGROUND Network pharmacology is widely used in mechanistic studies of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). The present study aimed to predict the target and signaling pathway of Baihe Decoction in the intervention of coronary heart disease (CHD) based on a network pharmacology approach and molecular docking. METHODS The active ingredients of Baihe Decoction were screened by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), and their potential target genes and proteins in CHD were predicted. The targets were screened out using Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man and the Genecards database. Venn soft was used to obtain the common targets of drugs and diseases. The compound-target-disease network of Baihe Decoction in CHD was constructed in Cytoscape, and the functional protein interaction network was obtained through the STRING database. ClusterProfiler and Pathview were used to perform Gene Ontology function analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the effective targets of Baihe Decoction in CHD. Finally, we used MOE software for molecular docking of the compounds to their targets. RESULTS Fifteen active components of Baihe Decoction in CHD were screened, which corresponded to 145 targets in CHD, including 30 targets with strong correlations. The key targets included Jun, Aktl, MAPK1, RELA, IL6, CXCL8, EGFR, MAPK14, ESR1, and FOS, which were found to play important roles in the treatment of CHD. The results of molecular docking further illustrated the roles that the compounds with quercetin and β-sitosterol play in the treatment of CHD through their interference with AKT1 and MAPK1 target proteins. CONCLUSIONS This study has preliminarily revealed the mechanism of Baihe Decoction in the treatment of CHD. The components of TCM may intervene in the processes of CHD occurrence and development by regulating cardiomyocytes and antioxidative stress, and by participating in inflammation and immune response. Moreover, in the clinical syndrome differentiation of TCM, Baihe Decoction can be used as the main drug to treat CHD and angina pectoris due to qi stagnation and blood stasis caused by emotional discomfort.","Jin, Yaxian; Yin, Xiaodan; Li, Zhenying; Xu, Jiangyan",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-21-543; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849106/,833

There is however a need for greater coordination, with limited resources and the shifting global nature of the pandemic resulting in a proliferation of research projects underpowered and unable to achieve their aims. Methods: The UK Collaborative on Development Research (UKCDR) and Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness (GloPID-R), two funder coordination groups have collaborated to develop a live database of funded research projects across the world relating to COVID-19. Drawing data continually from their members and further global funding bodies, as of 15 th October 2020 the database contains 5,084 projects, funded by 71 funders, taking place across 134 countries representing an investment of at least $1.7 billion. To our knowledge it is one of the most comprehensive databases, covering a wide breadth of research disciplines. The database is aligned to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Global Research Roadmap: 2019 Novel Coronavirus. It is being used by the WHO, governments and multi-lateral policy makers, research funders and researchers.

Numerous genetic and environmental risk factors have been suggested to contribute to the development of ASD. However, no one factor can adequately explain either the frequency of the disorder or the male bias in its prevalence. Gonadal, thyroid, and glucocorticoid hormones all contribute to normal development of the brain, hence perturbations in either their patterns of secretion or their actions may constitute risk factors for ASD. Environmental factors may contribute to ASD etiology by influencing the development of neuroendocrine and neuroimmune systems during early life. Emerging evidence suggests that the placenta may be particularly important as a mediator of the actions of environmental and endocrine risk factors on the developing brain, with the male being particularly sensitive to these effects. Understanding how various risk factors integrate to influence neural development may facilitate a clearer understanding of the etiology of ASD.","Wilson, Hayley A; Creighton, Carolyn; Scharfman, Helen; Choleris, Elena; MacLusky, Neil J","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",https://doi.org/10.1177/1073858420952046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912048/,833

To introduce the representative troublesome cases related to the manipulation of donor (DAs) and recipient (RAs) arteries during low-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass. METHODS For the past 5 years, a total of 507 low-flow bypass surgeries were performed in patients with cerebral aneurysms, moyamoya diseases and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis diseases. Perioperative frustrating situations were retrospectively reviewed and 6 representative cases were finally described. RESULTS The first case was about the repeat microanastomosis due to the occlusion of the anastomotic segment by thrombus formation. The second case was about the repair of the DA injured by the thermal energy. The third case was about the direct repair of the DA damaged by a sharp knife. The fourth case was about the repeat microanastomosis due to the avulsion of the anastomotic segment. The fifth case was about lengthening the short DA with a nearby interposition graft. The sixth case was about the use of retrograde flow via the distal segment of DA due to the injury of the proximal segment of DA. In all patients, rescue procedures were successful and bypass flow was patent with no relevant complications. CONCLUSION Intraoperative accidents were frustrating, however, they were safely rescued without significant sequelae.

In this regard, the flammability of trees is a topic of great interest for ecology, management, and the development of sustainable restoration and rehabilitation plans. Tree species differ in regard to flammability, and many plant functional traits contribute to flammability at species, community and vegetation level. The relationship between plant traits and flammability at species level is important for a broader understanding of the vegetation-fire dynamic at the local and landscape scales. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the impact of individual plant traits of tree species on flammability components. By keywords-based searching of academic databases, 85 research papers were collected and analyzed. The literature synthesis shows: i) main issues addressed in studies on plant trait-based tree flammability, ii) general research output and biogeographic regions studied, iii) inventory of tree taxa investigated, iv) relationships between plant traits and flammability components, v) the most relevant plant traits that determine the flammability-related differences between species.","Popović, Zorica; Bojović, Srdjan; Marković, Milena; Cerdà, Artemi",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399329/,833

Laparoscopic hysterectomy has advanced significantly since 1988, when it was first introduced. Continued improvements in instrumentation, energy sources, hemostatic agents, and vaginal cuff closure techniques have expanded the use of minimally invasive hysterectomy. Variations of laparoscopy, specifically laparoendoscopic single-site surgery hysterectomy and robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, have further expanded the role of minimally invasive hysterectomy with the goal of decreasing morbidity. As with any evolving technology, well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness before wide-spread adoption.","Ridgeway, Beri; Falcone, Tommaso",Clinical obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/grf.0000000000000001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24145361/,833
158696,Direct punishment and indirect reputation-based tactics to intervene against offences.,2021-11-22,"PURPOSE Telehealth has been an integral response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no studies to date have examined the utility and safety of telehealth for oncology patients undergoing systemic treatments. Concerns of the adequacy of virtual patient assessments for oncology patients include the risk and high acuity of illness and complications while on treatment. METHODS We assessed metrics related to clinical efficiency and treatment safety after propensity matching of newly referred patients starting systemic therapy where care was in large part replaced by telehealth between March and May 2020, and 206 newly referred patients from a similar time period in 2019 where all encounters were in-person visits. RESULTS Patient-initiated telephone encounters that capture care or effort outside of visits, time to staging imaging, and time to therapy initiation were not significantly different between cohorts. Similarly, 3 month all-cause or cancer-specific emergency department presentations and hospitalizations, and treatment delays were not significantly different between cohorts. There were substantial savings in travel time with virtual care, with an average of 211.4 minutes saved per patient over a 3-month interval. CONCLUSION Our results indicate that replacement of in-person care with virtual care in oncology does not lead to worse efficiency or outcomes. Given the increased barriers to patients seeking oncology care during the pandemic, our study indicates that telehealth efforts may be safely intensified. These findings also have implications for the continual use of virtual care in oncology beyond the pandemic.","Hsiehchen, David; Muquith, Maishara; Haque, Waqas; Espinoza, Magdalena; Yopp, Adam; Beg, Muhammad S",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.21.00092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152833/,833

We study whether air quality affects the occurrence of severe influenza cases that require inpatient hospitalization. Using longitudinal information on local air quality and hospital admissions across the United States, we find that poor air quality increases the incidence of significant influenza hospital admissions. Effects diminish in years with greater influenza vaccine effectiveness. Apart from increasing vaccination rates, improving air quality may help reduce the spread and severity of influenza.","Singer, Gregor; Graff Zivin, Joshua; Neidell, Matthew; Sanders, Nicholas",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057216,833
183897,Laboratory diagnosis of SARS.,2004,"This paper presents preliminary work on the topic of emotion analysis on Twitter, in the context of the coronavirus pandemic in Portugal. We collected, curated and analyzed covid-related tweets of users in Portugal in order to understand the evolution of the six basic emotions reflected in these tweets. We analyzed tweets written in both English and Portuguese. In this first step of our work we correlate this information with key events of the evolution of the pandemic in Portugal during March, which was the most critical period in Portugal. We do so in an attempt to estimate the online manifestation of the psychological toll that this pandemic has on the overall well-being status of the general population. Our findings show that the sentiment analysis of covid-related tweets is consistent with our hypothesis that negative emotions would intensify as the pandemic progressed. The preliminary results obtained stand as proof of concept that the analysis of real-time tweets or other social media messages through sentiment analysis can be an important tool for behavioural and well-being tracking.","Trifan, A.; Matos, S.; Morgado, P.; Oliveira, J.

In the arms race between cyber attackers and defenders, cyber security professionals need as much information as they can gather. Cyber situational awareness (CSA) is a broad strategy that aims to improve decision making in cyber security by analysing security events. This study aims to improve CSA by comparing data mining techniques, specifically classification techniques, when applied to cyber security data. The predictors are trained by classification algorithms and the training data is collected from Open Source Intelligence including cyber-attacks in Europe over the period 2017–2019. Furthermore, the techniques have been applied to data from a more recent period, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. This has allowed the study to look at how COVID may have affected methods and targets of cyber attacks, and has shown a decrease in accuracy suggesting attack patterns have changed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Crowe, S.; Pournouri, S.; Ibbotson, G.",Advanced Sciences and Technologies for Security Applications,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-72120-6_9,833

185927,Management and prevention of SARS in China.,2004,"Background: Many countries imposed lockdowns in March 2020, in anticipation of the first wave of COVID-19 and the massive healthcare resources required to meet its acute medical needs. Sweden adopted a different strategy to contain the epidemic, opting for non-binding recommendations. Nonetheless, elective and acute surgical procedures in health care may have been affected. Objectives: To investigate the effect of the first-wave of COVID-19 and the government's response in Sweden on the rates of total joint replacements (TJR), arthroscopies, and fracture surgeries of the knee and hip. Methods: We used register data for the entire population of Skåne, the southernmost region in Sweden with 1.3 million inhabitants (13% of the total Swedish population). We identified all residents aged ≥18 years who between 1st January 2015 and 31st November 2020 underwent any of the following surgical procedures of the knee or hip: TJR (TJR due to fracture excluded), arthroscopy, and surgery due to fracture (including TJR). To demarcate pre-event and post-event periods, we established a differentiation point corresponding to mid-March 2020, the timepoint at which the the Swedish Public Health Agency began recommending social distancing, working from home, distance learning for secondary schools and universities,. At the aggregate level, we modelled the number of surgeries per 10,000 adults from January 2015 up to September 2020. We did an interrupted time-series (ITSA) analysis using segmented ordinary least-squares regression to estimate changes in the levels and trends of surgical procedures compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, adjusting for seasonal variations. The month of March was treated as a phase-in period to give time for the new recommendations to be implemented. In addition, we estimated the absolute and relative difference (with its 95% confidence interval [CI]) between the predicted and the counterfactual scenario in the monthly number of surgeries from April 2020, where the counterfactual is the rate of surgery that would have been expected if COVID-19 had not happened. To account for the possibility that other co-occurring events may be responsible for the observed changes, we assessed changes in the number of surgeries due to fractures, which are normally treated as emergencies that cannot be cancelled or rescheduled, and thus should be less affected, at least by policies at the hospital level. Results: We identified a total of 20,831 TJRs, 12,156 arthroscopies and 15,041 fracture surgeries of the knee or hip over the study period. The monthly rate of surgeries and ITSAs are presented in Figure 1, with the pre-COVID period starting from February 2019 for readability (Figure 1). The results suggest that in April 2020, there was a decrease of 2.08 (95%CI 1.81;2.35) TJRs per 10,000 adults which corresponds to a decrease of 74% (95%CI 65%;85%) when compared to the counterfactual scenario. This was followed by a positive trend signifying a monthly increase of 0.36 (95%CI 0.31;0.40) TJRs per 10,000 adults. The rate of arthroscopies followed a similar pattern with a decrease of 0.55 (95%CI 0.39;0.71) arthroscopies per 10,000 adults in April, which corresponds to a 49% decrease (95%CI 28%;63%) followed by a positive trend signifying a monthly increase of 0.11 (95%CI 0.07;0.15) arthroscopies per 10,000 adults. The rate of surgery due to knee or hip fractures showed no decrease in April and was followed by a negative trend signifying a monthly decrease of 0.03 (95%CI 0.002;0.04) surgeries per 10,000 adults. Conclusion: In Sweden, we observed a marked decrease in the number of typical elective knee and hip surgeries such as TJRs and arthroscopies, following the government's response to Covid-19. We then observed a slow but steady recovery that brought the rates of procedures towards expected levels by Fall 2020, before the second wave hit the country. The number of acute fracture surgeries showed no sharp drop, instead showing a steady and slow decline potentially due to reduction in commuting and in physical activities l nked to recommendations of social.","Dell'isola, A.; Kiadaliri, A.; Turkiewicz, A.; Hughes, V.; Magnusson, K.; Runhaar, J.; Bierma-Zeinstra, S.

In rhinovirus colds the symptoms are thought to be caused by the host response rather than viral damage of the nasal epithelium. Rhinovirus triggers an inflammatory cascade, evidenced by the presence of inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL-8) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., kinins) in nasal secretions, which results in symptomatic illness. In contrast to rhinovirus and coronavirus, which do not cause discernible epithelial damage, influenza virus and adenovirus do damage the nasal epithelium. Appropriate antiviral therapy will depend on the causative virus. Treatment of rhinovirus colds may require an antiviral agent (e.g., interferon alpha) in combination with antiinflammatory medication.","Winther, B; Gwaltney, J M; Mygind, N; Hendley, J O",American journal of rhinology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9513654/,833
