1085,1085,1085,Immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection,13.0060215,9.893807,2012-09-27,"Malaria is a reemerging disease in the countries where it was eradicated previously, whereas it is endemic in many countries including tropical countries. In India, malarial infection is on rise due to rapid urbanization and overcrowding in all major metropolitan cities. The incidence of morbidity and mortality due to malaria infection is increasing and could be attributed to drug resistance in strains of malarial parasite. Combining immune modulation strategies with anti-malarial drugs has a beneficial effect in an attempt to improve treatment for malaria. Along with clinical presentation and outcome of this parasitic infection, it is important to understand immunological disturbances associated with biological mechanisms underlying these actions in better understanding of pathogenesis of malarial infection. Immune and inflammatory responses in malarial infection are controlled and co-ordinated by various cytokines and chemokines. This review focuses on commonly seen immunological disturbances associated with malarial infection resulting in related humoral and cell mediated immune functions primarily with innate to subsequent adaptive immunity in tackling this parasitic infection.","Pradhan, Vandana; Ghosh, Kanjaksha",J Parasit Dis,240,1

Increased genetic sequencing of African A/H1N1 pandemic influenza viruses during 2009–2013 revealed multiyear persistence of 2 viral lineages within West Africa, raising questions about the roles of reduced air traffic and the asynchrony of seasonal influenza epidemics among West African countries in the evolution of independent lineages. The potential for novel influenza virus lineages to evolve within Africa warrants intensified influenza surveillance in Africa and other understudied areas.","Nelson, Martha I.; Njouom, Richard; Viboud, Cecile; Niang, Mbayame N.

The viral glycoprotein (GP) facilitates host cell entry and, jointly with cellular interaction partners, constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention. However, it is unknown whether the GPs of the currently and previously circulating EBOVs use the same mechanisms for cellular entry and are thus susceptible to inhibition by the same antivirals and cellular defenses. Here, we show that the GPs of the EBOVs circulating in 1976 and 2014 transduce the same spectrum of target cells, use the same cellular factors for host cell entry, and are comparably susceptible to blockade by antiviral interferon-induced transmembrane proteins and neutralizing antibody KZ52. Thus, the viruses responsible for the ongoing EVD epidemic should be fully susceptible to established antiviral strategies targeting GP and cellular entry factors.","Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Gnirß, Kerstin; Wrensch, Florian; Pöhlmann, Stefan",J Infect Dis,240,3

Since its first isolation, EV-D68 has been detected sporadically. However, the US and Canada have experienced outbreaks of EV-D68 infections between August and December 2014. This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 in Chongqing, Southwestern China. From January 2012 to November 2014, 1876 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens (NPAs) were collected from hospitalized children with RTIs. Among the 1876 NPAs, EV-D68 was detected in 19 samples (1.0%, 19/1876). Of these, 13 samples were detected in September and October 2014 (9.8%, 13/132). Phylogenetic analysis showed that all 13 strains detected in the 2014 Chongqing had high homology with the main strains of the 2014 US outbreak. Among the children with EV-D68 infection, 13 (68%) had a history of recurrent wheezing. A total of 13 children had a discharge diagnosis of asthma. Of these, 11 children were diagnosed with acute asthma exacerbation. EV-D68 was the predominant pathogen that evoked asthma exacerbation in September and October 2014. In conclusion, our results found that a history of recurrent wheezing may be a risk factor for the detection of EV-D68 and viral-induced asthma exacerbation may be a clinical feature of EV-D68 infection.","Xiao, Qiuyan; Ren, Luo; Zheng, Shouyan; Wang, Lili; Xie, Xiaohong; Deng, Yu; Zhao, Yao; Zhao, Xiaodong; Luo, Zhengxiu; Fu, Zhou; Huang, Ailong; Liu, Enmei",Sci Rep,240,1
2118,2118,2118,Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activator diminazene aceturate prevents lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by inhibiting MAPK and NF-κB pathways in human retinal pigment epithelium,13.167032,10.038628,2016-02-09,"BACKGROUND: Retinal inflammation is a devastating pathological process in ocular diseases. Functional impairment of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is associated with inflammatory retinal diseases. Enhancing the protective axis namely ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas by activation of ACE2 presents anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated whether diminazene aceturate (DIZE), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, prevented lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response by activating the protective axis and whether the effect was mediated by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. METHODS: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and real-time PCR were used to determine the optimum concentration and incubation time of DIZE. ARPE-19 cells and primary cultured human retinal pigment epithelia (hRPE) were incubated with or without 10 μg/mL DIZE for 6 h before stimulated with 5 μg/mL LPS for 24 h. The mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines, AT1R, and AT2R was analyzed. The protein level of inflammatory cytokines, Ang II, and Ang-(1-7) was detected. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and phosphorylated transcription inhibition factor-κB-α (p-IκB-α) were measured. Inhibitors of MAPKs and NF-κB were added to verify the involvement of these pathways. A small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to ACE2 and a selective Ang-(1-7) antagonist A779 was used to confirm the role of ACE2 and the involvement of ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis. RESULTS: DIZE remarkably increased the expression of ACE2 and inhibited the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in both RPE cell lines stimulated with LPS. Inhibitors of p38, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-κB significantly decreased LPS-induced overproduction of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. DIZE reduced the expression of Ang II and AT1R, whereas increased Ang-(1-7). Furthermore, DIZE downregulated the phosphorylation of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and the activation of NF-κB upon stimulation with LPS. Downregulating ACE2 and pre-treatment with A779 abrogated the effects of DIZE on production of cytokines, the expression of Ang II, Ang-(1-7), AT1R, phosphorylation of MAPKs and activation of NF-κB. CONCLUSIONS: DIZE inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory response by activating ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis in human RPE cells. The protective effect is mediated by inhibiting the p38MAPK, ERK1/2, JNK, and NF-κB pathways.","Tao, Lifei; Qiu, Yiguo; Fu, Xinyu; Lin, Ru; Lei, Chunyan; Wang, Jiaming; Lei, Bo",J Neuroinflammation,240,11

However, there is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global human cases of H5N1 from 1997-2015. Moreover, few studies have examined in detail the changing epidemiology of human H5N1 cases in Egypt, especially given the most recent outbreaks since November 2014 which have the highest number of cases ever reported globally over a similar period. Data on individual cases were collated from different sources using a systematic approach to describe the global epidemiology of 907 human H5N1 cases between May 1997 and April 2015. The number of affected countries rose between 2003 and 2008, with expansion from East and Southeast Asia, then to West Asia and Africa. Most cases (67.2%) occurred from December to March, and the overall case fatality risk was 53.5% (483/903) which varied across geographical regions. Although the incidence in Egypt has increased dramatically since November 2014, compared to the cases beforehand there were no significant differences in the fatality risk , history of exposure to poultry, history of human case contact, and time from onset to hospitalization in the recent cases.","Lai, Shengjie; Qin, Ying; Cowling, Benjamin J.; Ren, Xiang; Wardrop, Nicola A.; Gilbert, Marius; Tsang, Tim K.; Wu, Peng; Feng, Luzhao; Jiang, Hui; Peng, Zhibin; Zheng, Jiandong; Liao, Qiaohong; Li, Sa; Horby, Peter W.; Farrar, Jeremy J.; Gao, George F.; Tatem, Andrew J.; Yu, Hongjie",Lancet Infect Dis,240,3

Patients received a once daily subcutaneous injection of dalteparin 2500 anti-Xa i.u. commencing the day prior to starting HDCT, and continuing until day +30 post HSCT or hospital discharge, whichever came first. Dosage adjustments were made for patients developing renal failure. All bleeding episodes were recorded and graded and VOD was diagnosed and graded according to Seattle criteria. At 100 days of follow-up, the overall survival and probability of regimen-related mortality were 85 and 15%, respectively. Nine patients developed VOD. The probability of developing VOD post allogeneic and autologous HSCT was 28% (95% CI, 6–45) and 17% (95% CI, 0–32), respectively. VOD was graded as moderate (n=8) and severe (n=1). VOD resolved in all cases except for one patient who died secondary to severe VOD and multiorgan failure. Clinically significant bleeding episodes occurred in three patients; 24 patients developed minor bleeding not requiring specific therapy. All bleeding episodes resolved. These results suggest that LMWH for VOD prophylaxis is safe with a low incidence of serious bleeding events. Whether it is superior to unfractionated heparin, however, is unknown and should be addressed within the context of a randomized controlled trial.","Forrest, D L; Thompson, K; Dorcas, V G; Couban, S H; Pierce, R",Bone Marrow Transplant,240,9

In the prophylaxis study a total of 57 volunteers received lozenges of either zinc gluconate (23 mg) (29 volunteers) or matched placebo (28 volunteers) every 2 h while awake during a period of four and a half days. They were challenged with 10(2) tissue culture infecting dose (TCID(50)) of human rhinovirus 2 (HRV-2) on the second day of medication, and were monitored daily for symptoms and signs of colds and laboratory evidence of infection. Zinc reduced the total mean clinical score from 8.2 in the placebo group to 5.7 and the reduction of the mean clinical score was statistically significant on the second day after virus challenge. In the therapeutic study 69 volunteers were inoculated with 10(2) TCID(50) of HRV-2 and those who developed cold symptoms were randomly allocated to receive either zinc gluconate lozenges (six volunteers) or matched placebo lozenges (six volunteers) every two hours they were awake for six days. Treatment of colds with zinc reduced the mean daily clinical score and this was statistically significant on the fourth and fifth day of medication. Similarly, medication also reduced the mean daily nasal secretion weight and total tissue count and these reductions were statistically significant on days two and six for nasal secretion weights and days four to six of medication for tissue counts when compared with placebo. There were also statistically significant reductions in the mean total nasal secretion weights and total tissue counts. Zinc, however, had no significant effect on the rate or amount of virus excreted by volunteers. We conclude that zinc gluconate lozenges are reasonably well tolerated and that they have a significant effect on the signs and symptoms of colds caused by rhinoviruses, although the mechanism of action remains obscure.","Al-Nakib, W.; Higgins, P.G.; Barrow, I.; Batstone, G.; Tyrrell, D.A.J.",J Antimicrob Chemother,240,3

Measles transmissibility was assessed by estimation of the reproduction number, R, the average number of secondary cases per infection, using 4 methods; elimination requires maintaining R at <1. Method 1 estimates R as 1 minus the proportion of cases that are imported. Methods 2 and 3 estimate R by fitting a model of the spread of infection to data on the sizes and generations of chains of transmission, respectively. Method 4 assesses transmissibility before public health interventions, by estimating R for the case with the earliest symptom onset in each cluster (R(index)). During 2001–2014, R and R(index) estimates obtained using methods 1–4 were 0.72 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68, 0.76), 0.66 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.70), 0.45 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.49), and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.69), respectively. Year-to-year variability in the values of R and R(index) and an increase in transmissibility in recent years were noted with all methods. Elimination of endemic measles transmission is maintained in the United States.

One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest‐savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non‐tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non‐tree plants have been defined as fallback and non‐preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha. Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest‐savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J.

Currently, no FDA approved drugs or vaccines are available for the treatment of LASV fever. The LASV glycoprotein complex (GP) is a promising target for vaccine or drug development. It is situated on the virion envelope and plays key roles in LASV growth, cell tropism, host range, and pathogenicity. In an effort to discover new LASV vaccines, we employ several sequence-based computational prediction tools to identify LASV GP major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II T-cell epitopes. In addition, many sequence- and structure-based computational prediction tools were used to identify LASV GP B-cell epitopes. The predicted T- and B-cell epitopes were further filtered based on the consensus approach that resulted in the identification of thirty new epitopes that have not been previously tested experimentally. Epitope-allele complexes were obtained for selected strongly binding alleles to the MHC-I T-cell epitopes using molecular docking and the complexes were relaxed with molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interaction and dynamics of the epitope-allele complexes. These predictions provide guidance to the experimental investigations and validation of the epitopes with the potential for stimulating T-cell responses and B-cell antibodies against LASV and allow the design and development of LASV vaccines.","Baral, Prabin; Pavadai, Elumalai; Gerstman, Bernard S.; Chapagain, Prem P.",Sci Rep,240,3

It has been previously shown that the production and release of LT by human-derived ETEC strains are variable. Although the natural genetic polymorphisms of regulatory sequences of LT-encoding (eltAB) genes may explain the variable production of LT, the knowledge of the transcriptional and posttranscriptional aspects affecting LT expression among ETEC strains is not clear. To further understand the factors affecting LT expression, we evaluated the impact of the natural polymorphism in noncoding regulatory sequences of eltAB among clinically derived ETEC strains. Sequence analyses of seven clinically derived strains and the reference strain H10407 revealed polymorphic sites at both the promoter and upstream regions of the eltAB operon. Operon fusion assays with GFP revealed that specific nucleotide changes in the Pribnow box reduce eltAB transcription. Nonetheless, the total amounts of LT produced by the tested ETEC strains did not strictly correspond to the detected LT-specific mRNA levels. Indeed, the stability of LT varied according to the tested strain, indicating the presence of posttranscriptional mechanisms affecting LT expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the production of LT is a strain-specific process and involves transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate the final amount of toxin produced and released by specific strains.

South Africa has the highest prevalence of FASD in the world. We review the social determinants underpinning FASD in South Africa and add critical insight from an intersectional feminist perspective. We undertook a scoping review, guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Drawing from EBSCOhost and PubMed, 95 articles were screened, with 21 selected for analysis. We used the intersectionality wheel to conceptualize how the social and structural determinants of FASD identified by the literature are interconnected and indicative of broader inequalities shaping the women and children affected. Key intersecting social determinants that facilitate drinking during pregnancy among marginalized populations in South Africa documented in the existing literature include social norms and knowledge around drinking and drinking during pregnancy, alcohol addiction and biological dependence, gender-based violence, inadequate access to contraception and abortion services, trauma and mental health, and moralization and stigma. Most of the studies found were quantitative. From an intersectional perspective, there was limited analysis of how the determinants identified intersect with one another in ways that exacerbate inequalities and how they relate to the broader structural and systemic factors undermining healthy pregnancies. There was also little representation of pregnant women’s own perspectives or discussion about the power dynamics involved. While social determinants are noted in the literature on FASD in South Africa, much more is needed from an intersectionality lens to understand the perspectives of affected women, their social contexts and the nature of the power relations involved. A critical stance towards the victim/active agent dichotomy that often frames women who drink during pregnancy opens up space to understand the nuances needed to support the women involved while also illustrating the contextual barriers to drinking cessation that need to be addressed through holistic approaches.","De Jong, Michelle; George, Asha; Jacobs, Tanya",Health Policy Plan,240,3

GreenCross Pharma (GC Pharma), a Korean company, developed the Tdap vaccine GC3111 in 2010. Recently, they enhanced the vaccine, GC3111, produced previously in 2010 to reinforce the antibody response against filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). In this study, immunogenicity and efficacy of the enhanced Tdap vaccine compared and evaluated with two Tdap vaccines, GC3111 vaccine produced in 2010 previously and commercially available Tdap vaccine in a murine model. METHODS: Two tests groups and positive control group of Balb/c mice were primed with two doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine followed by a single booster Tdap vaccine at 9 week using the commercially available Tdap vaccine or 2 Tdap vaccines from GC Pharma (GC3111, enhanced GC3111). Humoral response was assessed 1 week before and 2 and 4 weeks after Tdap booster vaccination. The enhanced GC3111 generated similar humoral response compare to the commercial vaccine for filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). The interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (Th1), interleukin 5 (IL-5) (Th2) and interleukin 17 (IL-17) (Th17) cytokines were assessed 4 weeks after booster vaccination by stimulation with three simulators: heat inactivated Bordetella pertussis (hBp), vaccine antigens, and hBp mixed with antigens (hBp + antigen). A bacterial challenge test was performed 4 weeks after booster vaccination. RESULTS: Regarding cell-mediated immunity, cytokine secretion differed among the three simulators. However, no difference was found between two test groups and positive control group. All the vaccinated groups indicated a Th1 or Th1/Th2 response. On Day 5 post-bacterial challenge, B. pertussis colonies were absent in the lungs in two test groups and positive control group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the immunogenicity of GC Pharma’s Tdap vaccine; enhanced GC3111 was equivalent to the presently used commercial vaccine in terms of humoral response as well as cell-mediated cytokine expression.

In this study, multiple analyses based on 3593 patients with breast cancer and their mRNA expression values were utilized to investigate the clinical relevance of LSM family genes, including cancer aggressiveness, immune cell infiltration, prognostic outcomes, and related signaling pathways. We revealed that LSM4 had higher expression levels in breast tumor and breast cancer sub-types than in normal samples, and was associated with poor survival outcomes. Interestingly, infiltration levels of most immune cell types, including cluster of differentiation for positive CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, T-cell follicular helpers, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells were positively correlated with LSM4 expression in several subclasses of breast cancer (basal, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), luminal A, and luminal B). ABSTRACT: In recent decades, breast cancer (BRCA) has become one of the most common diseases worldwide. Understanding crucial genes and their signaling pathways remain an enormous challenge in evaluating the prognosis and possible therapeutics. The “Like-Smith” (LSM) family is known as protein-coding genes, and its member play pivotal roles in the progression of several malignancies, although their roles in BRCA are less clear. To discover biological processes associated with LSM family genes in BRCA development, high-throughput techniques were applied to clarify expression levels of LSMs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-BRCA dataset, which was integrated with the cBioPortal database. Furthermore, we investigated prognostic values of LSM family genes in BCRA patients using the Kaplan–Meier database. Among genes of this family, LSM4 expression levels were highly associated with poor prognostic outcomes with a hazard ratio of 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.21–1.51, p for trend = 3.4 × 10(−7)). MetaCore and GlueGo analyses were also conducted to examine transcript expression signatures of LSM family members and their coexpressed genes, together with their associated signaling pathways, such as “Cell cycle role of APC in cell cycle regulation” and “Immune response IL-15 signaling via MAPK and PI3K cascade” in BRCA. Results showed that LSM family members, specifically LSM4, were significantly correlated with oncogenesis in BRCA patients. In summary, our results suggested that LSM4 could be a prospective prognosticator of BRCA.","Ta, Hoang Dang Khoa; Wang, Wei-Jan; Phan, Nam Nhut; An Ton, Nu Thuy; Anuraga, Gangga; Ku, Su-Chi; Wu, Yung-Fu; Wang, Chih-Yang; Lee, Kuen-Haur",Cancers (Basel),240,3

In the United States, NEC strikes 1 to 8% of patients admitted to neonatal intensive care units, almost all of whom are premature infants. The incidence is low in certain countries wity a low premature birth rate, e.g., Japan. Two theories of pathogenesis are: the Santulli theory, which implicates three factors: ischaemia, bacteria and substrate; and the Lawrence theory, which stresses the injurious role of bacterial toxins on the immature gut of the preterm infant. Clinical and experimental evidence support each of the theories, but neither theory can explain certain clinical phenomena, particularly the resistance to NEC manifested by more than 90% of preterm infants, who never develop the syndrome. A unifying hypothesis of pathogenesis and a mathematical model of NEC are outlined. Because clustering of cases may occur, the design of clinical trials of preventive measures for NEC must include simultaneous control infants.","Kosloske, Ann M.",Semin Neonatol,240,1

The present study synthesises and evaluates the MAO inhibition properties of a series of 33 1-tetralone and 4-chromanone derivatives in an attempt to discover high-potency compounds and to expand on the structure–activity relationships of MAO inhibition by these classes. Among these series, eight submicromolar MAO-A inhibitors and 28 submicromolar MAO-B inhibitors are reported, with all compounds acting as specific inhibitors of the MAO-B isoform. The most potent inhibitor was a 1-tetralone derivative (1h) with IC(50) values of 0.036 and 0.0011 µM for MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. Interestingly, with the reduction of 1-tetralones to the corresponding alcohols, a decrease in MAO inhibition potency is observed. Among these 1-tetralol derivatives, 1p (IC(50) = 0.785 μM) and 1o (IC(50) = 0.0075 μM) were identified as particularly potent inhibitors of MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. Potent compounds such as those reported here may act as leads for the future development of MAO-B specific inhibitors.

The objectives of this study were to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection (COV19) status among 262 migrant farmworkers in North Florida. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of the information gathered from migrant workers referred by the Florida Dept. of Health for evaluation. Due to the urgency of returning to Mexico, subjects with which COV19 was detected were reevaluated for detailed medical history. Therefore, subjects that tested negative were later released following CDC guidelines. COV19 status was determined using an RNA qualitative nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from nasopharyngeal swabs collected over a three-day period. Variables collected include demography, symptoms, temperature, comorbidities, medication use, and vaccine status. Statistical significance for categorical variables was assessed using χ (2) test or Fisher’s exact test where appropriate. Remaining variables were assessed using basic descriptive analysis. RESULTS: From the 262 subjects tested, 6 missed the follow up visit and data was unavailable. All were Mexican males, age 18-67 years, with positivity rate of 35.1%. Among the 92 (+) subjects, the average age was 34.1 years and 34.5 among the 164 (-) subjects, (p=< 0.77). The symptoms and temperatures are in Table 1.

To model the market diffusion of new energy carriers and powertrains like electric vehicles, fleet turnover models are commonly used. A decisive influence factor for the substitution dynamics of such transformations is the survival rate of the national car fleet of a country. It represents the likelihood of a car reaching a certain lifespan. Due to a lack of data, current methods to estimate such survival probabilities neglect the imports and exports of used cars. Existing studies are limited to countries with a predominant market of new cars, compared to low numbers of imported and exported used cars. In this study, we resolve this marked simplification and propose a new method to estimate survival probabilities for countries with a high number of imported and exported used cars. Empirical data on the car stock, on inflows of new and used cars, and on outflows of exported and scrapped cars are gathered from 71 national statistics offices. Survival rates of the car fleets of 31 European countries are derived, for which we find a pronounced regional variability. Average lifespans of cars vary from 8.0 to 35.1 years, with a mean of 18.1 years in Western and 28.4 years in Eastern European countries, revealing the high impact of cross-border flows of cars. The study also shows that survival rate estimates can be improved significantly even in the absence of reliable data if a combination of a Weibull and a Gaussian distribution is used. It is likely that the predictive power of existing models (regarding the future environmental impact of car fleets) could be improved significantly if these findings were considered accordingly. The findings of this study can directly be included in fleet turnover and policy assessment models. They also enable the analysis of economic and environmental spillover effects from the imports and exports of used cars between countries.

Recent evidence has been conflicting, with both thyrotoxicosis and suppression of thyroid function reported. Objective: We aimed to detail the acute effects of COVID-19 on thyroid function and determine if these effects persisted upon recovery from COVID-19. Design: Cohort observational study. Participants and Setting: Adult patients admitted to Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust, London, UK with suspected COVID-19 between March 9 to April 22, 2020 were included, excluding those with pre-existing thyroid disease and those missing either free thyroxine (FT4) or TSH measurements. Of 456 patients, 334 had COVID-19 and 122 did not. Main Outcome Measures: TSH and FT4 measurements at admission, and where available, those taken in 2019 and at COVID-19 follow-up. Results: Most patients (86·6%) presenting with COVID-19 were euthyroid, with none presenting with overt thyrotoxicosis. Patients with COVID-19 had a lower admission TSH and FT4 compared to those without COVID-19. In the COVID-19 patients with matching baseline thyroid function tests from 2019 (n=185 for TSH and 104 for FT4), both TSH and FT4 were reduced at admission compared to baseline. In a complete cases analysis of COVID-19 patients with TSH measurements at follow-up, admission and baseline (n=55), TSH was seen to recover to baseline at follow-up. Conclusions: Most patients with COVID-19 present with euthyroidism. We observed mild reductions in TSH and FT4 in keeping with a non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Furthermore, in survivors of COVID-19, thyroid function tests at follow-up returned to baseline.","Eu Khoo, Bernard Chong; Tan, Tricia; Mills, Edouard; Clarke, Sophie A; Patel, Bijal; Modi, Manish; Phylactou, Maria; Eng, Pei Chia; Thurston, Layla; Alexander, Emma C; Meeran, Karim; Comninos, Alexander N; Abbara, Ali; Dhillo, Waljit Singh",J Endocr Soc,240,26

We investigated the psycho-social burden of the pandemic and self-perceived risk and harm in a large IBD cohort. METHODS: In this monocentric prospective observational study, pediatric (pIBD) and adult patients completed questionnaires related to their IBD (phenotype, disease activity, treatment), comorbidities, demographic and socioeconomic factors, validated tools on Perceived Stress (PSQ) and quality of life (sIBDQ). They judged perception of harm in case of acquiring COVID-19 using ratings from 1 to 7. We used number and type of established conditions for severe COVID-19 outcome to categorize patients in 5 risk groups. SARS-CoV2 antibodies were determined by Elecsys Roche anti-N pan-Ig. All comparisons were made by using t-test, Mann-Whitney-U-test or Chi-square-test where applicable with 2-sided significance levels of 5%. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was performed to determine associations between factors and perceived harm. RESULTS: Between mid-July to mid-October, 504 (62%) of 820 invited IBD patients and 86 pIBD parents completed the survey. Age ranged from 6-85 years, 80% received mono- or combo-therapy with immunomodulator, biologic, JAK-inhibitor or corticosteroids. Remission, mild, moderate and severe disease activity were reported by 46, 39, 12 and 3%, respectively. High harm of potential COVID-19 (>3) was perceived by 75.4%, rates increased with age (p=0.0019). After adjusting for age and gender, high perceived harm was significantly associated with immunosuppressive drugs, number/type of comorbidities, sleep disturbance, unintended gain or loss of weight, higher PSQ and lower sIBDQ scores. PSQ scored lower in males >60 years vs age matched females or younger adults, and in patients in remission vs active disease. PIBD mothers’ total PSQ was similar with even higher subscores for demands (P=0.0004) as adults with moderate/severe disease. Compared to pre-pandemic, 58-93% of pIBD decreased physical activities (at home, sports, outdoor) with minor changes in adults. SARS-CoV-2 serology was positive in 0.4% of IBD patients compared to 2% of our city population. CONCLUSION: Prior to 2nd infection wave, even IBD patients aged <40 years suffer from a high degree of worries, stress and perceived harm for potential COVID-19. Most elderly patients and those with comorbidities adequately estimate their risks. In pIBD, pandemic restrictions substantially impacted on physical activity. The low seropositivity rate indicates high adherence to social distancing or altered immune response due to IBD drugs. Results of the follow up survey in March 21 are underway.","Koletzko, L; Klucker, E; Le Thi, G; Breiteneicher, S; Rubio-Acero, R; Neuhaus, L; Stark, R; Standl, M; Hölscher, M; Török, H; Koletzko, S; Schwerd, T",J Crohns Colitis,240,16

Member States have accepted the possibility of additional own resource payments up to 0.6 percent of their gross national income (GNI) until the year 2058. Simulations show that this 0.6 percentage point extra margin represents a very large excess coverage which creates a repayment potential far above the magnitude needed to redeem the NGEU debt. This holds even under very conservative assumptions on GNI growth. The study also sheds light on the signals, incentives, and liability consequences arising from this far-reaching excess coverage of the Corona debt. The extensive excess repayment capacity of the EU budget over the coming decades can be understood as a signal that a new EU debt window can be rapidly used in the coming decades whenever it is needed. The paper also highlights another consequence of this overfunding for the maximum liability of the German federal budget for NGEU debt. The calculations show that this liability is effectively unlimited and thus fundamentally different from the type of partial liability that was accepted for the European Stability Mechanism.","Heinemann, Friedrich",List Forum,240,22

Healthcare systems are key partners in implementing HPV vaccination quality improvement (QI) programs. To inform future system-level HPV vaccine initiatives, we sought to understand HPV vaccine QI from the perspective of QI program leaders in healthcare systems. We conducted telephone interviews with a multi-state sample of 17 QI leaders in 15 systems. We analyzed data qualitatively via thematic analysis to describe QI leaders' perspectives on prioritizing and implementing HPV vaccine QI. All QI leaders endorsed HPV vaccination as beneficial, and some had already prioritized increasing uptake to improve adolescent health and meet payor reimbursement standards. Those not prioritizing HPV vaccination cited concerns including the relatively small size of adolescent patient populations, lack of buy-in among providers, and the need to focus on health services perceived as more profitable or urgent. When implementing HPV vaccine QI programs, QI leaders reported key barriers to be the lack of robust data systems and acceptable QI metrics, limited time, and pressures of a fee-for-service clinical environment. Facilitators included automation and standardization in QI efforts and passionate vaccine champions. Almost all QI leaders reported future plans to implement HPV vaccine QI projects. Findings suggest that many healthcare systems are motivated to improve HPV vaccination. However, resistance to guideline-consistent quality metrics, the narrow target of one vaccine in the adolescent patient population, payment structures, and constrained time of providers are key barriers to practice improvements.","Grabert, Brigid K; Heisler-MacKinnon, Jennifer; Liu, Amy; Margolis, Marjorie A; Cox, Elizabeth D; Gilkey, Melissa B",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,240,1

It assures the reliability and standards of the laboratory function. A pandemic situation such as that caused by the influenza H1N1 2009 virus or the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) increases the demands on the public health system, and the need to build, upgrade and expand the number of diagnostic laboratories. The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 unleashed a public health emergency of an unprecedented scale. The need has been highlighted for the accreditation of tests relating to COVID-19 by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) or any agencies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) or Indian Council of Medical Research. The implementation of quality system in diagnostic laboratories would ensure accurate, reliable and efficient test results at par with the international standards. The functional aspects of a laboratory such as a well-defined organogram, standard operating procedures, good laboratory practices, quality controls, human resources, equipment management, reagents, inventory of records, proper communication need to be addressed to assure quality.

Tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) activation following ischemic injury is known to increase neuronal excitability by downregulation of K-Cl co-transporter 2 (KCC2); a neuronal chloride (Cl-) co-transporter. In this study, three graded doses of ANA12, a small-molecule selective TrkB antagonist, were tested in CD1 mice at P7 and P10 following induction of neonatal ischemia by a unilateral carotid ligation. The PB loading dose remained the same in all treatment groups at both ages. Evaluation criteria for the anti-seizure efficacy of ANA12 were: (1) quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) seizure burden and power, (2) rescue of post-ischemic KCC2 and pKCC2-S940 downregulation and (3) reversal of TrkB pathway activation following ischemia. ANA12 significantly rescued PB resistant seizures in a dose-dependent manner at P7 and improved PB efficacy at P10. Additionally, female pups responded better to lower doses of ANA12 compared to males. ANA12 significantly reversed post-ischemic KCC2 downregulation and TrkB pathway activation at P7 when PB alone was inefficacious. Rescuing KCC2 hypofunction may be critical for preventing emergence of refractory seizures.","Carter, B M; Sullivan, B J; Landers, J R; Kadam, S D",Scientific reports,240,1

The actions of glucocorticoids are mediated by a ubiquitous intracellular receptor protein, the glucocorticoid receptor. So far, data on coronavirus disease 2019 and glucocorticoid receptor alpha expression are lacking. DESIGN Prospective observational study. SETTING One academic multidisciplinary ICU. SUBJECTS Twenty-six adult coronavirus disease 2019 patients; 33 adult noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients, matched for age, sex, and disease severity, constituted the control group. All patients were steroid-free. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Glucocorticoid receptor alpha, glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper expression, and serum cortisol were measured on ICU admission. In coronavirus disease 2019 patients, glucocorticoid receptor alpha and glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper messenger RNA expression were upregulated (4.7-fold, p < 0.01 and 14-fold, p < 0.0001, respectively), and cortisol was higher (20.3 vs 14.3 μg/dL, p < 0.01) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS ICU coronavirus disease 2019 patients showed upregulated glucocorticoid receptor alpha and glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper expression, along with cortisol levels, compared with ICU noncoronavirus disease 2019 patients. Thus, on ICU admission, critical coronavirus disease 2019 appears to be associated with hypercortisolemia, and increased synthesis of glucocorticoid receptor alpha and induced proteins.","Vassiliou, Alice G; Athanasiou, Nikolaos; Keskinidou, Chrysi; Jahaj, Edison; Tsipilis, Stamatios; Zacharis, Alexandros; Botoula, Efthimia; Diamantopoulos, Aristidis; Ilias, Ioannis; Vassiliadi, Dimitra A; Tsagarakis, Stylianos; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Dimopoulou, Ioanna",Critical care medicine,240,17

Objective The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations.

However, if SAEW disinfection is followed by chitosan (CS) coating treatment, this will construct a new membrane and prevent the loss of moisture and carbon dioxide through the damaged cuticle. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of SAEW disinfection followed by CS coating treatment at improving the internal quality of eggs during 6 weeks of storage at 25°C. RESULTS Scanning electron microscopy revealed that SAEW-treated eggs had deeper and wider cracks than control eggs stored between 0 d and 21 d. Moreover, the depth and width of the cracks in the uncoated eggs increased as storage time increased. However, the CS coating method was successfully used on SAEW-disinfected eggs to construct a barrier against the negative effects of shell damage. After 6 weeks of storage at 25°C, the yolk index, albumen pH, HU value, and weight loss value of the SAEW + CS group were 0.31, 9.01, 63.72, and 5.35%, respectively. CONCLUSION A combination of SAEW and CS was more effective at maintaining internal egg quality than SAEW or CS treatments alone during storage. This article is protected by copyright.

The aim of this study is to establish the impact of packed red blood cell (PRBC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelet (PLT) transfusion on the 30-day mortality and morbidity (thrombotic versus non thrombotic complications) of rAAAs. METHODS A retrospective study of 90 consecutive rAAAs from November 2007 to June 2015 was conducted. Multivariable regression models were produced to determine blood products associated with 30-day morbidity and mortality post-rAAA. RESULTS The overall mortality was 14.6%. At multivariable analyses, transfusion with FFP (>3 units) was independently associated with an increased risk of mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 11.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-96.72, P = .027). The overall morbidity was 26.8%, and subgroup analysis (thrombotic vs nonthrombotic complications) demonstrated transfusion of PLTs (>1 pool) to be independently associated with thrombotic events (OR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.37-13.6, P = .012). Thrombotic events were responsible for 50% (n = 11 of 22) of all morbidities and mortalities (n = 6 of 12). CONCLUSION Transfusion of FFP and PLTs may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. The use of these blood components should be considered in the context of the patient's clinical and laboratory data as opposed to a fixed ratio to PRBCs. This may result in the reduction in thrombotic complications emerging in rAAA cohort.","Kordzadeh, Ali; Askari, Alan; Parsa, Ali D; Browne, Tom; Panayiotopoulos, Yiannis P",Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,240,1

Following this finding, the objective of the present study was to understand how the App culture supernatant inhibits PRRSV replication in its natural targeted host cells, i.e. porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs). METHODOLOGY Several assays were conducted with App culture supernatant-treated PRRSV-infected cell lines, such as PAM, St-Jude porcine lung and MARC-145 cells. RT-qPCR assays were used to determine the expression levels of type I and II IFN mRNAs, viral genomic (gRNA) and sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNAs). Proteomic, Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were conducted to determine the involvement of actin filaments in the App culture supernatant antiviral effect.Results/Key findings. Type I and II IFN mRNA expressions were not upregulated by the App culture supernatant. Time courses of gRNA and sgRNA expression levels demonstrated that the App culture supernatant inhibits PRRSV infection before the first viral transcription cycle. Western blot experiments confirmed an increase in the expression of cofilin (actin cytoskeleton dynamics regulator) and immunofluorescence also demonstrated a significant decrease of actin filaments in App culture supernatant-treated PRRSV-infected PAM cells. App culture supernatant antiviral activity was also demonstrated against other PRRSV strains of genotypes I and II. CONCLUSION App culture supernatant antiviral effect against PRRSV takes place early during PRRSV infection. Results suggest that App culture supernatant antiviral effect may take place via the activation of cofilin, which induces actin depolymerization and subsequently, probably affects PRRSV endocytosis. Other experiments are needed to fully validate this latest hypothesis.","Hernandez Reyes, Yenney; Provost, Chantale; Traesel, Carolina Kist; Jacques, Mario; Gagnon, Carl A",Journal of medical microbiology,240,31

The aim of this review was to identify all published studies of interventions which sought to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care in Pacific low-and middle-income countries. Methods A scoping review framework was used. Databases and grey literature were searched for studies published between January 2000 and July 2019 which described actions to improve the quality of maternal and newborn care in Pacific low- and middle-income countries. Interventions were categorised using a four-level health system framework and the WHO quality of maternal and newborn care standards. An expert advisory group of Pacific Islander clinicians and researchers provided guidance throughout the review process. Results 2010 citations were identified and 32 studies included. Most interventions focused on the clinical service or organisational level, such as healthcare worker training, audit processes and improvements to infrastructure. Few addressed patient experiences or system-wide improvements. Enablers to improving quality care included community engagement, collaborative partnerships, adequate staff education and training and alignment with local priorities.

Despite this knowledge, differential regulation of adhesiveness in T cell subsets has not been explored yet. In this study, we show that in human T cells, SDF-1α-mediated β2 integrin activation is driven by a, so far, not-described reactive oxidative species (ROS)-regulated calcium influx. Furthermore, we show that CD4+CD28null T cells represent a highly reactive subset showing 25-fold stronger β2 integrin activation upon SDF-1α stimulation compared with CD28+ T cells. Interestingly, ROS-dependent Ca release was much more prevalent in the pathogenetically pivotal CD28null subset compared with the CD28+ T cells, whereas the established mediators of the classical pathways for β2 integrin activation (PKC, PI3K, and PLC) were similarly activated in both T cell subsets. Thus, interference with the calcium flux attenuates spontaneous adhesion of CD28null T cells from acute coronary syndrome patients, and calcium ionophores abolished the observed differences in the adhesion properties between CD28+ and CD28null T cells. Likewise, the adhesion of these T cell subsets was indistinguishable in the presence of exogenous ROS/H2O2 Together, these data provide a molecular explanation of the role of ROS in pathogenesis of plaque destabilization.","Samstag, Yvonne; Bogert, Nicolai V; Wabnitz, Guido H; Din, Shabana; Therre, Markus; Leuschner, Florian; Katus, Hugo A; Konstandin, Mathias H",Journal of immunology,240,1

The purpose of this paper is to characterise growth and metabolic performance of BSF larvae on substrate moisture contents from 45 to 85%. Larvae developed into prepupae only at 45-75% substrate moisture content. Within this interval, the maximal specific growth rate was highest (0.73 day-1), the growth period shortest (13 days), and the maximal dry weight lowest (88 mg) at 45% moisture content. Differences in cost of growth and maintenance were not observed at the different substrate moisture contents, and differences in larval performance were likely associated to differences in co-occurring microbial activities. As much as 22% of the substrate carbon was emitted as CO2 at 45% moisture content by microorganisms, measured as the difference between total respiration and larval respiration, whereas microbial CO2 production amounted to only 3% of the substrate carbon at 75% moisture content. As consequence of the high specific growth rate and short growth phase, the overall net growth efficiency was higher at 45% moisture content (0.62) than at 75% moisture content (0.52). Overall, the metabolic performance of the BSF larvae was insensitive to differences in substrate moisture content. Their performance was, however indirectly affected by the substrate moisture content due to differences in co-occurring microbial processes in the substrate.","Bekker, Nicolai Sundgaard; Heidelbach, Søren; Vestergaard, Sofie Zacho; Nielsen, Morten Eneberg; Riisgaard-Jensen, Marie; Zeuner, Emil Juel; Bahrndorff, Simon; Eriksen, Niels Thomas",Waste management,240,1

In this study, nitrogen-doped sludge-derived biochar (NSDB) was prepared and applied to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation, focusing on the effect of calcination temperature on the degradation mechanism. The results showed that the contribution of free radicals to SMX degradation decreased gradually when calcination temperature increased from 300 to 800 °C. In contrast, the contribution of surface-bound reactive species increased gradually. However, the contribution of surface-bound reactive species to SMX degradation decreased for NSDB prepared at 900 °C. The change of physiochemical properties such as contact angle caused by calcination temperature was responsible for the shift of SMX degradation mechanism. NSDB prepared at 800 °C showed higher catalytic activity to PMS compared to NSDB prepared at other temperatures. Compared to sludge-derived biochar (SDB), NSDB had much higher catalytic activity, indicating that nitrogen doping could improve the catalytic activity of SDB. This study provided a way to modulate the degradation mechanism of SMX by calcination temperature of biochar to activate PMS for degradation of organic pollutants.","Wang, Shizong; Wang, Jianlong",Journal of hazardous materials,240,1

These regulations aimed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission among farmworkers, but made compromises that may fail to reduce the risk of further outbreaks among Oregon's agricultural workers, particularly those living in agricultural labor housing. Instead of considering the scientific literature that called for attention to space and length of time for social distancing among unrelated persons in indoor areas, the agency accepted the 6-foot social distancing rule of thumb and allowed even shorter distances between beds with the installation of plastic or plywood barriers. The 6-foot distance (or less with a barrier) between people sleeping next to each other in poorly ventilated housing has proved disastrous. Additionally, testing for migrant and seasonal farmworkers is neither uniform nor thorough, and little data have been collected to assess the success of existing testing efforts. New regulations must be adopted for farm labor housing that limit occupancy to at most two unrelated individuals for a room of 200 square feet; include expanded specification on the provision of fresh air in shared living spaces; and support increased access to testing, surveillance testing, and alternative safe housing at labor housing sites for identified cases.","Accorsi, Emma K; Samples, Julie; McCauley, Linda A; Shadbeh, Nargess",Journal of agromedicine,240,1

BACKGROUND Supporting physically and emotionally exhausted nurses, whilst ensuring quality standards of care delivery in the recovery phase of COVID-19, requires careful, considerate and proactive planning. EVALUATION Drawing on literature and utilising Lawton and Paez Gabriunas' (2015) integrated ethical leadership framework (purpose, practices, virtues), possible practical suggestions for the operationalisation of ethical leadership are proposed. DISCUSSION Nurse managers must maintain ethical vigilance in order to nurture values driven behaviour, demonstrating empathy and compassion for nurses experiencing physical and emotional exhaustion because of COVID-19. It is important that open dialogue, active listening and self-care interventions exist. Nurse managers have an essential role in inspiring and empowering nurses, building morale and a collective commitment to safe quality care. CONCLUSION Nurse managers need to consider ways of empowering, supporting and enabling nurses to apply ethical standards in every day practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT Fostering ethical nurse leadership requires careful and sensitive planning, as well as charismatic, compassionate and inspirational leaders. Supporting staff through respect, empathy, role modelling and genuine conscientiousness is essential for increasing job performance and sustaining an ethical work environment.","Markey, Kathleen; Ventura, Carla Aparecida Arena; O' Donnell, Claire; Doody, Owen",Journal of nursing management,240,1

OBJECTIVE The objective of our descriptive study was to review our single-center experience with benign salpingo-ovarian conditions (feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes). DESIGN A retrospective cross-sectional study from January-2012 to October-2014. SETTING King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center--a referral tertiary healthcare center. PATIENTS AND METHODS All gynecologic patients who underwent SPLS procedures for benign adnexal pathologies were analyzed for pre-, intra-and postoperative details. SPLS was done using a single multi-port trocar and standard laparoscopic instruments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Perioperative complications and conversion rate. RESULTS Eighty (n=80) patients underwent SPLS interventions. the median age and BMi were 37 years and 24.6 kg/m2, respectively. Thirty-one patients (38.8%) had >=1 previous abdominopelvic surgeries. Of 104 SPLS procedures conducted, the three most common procedures were unilateral ovarian cystectomy (n=21/104; 20.2%), bilateral ovarian transposition (n=20/104; 19.2%), and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (n=16/104; 15.4%). No patient required addition of extra ports or conversion to conventional multi-port laparoscopy or laparotomy. The median operative time, estimated blood loss and hospital stay were 66 min, 10 mL and 1 day, respectively. No patient experienced major intraoperative or postoperative complications. the median postoperative pain grade using the visual analogue scale was 2 (examined in 74 of 80 patients). At six-weeks postoperatively, the median wound scar length (measured at outpatient clinic) was 1.2 cm.

Children aged 2-59 months admitted to the Hôpital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco meeting WHO-defined severe pneumonia criteria were recruited during 14 months and thoroughly investigated to ascertain a definitive diagnosis. Viral prevalence of RSV, hMPV and other viruses causing respiratory symptoms was investigated in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples through the use of molecular methods. Of the 683 children recruited and included in the final analysis, 61/683 (8·9%) and 124/683 (18·2%) were infected with hMPV and RSV, respectively. Besides a borderline significant tendency for higher age in hMPV cases, patients infected with either of the viruses behaved similarly in terms of demographics, patient history, past morbidity and comorbidity, vaccination history, socioeconomic background and family environment. Clinical presentation on arrival was also similar for both viruses, but hMPV cases were associated with more severity than RSV cases, had a higher risk of intensive care need, and received antibiotic treatment more frequently. RSV and hMPV are common and potentially life-threatening causes of WHO-defined pneumonia in Moroccan children. Both viruses show indistinctive clinical symptomatology, but in Moroccan children, hMPV was associated with a more severe evolution.","Jroundi, I; Mahraoui, C; Benmessaoud, R; Moraleda, C; Tligui, H; Seffar, M; El Kettani, S E C; Benjelloun, B S; Chaacho, S; Muñoz-Almagro, C; Ruiz, J; Alonso, P L; Bassat, Q",Epidemiology and infection,240,1

Morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (EMBEDA, MS-sNT), indicated for management of chronic, moderate to severe pain, contain pellets of morphine sulfate with a sequestered naltrexone core. Should product tampering by crushing occur, the sequestered naltrexone is intended for release to reduce morphine-induced subjective effects. OBJECTIVE This study compared self-reports of high, euphoria, and drug-liking effects of intravenous morphine alone versus intravenous morphine combined with naltrexone in a clinical simulation of intravenous abuse of crushed MS-sNT. METHODS This single-center, randomized, double-blind, crossover study characterized subjective effects of naltrexone administered intravenously at the same ratio to morphine present in MS-sNT. Subjects were male and had used prescription opioids five or more times within the previous 12 months to get 'high' but were not physically dependent on opioids. The primary outcome was the response to the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) question #5, ""How high are you now?"" (100 mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]). The secondary outcome was the response to a Cole/Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Stimulation-Euphoria modified scale. Additional outcomes included response to VAS drug liking, the remaining DEQ questions, and pupillometry. RESULTS Administration of intravenous naltrexone following intravenous morphine diminished mean high (29.8 vs 85.2 mm), Cole/ARCI Stimulation-Euphoria (13.7 vs 27.8 mm), and drug-liking (38.9 vs 81.4 mm) scores (all p < 0.0001) compared with intravenous morphine alone. No serious adverse events occurred as a result of the tested ratio of naltrexone to morphine. CONCLUSIONS Results in this study population suggest that naltrexone added to morphine in the 4% ratio within MS-sNT mitigates the high, euphoria, and drug liking of morphine alone, potentially reducing the attractiveness for product tampering. Assessment of the true clinical significance of these findings will require further study.","Webster, Lynn R; Johnson, Franklin K; Stauffer, Joseph; Setnik, Beatrice; Ciric, Sabrina",Drugs in R&D,240,5

Viral pneumonia in adults could present as community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), ranging from mild disease to severe disease requiring hospital admission and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the role of viruses in hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia as causative agents or as co-pathogens and the effect of virus detection on clinical outcome are being investigated.More than 20 viruses have been linked to CAP. Clinical presentation, laboratory findings, biomarkers, and radiographic patterns are not characteristic to specific viral etiology. Currently, laboratory confirmation is most commonly done by detection of viral nucleic acid by reverse transcription-PCR of respiratory secretions.Apart from the US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for treatment of influenza pneumonia, the treatment of non-influenza respiratory viruses is limited. Moreover, the evidence supporting the use of available antivirals to treat immunocompromised patients is modest at best. With the widespread use of molecular diagnostics, an aging population, and advancement in cancer therapy, physicians will face a bigger challenge in managing viral respiratory tract infections.

METHODS This open-label repeat-dose study enrolled 22 patients (mean age, 51.4 years; 81.8% female). All patients were receiving at least one concomitant medication; 86.4% were receiving at least two concomitant medications and 81.8% were receiving at least three. Patients receiving a stable dose of an opioid were converted to hydromorphone ER at a 5:1 ratio (morphine equivalent:hydromorphone). The dose was titrated to adequate analgesia over 3-14 days and stabilized between 8-48 mg. Oral morphine immediate-release was permitted for breakthrough pain. Area under the concentration-time curve from 0-24 hours (AUC(0-24)), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), trough plasma concentration (C(min)), average plasma concentration (C(avg)), and degree of fluctuation (100 × [(C(max) - C(min)) ÷ C(avg)]) were calculated based on data from 14 patients. RESULTS Dose-normalized to 16 mg, mean pharmacokinetic parameter values were: AUC(0-24), 41.1 ng · h/mL; C(max), 2.6 ng/mL; C(min), 1.1 ng/mL; C(avg), 1.7 ng/mL; and the degree of fluctuation was 99.6%. The pharmacokinetic profile of hydromorphone ER was linear and consistent with dose proportionality. Mean pain intensity difference scores showed statistically significant improvement from 2-21 hours after dosing. Sixteen (72.7%) patients reported at least one adverse event (AE).

Despite increasing popularity of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in bariatric surgery, its effect on GERD is still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of LSG with or without hiatal hernia repair (HHR) on GERD in obese patients. METHODS Seventy-eight patients with HH underwent LSG with concomitant HHR (LSG+HHR group). Their data were compared with that of 102 patients without HH, who underwent only LSG (LSG-group). All patients underwent a standardized questionnaire, a double-contrast barium swallow, and an upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy before the surgical procedure and at least 6 months later. RESULTS At baseline, the prevalence of GERD symptoms and their frequency-intensity scores did not differ between groups. At follow up, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of typical GERD symptoms only in the LSG-group (P = .003). LSG+HHR patients showed a significantly higher heartburn frequency-intensity score compared with LSG patients (P = .009). CONCLUSION This finding confirms that LSG has a beneficial effect on relieving GERD symptoms, although the underlying mechanisms are still unclear; conversely, the procedure of HHR did not produce any improvement in GERD symptoms.","Santonicola, Antonella; Angrisani, Luigi; Cutolo, Pierpaolo; Formisano, Giampaolo; Iovino, Paola",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,240,26

Computerized Internet randomization was done between 2010 and 2013. Patients, clinicians, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01082874). Setting 135 centers in 23 countries. Patients Adults aged 45 years or older who had or were at risk for atherosclerotic disease and were having noncardiac surgery. Exclusions were placement of a bare-metal stent within 6 weeks, placement of a drug-eluting stent within 1 year, or receipt of nonstudy aspirin within 72 hours before surgery. Intervention Aspirin therapy (overall trial, n = 4998; subgroup, n = 234) or placebo (overall trial, n = 5012; subgroup, n = 236) initiated within 4 hours before surgery and continued throughout the perioperative period. Of the 470 subgroup patients, 99.9% completed follow-up. Measurements The 30-day primary outcome was death or nonfatal myocardial infarction; bleeding was a secondary outcome. Results In patients with prior PCI, aspirin reduced the risk for the primary outcome (absolute risk reduction, 5.5% [95% CI, 0.4% to 10.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.50 [CI, 0.26 to 0.95]; P for interaction = 0.036) and for myocardial infarction (absolute risk reduction, 5.9% [CI, 1.0% to 10.8%]; HR, 0.44 [CI, 0.22 to 0.87]; P for interaction = 0.021). The effect on the composite of major and life-threatening bleeding in patients with prior PCI was uncertain (absolute risk increase, 1.3% [CI, -2.6% to 5.2%]). In the overall population, aspirin increased the risk for major bleeding (absolute risk increase, 0.8% [CI, 0.1% to 1.6%]; HR, 1.22 [CI, 1.01 to 1.48]; P for interaction = 0.50). Limitation Nonprespecified subgroup analysis with small sample. Conclusion Perioperative aspirin may be more likely to benefit rather than harm patients with prior PCI.

Studies suggest that M2-like macrophages are pro-fibrotic and contribute to hypertrophic scar formation. A previous study from our lab showed that M2 macrophages were present in developing hypertrophic scar tissues in vivo at 3-4 weeks after wounding. In this study, the effect of systemic macrophage depletion on scar formation was explored at subacute phase of wound healing. Thirty-six athymic nude mice that received human skin transplants were randomly divided into macrophage depletion group and control group. The former received intraperitoneal injections of clodronate liposomes while the controls received sterile saline injections on day 7, 10, and 13 postgrafting. Wound area, scar thickness, collagen abundance and collagen bundle structure, mast cell infiltration, myofibroblast formation, M1, and M2 macrophages together with gene expression of M1 and M2 related factors in the grafted skin were investigated at 2, 4, and 8 weeks postgrafting. The transplanted human skin from the control group developed contracted, elevated, and thickened scars while the grafted skin from the depletion group healed with significant less contraction and elevation. Significant reductions in myofibroblast number, collagen synthesis, and hypertrophic fiber morphology as well as mast cell infiltration were observed in the depletion group compared to the control group. Macrophage depletion significantly reduced M1 and M2 macrophage number in the depletion group 2 weeks postgrafting as compared to the control group. These findings suggest that systemic macrophage depletion in subacute phase of wound healing reduces scar formation, which provides evidence for the pro-fibrotic role of macrophages in fibrosis of human skin as well as insight into the potential benefits of specifically depleting M2 macrophages in vivo.","Zhu, Zhensen; Ding, Jie; Ma, Zengshuan; Iwashina, Takashi; Tredget, Edward E",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,240,1

The viable yellow agouti mouse (Avy) is a powerful epigenetic biosensor model that reports on the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus, which is established prior to the three-germ-layer separation, through the coat color of the animals. Here we show that maternal exposure to rotenone, a potent mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, not only changes the DNA methylation status of the Avy locus in the skin but broadly affects the liver DNA methylome of the offspring. These effects are accompanied by altered gene expression programs that persist throughout life, and which associate with impairment of antioxidant activity and mitochondrial function in aged animals. These pervasive and lasting genomic effects suggest a putative role for mitochondria in regulating life-long gene expression programs through developmental nuclear epigenetic remodeling.","Lozoya, Oswaldo A; Xu, Fuhua; Grenet, Dagoberto; Wang, Tianyuan; Grimm, Sara A; Godfrey, Veronica; Waidyanatha, Suramya; Woychik, Richard P; Santos, Janine H",Cell reports,240,16

Its clinical significance in primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the structure on recurrence of PSP after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) bullectomy. METHODS Between April 2010 and March 2014, 80 cases of PSP in 76 patients who underwent VATS bullectomy using endoscopic staplers were included. The staple line was covered with polyglycolic acid sheets and fibrin glue. Cases were assigned to a normal alveolar structure (NAS) group (n = 54) and a reticulated trabecula-like structure (RT) group (n = 26) based on the histological analysis. Factors associated with recurrence were analysed using logistic regression. RESULTS The reticulated trabecula-like structure was significantly related to apical lung blebs. The recurrence rate of PSP was significantly higher in the RT group than in the NAS group (38.5% vs. 3.7%; P <0.001). On multivariate analysis, the reticulated trabecula-like structure was an independent factor for recurrence of PSP after VATS bullectomy. CONCLUSION The change of alveolar structure at the base of apical lung blebs would increase the risk for recurrence of PSP after VATS bullectomy.","Ota, Hideki; Kawai, Hideki; Kuriyama, Syouji",Annals of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery : official journal of the Association of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeons of Asia,240,1

To overcome these difficulties, some concepts have been introduced, namely, articulating instruments and cross-handed manipulation, which causes the right hand to control the left instrument tip and vice versa. The aim of this study was to compare task performance with different approaches based on a mechanical evaluation platform. METHODS A LESS mechanical evaluation platform was set up to investigate the performance of 2 tasks (suture pass-through rings and clip-cut) with 3 different settings: uncrossed manipulation with straight instruments (group A, the control group), uncrossed manipulation with articulating instruments (group B), and cross-handed manipulation with articulating instruments (group C). The operation time and average load required for accomplishment of the standard tasks were measured. RESULTS Group A presented significantly better time scores than group B, and group C consumed the longest time to accomplish the 2 tasks (P < .05). Comparing of average load required to perform the suture pass-through rings task, it differed significantly between dominant and nondominant hand in all groups (P < .01) and was less in group A and group B than group C in dominant hand (P < .01), while it was almost the same in all groups in the nondominant hand. In terms of average load requirement to accomplish clip-cut task, it was almost equal not only between group A and B but also between dominant and nondominant hand while the increase reached statistical significance when comparing group C with other groups (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Compared with conventional devices and maneuvering techniques, articulating instruments and cross-handed manipulation are associated with longer operation time and higher workload. Instruments with better maneuverability should be developed in the future for LESS.","Xu, An An; Zhu, Jiang Fan; Xie, Xiaofeng; Su, Yuantao",Surgical innovation,240,1

We determined the patency rates of the anterior choroidal artery after placement of flow-diversion devices across its ostium. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed a consecutive series of patients in whom a Pipeline Embolization Device was placed across the ostium of an angiographically visible anterior choroidal artery while treating the target aneurysm. Patency of the anterior choroidal artery after Pipeline Embolization Device placement was determined at immediate postoperative and follow-up angiography. Data on pretreatment aneurysm rupture status, concomitant coiling, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, neurologic status at follow-up, and follow-up MR imaging/CT findings were collected. RESULTS Fifteen patients with 15 treated aneurysms were included in this study. In the immediate postprocedural setting, the anterior choroidal artery was patent on posttreatment angiography for all 15 patients. Of the 14 patients with follow-up angiography at least 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device placement, 1 (7%) had occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery and 14 had a patent anterior choroidal artery (93%). No patients had new neurologic symptoms or stroke related to anterior choroidal artery occlusion at follow-up. Of the 9 patients with follow-up CT or MR imaging, none had infarction in the vascular territory of the anterior choroidal artery. CONCLUSIONS In this small study, placement of a Pipeline Embolization Device across the anterior choroidal artery ostium resulted in occlusion of the artery in only 1 patient. It was not associated with ischemic changes in the distribution of the anterior choroidal artery in any patient.","Brinjikji, W; Kallmes, D F; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G",AJNR.

METHODS Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon guide catheter, were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS Use of the balloon guide catheter during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the formation of large distal emboli with a diameter >1 mm, regardless of the device used (P<0.01). Applying aspiration via the balloon guide catheter in place of the conventional guide catheter resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P<0.0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69.2 ± 27.3 and 45.5 ± 22.8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional guide catheter was used (1.5 versus 1.1). CONCLUSIONS The risk of distal embolization was significantly reduced with the use of the balloon guide catheter.","Chueh, Ju-Yu; Kühn, Anna Luisa; Puri, Ajit S; Wilson, Scott D; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Gounis, Matthew J",Stroke,240,5

Median survival from the time of RFA was 46 months. One-, 2- and 3-year local tumor progression (LTP)-free survival rates were 92%, 77%, and 77%, respectively. RFA offers very good local control in patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a potential, lung function-preserving treatment of colorectal lung metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS Forty-five patients with colorectal pulmonary metastases underwent computed tomography-guided RFA from December 2004 to June 2010. A baseline posttreatment scan was obtained 4-6 weeks after RFA and follow-up imaging studies every 3 months thereafter were obtained and compared to evaluate the tumor progression at site of ablation or elsewhere. The primary end points were LTP-free survival and overall survival from RFA procedure. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the end points. A Cox proportional hazard model with robust inference was used to estimate the associations between baseline factors and survival end points. RESULTS Sixty-nine metastases were ablated in 45 patients. Tumor size ranged from 0.4 to 3.5 cm. The median number of metastases ablated per patient was 1 (range, 1-3). Median follow-up after RFA was 18 months. Median survival from the time of RFA was 46 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.8-47.3). One-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates from the time of RFA were 95% (95% CI, 82%-99%), 72% (95% CI, 52%-85%), and 50% (95% CI, 26%-71%), respectively. Nine of 69 lesions (13%) progressed and 4 were retreated with no progression after second RFA. Median time to progression was not reached. LTP-free survival from RFA was 92% (95% CI, 82%-97%) at 1 year, 77% (95% CI, 58%-88%) at 2 years, and 77% (95% CI, 58%-88%) at 3 years. CONCLUSION Radiofrequency ablation of lung metastases is an effective minimally invasive, parenchymal-sparing technique that has very good local control rates in patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer, with LTP-free survival of 77% at 3 years.","Petre, Elena N; Jia, Xiaoyu; Thornton, Raymond H; Sofocleous, Constantinos T; Alago, William; Kemeny, Nancy E; Solomon, Stephen B",Clinical colorectal cancer,240,17

The ligature/LPS method was used to induce periodontitis in rats. LPS was employed to cause inflammation in Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). The transfections with FGFR1 SiRNA, NLRP3 SiRNA and the selective TLR4 inhibitor TAK242 were used to investigate the mechanism of Fisetin-mediated inflammatory reaction in LPS-induced HGF. As a result, Fisetin reduced the alveolar bone gap, reversed histopathological lesion and inhibited serum inflammatory cytokine concentration in periodontitis rats. Fisetin decreased the inflammatory cytokine contents in the supernatant of LPS-induced HGF. The inhibitory effect of Fisetin might be attributed to FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway both in vivo and in vitro. The suppressions of FGFR1, TLR4 and NLRP3 proved that FGFR1/TLR4/NLRP3 signaling was involved in the Fisetin-mediated inflammatory response. Fisetin also inhibited NLRP3 priming.

DATA SOURCES Data were drawn from the National Association of County & City Health Officials' 2013 National Profile Study (Profile Study) and the Area Health Resources File. LHDs that received module 1 of the Profile Study were asked to describe the level of partnership in MCH, communicable disease prevention, and chronic disease control. Levels of partnership included ""not involved,"" ""networking,"" ""coordinating,"" ""cooperating,"" and ""collaborating,"" with ""collaborating"" as the highest level of partnership. Covariates included both LHD organizational and community factors. Data analyses were conducted using Stata 13 SVY procedures to account for the Profile Study's survey design. RESULTS About 82%, 92%, and 80% of LHDs partnered with other organizations in MCH, communicable disease prevention, and chronic disease control programs, respectively. LHDs having a public health physician on staff were more likely to partner in chronic disease control programs (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-5.25). Larger per capita expenditure was also associated with partnerships in MCH (AOR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.22-4.86) and chronic disease prevention programs (AOR = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.09-2.86).

CONCLUSION About 1 in 5 LHDs did not have any partnerships in chronic disease control. LHD partnerships should be promoted to improve care coordination and utilization of limited health care resources. Factors that might promote LHDs' partnerships include having a public health physician on staff, higher per capita expenditure, and completion of a community health assessment. Community context likely influences types and levels of partnerships.

Under continuous hypercapnia (PaCO2 of 53.17 ± 5.07), CBF was significantly elevated between 15 and 120 min after the start of hypercapnia. During the course of the trial intervention, cardiac output also increased significantly. To assess the direct effect of hypercapnia on brain perfusion, the increase of CBF was corrected by the parallel increase of cardiac output. The maximum direct CBF enhancing effect of hypercapnia of 32% was noted at 45 min after the start of hypercapnia. Thereafter, the CBF enhancing slowly declined. No relevant adverse effects were observed. CBF and StiO2 reproducibly increased by controlled hypercapnia in all patients. After 45 min, the curve of CBF enhancement showed an inflection point when corrected by cardiac output. It is concluded that 45 min might be the optimum duration for a therapeutic use and may provide an optimal balance between the benefits of hypercapnia and risks of a negative rebound effect after return to normal ventilation parameters.Trial registration: The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (AZ 230/14) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Trial-ID: NCT01799525).

109374,109374,109374,The clinical sensitivity of a single SARS-CoV-2 upper respiratory tract RT-PCR test for diagnosing COVID-19 using convalescent antibody as a comparator.,12.934147,10.280491,2020-09-11,"Importance During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the general public has been advised to wear masks or improvised face coverings to limit transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, there has been considerable confusion and disagreement regarding the degree to which masks protect the wearer from airborne particles. Objectives To evaluate the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of various consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks that are intended to improve mask fit or comfort. Design, Setting, and Participants For this study conducted in a research laboratory between June and August 2020, 7 consumer-grade masks and 5 medical procedure mask modifications were fitted on an adult male volunteer, and FFE measurements were collected during a series of repeated movements of the torso, head, and facial muscles as outlined by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Quantitative Fit Testing Protocol. The consumer-grade masks tested included (1) a 2-layer woven nylon mask with ear loops that was tested with an optional aluminum nose bridge and nonwoven filter insert in place, (2) a cotton bandana folded diagonally once (ie, ""bandit"" style) or in a (3) multilayer rectangle according to the instructions presented by the US Surgeon General, (4) a single-layer woven polyester/nylon mask with ties, (5) a nonwoven polypropylene mask with fixed ear loops, (6) a single-layer woven polyester gaiter/neck cover balaclava bandana, and (7) a 3-layer woven cotton mask with ear loops. Medical procedure mask modifications included (1) tying the mask's ear loops and tucking in the side pleats, (2) fastening ear loops behind the head with 3-dimensional-printed ear guards, (3) fastening ear loops behind the head with a claw-type hair clip, (4) enhancing the mask/face seal with rubber bands over the mask, and (5) enhancing the mask/face seal with a band of nylon hosiery over the fitted mask. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary study outcome was the measured FFE of common consumer-grade and improvised face masks, as well as several popular modifications of medical procedure masks. Results The mean (SD) FFE of consumer grade masks tested on 1 adult male with no beard ranged from 79.0% (4.3%) to 26.5% (10.5%), with the 2-layer woven nylon mask having the highest FFE. Unmodified medical procedure masks with ear loops had a mean (SD) FFE of 38.5% (11.2%). All modifications evaluated in this study increased procedure mask FFE (range [SD], 60.3% [11.1%] to 80.2% [3.1%]), with a nylon hosiery sleeve placed over the procedure mask producing the greatest improvement. Conclusions and Relevance While modifications to improve medical procedure mask fit can enhance the filtering capability and reduce inhalation of airborne particles, this study demonstrates that the FFEs of consumer-grade masks available to the public are, in many cases, nearly equivalent to or better than their non-N95 respirator medical mask counterparts.","Clapp, Phillip W; Sickbert-Bennett, Emily E; Samet, James M; Berntsen, Jon; Zeman, Kirby L; Anderson, Deverick J; Weber, David J; Bennett, William D",JAMA internal medicine,240,1

In this study, 24 goat diarrheic fecal samples were collected from 3 farms in Sichuan province, China, and 87.5% (21/24) samples were detected as CKoV positive by RT-PCR. Meanwhile, full-length VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes were simultaneously cloned from 17 clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all CKoV strains were most closely related to porcine kobuvirus based on amino acid (aa) sequences of VP0 and VP3 proteins, but CKoV strains were closely related to with Aichivirus B strains (ferret, bovine, and sheep kobuvirus) based on aa sequences of the VP1 protein. Interestingly, compared with known CKoV strains in the GenBank database, Chinese CKoV strains have unique amino acid changes in VP0 and VP1 proteins. Moreover, the first Chinese CKoV nearly complete genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named SWUN/F11/2019. Compared with the two known CKoV strains, five aa mutations (S60A, L252I, V267T, I, V 306 L, V331I) were found in the VP0 gene and 7 aa mutations (S57N, G, T243A, V244I, T, A248V, L, S251A, R252H, and M255L) were found in VP1 in the SWUN/F11/2019 genome. This was the first report of the detection and molecular characteristics of CKoV from goats in China, which could be helpful for improving the understanding of the prevalence and genetic evolution of CKoV.","Abi, Keha-Mo; Zhang, Qi; Jing, Zhi Zhong; Tang, Cheng","Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",240,16

To evaluate the potential for implant-derived Co toxicity, we examined the relationship between serum Co (sCo) and erythrocyte counts (ERY) in a metal-containing total-hip arthroplasty implant population. METHODS Retrospective review of sCo concentrations identified 77 patients with concomitant ERY. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in ERY for patients divided into clinically relevant sCo ranges. A single detailed case review of a patient with a loose mal-positioned acetabular component and significantly elevated sCo was also performed for symptoms thought to arise from Co toxicity. RESULTS Statistical difference in ERY was not observed between patients with significantly elevated (>10 ng/mL), elevated (4-10 ng/mL), modestly elevated (1.0-3.9 ng/mL), or normal (<1.0 ng/mL) sCo. While the detailed case report was unremarkable for any of the clinical symptoms previously reported to be associated with Co toxicity and no increase in ERY was observed, this patient's sCo was 84 ng/mL. CONCLUSIONS Increased erythropoiesis was not observed in patients with implant-derived increased sCo. Even with a sCo 100 × the upper-limit of normal, the patient presented did not have increased ERY nor exhibit any symptoms ascribed with Co toxicity.","Tolan, Nicole V; Sierra, Rafael J; Moyer, Thomas P",Clinical biochemistry,240,31

Infancy, in particular, is a time of increased disease susceptibility and severity. Early-life viral infection causes acute illness and can be associated with the development of wheezing and asthma in later life. The most commonly detected viruses are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), and influenza virus. In this review we explore the complete picture from epidemiology and virology to clinical impact and immunology. Three striking aspects emerge. The first is the degree of similarity: although the infecting viruses are all different, the clinical outcome, viral evasion strategies, immune response, and long-term sequelae share many common features. The second is the interplay between the infant immune system and viral infection: the immaturity of the infant immune system alters the outcome of viral infection, but at the same time, viral infection shapes the development of the infant immune system and its future responses. Finally, both the virus and the immune response contribute to damage to the lungs and subsequent disease, and therefore, any prevention or treatment needs to address both of these factors.","Tregoning, John S; Schwarze, Jürgen",Clinical microbiology reviews,240,24

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of LATG in terms of long-term survival and morbidity. METHODS A case-control study was conducted on 100 cases of LATG and 348 cases of open total gastrectomy (OTG) performed for treating clinical stage I (cT1N0, cT1N1, and cT2N0) gastric cancer from August 2003 to December 2008 at the National Cancer Center of Korea. The clinicopathological characteristics, surgical outcomes, and complications were compared between the LATG and OTG groups. The overall survival rate and disease-free survival rate were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model for multivariate analysis. RESULTS The rate of postoperative complications was 27 %, the most common being anastomotic stenosis from LATG (9 %). There were no significant differences in surgical outcomes and complications between the LATG and OTG groups except for a longer operating time for LATG. Survival rates were also similar between groups; the hazard ratio of LATG versus OTG was 0.43 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.15-1.20; p = 0.107) for overall survival and 0.47 (95 % CI = 0.19-1.18; p = 0.106) for disease-free survival.

The acute neuroinflammatory response includes the activation of resident tissue macrophages in the CNS and the subsequent release of various cytokines and chemokines, which probably activates oxidative stress, causing long-term neuronal damage. This makes urgent the search for drugs with indirect anti-inflammatory effects with proven effectiveness. From this point of view, it is worth further studying the treatment of patients with COVID-19 with dipyridamole, which, with its antiviral activity and anti-inflammatory effect, inhibiting acute inflammation and progressive fibrosis, is the drug of choice, especially for patients with early signs of elevated D-dimer concentrations and pronounced clinical symptoms of microangiopathy.","Putilina, M V; Grishin, D V",Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

After initial ELISA optimization, diagnostic sensitivity (DSn) and specificity (DSp) for the linear peptides were determined using receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. The peptide IBVP1 showed 90.44% DSn and 88.64% DSp at ROC cut off 22.8% while IBVP2 showed 88.24% DSn and 85.23% DSp at ROC cut off 23.05%. The multimerization of linear peptides to MAP design resulted in the improvement of the diagnostic efficiency up to 94.85% DSn and 92.05% DSp for IBVM1 with 19.95% cut off. A similar improvement in the performance was also observed with 92.65% DSn and 90.91% DSp for IBVM2 at 20.72% cut off. All the peptides were tested for diagnostic specificity and did not show the cross-reactivity with Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus positive serum samples. In addition, repeatability testing for all linear and multimeric peptide showed that the coefficient of variation for intra-assay was within the expected limits, ranging from 2.4 to 10.4% and inter-assay coefficient of variation was ranging from 5.56 to 14.3%. In a nutshell, the present study used predicted B cell epitope, the synthetic peptide in linear and multimeric design for IBV antibody detection. The study also highlights peptide antigen with modified scaffold design could be a safe alternative to whole virion-based ELISA for IBV antibody detection.","Verma, Vikas; Joshi, Vinay G; Ranjan, Puneet; Tomar, Piyush; Chhabra, Rajesh; Mahajan, N K; Goel, Parveen",3 Biotech,240,1

How viroplasms form remains unknown. We previously found two forms of NSP2 in RV-infected cells: a cytoplasmically dispersed dNSP2, which interacts with hypophosphorylated NSP5; and a viroplasm-specific vNSP2, which interacts with hyperphosphorylated NSP5. Other studies report that CK1α, a ubiquitous cellular kinase, hyperphosphorylates NSP5, but requires NSP2 for reasons that are unclear. Here we show that silencing CK1α in cells before RV infection resulted in (i) >90% decrease in RV replication, (ii) disrupted vNSP2 and NSP5 interaction, (iii) dispersion of vNSP2 throughout the cytoplasm, and (iv) reduced vNSP2 protein levels. Together, these data indicate that CK1α directly affects NSP2. Accordingly, an in vitro kinase assay showed that CK1α phosphorylates serine 313 of NSP2 and triggers NSP2 octamers to form a lattice structure as demonstrated by crystallographic analysis. Additionally, a dual-specificity autokinase activity for NSP2 was identified and confirmed by mass spectrometry. Together, our studies show that phosphorylation of NSP2 involving CK1α controls viroplasm assembly. Considering that CK1α plays a role in the replication of other RNA viruses, similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms may exist for other virus pathogens that require cytoplasmic virus factories for replication.","Criglar, Jeanette M; Anish, Ramakrishnan; Hu, Liya; Crawford, Sue E; Sankaran, Banumathi; Prasad, B V Venkataram; Estes, Mary K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,240,1

METHODS This was a prospective, longitudinal observational study. Adult patients with HNC undergoing RT between March 2017 and August 2018 were recruited. Patients' body compositions were evaluated by bioelectrical impedance analysis, and dietary intake was recorded by 24-hour dietary recall at three time points, including baseline (T1), mid-treatment (T2) and post-treatment (T3). Patients were divided into low, middle and high energy intake groups based on the average daily energy intake (DEI). Changes in body weight (BW), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) among these three groups were compared. RESULTS From T1 to T3, the median loss of patients' BW, FM, FFM and SMM was 4.60, 1.90, 2.60 and 1.50 kg, respectively. The loss of BW was more dramatic from T2 to T3 than that from T1 to T2. BW loss was mainly contributed by SMM loss from T1 to T2 and by FM loss from T2 to T3. Meanwhile, patients' dietary intake reduced during treatment. High DEI group had a significantly attenuated loss of patients' BW, FFM, SMM and FM compared with the low DEI group. CONCLUSION Patients' BW, FM, FFM and SMM all significantly reduced, especially from T2 to T3, with decreased DEI during RT, which stresses the importance of nutrition intervention during the whole course of RT.","Zhuang, Bing; Zhang, Lichuan; Wang, Yujie; Cao, Yiwei; Shih, Yian; Jin, Sanli; Li, Hongmei; Gong, Liqing; Wang, Yanli; Jin, Shuai; Lu, Qian",BMJ supportive & palliative care,240,24

Published literature primarily offers a retrospective view of experience, with few studies examining and understanding the individual lived experience of practitioners prospectively. This study explores paramedics' lived experience of emergency preparedness and applies that learning. METHODS Thirteen paramedics were recruited through purposive sampling. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews explored their individual experiences of emergency preparedness, in line with the idiographic focus of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. RESULTS Through data analysis, the following superordinate themes were identified for further discussion: self-determination, control, and experience-based practice. Participants appeared to value their role and the unpredictable environment in which they worked. Personal resilience, an area that they suggested is not covered effectively within individual preparation, was viewed as important. The participants articulated that risk, threat, uncertainty, safety, trust, and control were important concepts within individual preparedness. These paramedics valued practice-based knowledge and education as credible and transferrable to their clinical work. CONCLUSION Evidence from this study suggests that standard emergency preparedness, with the focus at organizational level, is not sufficient for the individual workers or for an overall effective response. Dimensions of individual preparedness are presented, with the paramedic central to the experience within a conceptual model (the DiEP model), creating a new form of emergency preparedness that reflects the individual paramedic's experience.","Day, Alison; Staniszewska, Sophie; Bullock, Ian",Journal of emergency nursing,240,11

It is important to determine the performance of such systems in specific patient populations. We aimed to validate and determine within-day reliability of an IMU system for measuring lower limb gait kinematics and temporal-spatial parameters (TSP) in people with and without HIV. METHODS Gait was recorded in eight adults with HIV (PLHIV) and eight HIV-seronegative participants (SNP), using IMUs and optical motion capture (OMC) simultaneously. Participants performed six gait trials. Fifteen TSP and 28 kinematic angles were extracted. Intraclass correlations (ICC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error and Bland-Altman analyses were used to assess concurrent validity of the IMU system (relative to OMC) separately in PLHIV and SNP. IMU reliability was assessed during within-session retest of trials. ICCs were used to assess relative reliability. Standard error of measurement (SEM) and percentage SEM were used to assess absolute reliability. RESULTS Between-system TSP differences demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent ICCs (0.71-0.99), except for double support time and temporophasic parameters (< 0.60). All TSP demonstrated good mean absolute percentage errors (≤7.40%). For kinematics, ICCs were acceptable to excellent (0.75-1.00) for all but three range of motion (ROM) and four discrete angles. RMSE and bias were 0.0°-4.7° for all but two ROM and 10 discrete angles. In both groups, TSP reliability was acceptable to excellent for relative (ICC 0.75-0.99) (except for one temporal and two temporophasic parameters) and absolute (%SEM 1.58-15.23) values. Reliability trends of IMU-measured kinematics were similar between groups and demonstrated acceptable-to-excellent relative reliability (ICC 0.76-0.99) and clinically acceptable absolute reliability (SEM 0.7°-4.4°) for all but two and three discrete angles, respectively. Both systems demonstrated similar magnitude and directional trends for differences when comparing the gait of PLHIV with that of SNP. CONCLUSIONS IMU-based gait analysis is valid and reliable when applied in PLHIV; demonstrating a sufficiently low precision error to be used for clinical interpretation (< 5° for most kinematics; < 20% for TSP). IMU-based gait analysis is sensitive to subtle gait deviations that may occur in PLHIV.","Berner, Karina; Cockcroft, John; Louw, Quinette",Biomedical engineering online,240,1

Surgery can be done by thoracic and abdominal approaches. In emergency cases, mostly performed by abdominal approach. The use of mesh to close the defect is currently emerging as a viable option. PRESENTATION OF CASE We report a case of 70-year-old woman with complaints of shortness of breath and abdominal pain. The patient had a history of laparoscopic surgery with the installation of an anti-adhesive mesh for diaphragmatic hernia seven months before admission. Chest X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) scan found recurrence of diaphragmatic hernia. The patient then received laparotomy showing diaphragmatic hernia with contents in the form of transverse colon, ileum, gastric and omentum. The self-attached mesh was placed on the supra-diaphragm with abdominal approach. The patient was hospitalised four days after surgery. At two weeks and six months follow-up, no complaints were found. CT scan and chest X-ray were within normal limits. DISCUSSION We did a modified technique in managing the recurrence and adhesion of the diaphragmatic hernia using the hernia mesh attached onto the superior side of the diaphragm to minimise the complications and recurrences.

Anxiety disorders may be associated with decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to review and meta-analyze studies estimating associations between anxiety and ART adherence in LMICs. We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL and EMBASE for relevant studies published before July 18, 2018. We defined anxiety as reported anxiety scores from screening questionnaires or having a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and poor ART adherence as missed doses, poor visit attendance, or scores from structured adherence questionnaires. We used a random effects model to conduct a meta-analysis for calculating a pooled odds ratio, and conducted sensitivity analyses by time on ART, anxiety evaluation method, and study region. From 472 screened manuscripts, thirteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Eleven studies were included in the meta-analysis. PLHIV who reported anxiety had 59% higher odds of poor ART adherence compared with those who did not report anxiety disorder (pooled odds ratio [pOR]: 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.96, p < 0.001). When excluding PLHIV who initiated ART within 6 months, reported anxiety remained strongly associated with poor ART adherence (pOR: 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.20, p = 0.003). Among PLHIV in LMICs, reported anxiety was associated with poor ART adherence. This association persisted after the ART initiation period. Increased resources for mental health may be important for achieving virologic suppression in LMICs.","Wykowski, James; Kemp, Christopher G; Velloza, Jennifer; Rao, Deepa; Drain, Paul K",AIDS and behavior,240,1

This study tested the hypothesis of alterations in levels of fecal eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (F-EDN) and eosinophil density and degranulation within the colonic mucosa of IBS patients compared with healthy controls (HC). Colonic biopsies were collected from 37 IBS patients and 20 HC and analyzed for eosinophil numbers and local degranulation of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) by histologic procedures. Fecal samples were collected for F-EDN and microbiota analysis. Differentiated 15HL-60 cells were used in vitro to investigate the direct effect of live bacteria on eosinophil activation measured by a colorimetric assay with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) substrate. We observed a higher number of eosinophils and increased extracellular ECP in the mucosa of IBS patients compared with HC. Moreover, F-EDN levels in IBS samples were elevated compared with HC and positively correlated to extracellular ECP. Metagenomic analysis showed significant correlations between bacterial composition and eosinophil measurements in both HC and IBS patients. In vitro experiments revealed an increased degranulation of 15HL-60 after stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, and Yersinia enterocolitica. To conclude, we could demonstrate alterations related to eosinophils in IBS, and, for the first time, a positive correlation between F-EDN levels and degranulated eosinophils in the colonic mucosa of IBS patients. Together our results suggest that eosinophils play a role in the pathophysiology of IBS and the mechanisms might be linked to an altered microbiota.","Casado-Bedmar, Maite; de-Faria, Felipe Meira; Biskou, Olga; Lindqvist, Carl Mårten; Ranasinghe, Purnika Damindi; Bednarska, Olga; Peterson, Christer; Walter, Susanna A; Carlson, Marie; Keita, Åsa V",Journal of leukocyte biology,240,8

We estimated the incidence of bacterial co-infection and secondary infection in COVID-19 using clinical diagnoses to determine how frequently antibiotics are administered when bacterial infection is absent. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of inpatients with COVID-19 present on admission to hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database between April - June 2020. Bacterial infections were defined using ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes and associated ""present on admission"" coding. Co-infections were defined by bacterial infection present on admission, while secondary infections were defined by bacterial infection that developed after admission. Co-infection and secondary infection were not mutually exclusive. Results: 18.5% of 64,961 COVID-19 patients (n=12,040) presented with bacterial infection at admission, 3.8% (n=2,506) developed secondary infection after admission, and 0.9% (n=574) had both. 76.3% (n=49,551) received an antibiotic while hospitalized, including 71% of patients who had no diagnosis of bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infection occurred in 5.7% patients receiving steroids in the first 2 days of hospitalization, 9.9% receiving tocilizumab in the first 2 days of hospitalization, and 10.3% patients receiving both. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, bacterial co-infection (aRR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.11 - 1.20) and secondary infection (aRR 1.93; 95% CI, 1.82 - 2.04) were both independently associated with increased mortality. Conclusions: Though 1 in 5 inpatients with COVID-19 present with bacterial infection, secondary infections in the hospital are uncommon. Most inpatients with COVID-19 receive antibiotic therapy, including 71% of those not diagnosed with bacterial infection.","Baghdadi, Jonathan D; Coffey, K C; Adediran, Timileyin; Goodman, Katherine E; Pineles, Lisa; Magder, Larry S; O'Hara, Lyndsay M; Pineles, Beth L; Nadimpalli, Gita; Morgan, Daniel J; Harris, Anthony D",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,240,5

There is no reliable diagnostic test for LPR as there is for GERD. We hypothesized that detection of pepsin (a molecule only made in the stomach) in laryngeal epithelium or sputum should provide evidence for reflux of gastric contents to the larynx, and be diagnostic of LPR. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective study in patients with LPR symptoms undergoing antireflux surgery (ARS). METHODS Nine patients undergoing ARS for LPR symptoms were studied pre- and postoperatively using a clinical symptom questionnaire, laryngoscopy, 24-h pH monitoring, biopsy of posterior laryngeal mucosa, and sputum collection for pepsin Western blot assay. RESULTS The primary presenting LPR symptom was hoarseness in six, cough in two, and globus sensation in one patient. Pepsin was detected in the laryngeal mucosa in eight of nine patients preoperatively. There was correlation between biopsy and sputum (+/+ or -/-) in four of five patients, both analyzed preoperatively. Postoperatively, pH monitoring improved in all but one patient and normalized in five of eight patients. Eight of nine patients reported improvement in their primary LPR symptom (six good, two mild). Only one patient (who had negative preoperative pepsin) reported no response to treatment of the primary LPR symptom. Postoperatively, pepsin was detected in only one patient. CONCLUSIONS Pepsin is often found on laryngeal epithelial biopsy and in sputum of patients with pH-test-proven GERD and symptoms of LPR. ARS improves symptoms and clears pepsin from the upper airway. Detection of pepsin improves diagnostic accuracy in patients with LPR.","Wassenaar, Eelco; Johnston, Nikki; Merati, Albert; Montenovo, Martin; Petersen, Rebecca; Tatum, Roger; Pellegrini, Carlos; Oelschlager, Brant",Surgical endoscopy,240,1

An essential packaging signal component of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) has been further delimited to the first 598 nucleotides (nt) from the 5' end of its RNA genome, by using recombinant viruses transcribing subgenomic mRNA that included potential packaging signals. The integrity of the entire sequence domain was necessary because deletion of any of the five structural motifs defined within this region abrogated specific packaging of this viral RNA. One of these RNA motifs was the stem-loop SL5, a highly conserved motif in coronaviruses located at nucleotide positions 106 to 136. Partial deletion or point mutations within this motif also abrogated packaging. Using TGEV-derived defective minigenomes replicated in trans by a helper virus, we have shown that TGEV RNA packaging is a replication-independent process. Furthermore, the last 494 nt of the genomic 3' end were not essential for packaging, although this region increased packaging efficiency. TGEV RNA sequences identified as necessary for viral genome packaging were not sufficient to direct packaging of a heterologous sequence derived from the green fluorescent protein gene. These results indicated that TGEV genome packaging is a complex process involving many factors in addition to the identified RNA packaging signal. The identification of well-defined RNA motifs within the TGEV RNA genome that are essential for packaging will be useful for designing packaging-deficient biosafe coronavirus-derived vectors and providing new targets for antiviral therapies.","Morales, Lucia; Mateos-Gomez, Pedro A; Capiscol, Carmen; del Palacio, Lorena; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,240,6

However, SRS has limited sensitivity for this purpose. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC has a higher rate of sporadic dpNETs detection than SRS but there is little data for dpNETs detection in MEN1. PURPOSE To compare the performances of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) to diagnose dpNETs in MEN1. DESIGN AND SETTING Single-institution prospective comparative study PATIENTS AND METHODS Nineteen consecutive MEN1 patients (aged 47 ± 13 years) underwent (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS, and CE-CT within 2 months in random order. Blinded readings of images were performed separately by experienced physicians. Unblinded analysis of CE-CT, combined with additional magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic-ultrasound, (18)F-2-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT or histopathology results served as reference standard for dpNETs diagnosis. RESULTS The sensitivity of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT, SRS, and CE-CT was 76, 20, and 60 %, respectively (p < 0.0001). All the true-positive lesions detected by SRS were also depicted on (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT. (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT detected lesions of smaller size than SRS (10.7 ± 7.6 and 15.2 ± 5.9 mm, respectively, p < 0.03). False negatives of (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT included small dpNETs (<10 mm) and (18)F-FDG PET/CT positive aggressive dpNETs. No false positives were recorded. In addition, whole-body mapping with (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT identified extra-abdominal MEN1-related tumors including one neuroendocrine thymic carcinoma identified by the three imaging procedures, one bronchial carcinoid undetected by CE-CT and three meningiomas undetected by SRS. CONCLUSIONS Owing to higher diagnostic performance, (68)Ga-DOTA-TOC PET/CT (or alternative (68)Ga-labeled somatostatin analogues) should replace (111)In-pentetreotide in the investigation of MEN1 patients.","Morgat, Clément; Vélayoudom-Céphise, Fritz-Line; Schwartz, Paul; Guyot, Martine; Gaye, Delphine; Vimont, Delphine; Schulz, Jürgen; Mazère, Joachim; Nunes, Marie-Laure; Smith, Denis; Hindié, Elif; Fernandez, Philippe; Tabarin, Antoine",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,240,1

Although online health communities are helpful platforms for obtaining non-professional opinions, they pose risks in communicating unreliable and insufficient information in terms of quality and quantity. Existing methods in extracting user-reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in online health forums are not only insufficiently accurate as they disregard user credibility and drug experience, but are also expensive as they rely on supervised ground truth annotation of individual statement. We propose a NEural ArchiTecture for Drug side effect prediction (NEAT), which is optimized on the task of drug side effect discovery based on a complete discussion while being attentive to user credibility and experience, thus, addressing the mentioned shortcomings. We train our neural model in a self-supervised fashion using ground truth drug side effects from mayoclinic.org. NEAT learns to assign each user a score that is descriptive of their credibility and highlights the critical textual segments of their post. RESULTS Experiments show that NEAT improves drug side effect discovery from online health discussion by 3.04% from user-credibility agnostic baselines, and by 9.94% from non-neural baselines in term of F1. Additionally, the latent credibility scores learned by the model correlate well with trustworthiness signals, such as the number of ""thanks"" received by other forum members, and improve credibility heuristics such as number of posts by 0.113 in term of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Experience-based self-supervised attention highlights critical phrases such as mentioned side effects, and enhances fully supervised ADR extraction models based on sequence labelling by 5.502% in terms of precision. CONCLUSIONS NEAT considers both user credibility and experience in online health forums, making feasible a self-supervised approach to side effect prediction for mentioned drugs. The derived user credibility and attention mechanism are transferable and improve downstream ADR extraction models. Our approach enhances automatic drug side effect discovery and fosters research in several domains including pharmacovigilance and clinical studies.","Nguyen, Van-Hoang; Sugiyama, Kazunari; Kan, Min-Yen; Halder, Kishaloy",Journal of biomedical semantics,240,1

This study examines the course of MHC from childhood to adolescence and patterning by gender and disadvantage, in Australian and UK contexts. METHODS Data: Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n=4983) and the Millennium Cohort Study (n=18 296). Measures: A measure capturing key aspects of MHC was derived summing items from the parent-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, assessed at 4-5 years, 6-7 years, 10-11 years and 14-15 years. Analysis: Proportions of children with high MHC (scores ≥23 of range 8-24) were estimated by age and country. Random-effects models were used to define MHC trajectories according to baseline MHC and change over time. Sociodemographic patterns were described. RESULTS The prevalence of high MHC steadily increased from 4 years to 15 years (from 13.6% to 15.8% and 20.6% to 26.2% in Australia and the UK, respectively). Examination of trajectories revealed that pathways of some children diverge from this normative MHC progression. For example, 7% and 9% of children in Australia and the UK, respectively, had a low starting point and decreased further in MHC by mid-adolescence. At all ages, and over time, MHC was lower for boys compared with girls and for children from disadvantaged compared with advantaged family backgrounds. CONCLUSIONS Approaches to promoting MHC require a sustained focus from the early years through to adolescence, with more intensive approaches likely needed to support disadvantaged groups and boys.","O'Connor, Meredith; Arnup, Sarah J; Mensah, Fiona; Olsson, Craig; Goldfeld, Sharon; Viner, Russell M; Hope, Steven",Journal of epidemiology and community health,240,7

Gene targeting to generate constitutive or conditional loss of function knockouts remains cost and labor intensive, as well as time consuming. Adding to these challenges, retina expressed genes may have essential roles outside the retina leading to unintended confounds when using a knockout approach. Furthermore, the ability to ectopically express a gene in a gain of function experiment can be extremely valuable when attempting to identify a role in cell fate specification and/or terminal differentiation. We present a method for the rapid and efficient incorporation of DNA plasmids into the neonatal mouse retina by electroporation. The application of short electrical impulses above a certain field strength results in a transient increase in plasma membrane permeability, facilitating the transfer of material across the membrane (1,2,3,4). Groundbreaking work demonstrated that electroporation could be utilized as a method of gene transfer into mammalian cells by inducing the formation of hydrophilic plasma membrane pores allowing the passage of highly charged DNA through the lipid bilayer (5). Continuous technical development has resulted in the viability of electroporation as a method for in vivo gene transfer in multiple mouse tissues including the retina, the method for which is described herein (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). DNA solution is injected into the subretinal space so that DNA is placed between the retinal pigmented epithelium and retina of the neonatal (P0) mouse and electrical pulses are applied using a tweezer electrode. The lateral placement of the eyes in the mouse allows for the easy orientation of the tweezer electrode to the necessary negative pole-DNA-retina-positive pole alignment. Extensive incorporation and expression of transferred genes can be identified by postnatal day 2 (P2). Due to the lack of significant lateral migration of cells in the retina, electroporated and non-electroporated regions are generated. Non-electroporated regions may serve as internal histological controls where appropriate. Retinal electroporation can be used to express a gene under a ubiquitous promoter, such as CAG, or to disrupt gene function using shRNA constructs or Cre-recombinase. More targeted expression can be achieved by designing constructs with cell specific gene promoters. Visualization of electroporated cells is achieved using bicistronic constructs expressing GFP or by co-electroporating a GFP expression construct. Furthermore, multiple constructs may be electroporated for the study of combinatorial gene effects or simultaneous gain and loss of function of different genes. Retinal electroporation may also be utilized for the analysis of genomic cis-regulatory elements by generating appropriate expression constructs and deletion mutants. Such experiments can be used to identify cis-regulatory regions sufficient or required for cell specific gene expression (11). Potential experiments are limited only by construct availability.","de Melo, Jimmy; Blackshaw, Seth",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,240,33

Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors have excellent safety and immunogenicity records, but their behavior in human cell cultures remains only partly characterized. We studied here various virological and immunological aspects of the interactions of MVA-HIV, a vaccine candidate developed by the French National Agency for AIDS Research (ANRS), with primary human cells. We report that MVA-HIV infects and drives Gag expression in primary macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and epithelial and muscle cells. MVA-HIV-infected DCs matured, efficiently presented Gag, Pol, and Nef antigens, and activated HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). As expected with this type of vector, infection was cytopathic and led to DC apoptosis. Coculture of MVA-HIV-infected epithelial cells or myotubes with DCs promoted efficient Gag antigen major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) cross-presentation without inducing direct infection and death of DCs. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) infected with MVA-HIV also activated HIV-specific CD4(+) T cells. Moreover, exposure of DCs to MVA-HIV or to MVA-HIV-infected myotubes induced type I interferon (IFN) production and inhibited subsequent HIV replication and transfer to lymphocytes. Altogether, these results show that MVA-HIV promotes efficient MHC-I and MHC-II presentation of HIV antigens by APCs without facilitating HIV replication. Deciphering the immune responses to MVA in culture experiments will help in the design of innovative vaccine strategies.","Brandler, Samantha; Lepelley, Alice; Desdouits, Marion; Guivel-Benhassine, Florence; Ceccaldi, Pierre-Emmanuel; Lévy, Yves; Schwartz, Olivier; Moris, Arnaud",Journal of virology,240,1

This immunity can be due to vaccination or to the recovery post-disease. Effective herd immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection has several hurdles upon achievement. Herd immunity cannot be obtained concomitantly in many geographical areas because the areas have different population density and the societal measures to contain the spreading are different. A proportion of 50-66% of the population needs to be immunized naturally or artificially in this SARS-Cov2 pandemic and this percentage is not easily achievable.

Epitope stability, another issue to be solved when achieving herd immunity, is important. Mutation in the viral structure will call upon other sets of neutralizing antibodies and hence for other herd immunity type installment. The societal tactics to achieve the much-needed herd immunity should be developed keeping in mind the welfare of the population. Without being exhaustive, throughout our paper we will elaborate on each of the hurdles encountered in developing herd immunity to SARS-Cov2 infection.","Neagu, Monica",Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,240,7

Because this geriatric animal was considered postreproductive, oral contraception had been discontinued. Sequential transabdominal ultrasound evaluations were performed under voluntary behavior and revealed that the uterus contained a mass of heterogenous tissue which was rapidly increasing in size. Due to a lack of normal fetal development and the ultrasonographic appearance of the uterine tissue, a molar pregnancy was suspected. Ovariohysterectomy was performed, and a complete hydatidiform mole was confirmed through human chorionic gonadotropin levels as well as gross and histological examination of the uterus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a complete molar pregnancy has been reported antemortem in a nonhuman great ape, although a single case of partial hydatidiform mole was previously documented in a chimpanzee on postmortem examination. This case describes the successful medical and surgical management of complete molar pregnancy in a bonobo and provides support for extending the age range of birth control recommendations in geriatric captive great apes that exhibit active breeding behavior.","Persky, Meredith E; Jafarey, Yousuf S; Moegenburg, Tracy A; Laubscher, Annette; Lasser, Michael J; Clyde, Victoria L; Garner, Michael M",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,240,19

These emerging therapeutics can modulate the immune response, reduce epithelial injury, target endothelial and vascular dysfunction, have anticoagulant effects, and enhance ARDS resolution. RECENT FINDINGS Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy shows promise in earlier phase clinical testing, whereas a number of issues regarding clinical translation, such as donor and effect variability, are currently being optimized to enable larger scale clinical trials. Furthermore, a number of promising mesenchymal stromal cell therapy clinical studies for COVID-19-induced ARDS are underway. Recent studies provide support for several emerging ARDS pharmacotherapies, including steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons, and carbon monoxide. The history of unsuccessful clinical trials of potential therapies highlights the challenges to successful translation for this heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Given this, attention has focused on the potential to identify biologically homogenous subtypes within ARDS, to enable us to target more specific therapies, i.e. 'precision medicines'. SUMMARY Mesenchymal stromal cells, steroids, statins, vitamins, anticoagulants, interferons and carbon monoxide have therapeutic promise for ARDS.

METHODS Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly divided into three groups; lower extremity ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 2), renal ischemia-reperfusion group (Group 3) and control (anesthesia and median laparotomy only) (Group 1). In group 3, 1-h ischemia was performed on the kidney and in group 2, 1-h ischemia was performed on the left lower extremity. This procedure was followed by reperfusion for 24 h. Renal tissues were removed after the reperfusion period and the groups were evaluated for glutathioneperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde and GSH levels, and furthermore, their histolopathological scores were calculated. RESULTS Renal malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in Group 2 and Group 3 than they were in the Control group. There was no significant difference in renal malondialdehyde levels between Group 2 and Group 3. Kidney glutathione (GSH) levels were statistically lower in Group 2 and Group 3 than in the Control group. No statistically significant difference was found between Group 2 and Group 3 regarding their GSH levels. In histological evaluation, there was no statistically significant difference between Group 2 and Group 3 in terms of kidney damage score. CONCLUSIONS This study has identified that lower extremity ischemia induces remote kidney damage with similar features to kidney injury, occurring after direct kidney ischemia-reperfusion.","Eygi, Bortecin; Gokalp, Orhan; Kiray, Muge; Iscan, Sahin; Gokalp, Gamze; Demirbas, Bahar; Yesilkaya, Nihan; Iner, Hasan; Gür, Mehmet S; Besir, Yuksel; Yilik, Levent; Gurbuz, Ali",Vascular,240,11

In this cross-sectional comparative study, our objective is to compare the depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors with a control group. METHOD 69 elderly COVID-19 survivors (age 65 or older) within 2 weeks post-discharge were assessed for anxiety and depression symptoms by a package of self-rating scales (Geriatric Anxiety Scale-10 (GAS-10), Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15) and General Health Questionar-28 (GHQ-28)). Their scores were compared with a group of aged-matched residents without COVID-19 in their community. RESULTS The mean scores on GAS-10, GDS-15 and GHQ-28 in the COVID-19 survivors group and control group were 12.06 vs. 6.53 (p < .001), 12.48 vs. 5.73 (p < .001), 52.7 vs. 29.8 (p < .001), respectively. All of the COVID-19 survivors and 60% of the controls had scores in the pathological range of GHQ-28 scale. A total of 93.2% of COVID-19 survivors revealed anxiety symptoms in GAS-10 scale. This rate was 60% in the control group. A total of 86.6% of COVID-19 survivors compared to 46.6% of the controls reported symptoms of depression in GDS-15 scale. CONCLUSION The rate of depression and anxiety symptoms in elderly COVID-19 survivors and controls found to be high during the pandemic.

However, it is less well known if stroke lesions in different brain regions are associated with reduced quality of life (QoL). We therefore investigated this association by multivariate lesion-symptom mapping. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging and clinical data from the WAKE-UP trial. European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) 3 level questionnaires were completed 90 days after stroke. Lesion symptom mapping was performed using a multivariate machine learning algorithm (support vector regression) based on stroke lesions 22-36 h after stroke.

Of 503 randomized patients, 329 were included in the analysis (mean age 65.4 years, SD 11.5; median NIHSS = 6, IQR 4-9; median EQ-5D score 90 days after stroke 1, IQR 0-4, median lesion volume 3.3 ml, IQR 1.1-16.9 ml). After controlling for lesion volume, significant associations between lesions and EQ-5D score were detected for the right putamen, and internal capsules of both hemispheres. Multivariate lesion inference analysis revealed an association between injuries of the cortico-spinal tracts with worse self-reported quality of life 90 days after stroke in comparably small stroke lesions, extending previous reports of the association of striato-capsular lesions with worse functional outcome.

High-frequency (100 Hz) triplets of rTMS synchronized to the negative but not the positive peak of the ongoing sensorimotor μ-rhythm isolated with the concurrently acquired electroencephalography (EEG) resulted in a reproducible long-term potentiation like increase of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, an index of corticospinal excitability (Zrenner et al. 2018, Brain Stimul 11:374-389). Here, we analyzed the EEG and TMS-EEG data from (Zrenner et al., 2018) to investigate the effects of μ-rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS on EEG-based measures of cortical excitability. We used resting-state EEG to assess μ- and β-power in the motor cortex ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulation, and single-pulse TMS-evoked and induced EEG responses in the stimulated motor cortex. We found that μ-rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS did not significantly change any of these EEG measures, despite the presence of a significant differential and reproducible effect on MEP amplitude. We conclude that EEG measures of cortical excitability do not reflect corticospinal excitability as measured by MEP amplitude. Most likely this is explained by the fact that rTMS induces complex changes at the molecular and synaptic level towards both excitation and inhibition that cannot be differentiated at the macroscopic level by EEG.","Desideri, Debora; Zrenner, Christoph; Gordon, Pedro Caldana; Ziemann, Ulf; Belardinelli, Paolo",PloS one,240,29

As stated in the FDA PRO Guidance for Medical Product Development (2009), one way to lend meaning and interpretation to such a PRO measure is to dichotomize between values where within-patient changes are considered clinically important and those that are not. But even a PRO scale with a cutoff score that discriminates well between responder and non-responders is fraught with some misclassification. METHODS Using estimates of sensitivity and specificity on classification of responder status from a PRO instrument, formulas are provided to correct for such responder misclassification under the assumption of no treatment misclassification. Two case studies from sexual medicine illustrate the methodology. RESULTS Adjustment formulas on cell counts for responder misclassification are a direct extension of correction formulas for misclassification on disease from a two-way cross-classification table of disease (yes, no) and exposure (yes, no). Unadjusted and adjusted estimates of treatment effect are compared in terms of odds ratio, response ratio, and response difference. In the two case studies, there was considerable underestimation of treatment effect. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The methodology can be applied to different therapeutic areas. Limitations of the methodology, such as when adjusted cell estimates become negative, are highlighted. The role of anchor-based methodology is discussed for obtaining estimates of sensitivity and specificity on responder classification. Correction for treatment effect bias from misclassification of responder status on PRO measures can lead to more trustworthy interpretation and effective decision-making.

We performed a systematic review of studies that examined methods to assess medications in use at a specific point in time. METHODS Comprehensive literature search to identify studies that compared active medications identified using pharmacy databases to medications identified using nonautomated data sources. Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text material. RESULTS Of 496 studies screened, 29 studies evaluating 50 comparisons met inclusion criteria. Twenty-nine comparisons evaluated fixed look-back period approaches, defining active medications as those filled in a specified period prior to the index date (range 84-730 days). Fourteen comparisons evaluated medication-on-hand approaches, defining active medications as those for which the most recent fill provided sufficient supply to last through the study index date. Sensitivity ranged from 48% to 93% for fixed look-back period approaches and 35% to 97% for medication-on-hand approaches. Interpretation of comparative performance of methods was limited by use of different reference sources, target medication classes, and databases across studies. In four studies with head-to-head comparisons of these methods, sensitivity of the medication-on-hand approach was a median of 7% lower than the corresponding fixed look-back approach. CONCLUSIONS The reported accuracy of methods for identifying active medications using pharmacy databases differs greatly across studies. More direct comparisons of common approaches are needed to establish the accuracy of methods within and across populations, medication classes, and databases.","Anderson, Timothy S; Xu, Edison; Whitaker, Evans; Steinman, Michael A",Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,240,5

Poly(d,l)-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) (LA:GA=50:50) copolymer and cisplatin were mixed, compressed, and sintered to construct biodegradable pellets and placed in phosphate-buffered saline to test the characteristics of in vitro release. In vivo, equal amounts of cisplatin (10mg/kg) were introduced into rabbit pleural cavities either by free form (Gr1) or pellets form (Gr2). Cisplatin concentrations in the collected pleural effusion and blood were measured and compared by repeated measurement ANOVA. In vitro, approximately 5% of the cisplatin was released in the first day while the rest was gradually released in the following 50 days. In vivo, the cisplatin level in the pleural fluid was equally high during the first 2 days but dropped quickly in Gr1 while remaining high in Gr2 for 18 days, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001) In contrast, the plasma cisplatin level was 10 times significantly higher in Gr1 than in Gr2 (P<0.001), which resulted in two early deaths of rabbits. Thus we concluded that our biodegradable pellets could achieve high and steady cisplatin release in the pleural cavity.

Data from IMS III, MR RESCUE, SWIFT and TREVO2 consistently demonstrate the dramatic impact of collateral perfusion in acute ischemic stroke. Such collateral, or parallel, trials of the underlying pathophysiology in stroke reveal that diagnosis or selection of optimal candidates may be paramount to the specific drug or device therapy.

Investigations into the biology and origins of this variation have been the focus of research in the fields of dermatology, anthropology, and forensic science, among others. This manuscript explores how much of what we know about the biology, genetics, and evolutionary origins of pigmentation has been strongly influenced by investigations and applications that focus on lighter skin. METHODS I reviewed literature from the fields of dermatology, anthropology and evolutionary genetics, and forensic science to assess how perceptions of lighter skin as the ""normal"" state in humans can shape the ways that knowledge is gathered and applied in these fields. RESULTS This normalization of lighter skin has impacted common tools used in dermatology and shaped the framework of dermatological education. A strong Eurocentric bias has shaped our understanding of the genetic architecture of pigmentary traits, which influences the ways in we understand the evolutionary processes leading to modern pigmentation diversity. Finally, I discuss how these biases in pigmentation genetics work in combination with phenotypic systems that privilege predicting lighter pigmentation variation to impede accurate prediction of intermediate phenotypes, particularly in individuals with ancestry from multiple populations. This can lead to a disproportionate targeting of already over-policed populations with darker skin. CONCLUSIONS Potential changes to how we conceptualize clinical and basic pigmentation research may help to reduce existing health disparities and improve understanding of pigmentation genetic architecture and how this knowledge is applied in forensic contexts.","Norton, Heather L",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,240,5

Hernia recurrence after prior ACS represents a complex surgical challenge. In this context, we report our experience utilizing posterior component separation with transversus abdominis muscle release (PCS/TAR) and retromuscular mesh reinforcement. METHODS Patients with a history of recurrent hernia following ACS repaired with PCS/TAR were retrospectively identified from prospective databases collected at two large academic institutions. Patient demographics, hernia characteristics (using CT scan) and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients with a history of ACS developed 22 (76%) midline, 3 (10%) lateral and 4 (14%) concomitant recurrences. Contamination was present in 11 (38%) of cases. All were repaired utilizing a PCS/TAR with retromuscular mesh placement (83% synthetic, 17% biologic) and fascial closure. Wound morbidity consisted of 13 (45%) surgical site occurrences including 8 (28%) surgical site infections. Five (17%) patients required 90-day readmission, and two (7%) were related to wound morbidity. One organ space infection with frank spillage of stool resulted in the only instance of mesh excision. This case also represents the only instance of recurrence (3%) with a mean follow-up of 11 (range 3-36) months. CONCLUSION Patients with a history of an ACS who develop a recurrence represent a challenging clinical scenario with limited options for surgical repair. A PCS/TAR hernia repair achieves acceptable outcomes and may in fact be the best approach available.","Pauli, E M; Wang, J; Petro, C C; Juza, R M; Novitsky, Y W; Rosen, M J",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,240,1

In contrast to bulky tumor cells, CSCs remain less differentiated and resistant to therapy even when targeted with tissue-specific antigenic markers. This makes CSCs responsible for not only tumor initiation, development, but also tumor recurrence. Emerging evidence suggests that CSCs can undergo cell senescence, a non-proliferative state of cells in response to stress. While cell senescence attenuates tumor cell proliferation, it is commonly regarded as a tumor suppressive mechanism. However, mounting research indicates that CSC senescence also provides these cells with the capacity to evade cytotoxic effects from cancer therapy, exacerbating cancer relapse and metastasis. Recent studies demonstrate that senescence drives reprogramming of cancer cell towards stemness and promotes CSC generation. In this review, we highlight the origin, heterogeneity and senescence regulatory mechanisms of CSCs, the complex relationship between CSC senescence and tumor therapy, and the recent beneficial effects of senotherapy on eliminating senescent tumor cells.","Zhang, Da-Yong; Monteiro, Michael J; Liu, Jun-Ping; Gu, Wen-Yi",Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,240,1

Compact high field magnet systems entirely made of HTS for compact tokamaks, hybrid HTS-LTS magnets for enhanced operational capabilities (e.g. larger flux swing) in conventional tokamaks and future stellarator devices with HTS magnet systems are presently investigated. An overview of recent concepts, developments and designs of HTS-based future fusion magnet systems is given and a number of physical and technical challenges will be addressed, too: In particular, the so-called second generation HTS Rare-Earth-Barium-Copper-Oxide (REBCO) shows an excellent superconducting performance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. The layered architecture of these technical REBCO conductors and the ceramic nature of REBCO lead to mechanical challenges at high Lorentz forces, which is relevant for cable-in-conduit-conductors (CICC) of future fusion magnets due to the high currents and high field strengths. Different high-current cable concepts for future fusion magnets are discussed. High loads are not only a challenge for potential future HTS conductors but also for the conductor jackets and the coil casing of the magnet systems. An increase of the numbers of load cycles on the path towards a future fusion power plant requires superior mechanical strength. The high critical temperature of HTS materials allows to design HTS CICC with a noticeably higher minimum quench energy and temperature margin compared to LTS conductors – but leads inevitably to substantially slower quench propagation velocity and challenges related to quench detection. Recent results from numerical modeling and experimental investigation of quench in high-current HTS CrossConductor (HTS CroCo) based CICC are addressed.","Wolf, Michael J.; Ebner, Christof; Fietz, Walter H.; Heller, Reinhard; Nickel, Daniel; Weiss, Klaus-Peter",Fusion Engineering and Design,240,1

Open-ended responses were analysed via thematic analysis to provide further context. A total of 6,291 responses were obtained from 81 education settings across Wales (including primary and secondary schools as well as sixth form, colleges and universities). Wellbeing was highest in primary school children and boys and lowest in those who were at secondary school children, who were girls and, those who preferred not to give a gender. Among primary school children, higher wellbeing was seen for those who played with others (rather than alone), were of Asian ethnicity (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.26 to 4.3), lived in a safe area (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.67 to 2.5) and had more sleep. To support their wellbeing young people reported they would like to be able to play with their friends more. Among secondary school children those who were of mixed ethnicity reported lower wellbeing (OR: 5.10, 95% CI: 1.70 to 15.80). To support their wellbeing they reported they would like more support with mental health (due to anxiety and pressure to achieve when learning online). This study found self-reported wellbeing differed by gender, ethnicity and deprivation and found younger children report the need for play and to see friends to support wellbeing but older children/young people wanted more support with anxiety and educational pressures.","James, M.; Jones, H.; Baig, A.; Marchant, E.; Waites, T.; Todd, C.; Hughes, K.; Brophy, S.",,240,26

We evaluated the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the Delta variant in an outbreak in southern China. Methods: Data on confirmed cases and their close contacts were retrospectively collected from the outbreak that occurred in Guangdong, China in May-June 2021. Key epidemiological parameters, temporal trend of viral loads and secondary attack rates were estimated and compared between the Delta variant and the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also evaluated the association of vaccination with viral load and transmission. Results: We identified 167 patients infected with the Delta variant in the Guangdong outbreak. The mean estimates of the latent period and the incubation period were 4.0 days and 5.8 days, respectively. A relatively higher viral load was observed in Delta cases than in wild-type infections. The secondary attack rate among close contacts of Delta cases was 1.4%, and 73.9% (95% confidence interval: 67.2%, 81.3%) of the transmissions occurred before onset. Index cases without vaccination (OR: 2.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 8.45) or with one dose of vaccination (OR: 6.02, 95% confidence interval: 2.45, 18.16) were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received 2 doses of vaccination. Discussion: Patients infected with the Delta variant had more rapid symptom onset. The shorter and time-varying serial interval should be accounted in estimation of reproductive numbers. The higher viral load and higher risk of pre-symptomatic transmission indicated the challenges in control of infections with the Delta variant.","Kang, M.; Xin, H.; Yuan, J.; Ali, S.

The sample consisted of 183 adult Christian Pakistanis. Multiple regression indicated that religiosity, attachment to father, and attachment to God were the strongest predictors of perceived stress, though not in the same pattern as expected in Western contexts.

Current methods for in vivo quantification of mutagenesis are limited because they rely on transgenic rodent systems that are low-throughput, expensive, prolonged, and don’t fully represent other species such as humans. Next generation sequencing (NGS) is a conceptually attractive alternative for mutation detection in the DNA of any organism, however, the limit of resolution for standard NGS is poor. Technical error rates (~1×10−3) of NGS obscure the true abundance of somatic mutations, which can exist at pernucleotide frequencies ≤1×10−7. Using Duplex Sequencing, an extremely accurate error-corrected NGS (ecNGS) technology, we were able to detect mutations induced by 3 carcinogens in 5 tissues of 2 strains of mice within 31 days following exposure. We observed a strong correlation between mutation induction measured by Duplex Sequencing and the gold-standard transgenic rodent mutation assay. We identified exposure-specific mutation spectra of each compound through trinucleotide patterns of base substitution. We observed variation in mutation susceptibility by genomic region, as well as by DNA strand. We also identified the primordial signs of carcinogenesis in a cancer-predisposed strain of mice, as evidenced by clonal expansions of cells carrying an activated oncogene, less than a month after carcinogen exposure. These findings demonstrate that ecNGS is a powerful method for sensitively detecting and characterizing mutagenesis and the early clonal evolutionary hallmarks of carcinogenesis. Duplex Sequencing can be broadly applied to chemical safety testing, basic mutational research, and related clinical uses. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Error-corrected next generation sequencing (ecNGS) can be used to rapidly detect and quantify the in vivo mutagenic impact of environmental exposures or endogenous processes in any tissue, from any species, at any genomic location. The greater speed, higher scalability, richer data outputs, as well as cross-species and cross-locus applicability of ecNGS compared to existing methods make it a powerful new tool for mutational research, regulatory safety testing, and emerging clinical applications.","Valentine, Charles C.; Young, Robert R.; Fielden, Mark R.; Kulkarni, Rohan; Williams, Lindsey N.; Li, Tan; Minocherhomji, Sheroy; Salk, Jesse J.",bioRxiv,240,17

In order to improve the robustness of the radar-based gesture recognition system, the proposed framework extracts a comprehensive hand profile, including range, Doppler, azimuth and elevation, over multiple measurement-cycles and encodes them into a feature cube. Rather than feeding the range-Doppler spectrum sequence into a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected with recurrent neural networks, the proposed framework takes the aforementioned feature cube as input of a shallow CNN for gesture recognition to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a hand activity detection (HAD) algorithm to automatize the detection of gestures in real-time case. The proposed HAD can capture the time-stamp at which a gesture finishes and feeds the hand profile of all the relevant measurement-cycles before this time-stamp into the CNN with low latency. Since the proposed framework is able to detect and classify gestures at limited computational cost, it could be deployed in an edge-computing platform for real-time applications, whose performance is notedly inferior to a state-of-the-art personal computer.

However, hydrophobic species are frequently incompatible with biological systems. For this reason, fluorinated matrices are often sought, since fluorinated species are neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic; they therefore do not interact with most biomolecules. However, most fluorinated oils have densities much higher than the density of water (1 g/ml). Consequently, water droplets float in fluorinated oils, aggregating near their surfaces. This facilitates droplet-droplet collision and fusion, exposing droplets to air interfaces and making their manipulation difficult. Here, we report the synthesis, characterization, and use of fluorinated polysiloxane oils that have densities close to the density of water. These, with a non-ionic fluorosilicone surfactant, produce thermostable water-in-oil emulsions that neither float nor sink. We show how droplets in these emulsions can host many biological processes, including PCR, DNA origami, rolling circle amplification (RCA), and Taqman® assays. Further, oil-diffusible reagents can initiate reactions within the droplets.

The aim of this study is to analyze treatment patterns and to identify if there was also a delay in time to treatment for breast and colorectal cancers diagnosed during the pandemic. Methods: We utilized a dataset linking the institutional tumor registry and electronic health records from a large ambulatory group practice in Northern California. We analyzed data from 1,047 patients with newly diagnosed breast and colorectal cancers between 1/2019 and 8/2020 who received care at Sutter HealthPalo Alto Medical Foundation until 12/2020. We performed a T-test to examine whether patterns of treatment status (surgery vs chemotherapy vs neither) and time-totreatment are different in pre-COVID vs pandemic eras. Results: The proportion of patients who did not receive surgery or chemotherapy during the pandemic was significantly higher, compared to the pre-COVID era (34.5% vs. 13.0%, p &lt; 0.01). Among the breast and colorectal cancer patients who received care, the time to initial treatment did not significantly vary in the pre-COVID (median 34 days, mean 36.8 days) era as compared to during the pandemic (median 30 days, mean 32.2 days) (p = 0.15). There was no difference when accounting for surgery (p = 0.15) vs chemotherapy (p = 0.52) as the initial treatment modality. A statistically significant difference was seen amongst the 888 breast cancer cases identified during the study period, but the mean time to treatment during the pandemic (31 days) was actually shorter than the mean time to treatment identified prior to the pandemic (38 days). This difference in breast cancer time to treatment was mainly driven by a statistically shorter time to surgery (p = 0.04) in the pandemic era with no statistically significant difference in time to chemotherapy following a breast cancer diagnosis in the pandemic era as compared to the pre-COVID era (p = 0.99).

In this sense, viruses, the cause of new epidemics and pandemics have also deserved to be studies from an evolutionary approach. Our genome has abundant genetic information that viruses have left us as fingerprints. It has already been demonstrated that viruses evolve by natural selection, starting mainly from their mutations and this is the proposal based on Darwin's legacy;however, there is also the mechanism of horizontal gene transfer between viruses, especially RNAs, and between the host and viruses. This knowledge is based on the adaptive theory, so called theory of inheritance of acquired characters, proposed by Lamarck and supported by the epigenetics. The appearance of SAR-CoV-2 has not been excluded from its evolutionary origin being studied and for this reason, the present word is based on an updated bibliographic review on the origin of this virus, having concluded that they participated in this process both the mechanisms of natural selection and acquired characters. A better understanding of these evolutionary mechanisms could serve to prevent future occurrences of new viral epidemics.","Martinez, P. M.",Revista de Investigacion Cientifica REBIOL,240,16

The uncertainty and fear change represented a golden opportunity for threat actors. Early 2020 research discovered widespread evidence that threat actors embraced the COVID-19 fear event to mount Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attacks and exploit the opportunity exposed by the disruption. Tactics ranging from phishing emails and social engineering to malware distribution have been identified with many malicious domains with medical information that delivered sophisticated malware to the victims’ systems. APTs are incredibly sophisticated, stealthy and remain undetected for potentially long periods. They use zero-day or unknown vulnerabilities and are carried out by adversaries possessing a very high level of expertise and deploying significant resources for the primary purpose of data exfiltration or positioning for long term attack strategies. The current defence security solutions are a combination of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS), Security Operations Centre (SOC), anomaly and heuristic-based endpoint protection systems, etc. However, IDPS face several problems in mitigating APT attacks, such as a lack of historical correlation of attack data, knowledge of defence against known APT attacks stages only.

The current standard for accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is laboratory-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Here, we report a preliminary prospective performance evaluation of the QuantuMDx Q-POC SARS CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. Methods: Between November 2020 and March 2021, we obtained 49 longitudinal nose and throat swabs from 29 individuals hospitalised with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 at St Georges' NHS Foundation Trust, London (UK). In addition, we obtained 101 mid nasal swabs from healthy volunteers in June 2021. We then used these samples to evaluate the Q-POC SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay. The primary analysis was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the Q-POC test against a reference laboratory-based RT-PCR assay. Results: The overall sensitivity of the Q-POC test compared with the reference test was 96.88% (83.78%- 99.92% CI) for a cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off value for the reference test of 35 and 80.00% (64.35% to 90.95% CI) without altering the reference test's Ct cut-off value of 40. Conclusions: The Q-POC test is a sensitive, specific and rapid point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 at a reference Ct cut-off value of 35. The Q-POC test provides an accurate and afforda-ble option for RT-PCR at point-of-care without the need for sample pre-processing and laboratory handling.

Patients receiving care at a large, community-based cancer center in Seattle, Washington were sent an email requesting voluntary participation in a survey to assess their experiences with telemedicine. Surveying took place during the interval from March 1, through May 31 2020, in the early phase of the pandemic. The survey queried participants regarding demographic and clinical characteristics, included a panel of questions designed to assess reasons for choosing telemedicine and their satisfaction with care, and a NCCN-validated distress scale. Descriptive statistics were tabulated and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of satisfaction with telemedicine. Surveys were completed by 155 patients. Mean age of respondents was 65 years old, 69% were female, and 41% were treated for a gynecologic condition. Most used an audiovisual (v audio-only) platform (70%) and stated they were offered the choice to use telehealth (88%). Overall, 82% found the platform easy to use, 87% were satisfied with the care provided, 84% found they could connect emotionally with their provider, and 93% stated they would use telemedicine again. Reasons for continued interest in using telemedicine again included convenience, safety, and transportation issues. In a multivariable model, being offered the choice to use telehealth was the only significant predictor of satisfaction with care (odds ratio 4.81). Male gender, living close to the clinic, and self-reported worry were negatively associated with their ability to connect emotionally with their provider, but high distress scores did not impact having an emotional connection with their provider. Rates of patient satisfaction with telemedicine were high, but not being offered the choice of an in-person visit emerged as an important predictor of dissatisfaction with care. This information may be important for clinics planning to incorporate telemedicine in the future.

Methods/Principle Findings: The review included studies published in English, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish. Records were identified through systematic literature searches in six databases. Results are summarized narratively and using meta-analytic strategies. We found studies only for the 1918 and 2009 pandemics. Of 14 studies on the 2009 pandemic including data on both medical and social risk factors, after controlling for medical risk factors 8 demonstrated independent impact of SES. A random effect analysis of 46 estimates from 35 studies found a pooled mean odds ratio of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.7), comparing the lowest to the highest SES, but with substantial effect heterogeneity across studies, reflecting differences in outcome measures and definitions of case and control samples. Analyses by pandemic period (1918 or 2009) and by level of SES measure (individual or ecological) indicate no differences along these dimensions. Studies using healthy controls tend to find low SES associated with worse influenza outcome, and studies using infected controls find low SES associated with more severe outcomes. Studies comparing severe outcomes (ICU or death) to hospital admissions are few but indicate no clear association. Studies with more unusual comparisons (e.g., pandemic vs seasonal influenza, seasonal influenza vs other patient groups) report no or negative associations. Conclusions/Significance: Results show that social risk factors help to explain pandemic outcomes in 1918 and in 2009 although the mechanisms and types of social vulnerabilities leading to disparities in outcomes may differ over time. Studies of the 2009 pandemic also showed that social vulnerability could not always be explained by medical risk factors. To prepare for future pandemics, we must consider social along with medical vulnerability.

Furthermore, the healthcare system as a whole may be adversely affected due to the cost associated with physician turnover and reduced productivity. Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, there has been an exponential increase in publications related to both COVID-19 and burn-out. [...]engagement in professional societies and social groups has been shown to help overcome physician burn-out.12 Although opportunities to travel, socialise and attend meetings in-person are limited due to the pandemic, many medical societies currently are offering professional and educational support for virtual connections. A number of applications such as Headspace or CALM have been recommended to be useful for healthcare professionals to build moral resilience by focusing on self-care.18 Physical exercise is also a well-established factor to improve mood and alleviate stress and may help mitigate and prevent burn-out among gastroenterologists.19 Summary The demands on the gastroenterologist extend beyond his or her hours at work.","Duong, Nikki Bollipo Steven Repaka Aparna Shaji Sebastian Tennyson Christina Charabaty Aline",Frontline Gastroenterology,240,33

Using a longitudinal study design, we measured PA and SB using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ0SF) and feelings of ME, PE, MF, PF and fatigue using the Trait-State Mental and Physical Energy and Fatigue Questionnaire. Participants were then split into 2 groups, &lt;8hr and &gt;8hr. A series of step-wise regression models were used controlling for demographic factors and other lifestyle factors (e.g. sleep, mental workload, diet). Among the 473 participants in the &lt;8hr group, PA was associated with increased PE and ME and decreased MF. However, of the 366 participants in the &gt;8hr group PA was only associated with increased PE and decreased PF. We found PA was not significantly associated with ME and MF for participants who reported sitting &gt;8hr. Our results suggest that sitting for &gt;8hr may negate the positive benefits of PA on ME and MF. We recommend that individuals with low levels of ME and MF and who sit for &gt;8hr to prioritize reducing their sitting time.

Methods Using Australian workers compensation and census data, we calculated weeks of compensated time off work per 1,000 labour force at Statistical Area Level 4, an indicator of work disability burden. Records included all claims with at least one day of compensated time off work lodged between 2010 and 2015. Work disability burden was z-transformed by state and mapped across Australia. Statistical Areas [≥] 1.5 standard deviations from the state/territory mean were considered hotspots and coldspots. We tested several sociodemographic factors as predictors of work disability burden. Results Work disability burden hotspots were concentrated in lower socioeconomic suburbs and exurbs of state capitals, plus several regional areas. Coldspots were primarily in wealthy central urban and suburban areas. Factors associated with greater work disability burden include socioeconomic disadvantage, rurality, lower labour force participation, higher unemployment, and more people with core activity limitations, aged 65+ years, and aged 65+ but fewer foreign-born. Conclusions Work disability burden is unequally distributed across Australia and strongly influenced by sociodemographic factors. The findings can guide more efficient allocation of resources for primary and secondary work disability prevention and rehabilitation.","Lane, T. J.; Collie, A.",,240,10

This study was conducted to investigate the influence of air pressure, air temperature, and relative humidity on the number of confirmed cases in COVID-19. Based on the result, the calculation of reproduced correlation through path decompositions and subsequent comparison to the empirical correlation indicated that the path model fits the empirical data. The identified factor significantly influenced the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Therefore, the number of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 may reduce as the amount of relative humidity increases; relative humidity will increase as the amount of air temperature decreases; and the amount of air temperature will decrease as the amount of air pressure decreases.

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. COVID-19 can be detected by a lung infection of the patients. The standard method for detecting COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. But the availability of RT-PCR tests is in short supply. As a result of this, the early detection of the disease is difficult. The easily obtainable modes like X-rays are often used for detecting infections in the lungs. It is confirmed that X-ray scans can be widely used for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis. But a physical diagnosis of X-rays of an outsized number of patients is a longterm process. A deep learning-based diagnosis process can help radiologists in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray scans. Pre-trained CNNs are commonly used in detecting diseases from datasets. This paper proposes a CNN model with a parallelization strategy that extracts the features in the X-ray images by applying filters parallelly through the images. Our proposed method aims to attain higher accuracy and a less loss rate with precision. To do so, the accuracy and loss rates of three types of CNN - VGG-16, MobileNet, and CNN are compared with the parallelization technique. Since, VGG-16 and MobileNet are pre-trained models;those two models are directly imported from Keras.

Basing the prior on the reproduction rate during lockdown instead on the CoMix study results for the reduction in social contacts under lockdown, and assuming the reproduction number scales with the number of social contacts, provides a much more restrictive upper limit on the transmission rate by contaminated objects of fewer than 1 in 30 per day per infectious person (95% CL).

Standard approaches for ePRO implementation are not established warranting evaluation in community cancer practices. Objective: Evaluate implementation of ePRO symptom monitoring across a large multi-site community oncology practice network. Methods: Patients initiating a new systemic therapy at one of 210 practice sites in the Texas Oncology Practice were invited to use in the Navigating Cancer ePRO platform, with rolling implementation from July-December 2020. Participating patients received a weekly prompt by text message or email (patient choice) to selfreport common symptoms and well-being via web or smartphone. Severe self-reported symptoms triggered a real-time notification alert to nursing triage to address the symptom. Enrollment and compliance were systematically tracked weekly with evaluation of barriers and facilitators to adoption and sustainability. Results: 4375 patients planning systemic treatment enrolled and participated, with baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. 73% (1841/2522) of enrolled patients with follow up completed at least one ePRO assessment, and among these individuals, 65% (8762/25061) of all available weekly ePRO assessments were completed. Over a 10-week period, compliance with weekly symptom reporting declined from 72% to 52%. Patients on oral therapy had higher compliance rates overall. Barriers currently being addressed include lack of a second reminder text/email prompt, inconsistent discussion of reported ePROs by clinicians at visits, and COVID-related changes in workflow. Facilitators included patient and staff engagement on the importance of PROs for symptom management. Conclusions: ePROs can be effectively implemented in community oncology practice.

Virtual clinics (VC) were used by the cystic fibrosis (CF) MDT to assess and monitor patients. Objectives: To scope benefits of providing MSK physiotherapy to allow pwCF to self-manage their condition and improve their quality of life (QOL). Methods: VC for MSK pain were offered for 6 weeks. Patient satisfaction and perceived resolution of symptoms was assessed. Results: 15 patients had an average of 1.5 treatment sessions. MSK problems included peripheral joint pain n = 12;spine n = 2 and TMJ. 91% of pwCF were seen within 3 days of referral with remainder seen within 1 week. 55% responded to a satisfaction survey. 83% of pwCF felt a 58% improvement in symptoms. 50% felt the support received was sufficient with 50% requiring additional follow-up. Future access to CF MSK services was considered favourably. 33% stated a preference for face-to-face consultation, with 50% finding VC to be a ‘convenient alternative’. PwCF have an increased prevalence of spinal deformities such as kyphosis and scoliosis, the same prevalence of MSK pain as age-matched controls and pain in pwCF rising with age and associated co-morbidities. 94% of pwCF may experience pain limiting airway clearance and subsequent QOL. PwCF often describe the negative impact pain has on their ability to stay active and function in daily life. UK national standards of care recommend that ‘all individuals with CF should be screened for MSK signs and symptoms, with referral pathways to access MSK specialists where appropriate’ suggesting that MSK specialist input within CF centres would be ideal. In Glasgow, there is currently no specialist CF MSK physiotherapy provision and local specialist services have a current waiting list of 44 weeks. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that pwCF feel specialist CF MSK input is valuable and significantly reduced their pain within a short period of time, thus maintaining their QOL.","Morrison, L.; Dunphy, R.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,240,28

Infection treatments resulting in shorter hospitalization durations are associated with cost savings from the hospital perspective. OBJECTIVE To determine whether similar economic advantages are associated with oral linezolid, the costs and consequences of linezolid use following vancomycin IV versus the existing practice in the treatment of infections caused by MRSA were compared. METHODS The charts of all patients admitted to one of three tertiary care teaching hospitals between January 1, 1997 and August 31, 2000 and treated with vancomycin IV for an active MRSA infection (skin and soft tissue only) were reviewed. Based on the vancomycin IV chart review data set and a simulated linezolid data set, the clinical consequences and the associated costs of MRSA treatment with vancomycin IV, and oral and IV forms of linezolid were quantified and compared within the framework of a cost-consequence analysis. RESULTS Patients treated with oral and IV forms of linezolid compared with the existing practice had a shorter length of stay and required fewer home IV care services, which resulted in a cost savings of $750 (2001 values) to the Canadian health care perspective. CONCLUSIONS The estimated cost savings associated with linezolid use not only offset the higher acquisition cost of the anti-infective, but may be substantial to health care systems across Canada, especially as the incidence of MRSA continues to rise.","Rosner, Andrew J; Becker, Debbie L; Wong, Angelina H; Miller, Elizabeth; Conly, John M",The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale,240,28

These findings strongly suggest that the role of the mouse transporter in determining infection is to provide an envelope-binding site. This role is analogous to those of host membrane proteins composed of a single membrane-spanning domain that serve as binding proteins or receptors for other enveloped viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and murine and human coronaviruses.","Albritton, L M; Kim, J W; Tseng, L; Cunningham, J M",Journal of virology,240,30

METHODS A retrospective review of work logs and patient assignments, detailed review of medical records of patients with SARS, and comprehensive telephone-based interviews of HCWs who met the case definition for SARS after implementation of infection control precautions. RESULTS Seventeen HCWs from 6 hospitals developed disease that met the case definition for SARS after implementation of infection control precautions. These HCWs had a mean age (+/-SD) of 39+/-2.3 years. Two HCWs were not interviewed because of illness. Of the remaining 15, only 9 (60%) reported that they had received formal infection control training. Thirteen HCWs (87%) were unsure of proper order in which personal protective equipment should be donned and doffed. Six HCWs (40%) reused items (eg, stethoscopes, goggles, and cleaning equipment) elsewhere on the ward after initial use in a room in which a patient with SARS was staying. Use of masks, gowns, gloves, and eyewear was inconsistent among HCWs. Eight (54%) reported that they were aware of a breach in infection control precautions. HCWs reported fatigue due to an increased number and length of shifts; participants worked a median of 10 shifts during the 10 days before onset of symptoms. Seven HCWs were involved in the intubation of a patient with SARS. One HCW died, and the remaining 16 recovered. CONCLUSION Multiple factors were likely responsible for SARS in these HCWs, including the performance of high-risk patient care procedures, inconsistent use of personal protective equipment, fatigue, and lack of adequate infection control training.","Ofner-Agostini, Marianna; Gravel, Denise; McDonald, L Clifford; Lem, Marcus; Sarwal, Shelley; McGeer, Allison; Green, Karen; Vearncombe, Mary; Roth, Virginia; Paton, Shirley; Loeb, Mark; Simor, Andrew",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,240,1

How to face a COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Northern Italy?",13.096641,9.878035,2020,"Measles is uncommon in Australia due to effective national vaccination strategies. In mid-2003, a cluster of nine cases of measles occurred in western Sydney. The index case was a 29-year-old traveller recently returned from Nepal. The case presented to hospital and transmitted the disease to two others in the Emergency Department. Further cases resulted from both community and nosocomial transmission. The median age of cases was 24 years, with three cases in children aged under four years. Only one person had a documented history of measles vaccination, a child who had received one dose of vaccine overseas. One case was a 2-month-old infant whose mother was immune and two cases were hospital staff members. Molecular analysis of measles virus isolates from four cases revealed the same D8 genotype, a strain previously identified in Nepal. Staff vaccination strategies implemented as a result of the outbreak were poorly patronised despite nosocomial transmission. As diseases such as measles become rare it is important to thoroughly investigate any outbreaks, and to maintain a high index of suspicion of measles, particularly in travellers presenting with a rash having returned from measles-endemic areas. Genetic analysis is important in tracing the origins of an outbreak, and to confirm relatedness between cases. The highly infectious nature of measles virus also underscores the need for appropriate infection control in minimising risk of nosocomial transmission. Such policies are of increasing importance with the emergence of novel viruses or the threat of pandemic influenza.","Weston, Kathryn M; Dwyer, Dominic E; Ratnamohan, Mala; McPhie, Ken; Chan, Sau-wan; Branley, James M; Allchin, Lisa J; Hort, Krishna P",Communicable diseases intelligence quarterly report,240,1

Immunity against tetanus was also investigated. METHODS Two groups of agricultural workers consisting of 153 animal breeders (exposed) and 46 non- breeders (controls) were included in the study. In a first group of 103 workers (89 exposed and 14 controls) the serum concentrations of antibodies against Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) were measured, whereas in the second group of 96 workers (64 exposed and 32 controls) the serum concentrations of antibodies against Leptospira spp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella spp. and Salmonella spp. were addressed. Imunization against tretanus was also studied in this group. RESULTS Animal breeders showed higher rates of IgG antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (50% vs. 31.2%), and Leptospira spp. (59.4% vs. 43.7%). Results of logistic regression analysis revealed that breeder workers showed a tendency to have higher prevalence of positivity for antibodies to Leptospira spp.and Coxiella burnetii than non-breeders (ORs ~ 3). Only one exposed subject showed antibodies against hepatitis E (none in controls), but when tested with another commercially available kit the percentage of anti HEV IgG positive subjects increased to 22.3% in the exposed, while none of the controls showed positive. None of the subjects showed antibodies against Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp. Italians and other European workers have better protection against tetanus (91%) compared to non-EU workers (81%). CONCLUSIONS The higher frequency of the presence of serum antibodies to zoonotic agents (e.g. Leptospira spp. and Coxiella burnetii) in animal breeders suggests that they are more exposed to biological agents than workers not involved in animal breeding activities. The risk of contact with HEV deserves further studies because the adoption of different assays can result in significantly different results. The promotion of immunization of agricultural workers might be a priority, in particular for migrants.","Tabibi, Ramin; Baccalini, Rosana; Barassi, Alessandra; Bonizzi, Luigi; Brambilla, Gabri; Consonni, Dario; Melzi d'Eril, Gianlodovico; Romanò, Luisa; Sokooti, Maryam; Somaruga, Chiara; Vellere, Francesca; Zanetti, Alessandro; Colosio, Claudio",Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,240,1

OBJECTIVES To report the protocols and case selection of a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory in the epicenter of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS All pediatric cardiac catheterization procedures from March 16, 2020 through May 10, 2020 were reviewed. Changes to case selection and periprocedural workflow are described. Data were collected on COVID-19 testing status and primary procedure type, and all procedures were classified by urgency. RESULTS There were 52 catheterizations performed on 50 patients. Endomyocardial biopsies were the most common procedure (n = 27; 52%). Interventional and diagnostic procedures represented 27% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 11) of cases, respectively. Two emergent procedures (3.8%) were performed on patients with positive COVID-19 testing. Most cases were performed on patients with negative COVID-19 testing (n = 33; 94%). CONCLUSIONS Adjusting to the COVID-19 pandemic in a high-volume pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory can be safely and effectively managed by prioritizing emergent and urgent cases and modifying workflow operations. The experience of this center may assist other pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratories in adapting to similar practice changes as the pandemic continues to evolve.","Oshiro, Kristin T; Turner, Mariel E; Torres, Alejandro J; Crystal, Matthew A; Vincent, Julie A; Barry, Oliver M",The Journal of invasive cardiology,240,1

Although other diagnostic methods have been introduced, detection of viral genes on oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse-transcription real time-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays is still the gold standard. Efficient viral RNA extraction is a prerequisite for downstream performance of rRT-PCR assays. Currently, several automatic methods that include RNA extraction are available. However, due to the growing demand, a shortage in kit supplies could be experienced in several labs. For these reasons, the use of different commercial or in-house protocols for RNA extraction may increase the possibility to analyze high number of samples. Herein, we compared the efficiency of RNA extraction of three different commercial kits and an in-house extraction protocol using synthetic ssRNA standards of SARS-CoV-2 as well as in oro-nasopharyngeal swabs from six COVID-19-positive patients. It was concluded that tested commercial kits can be used with some modifications for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome by rRT-PCR approaches, although with some differences in RNA yields. Conversely, EXTRAzol reagent was the less efficient due to the phase separation principle at the basis of RNA extraction.

Among these patients, 97 isolated patients were scored with a self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) score seven days after quarantine, and the correlation between age and score was analyzed. These 97 isolated patients were then divided into three groups according to age: group A (up to 35 years old), group B (36-60 years), and group C (over 60 years). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the scores among groups. The Q-test was used for pairwise comparison.P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.There was a negative correlation between age and SAS score in isolated Covid-19 patients, and the differences in the score among groups were statistically significant. Patients under 35 years old were more prone to anxiety when they were isolated for seven days. Isolated patients aged up to 35 years old need more attention from quarantine medical staff, communication should be strengthened, and psychological intervention from psychotherapists should be given if necessary.","Sun, Peng; Fan, Duo-Jiao; Li, Heng-Zhou; He, Tao; Zhang, Xiao-Kun; Wang, Guang; Chen, Wan-Li; Liu, Li-Min",Psychol Health Med,240,16

METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify original articles regarding clinical, laboratory, and anatomopathological kidney changes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 published until May 7, 2020. The search was carried out across PubMed, Scopus, and Embase using the keywords ""COVID-19"", ""coronavirus"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""kidney injury"" and ""kidney disease"". Fifteen studies presented clinical and laboratory renal changes in patients with COVID-19, and three addressed anatomopathological changes. DISCUSSION Acute kidney injury (AKI) was a relevant finding in patients with COVID-19. There were also significant changes in laboratory tests that indicated kidney injury, such as increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, and hematuria. The presence of laboratory abnormalities and AKI were significant in severely ill patients. There was a considerable prevalence of AKI among groups of patients who died of COVID-19. Histopathological analysis of the kidney tissue of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus may directly affect the kidneys. CONCLUSION Although COVID-19 affects mainly the lungs, it can also impact the kidneys. Increased serum creatinine and BUN, hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI were frequent findings in patients with severe COVID-19 and were related to an increased mortality rate. Further studies focusing on renal changes and their implications for the clinical condition of patients infected with the novel coronavirus are needed.","Nogueira, Samuel Átila Rodrigues; Oliveira, Samuel Ciríaco Silva de; Carvalho, Ana Flávia Moreira de; Neves, Julia Moreira Cavalcante; Silva, Leila Silveira Vieira da; Silva Junior, Geraldo Bezerra da; Nobre, Maria Elizabeth Pereira",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),240,14

The guidance coming from multiple sources frequently has been difficult to assimilate as well as dynamic, with constantly changing standards. We seek to communicate the current guidelines published by each state, to discuss the impact of these guidelines on orthopaedic surgery, and to provide the general framework used to determine which procedures have been postponed at our institution. METHODS: An internet search was used to identify published state guidelines regarding the cancellation of elective procedures, with a publication cutoff of March 24, 2020, 5:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time. Data collected included the number of states providing guidance to cancel elective procedures and which states provided specific guidance in determining which procedures should continue being performed as well as to orthopaedic-specific guidance. RESULTS: Thirty states published guidance regarding the discontinuation of elective procedures, and 16 states provided a definition of ""elective"" procedures or specific guidance for determining which procedures should continue to be performed. Only 5 states provided guidelines specifically mentioning orthopaedic surgery; of those, 4 states explicitly allowed for trauma-related procedures and 4 states provided guidance against performing arthroplasty. Ten states provided guidelines allowing for the continuation of oncological procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Few states have published guidelines specific to orthopaedic surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak, leaving hospital systems and surgeons with the responsibility of balancing the benefits of surgery with the risks to public health.","Sarac, Nikolas J; Sarac, Benjamin A; Schoenbrunner, Anna R; Janis, Jeffrey E; Harrison, Ryan K; Phieffer, Laura S; Quatman, Carmen E; Ly, Thuan V",J Bone Joint Surg Am,240,32

Aim: The aim of this guideline is the treatment of patients with SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) in hospital; in particular, it addresses the treatment of respiratory failure treated in general Internal Medical- and Pulmonary Medical wards. Results: Elderly patients and patients with chronic disease are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Target oxygen saturation should be between 92% and 96% in patients without chronic lung diseases. Treatment with &gt;5 L oxygen/min should be in close collaboration with intensive care colleagues and &gt;15 l/min preferably in intensive care units. High-flow nasal canula (HFNC) and long-term Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) are recommended for patients not responding to conventional oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is only recommended for selected patients, such as those with a ceiling of treatment or patients presenting with hypercapnic failure. With the use of humidification protective equipment as FFP2-3 masks should be used. Nebulized medication should be avoided, and spacers should be used instead. Conclusion: Respiratory failure is frequently the cause of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 and should be monitored closely.","Nielsen Jeschke, Klaus; Bonnesen, Barbara; Hansen, Ejvind Frausing; Jensen, Jens-Ulrik Stæhr; Lapperre, Therese Sophie; Weinreich, Ulla Møller; Hilberg, Ole",Eur.

Their behavior during lockdown and associated restrictions is unknown, as well as whether it was influenced by coexistent cardiovascular conditions. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in May 2020, in France, nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic diseases. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 10,859 people; 3701 fully completed questionnaires. The prevalence of self-reported asthma was 7%. Patients were classified in 4 categories: asthma with (n = 106) or without (n = 149) cardiovascular disease and other diseases with (n = 1186) or without (n = 2260) cardiovascular disease. RESULT: Adherence to movement restrictions during the lockdown was very strong: 89% of participants reported a frequency of outings of ""less than once per week"" and ""once or twice per week"" for errands and no family-related outings during the lockdown. This proportion and frequency of outings were similar whatever the chronic disease (p = 0.122). Most patients (96%) reported a high feeling of security during the lockdown, but 95% felt anxious or depressed, with no difference by disease. As compared with patients with controlled asthma, those with uncontrolled asthma more frequently reported complaints related to deteriorated medical follow-up, waived care, anxiety or depression. CONCLUSIONS: Behaviors during the lockdown in France among the asthma population did not differ from patients with other chronic diseases in this cohort, which strengthens hypotheses for specific disease-related susceptibility to explain the low representation of asthmatics among COVID-19 cases. Special attention should be paid to the subgroup of patients with uncontrolled asthma during lockdowns.","Taillé, Camille; Roche, Nicolas; Tesson, Florian; Tardivon, Coralie; Tran, Viet-Thi; Couffignal, Camille",J Asthma,240,16

Hourly traffic, air pollutants, and meteorological data on/near a major freeway in the downtown of Seattle, Washington, were collected for five weeks before and ten weeks after the Washington Stay Home Order (SHO) was enacted, respectively (February 17-May 31, 2020). The pollutants between pre- and post-SHO periods were compared, and their differences were statistically tested. Besides, first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models were developed to reveal the impacts specific to the change of traffic due to the COVID-19 responses while controlling for meteorological conditions. Results indicate that compared with those in the post-SHO period, the median traffic volume and road occupancy decreased by 37% and 52%, respectively. As for pollutants, the median BC and PM2.5 levels significantly decreased by 25% and 33%, relatively, while NO, NO2, NOx, and CO decreased by 33%, 29%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. In contrast, neither size-resolved UFPs nor total UFPs showed significant changes between the two periods, although larger particles (&#8805;115.5 nm) decreased by 4-29%. Additionally, significant differences were found in meteorological conditions between the two periods. Based on the MAR(1) models, controlling for meteorological conditions, the COVID-19 responses were associated with significant decreases in median levels of traffic-related pollutants including 11.5-154.0 nm particles (ranging from -3% [95% confidence interval (CI): -1%, -4%] to -12% [95% CI: -10%, -14%]), total UFPs (-7% [95% CI: -5%, -8%]), BC (-6% [95% CI: -5%, -7%]), PM2.5 (-2% [95% CI: -1%, -3%]), NO, NO2, NOx (ranging from -3% [95% CI: -2%, -4%] to -10% [95% CI: -18%, -12%]), and CO (-4% [95% CI, -3%, -5%]). These findings illustrate that the conclusion of the COVID-19 impacts on urban traffic-related air pollutant levels could be completely different in scenarios whether meteorology was adjusted for or not.

Migrants are overrepresented in COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospital admissions, intensive care treatment and death statistics in all countries with available data. A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population. Here, we use the Norwegian situation as a case to explain the need for an innovative, system-level, interdisciplinary approach at a global level.","Diaz, Esperanza; Mamelund, Svenn-Eirik; Eid, Jarle; Aasen, Henriette Sinding; Martin Kaarbøe, Oddvar; Brokstad, Rebecca Jane Cox; Gloppen, Siri; Beyer, Anders; Kumar, Bernadette Nirmal",Scand J Public Health,240,1

The retail business have been evolving over the past several decades, accentuated by the evolution and development of digital technologies. Almost all parts of the world have witnessed the changes in consumer behavior, the nature of retail, and reshaping of the high street landscape due to the e-commerce revolution and continued expansion. Especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail platforms powered by digital technology had to be adapted quickly, and it is expected to continue to support this change as consumers and retailers adjust to new normalities. Moreover, retail real estate is intricately linked with the retail sector dynamics. While lockdown and social distance rules have devastating impacts on “traditional” retail property sector, it may accelerate the evolution process of multi-channel retail and the channel integration role of physical stores and thus, bring in transformations in urban-retail landscape. It is not necessarily leading to an end of high street stores, but it may have a significant impact on retail real estate business. There remains a lack of understanding of how these changes may pan out with a rigorous academic investigation. To close this knowledge gap, we analyze both the strategy event data of a range of UK retailers as well as the insights from interviews with retail asset manager and landlords using a mixed-method approach. The findings indicate an urgent need for physical shops to reposition the functions of their multi-channel business. Our analysis provide significant insights and highlight several implications for retailers, landlords and, also policy-making units dealing with urban regeneration and local economic development in the post-COVID-19 world.","Nanda, Anupam Xu Yishuang Zhang Fangchen",Journal of Urban Management,240,30

Using a simple and validated instrument of depression screening, we evaluated the incidence and severity of major depression among African American patients within 90 days of recovery from severe COVID-19-associated respiratory failure. METHODS: African American patients hospitalized and treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19-associated respiratory failure in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, were screened for depression within 90 days of hospital discharge using the validated patient health questionnaires (PHQ-2) and PHQ-9. RESULTS: A total of 73 patients completed the questionnaire. The median age was 52.5 years [IQR 44-65] and 65% were males. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (66%) and diabetes mellitus (51%). Forty-four percent of the patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on their PHQ-9 questionnaire responses. The incidence of MDD was higher among females (69%, n=18/26) compared to males (29%, n=14/47), in patients > 75 years (66%) and those with multiple comorbidities (45%). Eighteen percent of the patients had moderate depression, while 15% and 22% had moderately severe and severe depression, respectively. Only 26% (n=7/27) of eligible patients were receiving treatment for depression at the time of this survey. CONCLUSION: The incidence of depression in a cohort of African American patients without prior psychiatric conditions who recovered from severe COVID-19 infection was 44%.

Our aim was to compare the outcome of hospitalized coronavirus disease 219 (COVID-19) patients in low and high SES group. Prospective cohort study of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 in three acute hospitals. Electronic case notes were analyzed for baseline characteristics and admission investigations. Scottish index for multiple deprivation (SIMD) was used to divide patients into two groups: more deprived (SIMD 1-5) and less deprived (SIMD 6-10) and results compared. Poor outcome was defined as either need for intubation and/or death. One hundred and seventy-three patients were identified, one was excluded. One hundred and eight (62.8%) were males, mean age was 68.5 ± 14.7 years. Commonest comorbidity was hypertension 87 (50.6%). One hundred and seventeen (68.0%) patients were in more deprived group. Baseline characteristics, admission blood profile and reason for admission were evenly matched in both groups. Outcomes were comparable in both groups: transfer to critical care (27.4% vs 27.3%; P = .991), intubation (18.8% vs 20.2%; P = .853), 30-day all-cause mortality (19.7% vs 14.5%; P = .416) and overall poor outcome (30.8% vs 30.9%; P = .985). Median time to discharge was 7 days longer (17 vs 10 days; P = .018) and median time to death was 4.5 days longer in more deprived group (17 vs 12.5 days; P = .388).

This paper: (1) evaluates the idea that a single standard of ""healthy"" growth characterizes children under age 5, (2) discusses how variation from this standard is viewed in global health, in human biology and by parents, and (3) explores how views of ""normal"" growth shape biomedical and parental responses. METHODS: This paper reviews the anthropological, public health and clinical literature on the nature of child growth and the applicability of World Health Organization Multicenter Growth Reference Study growth standards across contexts. RESULTS: The considerable variability in child growth across contexts makes it unlikely that any one framework, with issues of sample selection and representativeness, can serve as the model of healthy growth. Global health, human biology and parents differ in the emphasis they place on heredity versus environmental context in understanding this variability, but human biologists and parents tend to view a wider range of growth as ""normal."" Since both biomedicine and parents base their care decisions on their perceptions of normal, healthy growth, the comparative framework used has important implications for medical treatment and feeding practices. CONCLUSIONS: A more nuanced approach that incorporates the biology of growth and its association with health outcomes across contexts is critical to identify patterns of healthy growth and to avoid over-reliance on a single standard that may pathologize variability.","Thompson, Amanda L",Am J Hum Biol,240,29

Although social distancing improves physical health in terms of helping to reduce viral transmission, its psychological consequences are less clear, particularly its effects on memory. In this research, we investigated the effect of social distancing duration on negative moods and memory. The relation between social distancing duration and both negative mood and memory errors followed the same U-shaped function: negative moods and memory errors initially decreased as social distancing duration increased, and then at approximately 30 days, they began to increase. Subsequent analyses indicated that memory errors were mediated by lonely mood in particular. Thus, short-term social distancing might benefit psychological well-being and memory performance, but extended social distancing has a negative impact on mood and memory.","Zhang, Weiwei; Gao, Fei; Gross, Julien; Shrum, L J; Hayne, Harlene",Memory,240,24

As there is no specific therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection at present and also because of the long time it takes to discover a new drug and the urgent need to respond urgently to a pandemic infection. Perhaps the best way right now is to find an FDA-approved drug to treat this infection. Oxidative stress and inflammation play a vital role in the progression of tissue injury in COVID-19 patients; furthermore, the G6PD activation is related to increased oxidative inflammation in acute pulmonary injury. In this regard, we propose a new insight that may be a good strategy for this urgency. Exploiting G6PD through inhibiting G6PD activity by modifying redox balance, metabolic switching and protein-protein interactions can be proposed as a new approach to improving patients in severe stage of COVID 19 through various mechanisms. Polydatin is isolated from many plants such as Polygonum, peanuts, grapes, red wines and many daily diets that can be used in severe stage of COVID-19 as a G6PD inhibitor. Furthermore, polydatin possesses various biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunoregulatory, nephroprotective, hepatoprotective, anti-arrhythmic and anti-tumor. Our hypothesis is that the consumption of antioxidants such as Polydatin (a glucoside of resveratrol) as a complementary therapeutic approach may be effective in reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Doustimotlagh, Amir Hossein; Eftekhari, Mahdieh",Clin Nutr ESPEN,240,16

Further, the spread is local-dependent, reflecting a number of social, political, economic, and environmental dynamic factors. The present paper aims to provide a relatively simple way to model, forecast, and evaluate the time incidence of a pandemic. The proposed framework makes use of the non-central beta (NCB) probability density function. Specifically, a probabilistic optimisation algorithm searches for the best NCB model of the pandemic, according to the mean square error metric. The resulting model allows one to infer, among others, the general peak date, the ending date, and the total number of cases as well as to compare the level of difficult imposed by the pandemic among territories.

On the other hand, there are no reports of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) outcomes in ASAP patients. Therefore, we evaluated thrombus burden and thrombus viral load and their impact on microvascular bed perfusion in the infarct area (myocardial blush grade, MBG) in ASAP compared to SARS-COV-2 negative (SANE) STEMI patients. METHODS: This was an observational study of 46 ASAP, and 130 SANE patients admitted with confirmed STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention and thrombus aspiration. The primary endpoints were thrombus dimension + thrombus viral load effects on MBG after PPCI. The secondary endpoints during hospitalization were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). MACEs are defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal acute AMI, and heart failure during hospitalization. RESULTS: In the study population, ASAP vs. SANE showed a significant greater use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and of heparin (p < 0.05), and a higher thrombus grade 5 and thrombus dimensions (p < 0.05). Interestingly, ASAP vs. SANE patients had lower MBG and left ventricular function (p < 0.001), and 39 (84.9%) of ASAP patients had thrombus specimens positive for SARS-COV-2. After PPCI, a MBG 2-3 was present in only 26.1% of ASAP vs. 97.7% of SANE STEMI patients (p < 0.001). Notably, death and nonfatal AMI were higher in ASAP vs. SANE patients (p < 0.05). Finally, in ASAP STEMI patients the thrombus viral load was a significant determinant of thrombus dimension independently of risk factors (p < 0.005). Thus, multiple logistic regression analyses evidenced that thrombus SARS-CoV-2 infection and dimension were significant predictors of poorer MBG in STEMI patients. Intriguingly, in ASAP patients the female vs. male had higher thrombus viral load (15.53 ± 4.5 vs. 30.25 ± 5.51 CT; p < 0.001), and thrombus dimension (4.62 ± 0.44 vs 4.00 ± 1.28 mm2; p < 0.001). ASAP vs. SANE patients had a significantly lower in-hospital survival for MACE following PPCI (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In ASAP patients presenting with STEMI, there is strong evidence towards higher thrombus viral load, dimension, and poorer MBG. These data support the need to reconsider ASAP status as a risk factor that may worsen STEMI outcomes.","Marfella, Raffaele; Paolisso, Pasquale; Sardu, Celestino; Palomba, Luciana; D039,; Onofrio, Nunzia; Cesaro, Arturo; Barbieri, Michelangela; Rizzo, Maria Rosaria; Sasso, Ferdinando Carlo; Scisciola, Lucia; Turriziani, Fabrizio; Galdiero, Massimiliano; Pignataro, Danilo; Minicucci, Fabio; Trotta, Maria Consiglia; Amico, Michele; Mauro, Ciro; Calabrò, Paolo; Balestrieri, Maria Luisa; Signioriello, Giuseppe; Barbato, Emanuele; Galdiero, Marilena; Paolisso, Giuseppe",Crit Care,240,1

This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed approach was measured in the real world using the information from four users and the results showed the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.","Govindan, Kannan; Mina, Hassan; Alavi, Behrouz",Transp Res E Logist Transp Rev,240,26

Rapid identification of immune epitopes would be an efficient way to screen the candidates for vaccine development at the time of pandemic. This study aimed to predict the protective epitopes with bioinformatics methods and resources for vaccine development. METHODS: The genome sequence and protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. ABCpred and BepiPred servers were utilized for sequential B-cell epitope analysis. Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted via DiscoTope 2.0 program. IEDB server was utilized for HLA-1 and HLA-2 binding peptides computation. Surface accessibility, antigenicity, and other important features of forecasted epitopes were characterized for immunogen potential evaluation. RESULTS: A total of 63 sequential B-cell epitopes on spike protein were predicted and 4 peptides (Spike315-324, Spike333-338, Spike648-663, Spike1064-1079) exhibited high antigenicity score and good surface accessibility. Ten residues within spike protein (Gly496, Glu498, Pro499, Thr500, Leu1141, Gln1142, Pro1143, Glu1144, Leu1145, Asp1146) are forecasted as components of discontinuous B-cell epitopes. The bioinformatics analysis of HLA binding peptides within nucleocapsid protein produced 81 and 64 peptides being able to bind MHC class I and MHC class II molecules respectively. The peptides (Nucleocapsid66-75, Nucleocapsid104-112) were predicted to bind a wide spectrum of both HLA-1 and HLA-2 molecules. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell epitopes on spike protein and T-cell epitopes within nucleocapsid protein were identified and recommended for developing a protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Chen, Hong-Zhi; Tang, Ling-Li; Yu, Xin-Ling; Zhou, Jie; Chang, Yun-Feng; Wu, Xiang",Infect Dis Poverty,240,30

In order to control the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been subjected to increased exposure to work stress. In this systematic review, we aimed at investigating the prevalence and determinants of immediate and long-term post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) effects on healthcare professionals by the COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) and SARS-2003 (SARS CoV-1) pandemics. METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to the recommendations of the Protocols for Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Only studies reporting the prevalence of PTSD (frequency, percentage) and related risk factors (adjusted odds ratio (OR)) in healthcare professionals (HCPs) during the SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV-1 pandemics were included. The following databases were screened: Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, and Health Psychosocial Instrument (HaPI). RESULTS: Six of eight studies reported PTSD symptoms among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic in China (three), Singapore (one), India (one), and the United States of America (USA) (two), while two studies reported symptoms during the SARS-2003 pandemic in China (one) and Singapore (one). Sample sizes ranged from 263 to 5062 with a combined total of 10,074 participants. All of the studies self-reported the level of exposure to coronaviruses (CoV-1 and CoV-2) and severity of PTSD. Seven studies reported the prevalence of immediate PTSD and determinants, while one study reported delayed-onset PTSD (3 years after CoV-1 pandemic). Determinants of immediate PTSD were reported for the CoV-2 pandemic, while those for long-term PTSD were reported for the CoV-1 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and determinants of immediate or long-term pandemic PTSD for healthcare workers can improve prevention, diagnosis, and management. Rigorous research measuring the prevalence of PTSD and its associated risk factors (adjusted OR) for the CoV-2 pandemic are envisaged. Although strategies to resolve immediate PTSD are key, long-term PTSD must not be overlooked.","Al Falasi, Buthaina; Al Mazrouei, Mouza; Al Ali, Mai; Al Dhamani, Maithah; Al Ali, Aisha; Al Kindi, Mariam; Dalkilinc, Murat; Al Qubaisi, Mai; Campos, Luciana Aparecida; Al Tunaiji, Hashel; Baltatu, Ovidiu Constantin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),240,16

Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the COVID-19 pandemic, five health systems in Maryland formed a consortium - with diverse expertise and representation - representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process, which determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and healthcare professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens' values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, intensive care unit resources, blood components, novel therapeutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were developed. Creating operational algorithms for each resource posed unique challenges; each resource's varying nature and underlying data on benefit prevented any single algorithm from being universally applicable. The development of scarce resource allocation processes must be iterative, legally vetted, and tested. We offer our processes to assist other regions that may be faced with the challenge of rationing healthcare resources during public health catastrophes.","Ehmann, Michael R; Zink, Elizabeth K; Levin, Amanda B; Suarez, Jose I; Belcher, Harolyn Me; Daugherty Biddison, Elizabeth L; Doberman, Danielle J; D039,; Souza, Karen; Fine, Derek M; Garibaldi, Brian T; Gehrie, Eric A; Golden, Sherita H; Gurses, Ayse P; Hill, Peter M; Hughes, Mark T; Kahn, Jeffrey; Koch, Colleen G; Marx, Jason J; Meisenberg, Barry R; Natterman, Jeffrey; Rushton, Cynda H; Sapirstein, Adam; Selinger, Stephen R; Stephens, R Scott; Toner, Eric S; Unguru, Yoram; van Stone, Maureen; Kachalia, Allen",Chest,240,11

Since the role of HPV was demonstrated, few studies have focused on HPV-negative OPSCC. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of therapeutic strategy (surgical vs. non-surgical) on oncologic outcomes in patients with HPV-negative OPSCC. MATERIAL AND METHOD: All p16-negative OPSCCs treated from 2009 to 2014 in 7 tertiary-care centers were included in this retrospective study and were classified according to the therapeutic strategy: surgical strategy (surgery ± adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy) vs. non-surgical strategy (definitive radiotherapy ± chemotherapy). Patients not eligible for surgery (unresectable tumor, poor general-health status) were excluded. Univariate, multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were performed to compare overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Four hundred seventy-four (474) patients were included in the study (surgical group: 196; non-surgical group: 278). Five-year OS, DSS and RFS were 76.5, 81.3 and 61.3%, respectively, in the surgical group and 49.9, 61.8 and 43.4%, respectively, in the non-surgical group. The favorable impact of primary surgical treatment on oncologic outcomes was statistically significant after multivariate analysis. This effect was more marked for locally-advanced than for early-stage tumors. Propensity score matching analysis confirmed the prognostic impact of primary surgical treatment for RFS. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic strategy is an independent prognostic factor in patients with p16-negative OPSCC and primary surgical treatment is associated with improved OS, DSS and RFS. These results suggest that surgical strategy is a reliable option for advanced stage OPSCC.","Culié, Dorian; Viotti, Julien; Modesto, Anouchka; Schiappa, Renaud; Chamorey, Emmanuel; Dassonville, Olivier; Poissonnet, Gilles; Guelfucci, Bruno; Bizeau, Alain; Vergez, Sebastien; Dupret-Bories, Agnes; Garrel, Renaud; Fakhry, Nicolas; Santini, Laure; Lallemant, Benjamin; Chambon, Guillaume; Sudaka, Anne; Peyrade, Frederic; Saada-Bouzid, Esma; Benezery, Karen; Jourdan-Soulier, Florence; Chapel, Françoise; Ramay, Anne Sophie; Roger, Pascal; Galissier, Thibault; Coste, Valérie; Ben Lakdar, Aicha; Guerlain, Joanne; Temam, Stephane; Mirghani, Haitham; Gorphe, Phillipe; Bozec, Alexandre",Eur. j. surg. oncol,240,13

This study aimed to examine COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among U.S. adults with a history of using tobacco products or marijuana. Data were collected online in 2020-2021 including respondents' willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine, factors that may promote vaccine acceptance, and prior history of influenza vaccination. Logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the associations between vaccine hesitancy and demographic characteristics, substance use, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and prior influenza vaccination. Among 387 respondents, 49.1% were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, 26.0% were unwilling, and 24.9% were ""not sure."" Blacks, suburban or rural residents, those who lived by themselves or with a family with five members or above, those who were not stressed because of the COVID-19 pandemic were more likely to say ""no"" to a COVID-19 vaccine. Respondents who never, only once, or during some years received an influenza vaccine were 7.0, 6.2, and 5.2 times more likely to say ""no"" to a COVID-19 vaccine than respondents who received an influenza vaccination every year or almost every year. The use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and marijuana, as well as heavy drinking of alcohol, were not associated with COVID-19 hesitancy. The associations between demographic factors and vaccine hesitancy were roughly similar for COVID-19 and influenza vaccines. Although various demographic groups have different levels of vaccine hesitancy and also have different factors to increase their acceptance, addressing misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines, particularly concern about the safety of the vaccines is crucial in general.","Yang, Yong; Dobalian, Aram; Ward, Kenneth D",J. community health,240,16

Routinely recorded, clinical data, up to the 24th of April 2020, from the 2075 patients with Covid-19, admitted in 17 hospitals in Spain between the 1st of March and the 20th of April 2020 were used. The following variables were extracted for this study: age, gender, temperature, and saturation of oxygen on admission, treatment with heparin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, steroids, tocilizumab, a combination of lopinavir with ritonavir, and oseltamivir, together with data on mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate the associations. At the time of collecting the data, 301 patients had died, 1447 had been discharged home from the hospitals, 201 were still admitted, and 126 had been transferred to hospitals not included in the study. Median follow up time was 8 (IQR 5-12) days. Heparin had been used in 1734 patients. Heparin was associated with lower mortality when the model was adjusted for age and gender, with OR (95% CI) 0.55 (0.37-0.82) p = 0.003. This association remained significant when saturation of oxygen < 90%, and temperature > 37 °C were added to de model with OR 0.54 (0.36-0.82) p = 0.003, and also when all the other drugs were included as covariates OR 0.42 (0.26-0.66) p < 0.001. The association between heparin and lower mortality observed in this study can be acknowledged by clinicians in hospitals and in the community.

We performed a timely analysis of the Bavarian telestroke TEMPiS ""working diagnosis"" database. METHODS: Twelve hospitals from the TEMPiS network were selected. Data collected for January through April in years 2017 through 2020 were extracted and analyzed for presumed and definite ischemic stroke (IS), amongst other disorders. In addition, recommendations for intravenous thrombolysis (rtPA) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) were noted and mobility data of the region analyzed. If statistically valid, group-comparison was tested with Fisher's exact test considering unpaired observations and ap-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Upon lockdown in mid-March 2020, we observed a significant reduction in recommendations for rtPA compared to the preceding three years (14.7% [2017-2019] vs. 9.2% [2020], p = 0.0232). Recommendations for EVT were significantly higher in January to mid-March 2020 compared to 2017-2019 (5.4% [2017-2019] vs. 9.3% [2020], p = 0.0013) reflecting its increasing importance. Following the COVID-19 lockdown mid-March 2020 the number of EVT decreased back to levels in 2017-2019 (7.4% [2017-2019] vs. 7.6% [2020], p = 0.1719). Absolute numbers of IS decreased in parallel to mobility data. CONCLUSIONS: The reduced stroke incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic may in part be explained by patient avoidance to seek emergency stroke care and may have an association to population mobility. Increasing mobility may induce a rebound effect and may conflict with a potential second COVID-19 wave. Telemedical networks may be ideal databases to study such effects in near-real time.","Schlachetzki, Felix; Theek, Carmen; Hubert, Nikolai D; Kilic, Mustafa; Haberl, Roman L; Linker, Ralf A; Hubert, Gordian J",J Telemed Telecare,240,24

Evaluation of the present algorithm for prehospital ECG transmission is important to ensure correct and expeditious patient care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ECGs transmitted from the prehospital setting to a non-invasive department of cardiology. METHODS: At Lillebaelt Hospital, the cardiologist on-call evaluated and entered the transmitted ECGs and the associated transmission criteria into the Clinical Measurement System database (KMS). Furthermore, data from the KMS and the diagnoses at discharge were obtained from 2012 to 2015. RESULTS: A total of 9,751 ECGs were included in the study. ECG transmission increased by 35% from year one to year three (p less-than 0.05). A total of 362 patients (3.7%) had STEMI. 25% of all ECGs were transmitted without any obvious cardiac symptom but produced a diagnosis of other cardiac illnesses than acute coronary syndrome in 28% of these patients. The number of ECGs sent per adult inhabitant in the area per year was 1:85. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of ECGs are transmitted annually and at an increasing rate, and STEMI only comprises a very limited proportion of all transmitted ECGs to a non-invasive centre in Denmark.

O georreferenciamento, tomando como unidade os setores censitários, foi realizado a partir de informações cedidas pela Secretaria de Saúde de Bauru a respeito do endereço residencial dos pacientes acometidos pela enfermidade. A análise da distribuição espacial da doença demonstrou que os casos ocorreram especialmente na área urbana do município. As incidências cumulativas anuais de LVA, considerando os casos adotados por ano e as respectivas projeções populacionais, foram calculadas, evidenciando que a taxa mais elevada foi observada em 2006. Tal fato foi confirmado pelo delineamento da série histórica, que também derivou o cálculo da tendência, demonstrando que esta foi positiva durante o período analisado. O índice sazonal obtido foi confrontado com dados referentes às médias mensais de precipitação pluviométrica e temperatura do município, o que nos permitiu inferir que meses que obtiveram índices com valores superiores a um, eram, de maneira geral, precedidos por períodos chuvosos. A variável temperatura, por sua vez, apesar de provavelmente estar relacionada à ocorrência da enfermidade na região, aparentemente não exerceu influência na sazonalidade da doença por se apresentar sem oscilações importantes no período. A análise de clusters, utilizando o método estatístico espaço-temporal scan, detectou um provável aglomerado localizado nas regiões sudoeste e central do município no ano de 2006. Uma análise descritiva univariada, comparando setores censitários que apresentaram LVA com relação aos que não relataram casos da doença, foi conduzida.

The present study reports meat and meat product waste in the German HaFS business sector based on structured telephone interviews. Purchased fresh meat and meat product quantities, as well as waste during storage, due to preparation and leftovers, are captured for four different market segments. Waste ratios referring to weekly meat purchases are analysed and compared between these segments, as well as on the business-type level. In this context, the authors distinguish total and avoidable meat waste. Absolute meat waste volumes are extrapolated on a weighted base for the entire German HaFS sector.

Immunomodulatory therapy is gaining interest in COVID-19, but this strategy has received less attention in other respiratory viral infections than it deserved. In this review we suggest that based on the similarities of the immune dysfunction in the severe cases of different respiratory viral infections, some lessons from the immunomodulatory therapy of COVID-19 (particularly regarding the choice of an immunomodulatory drug, the selection of patients and optimal time window for this kind of therapy) could be applied for some cases of severe influenza infection and probably for some future outbreaks of novel severe respiratory viral infections.","Ryabkova, Varvara A; Churilov, Leonid P; Shoenfeld, Yehuda",Clin Immunol,240,20

The objective of this study is to analyse clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a cohort of women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and their newborns exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during gestation. METHODS: Multicentric observational study of Spanish hospitals from the GESNEO-COVD cohort, participants in RECLIP (Spanish Network of Paediatric Clinical Assays). Women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR and/or serology during pregnancy, diagnosed and delivering during the period 15/03/2020-31/07/2020 were included. Epidemiological, clinical, and analytical data was collected. RESULTS: A total of 105 pregnant women with a median of 34.1 years old (IQR: 28.8-37.1) and 107 newborns were included. Globally, almost 65% of pregnant women had some COVID-19 symptoms and more than 43% were treated for SARS-COV-2. Overall, 30.8% of pregnant women had pneumonia and 5 (4.8%) women were admitted to the intensive care unit needing invasive mechanical ventilation. There was a rate of 36.2% of caesarean sections, which was associated with pneumonia during pregnancy (OR: 4.203, CI 95%: 1.473-11.995) and lower gestational age at delivery (OR: 0.724, CI 95%: 0.578-0.906). The prevalence of preterm birth was 20.6% and prematurity was associated with pneumonia during gestation (OR: 6.970, CI95%: 2.340-22.750) and having a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at delivery (OR: 6.520, CI95%: 1.840-31.790). All nasopharyngeal PCR in newborns were negative at birth and one positivized at 15 days of life. Two newborns died, one due to causes related to prematurity and another of unexpected sudden death during early skin-to-skin contact after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Although vertical transmission has not been reported in this cohort, the prognosis of newborns could be worsened by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy as COVID-19 pneumonia increased the risk of caesarean section deliveries and preterm births.","Carrasco, Itzíar; Muñoz-Chapuli, Mar; Vigil-Vázquez, Sara; Aguilera-Alonso, David; Hernández, Concepción; Sánchez-Sánchez, César; Oliver, Cristina; Riaza, Mónica; Pareja, Marta; Sanz, Olga; Pérez-Seoane, Beatriz; López, Juan; Márquez, Elena; Domínguez-Rodríguez, Sara; Hernanz-Lobo, Alicia; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio; Sánchez-Luna, Manuel; Navarro, María Luisa",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,240,33

As the disease continues to spread rapidly, the development of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches is urgently required. Although some progress has been made in understanding the viral structure and invasion mechanism of coronaviruses that may cause severe cases of the syndrome, due to the limited understanding of the immune effects caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is difficult for us to prevent patients from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the major complications of coronavirus infection. Therefore, any potential treatments should focus not only on direct killing of coronaviruses and prevention strategies by vaccine development, but also on keeping in check the acute immune/inflammatory responses, resulting in ARDS and PF. In addition, potential treatments currently under clinical trials focusing on killing coronaviruses or on developing vaccines preventing coronavirus infection largely ignore the host immune response. However, taking care of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with ARDS and PF is considered to be the major difficulty. Therefore, further understanding of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important for clinical resolution and saving medication cost. In addition to a breif overview of the structure, infection mechanism, and possible therapeutic approaches, we summarized and compared the hematopathologic effect and immune responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discussed the indirect immune response caused by SARS and direct infection, replication, and destroying of immune cells by MERS-CoV. The molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection-induced lymphopenia or cytokine storm may provide some hint toward fight against SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus. This may provide guidance over using immune therapy as a combined treatment to prevent patients developing severe respiratory syndrome and largely reduce complications.","Liang, Yanwen; Wang, Mong-Lien; Chien, Chian-Shiu; Yarmishyn, Aliaksandr A; Yang, Yi-Ping; Lai, Wei-Yi; Luo, Yung-Hung; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Chen, Yann-Jang; Chang, Pei-Ching; Chiou, Shih-Hwa",Front Immunol,240,16

Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infection are scarce. We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurological symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia, and sensory loss with tingling of all extremities were found, which began 10 days before. The modified Erasmus Giullain-Barré Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a segmental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly during treatment with immunoglobulins. Our case draws attention to the occurrence of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not experience respiratory or general symptoms. It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms.

The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web ""Time and Date"". RESULTS: In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.12±24.33); cumulative cases (9094.34±708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.84±43.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72±207.37); cumulative cases (44232.38±5875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29±310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (ß = -5.40, p<0.001) and (ß = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1°C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (ß = -1.35. p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed a significant decrease in incidence of daily cases and deaths in countries with high temperatures and low humidity (warmest countries), compared to those countries with low temperatures and high humidity (coldest countries). The findings could be of interest to the policymakers and the health officials on the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 pandemic and weather changes.","Meo, S A; Abukhalaf, A A; Alomar, A A; Al-Beeshi, I Z; Alhowikan, A; Shafi, K M; Meo, A S; Usmani, A M; Akram, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,240,23

METHODS: Medical charts of 3,694 of patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy were reviewed to extract information on demographics, preexisting comorbidities, and in-hospital complications leading to death. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to assess the association of obesity with nonrespiratory complications. These analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and number of preexisting comorbidities. RESULTS: Obesity was present in 411/3,694 (11.1%) patients dying with COVID-19. Obesity was significantly associated with increased probability of experiencing acute renal failure (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.33; 95% CI: 1.04-1.71) and shock (adjusted OR, 1.54; 95% CI: 1.19-1.99). The associations of obesity with acute renal failure and shock were stronger in patients aged < 60 years (adjusted OR, 2.00; 95% CI: 1.09-3.67 and OR, 2.37; 95% CI 1.29-4.36) than in those aged 60 years or older (adjusted OR, 1.20; 95% CI: 0.90-1.60 and OR, 1.22; 95% CI: 0.91-1.65). CONCLUSIONS: In patients dying with COVID-19 in Italy, obesity is associated with an increased probability of nonrespiratory complications, particularly shock and acute renal failure. These associations seem stronger in younger than in older adults. Strategies should be put in place in patients with COVID-19 with obesity to prevent these complications.","Onder, Graziano; Palmieri, Luigi; Vanacore, Nicola; Giuliano, Marina; Brusaferro, Silvio",Obesity (Silver Spring),240,1

The study focuses on the effects of containment and mitigation measures, on the behavior of children and youth (CaY) with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The study primary aim was to examine the impact of these urgent measures on the behaviors, communication, sleep, and nutritional status of the CaY. A secondary aim was to explore risk and protective factors on behavior change including sociodemographic variables, living conditions, ASD symptom severity and continuity of interventions. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 239 ASD subjects, 2-21 years of age, enrolled in the ELENA cohort in France at Stage 3 confinement and mitigation measures announced on March 16, 2020. A parent informant completed the COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: Of the domains examined, challenging behaviors, communicative skills and sleep had the greatest impact; in terms of risk and protective factors, subject age, ASD severity, single parenthood, daily living skills, and intervention continuity were most likely to impact behaviors; living conditions were not linked to behavior change. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the topography of behavioral change in CaY with ASD following institution of containment and mitigation measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and help identify risk and protective factors to help better address needs and tailor interventions in the future.","Berard, Mathilde; Rattaz, Cécile; Peries, Marianne; Loubersac, Julie; Munir, Kerim; Baghdadli, Amaria",J Psychiatr Res,240,6

OBJECTIVES: We assessed of the risk of illness due to airborne SARS-CoV-2 particles from breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing in indoor environments. METHODS: A risk assessment model, AirCoV2, for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 particles in aerosol droplets was developed. Previously published data on droplets expelled by breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing by an infected person were used as inputs. Scenarios encompassed virus concentration, exposure time, and ventilation. Newly collected data of virus RNA copies in mucus from patients are presented. RESULTS: The expelled volume of aerosols was highest for a sneeze, followed by a cough, singing, speaking, and breathing.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism among healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the USA. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.4 to 8.7%, and the effectiveness of school closures as a 7.6% and 8.4% reduction in fewer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, respectively, at peak demand when varying across initial reproduction number estimates by state. At the county level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, 9.5% (interquartile range (IQR) 8.2-10.9%) of healthcare worker households and 5.2% (IQR 4.1-6.5%) and 6.8% (IQR 4.8-8.8%) reduction in fewer hospital and ICU beds, respectively, at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p<0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 76.3 to 96.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU and hospital demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible trade-off between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.","Chin, Elizabeth T; Huynh, Benjamin Q; Lo, Nathan C; Hastie, Trevor; Basu, Sanjay",BMC Med,240,26

Methodology: We describe the first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease in Córdoba (Argentina), which presented in a patient without comorbidities in good clinical condition, and therefore ambulatory management using telemedicine was decided, which was satisfactory. Results: Outpatient management using telemedicine turned out to be optimal, avoiding the use of beds and the transmission of the virus within the hospital through management at home. Conclusion: Outpatient management of selected patients avoids virus transmission within the hospital and saturation of beds.

It also defines ""isolated"" and ""combined"" tremor syndromes depending on whether tremor is the sole clinical manifestation or is associated with other neurological or systemic signs. This syndromic approach provides a guide to investigate the underlying etiology of tremors, either genetic or acquired. Several genetic defects have been proven to cause tremor disorders, including autosomal dominant and recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial diseases, as well as chromosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, some tremor syndromes are recognized in individuals with a positive family history, but their genetic confirmation is pending. Although most genetic tremor disorders show a combined clinical picture, there are some distinctive conditions in which tremor may precede the appearance of other neurological signs by years or remain the prominent manifestation throughout the disease course, previously leading to misdiagnosis as essential tremor (ET). Advances in the knowledge of genetically determined tremors may have been hampered by the inclusion of heterogeneous entities in previous studies on ET. The recent classification of tremors therefore aims to provide more consistent clinical data for deconstructing the genetic basis of tremor syndromes in the next-generation and long-read sequencing era. This review outlines the wide spectrum of tremor disorders with defined or presumed genetic etiology, both isolated and combined, unraveling diagnostic clues of these conditions and focusing mainly on ET-like phenotypes. Furthermore, we suggest a phenotype-to-genotype algorithm to support clinicians in identifying tremor syndromes and guiding genetic investigations.","Magrinelli, Francesca; Latorre, Anna; Balint, Bettina; Mackenzie, Melissa; Mulroy, Eoin; Stamelou, Maria; Tinazzi, Michele; Bhatia, Kailash P",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,240,20

AIMS: To evaluate the effects of different coping strategies on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: A representative sample for Austria was recruited through Qualtrics® in a period of 4 weeks after the lockdown started. Measurements were coping inventory (SCI), psychological quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF, psychological domain), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and insomnia (ISI). Regression analyses were performed with coping strategies as predictors and mental health measures as dependent variables. RESULTS: The representative sample included N = 1,005 respondents (52.7% women). Positive thinking, active stress coping and social support were found to be positive predictors for psychological life quality, well-being, and negative predictors for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Alcohol and cigarette consumption was a negative predictor for psychological life quality, and well-being, and a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Support in faith was a positive predictor for perceived stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Coping strategies are significant predictors for mental health measures. Education about positive thinking, active coping, and social support could be beneficial for dealing with a decrease in mental health due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Budimir, Sanja; Probst, Thomas; Pieh, Christoph",J Ment Health,240,5

The United Nations' 2018 report on levels and trends on child mortality indicated that under-five mortality is one of the major public health problems in Ghana with a rate of 60 deaths per 1000 live births. To further mitigate this problem, it is important to identify the drivers of under-five mortality in order to achieve the United Nations SDG Goal 3 target 2. Methods: In this study, we investigated the effects of some selected risk factors on child mortality using data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic Health Survey. We modelled the relationship between child mortality and the risk factors using a logistic regression model under the frequentist and Bayesian frameworks. We used the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm to simulate parameter estimates from the posterior distributions, and statistical analyses were carried out using STATA version 14.1. Results: Results from the frequentist framework are in line with those from the Bayesian framework. The results showed an increased risk of death among children who were delivered through caesarean and reduced relative odds of death among children whose sizes are average or large at birth and whose mothers have formal education. Conclusions: There is a need for improved health facilities for better health-care for mothers and children. Education should, among other things, emphasise on the need for mothers to go for regular check-ups during antinatal and postnatal periods for improved mother and child health.","Iddrisu, Abdul-Karim; Tawiah, Kassim; Bukari, Francis Kwame; Kumi, Williams",Biomed Res Int,240,20

There is an abundance of literature relating to the preventative nature of breastmilk and breastfeeding against many infectious diseases and chronic conditions. However, despite medically complex infants and children being a group that could benefit most from continued breastfeeding, breastfeeding duration and exclusivity are lower among more complex paediatric populations. The reasons for this are not well known, and there is a paucity of data relating to supporting infants who have acute or chronic illness, disability or congenital anomaly to breastfeed. This systematic review aimed to understand the challenges of breast/chestfeeding the medically complex child and to establish the gaps in healthcare provision that act as barriers to optimal infant and young child feeding. The search was limited to studies published in English, focused on breastfed sick infants in hospital, with no date limits as there is no previous systematic review. Of 786 papers retrieved, 11 studies were included for review, and seven themes identified. Themes included practical and psychological challenges of continuing to breastfeed in a hospital setting, complications of the condition making breastfeeding difficult, lack of specialist breastfeeding support from hospital staff and a lack of availability of specialist equipment to support complex breastfeeding. The findings affirm the lack of consistent high-quality care for lactation support in paediatric settings and reinforce the need for further focused research in this area.","Hookway, Lyndsey; Lewis, Jan; Brown, Amy",Matern Child Nutr,240,16

The gruesome effects of microbial threats create considerable repercussions on the healthcare systems. The continually evolving nature of causative viruses due to mutation or re-assortment sometimes makes existing medicines and vaccines inactive. As a rapid response to such outbreaks, much emphasis has been placed on personal protective equipment (PPE), especially face mask, to prevent infectious diseases from airborne pathogens. Wearing face masks in public reduce disease transmission and creates a sense of community solidarity in collectively fighting the pandemic. However, excessive use of single-use polymer-based face masks can pose a significant challenge to the environment and is increasingly evident in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, face masks with inherent antimicrobial properties can help in real-time deactivation of microorganisms enabling multiple-use and reduces secondary infections. Given the advantages, several efforts are made incorporating natural and synthetic antimicrobial agents (AMA) to produce face mask with enhanced safety, and the literature about such efforts are summarised. The review also discusses the literature concerning the current and future market potential and environmental impacts of face masks. Among the AMA tested, metal and metal-oxide based materials are more popular and relatively matured technology. However, the repeated use of such a face mask may pose a danger to the user and environment due to leaching/detachment of nanoparticles. So careful consideration is required to select AMA and their incorporation methods to reduce their leaching and environmental impacts. Also, systematic studies are required to establish short-term and long-term benefits.","Pullangott, Gayathri Kannan Uthradevi S Gayathri Kiran Degala Venkata Maliyekkal Shihabudheen M.",RSC advances,240,16

Yet, without receiving any bailout or palliatives from the government, these businesses are required to meet their tax obligations to the government. Bearing in mind that this time (COVID-19 era) is different, one wonders what is required of businesses in view of the taxation problem and the social contract between the businesspersons and the government. In view of social contract obligations, in this COVID-19 pandemic should businesses pay tax to a government that seems to have delegitimised itself by its exploitative actions in terms of taxation and delinquent omission in terms of the provision of public goods and social services? The Nigerian government at all tiers (federal, state and local) seldom respect the essence of taxation. Therefore, businesses often pay tax for nothing. For many businesses, as far as taxation is concerned, to pay or not to pay? that is the question. This article is aimed at teasing out this taxation problem that may or may not be a moral dilemma.

Rapid recovery, ambulatory procedures, and bundled payments have altered the burden of care, with multiple studies showing an increase in physician work. Policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allow for precise documentation of patient touchpoints. We analyzed the duration of video, telephone, and text messaging to quantify modern arthroplasty work. METHODS: Consecutive primary hip, knee, and partial knee arthroplasties, performed 30 days before March 15, 2020 (date of practice closure), were included from a single institution, yielding 47 cases. We retrospectively quantified the duration of video telehealth documentation, telephone logs, and text messages over 90 days to calculate the postoperative work required in modern arthroplasty using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: An average of 9.4 touchpoints (2-14) by the surgeons occurred during the global period for this cohort, totaling 219 minutes (51-247 minutes). This included an average of 21 minutes of day-0 calls to family, 117 minutes for video visits, 52 minutes for phone calls, and 29 minutes for text messaging and wound photos.

Phubbing involves attending to and performing competing tasks, implying the involvement of attentional abilities. Yet, past research has not yet used a cognitive framework to establish a link between phubbing and attention. Using self-report data from a large online sample, we explored the associations between phubbing and everyday attentional failures. Phubbing was associated with difficulties in attentional shifting and distractibility, frequent attentional lapses, spontaneous and deliberate mind wandering, and attention-related cognitive errors. When examining these attention variables alongside several psychosocial and personality variables, attention-related cognitive errors acted as the biggest predictor of phubbing behavior. Phubbing was also positively correlated with media multitasking, which is a conceptually similar yet distinct technology use behavior. The results suggest that perceived everyday attentional failures are strongly associated with, and to an extent can predict, phubbing behavior, even more so than some social and personality variables. Technology has incorporated itself as a necessity, or at the very least a favored convenience, in most people’s lives. Characterizing technology multitasking behaviors from a variety of frameworks can help us better understand who is engaging in these behaviors and why.","Ward, Nathan",Future Internet,240,1

Thereby, a sequence of labels is assigned for each time series. Completion of the last label sequence permits prediction of individual time series.

Self-specimen collection methods have been successfully used in HIV and sexually transmitted infection research and can provide a feasible opportunity to scale up SARS-CoV-2 testing for research purposes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of adults to use different specimen collection modalities for themselves and children as part of a COVID-19 research study. METHODS: Between March 27 and April 1, 2020, we recruited 1435 adults aged 18 years or older though social media advertisements. Participants completed a survey that included 5-point Likert scale items stating how willing they were to use the following specimen collection testing modalities as part of a research study: home collection of a saliva sample, home collection of a throat swab, home finger-prick blood collection, drive-through site throat swab, clinic throat swab, and clinic blood collection. Additionally, participants indicated how the availability of home-based collection methods would impact their willingness to participate compared to drive-through and clinic-based specimen collection. We used Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations to assess if willingness to use each testing modality differed by demographic variables and characteristics of interest. We compared the overall willingness to use each testing modality and estimated effect sizes with Cohen d. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 1435 participants with a median age of 40.0 (SD=18.2) years and over half of which were female (761/1435, 53.0%). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed that they would be willing to use specimens self-collected at home to participate in research, including willingness to collect a saliva sample (1259/1435, 87.7%) or a throat swab (1191/1435, 83.1%). Willingness to collect a throat swab sample was lower in both a drive-through setting (64%) and clinic setting (53%). Overall, 69.0% (990/1435) of participants said they would be more likely to participate in a research study if they could provide a saliva sample or throat swab at home compared to going to a drive-through site; only 4.4% (63/1435) of participants said they would be less likely to participate using self-collected samples. For each specimen collection modality, willingness to collect specimens from children for research was lower than willingness to use on oneself, but the ranked order of modalities was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants were willing to participate in a COVID-19 research study that involves laboratory testing; however, there was a strong preference for home specimen collection procedures over drive-through or clinic-based testing. To increase participation and minimize bias, epidemiologic research studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune response should consider home specimen collection methods.","Hall, Eric William; Luisi, Nicole; Zlotorzynska, Maria; Wilde, Gretchen; Sullivan, Patrick; Sanchez, Travis; Bradley, Heather; Siegler, Aaron J",J Med Internet Res,240,7

However, the effects of FAW on the airflow at surgical sites under non-LAF (nLAF) ventilation systems remain unclear, as nLAF systems generate outlet-to-inlet multidirectional airflows of the air conditioning system. Here, we evaluate the effects of FAW on the airflow and sanitation quality in surgical fields with nLAF ventilation systems. Methods: : The airflow speed and direction were measured using a three-dimensional ultrasonic anemometer. Sanitation quality was evaluated by measuring the amount of dust particles after the activation of air conditioning. Results: : FAW caused no meaningful airflow (> 10 cm/sec) and did not diminish the sanitation quality in the surgical field separated by the anesthesia screen. Above the head area, the upward FAW airflow was not counteracted by nLAF, which caused an upward airflow at the edges of the operating table, originating from outside of the operating table and the floor.

RAS inhibitors seemed to interfere with the ACE2 receptor, and their safety was addressed in COVID-19 patients. Pedrosa et al. (Clin. Sci. (Lond.) (2021), 135, 465-481) showed in rats that captopril and candesartan up-regulated ACE2 expression and the protective RAS pathway in lung tissue. In culture of pneumocytes, the captopril/candesartan-induced ACE2 up-regulation was associated with inhibition of ADAM17 activity, counterbalancing increased ACE2 expression, which was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 spike protein entry. If confirmed in humans, these results could become the pathophysiological background for justifying RAS inhibitors as cornerstone cardiovascular protectives even during COVID-19 pandemic.","Simko, Fedor; Baka, Tomas",Clin Sci (Lond),240,25

These assays need to target conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 global variants and avoid cross-reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses. To contribute to this effort, we employed an in silico immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to identify immunogenic peptides resulting from conserved and highly networked regions with topological importance from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and spike proteins. A total of 57 highly networked T-cell epitopes that are conserved across geographic viral variants were identified from these viral proteins, with a binding potential to diverse HLA alleles and 80 to 100% global population coverage. Importantly, 18 of these T-cell epitope derived peptides had limited homology to seasonal human coronaviruses making them promising candidates for SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity assays. Moreover, two of the NC-derived peptides elicited effector/polyfunctional responses of CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients.IMPORTANCE The development of specific and validated immunologic tools is critical for understanding the level and duration of the cellular response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccines against this novel coronavirus disease. To contribute to this effort, we employed an immunoinformatics analysis pipeline to define 57 SARS-CoV-2 immunogenic peptides within topologically important regions of the nucleocapsid (NC) and spike (S) proteins that will be effective for detecting cellular immune responses in 80 to 100% of the global population. Our immunoinformatics analysis revealed that 18 of these peptides had limited homology to circulating seasonal human coronaviruses and therefore are promising candidates for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses from pre-existing coronavirus immunity. Importantly, CD8+ T cells derived from SARS-CoV-2 survivors exhibited polyfunctional effector responses to two novel NC-derived peptides identified as HLA-binders. These studies provide a proof of concept that our immunoinformatics analysis pipeline identifies novel immunogens which can elicit polyfunctional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses.","Lee, Eunok; Sandgren, Kerrie; Duette, Gabriel; Stylianou, Vicki V; Khanna, Rajiv; Eden, John-Sebastian; Blyth, Emily; Gottlieb, David; Cunningham, Anthony L; Palmer, Sarah",J. virol,240,10

Results were compared with infant formulas. We observed increased levels of total fatty acids and, in particular, saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in milk from mothers fed on a vegetable and fruit-rich diet compared with a Mediterranean diet. In the same milk, a reduced antioxidant potential was found. All infant formulas resulted in richer total fatty acid content than human breast milk. Only some formulas were qualitatively similar to breast milk. Of note, the antioxidant potential of the formulas was higher or lower than the human milk with the exception of one sample. The antioxidant potential of four formulas was very high. Dietary supplementation with antioxidants has been shown to have a teratogenic effect and to increase the formation of metastases in adult.

The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5­11°C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33·4 %; Chile 26·4 %) and mid-latitude (France 27·3 %; Portugal 21·2 %; Austria 19·3 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.","Kara, Murat; Ekiz, Timur; Ricci, Vincenzo; Kara, Özgür; Chang, Ke-Vin; Özçakar, Levent",Br J Nutr,240,1

Conversely, Alberto Fernández and Pedro Sánchez are more akin to the pop politician profile, posting photographs and media messages with a view to receiving press coverage. Both post tweets, based on values and historical events, aimed at their grassroots supporters. The main conclusion is that the pandemic has enhanced the presidential and personalist profiles of the four leaders, although their actions during the COVID-19 crisis were not necessarily in keeping with the populist paradigm. Thus, Sánchez and Bolsonaro implemented a health management communication strategy, while López Obrador and Fernández paid scant attention to health policy.","Manfredi-Sánchez, Juan-Luis Amado-Suárez Adriana Waisbord Silvio",Comunicar: Media Education Research Journal,240,1

We report the clinical and biochemical features of liver involvement, and the comorbidities that present with hepatitis, in a substantial cohort of patients. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 44 patients with MIS-C admitted at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian during April and May 2020. We evaluated the number of patients who developed hepatitis and examined both demographics and inflammatory laboratory values to ascertain those that were at higher risk for liver involvement and more severe disease. Hepatitis was present in 19 subjects (43%) and was associated with more severe disease. Persons with hepatitis had significantly higher rates of shock at presentation (21.1% vs. 0%; P = 0.008), greater respiratory support requirement (42.1% vs. 12%; P = 0.005), and longer hospitalization times (median, 7 [interquartile range {IQR}, 5, 10] vs. 4 days [IQR, 3.5, 6.5]; P < 0.05). Patients with hepatitis also had significantly higher levels of ferritin (706.9 vs. 334.2 mg/mL; P < 0.01), interleukin-6 (233.9 vs. 174.7 pg/mL; P < 0.05), troponin (83.0 vs. 28.5 ng/L; P < 0.05), and B-type natriuretic peptide (7,424.5 vs. 3,209.5 pg/mL; P < 0.05). The single patient with liver failure also developed multiorgan failure requiring vasopressors, hemodialysis, and mechanical ventilation. All patients were discharged, though >50% had persistent hepatitis up to 1 month after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis is common in children with MIS-C and is associated with a more severe presentation and persistent elevation of liver function tests in many. Despite the positive outcomes reported here, close follow-up is warranted given the limited knowledge of the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver.","Cantor, Amanda; Miller, Jonathan; Zachariah, Philip; DaSilva, Bernardo; Margolis, Kara; Martinez, Mercedes",Hepatology,240,20

It is found that a chargesless massless particle moving along the null trajectory in Eddington-Finkelstein (EF) coordinates feels instability in the vicinity of the horizon. Such instability is observer independent for this particle motion. Moreover, an observer associated to EF coordinates finds the local Hamiltonian as $xp$ where $p$ is the canonical momentum corresponding the coordinate $x$. Finally, using this Hamiltonian we notice that at the quantum level this class of observers feel the horizon as thermal object with temperature is given by the Hawking expression. We provide this by using various techniques in quantum mechanics and thereby bolstered our earlier claim -- the automatic local instability can be a mechanism for emerging horizon as a thermal object. In this process, the present analysis provides another set of coordinates (namely EF frame), in addition to our earlier Painleve ones, in which the null trajectory of the massless particle is governed by $xp$ type Hamiltonian in near the horizon regime.","Dalui, Surojit; Majhi, Bibhas Ranjan",,240,26

One measure put in place to contain the spread of the disease is self-quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to the disease. While officials expect the public to comply with such regulation, studies suggest that a major obstacle to compliance for self-quarantine is concern over loss of income or employment due to the prolonged absence from work. METHODS: A cohort study of the adult population of Israel was conducted in two time points during the COVID-19 outbreak, the last week of February and the third week of March 2020, in order to assess public attitudes. In particular, public compliance rates to self-quarantine with and without State-sponsored compensation for lost wages were assessed. RESULTS: The results suggest that public attitudes changed as the threat increased, making people more compliant with regulations. In February 2020, compliance rate for self-quarantine dropped from 94% to less than 57% when monetary compensation for lost wages was removed; however, in March 2020 this drop became more moderate (from 96 to 71%). The multivariate logistic regression revealed that older, non-Jewish, worried over COVID-19, and trusting the Ministry of Health were more likely than their counterparts to comply with self-isolation, even when monetary compensation was not assumed. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effects of threat on people's obedience with regulations, this study demonstrates that providing people with assurances about their livelihood during absence from work remains an important component in compliance with public health regulations.","Bodas, Moran; Peleg, Kobi",Isr J Health Policy Res,240,15

OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to evaluate the association of a battery of fulfillment, job satisfaction change, COVID-19 concerns, and coping measures. Our secondary objective was to determine whether the fulfillment and coping measures differed by gender and by experience levels among a battery of physician specialties. METHODS: The study was a purposive sample of convenience. Study participants included all trainees and attending orthopedic surgeons from our academic institution; all participants were invited to complete a survey built around a validated measure of professional fulfillment aimed at assessing response to acute change and stressors. We performed univariate statistics and a matrix correlational analysis to correlate different survey domains with variables of interest. RESULTS: The survey was sent electronically to 138 individuals; 63 surveys were completed (response rateâ=â45.7%). Twenty-seven (42.8%) individuals met the threshold criteria for fulfillment whereas 10 (15.9%) met the threshold for burnout. We found that surgeon perspectives on COVID-19 were not associated with burnout or professional fulfillment. Burnout was inversely associated with professional fulfillment (Râ=â-0.35). Support seeking was noted to be correlated with professional fulfillment (Râ=â0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Stressors related to COVID-19 pandemic were not correlated with physician burnout and fulfillment. This held true even when stratifying by gender and by attending vs. trainee.

COVID-19 managed to spread worldwide and so far more than 9.1 million cases and more than 4.7 lakh death has been reported globally. Children, pregnant women, elderly population, immunocompromised patients, and patients with conditions like asthma, diabetes, etc. are highly vulnerable to COVID infection. Currently, there is no treatment available for COVID-19 infection. Traditional medicinal plants have provided bioactive molecules in the past that are efficiently used during conditions like cancer, malaria, microbial infections, immune-compromised states, etc. AYUSH India has recommended the use of Curcuma longa, Allium sativum, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Withania somnifera for immune-boosting during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we investigated the potential of 63-major bioactive molecules of these plants against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) through docking studies and compared the results with known inhibitor 11a. Our results proposed cuscohygrine, Î³-Glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, anahygrine, and S-allylcystein as the potent inhibitors against Mpro identified using molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics. Interestingly, these molecules are from A. sativum, and W. somnifera, which are known for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory potential. None of the proposed molecules have earlier been reported as antiviral molecules. Our results predict very strong potential of these four-molecules against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, especially Î³-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, as all four form hydrogen bonding with Glu166 that is a crucial residue for the formation of the biologically active dimeric form of Mpro. Therefore, we strongly recommend further research on these biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2.","Parashar, Arun; Shukla, Arpit; Sharma, Ankush; Behl, Tapan; Goswami, Dweipayan; Mehta, Vineet",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,240,23

Here, we examine the relationship between self-reported cognitive biases (CB) and emotion regulation skills (ER), COVID-19 risk perception and affective response, and mental well-being (MWB). Five Hundred and Eleven individuals completed General Health Questionnaire, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Davos Assessment of Cognitive Biases Scale (DACOBS) as well as scales measuring COVID-19 risk perception and affective response during the initial days of the epidemic in Poland. We used path and bootstrapping analyses to examine the hypothesis that CB may shape MWB during COVID-19 pandemic both directly and indirectly by (i) decreasing ER capacity and (ii) by increasing COVID-19 risk perception and affective response. Negative effect of CB and positive effect of ER via cognitive reappraisal on MWB were observed in participants. Furthermore, in line with our hypothesis, we observed indirect effects of CB via increased COVID-19 risk perception and affective response and decreased use of reappraisal strategy, which all, in turn, were related to MWB. Finally, we found an indirect effect of CB on MWB through double mediation of suppression strategies and COVID-19 affective response. Results of the current study suggest that CB, which have been shown to be linked to a variety of mental health symptoms in non-clinical populations, may exacerbate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health outcomes.","Schudy, Anna; Zurek, Karolina; Wisniewska, Marcelina; Piejka, Aleksandra; GawÈ©da, Lukasz; Okruszek, Lukasz",Front Psychiatry,240,16

Regular testing of all afflicted individuals may not be feasible due to limited resources, as is true with HIV monitoring in resource-limited settings. Pooled testing methods have been developed in order to allow regular testing for all while reducing resource burden. However, the most commonly used methods do not make use of covariate information predictive of treatment failure, which could improve performance. We propose and evaluate four prediction-driven pooled testing methods that incorporate covariate information to improve pooled testing performance. We then compare these methods in the HIV treatment management setting to current methods with respect to testing efficiency, sensitivity, and number of testing rounds using simulated data and data collected in Rakai, Uganda. Results show that the prediction-driven methods increase efficiency by up to 20% compared with current methods while maintaining equivalent sensitivity and reducing number of testing rounds by up to 70%. When predictions were incorrect, the performance of prediction-based matrix methods remained robust. The best performing method using our motivating data from Rakai was a prediction-driven hybrid method, maintaining sensitivity over 96% and efficiency over 75% in likely scenarios.

Data evaluating agents with potential antiviral activity continue to expand, such that updated guidance is needed regarding use of these agents in children. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 20 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of COVID-19 in children, supportive care alone is suggested for most cases. For children with severe illness, defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement without need for non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), remdesivir is suggested, preferably as part of a clinical trial if available. Remdesivir should also be considered for critically ill children requiring invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. A duration of 5 days is appropriate for most patients. The panel recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir (or other protease inhibitors) for COVID-19 in children. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For children with severe or critical disease, this guidance offers an approach for decision-making regarding use of remdesivir.","Chiotos, Kathleen; Hayes, Molly; Kimberlin, David W; Jones, Sarah B; James, Scott H; Pinninti, Swetha G; Yarbrough, April; Abzug, Mark J; MacBrayne, Christine E; Soma, Vijaya L; Dulek, Daniel E; Vora, Surabhi B; Waghmare, Alpana; Wolf, Joshua; Olivero, Rosemary; Grapentine, Steven; Wattier, Rachel L; Bio, Laura; Cross, Shane J; Dillman, Nicholas O; Downes, Kevin J; Oliveira, Carlos R; Timberlake, Kathryn; Young, Jennifer; Orscheln, Rachel C; Tamma, Pranita D; Schwenk, Hayden T; Zachariah, Philip; Aldrich, Margaret L; Goldman, David L; Groves, Helen E; Rajapakse, Nipunie S; Lamb, Gabriella S; Tribble, Alison C; Hersh, Adam L; Thorell, Emily A; Denison, Mark R; Ratner, Adam J; Newland, Jason G; Nakamura, Mari M",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,240,24

There is currently no approved therapeutics for treating COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is considered a key therapeutic target by many researchers. Here we describe the identification of several monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. One human antibody, CA521FALA, demonstrated neutralization potential by immunizing human antibody transgenic mice. CA521FALA showed potent SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. CA521FALA also demonstrated having a long half-life of 9.5 days in mice and 9.3 days in rhesus monkeys. CA521FALA inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in SARS-CoV-2 susceptible mice at a therapeutic setting with virus titer of the lung reduced by 4.5 logs. Structural analysis by cryo-EM revealed that CA521FALA recognizes an epitope overlapping with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD in the Spike protein. CA521FALA blocks the interaction by binding all three RBDs of one SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer simultaneously. These results demonstrate the importance for antibody-based therapeutic interventions against COVID-19 and identifies CA521FALA a promising antibody that reacts with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to strongly neutralize its activity.","Song, Deyong; Wang, Wenbo; Dong, Chuangchuang; Ning, Zhenfei; Liu, Xiu; Liu, Chuan; Du, Guangying; Sha, Chunjie; Wang, Kailin; Lu, Jun; Sun, Baiping; Zhao, Yanyan; Wang, Qiaoping; Xu, Hongguang; Li, Ying; Shen, Zhenduo; Jiao, Jie; Wang, Ruiying; Tian, Jingwei; Liu, Wanhui; Wang, Lan; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Dou, Changlin",Commun Biol,240,12

It is highlighted that an increase in the predictive character depends on understanding the dynamics for the temporal evolution of the rate of contagion $\beta^*$. A semi-empirical model for this dynamics is formulated, where reaching $\beta^*\approx0$ due to isolation is achieved after the mean duration of the disease $\tau=1/\gamma$, in which the number of infected in the confined families has decreased. It is considered that $\beta^*(t)$ should have an abrupt decrease on the day of initiation of confinement and decrease until canceling at the end of the interval $\tau$. The analysis describes appropriately the infection curve for Germany. The model is applied to predict an infection curve for Cuba, which estimates a maximum number of infected as less than 2000 in the middle of May, depending on the rigor of the isolation. This is suggested by the ratio between the daily detected cases and the total. We consider the ratio between the observed and real infected cases (k) less than unity. The low value of k decreases the maximum obtained when $\beta^*-\gamma>0$. The observed evolution is independent of k in the linear region. The value of $\beta^*$ is also studied by time intervals, adjusting to the data of Cuba, Germany and South Korea. We compare the extrapolation of the evolution of Cuba with the contagion rate until 16.04.20 with that obtained by a strict quarantine at the end of April. This model with variable $\beta^*$ correctly describes the observed infected evolution curves. We emphasize that the desired maximum of the SIR infected curve is not the maximum standard with constant $\beta^*$, but one achieved due to quarantine when $\tilde R_0=\beta^*/\gamma<1$. For the countries controlling the epidemic the maxima are in the region in which SIR equations are linear.","Bizet, Nana Cabo; Oca, Alejandro Cabo Montes de",,240,1

As a result, surge models that rely on case counts to forecast hospital demand may be inaccurately influencing policy and decision-maker action. OBJECTIVE: Based on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence data derived from a statewide random sample (as opposed to relying on reported case counts), we determine the infection-hospitalization ratio (IHR), defined as the percentage of infected individuals who are hospitalized, for various demographic groups in Indiana. Furthermore, for comparison, we show the extent to which case-based hospitalization ratios, compared with the IHR, overestimate the probability of hospitalization by demographic group. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of statewide prevalence data from Indiana, COVID-19 hospitalization data extracted from a statewide health information exchange, and all reported COVID-19 cases to the state health department. SETTING: State of Indiana as of April 30, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic-stratified IHRs and case-hospitalization ratios. RESULTS: The overall IHR was 2.1% and varied more by age than by race or sex. Infection-hospitalization ratio estimates ranged from 0.4% for those younger than 40 years to 9.2% for those older than 60 years. Hospitalization rates based on case counts overestimated the IHR by a factor of 10, but this overestimation differed by demographic groups, especially age. CONCLUSIONS: In this first study of the IHR based on population prevalence, our results can improve forecasting models of hospital demand-especially in preparation for the upcoming winter period when an increase in SARS CoV-2 infections is expected.","Menachemi, Nir; Dixon, Brian E; Wools-Kaloustian, Kara K; Yiannoutsos, Constantin T; Halverson, Paul K",J Public Health Manag Pract,240,16

It is not known whether older adults are accessing emergency care differently from their younger counterparts. Our objective was to determine patterns of ED visit counts for emergent conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic for older adults. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational study. SETTING: Observational analysis of ED sites enrolled in a national clinical quality registry. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and sixty-four ED sites in 33 states from January 1, 2019 to November 15, 2020. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: We measured daily ED visit counts for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, sepsis, fall, and hip fracture, as well as deaths in the ED, by age categories. We estimated Poisson regression models comparing early and post-early pandemic periods (defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to the pre-pandemic period. We report incident rate ratios to summarize changes in visit incidence. RESULTS: For AMI, stroke, and sepsis, the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years) had the greatest decline in visit counts initially and the smallest recovery in the post-early pandemic periods. For falls, visits declined early and partially recovered uniformly across age categories. In contrast, hip fractures exhibited less change in visit rates across time periods. Deaths in the ED increased during the early pandemic period, but then fell and were persistently lower than baseline, especially for the older (75-84) and oldest old (85+ years). CONCLUSIONS: The decline in ED visits for emergent conditions among older adults has been more pronounced and persistent than for younger patients, with fewer deaths in the ED. This is concerning given the greater prevalence and risk of poor outcomes for emergent conditions in this age group that are amenable to time-sensitive ED diagnosis and treatment, and may in part explain excess mortality during the COVID-19 era among older adults.","Janke, Alexander T; Jain, Snigdha; Hwang, Ula; Rosenberg, Mark; Biese, Kevin; Schneider, Sandra; Goyal, Pawan; Venkatesh, Arjun K",J Am Geriatr Soc,240,27

This study aimed to determine a pre-test probability score for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study (4 University Hospitals) included patients with clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and results of blood tests (complete white blood cell count, serum electrolytes and CRP) were collected. A pre-test probability score was derived from univariate analyses of clinical and biological variables between patients and controls, followed by multivariate binary logistic analysis to determine the independent variables associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 605 patients were included between March 10th and April 30th, 2020 (200 patients for the training cohort, 405 consecutive patients for the validation cohort). In the multivariate analysis, lymphocyte (<1.3 G/L), eosinophil (<0.06 G/L), basophil (<0.04 G/L) and neutrophil counts (<5 G/L) were associated with high probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection but no clinical variable was statistically significant. The score had a good performance in the validation cohort (AUC = 0.918 (CI: [0.891-0.946]; STD = 0.014) with a Positive Predictive Value of high-probability score of 93% (95%CI: [0.89-0.96]). Furthermore, a low-probability score excluded SARS-CoV-2 infection with a Negative Predictive Value of 98% (95%CI: [0.93-0.99]). The performance of the score was stable even during the last period of the study (15-30th April) with more controls than infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: The PARIS score has a good performance to categorize the pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on complete white blood cell count. It could help clinicians adapt testing and for rapid triage of patients before test results.","Tordjman, Mickael; Mekki, Ahmed; Mali, Rahul D; Saab, Ines; Chassagnon, Guillaume; Guillo, Enora; Burns, Robert; Eshagh, Deborah; Beaune, Sebastien; Madelin, Guillaume; Bessis, Simon; Feydy, Antoine; Mihoubi, Fadila; Doumenc, Benoit; Mouthon, Luc; Carlier, Robert-Yves; Drapé, Jean-Luc; Revel, Marie-Pierre",PLoS One,240,24

Methods The data of 25 severe and critical COVID-19 patients, who were treated in our hospital from Jan. 23, 2020 to Mar. 5, 2020, were collected. The clinical characteristics were retrospectively analyzed, and the clinical and laboratory indexes were compared between cured patients and uncured patients. The laboratory indicators of cured patients were further compared between the progressive and recovery stages. The chest CT findings of the patients were observed, and the lesion volume was quantified to assess the evolution of lung lesions using the CT image-based intelligent pneumonia lesion quantitative analysis software. Results There were 19 male and six female COVID-19 patients, and there were three deaths. The median age of 25 patients was 65 (63, 75) years old, and the body mass index (BMI) was 25.60 (23.51, 28.65) kg/m2. Twenty-two patients had a clear epidemiological history. Fever (22 cases) and cough (14 cases) were the most common first symptoms, and 18 patients had underlying diseases. Twelve patients were cured and discharged (median hospital stay was 25.5 d), and 13 patients were not cured, including three deaths and 10 cases with hospital stay&gt;25 d with no remission. Compared with the uncured patients, the cured patients had significantly lower BMI, longer time from onset to progression to severe or critical illness, and higher CD4 +T lymphocyte counts (all P&lt;0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that high CD4 +T lymphocyte count was an independent protective factor for the cure and discharge of severe and critical COVID-19 patients (P=0.031). Compared with those in the progressive stage, the lymphocyte count and CD4 +T lymphocyte count of 12 cured patients were significantly higher in the progression stage, and the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin level were significantly lower (all P&lt;0.01). Twenty-one patients received chest CT examination in the progressive stage; and all of them had multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidation shadows of the multiple-lobe lateral band and the dorsal side of bilateral lungs, 20 cases had pleural thickening, 9 cases had a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion, and 8 cases had mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The 12 cured patients received CT examination during the recovery period, and their lesions were all improved to different extents; some patients had irregular fiber grid shadows and stripe shadows; and the pleural thickening and pleural effusion were reduced to different extents. The quantitative analysis curves showed that lesion volume in the 12 cured patients obviously increased in the progressive stage and reduced in the absorption stage, showing an inverted V shape; and lesion volume in the uncured patients (nine cases received CT examination for two or more times) showed a rapid increase in the progressive stage. Conclusion Most severe and critical COVID-19 patients in Shanghai are older, with higher BMI and underlying diseases. Low BMI, slow disease progression, and high CD4 +T lymphocyte count are beneficial to the improvement of COVID-19. The main findings of chest CT include multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidation shadows, mainly distributing in the lateral band and the dorsal side of lungs and mostly involving the pleura. The laboratory indexes, including the lymphocyte, CRP, CD4 +T lymphocyte, ESR and procalcitonin, and chest CT examination play an important role in the diagnosis, disease monitoring and prognosis assessment of COVID-19","Su, Zhou; Min, Yuan; Feng-Xiang, Song; Nan-Nan, Shi; Fei, Shan; Chao, Jiang; Yu-Xin, Shi",Acad.

Initial reports suggest that depression and anxiety are elevated during COVID-19, but no prior study has explored changes at the within-person level. The current study explored changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before the pandemic to soon after it first peaked in Spring 2020 in a sample of adolescents and young adults (N = 451) living in Long Island, New York, an early epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S. METHODS: Depression (Children's Depression Inventory) and anxiety symptoms (Screen for Child Anxiety Related Symptoms) were assessed between December 2014 and July 2019, and, along with COVID-19 experiences, symptoms were re-assessed between March 27th and May 15th, 2020. RESULTS: Across participants and independent of age, there were increased generalized anxiety and social anxiety symptoms. In females, there were also increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms. Multivariable linear regression indicated that greater COVID-19 school concerns were uniquely associated with increased depression symptoms. Greater COVID-19 home confinement concerns were uniquely associated with increased generalized anxiety symptoms, and decreased social anxiety symptoms, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults at an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. experienced increased depression and anxiety symptoms, particularly amongst females. School and home confinement concerns related to the pandemic were independently associated with changes in symptoms. Overall, this report suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is having multifarious adverse effects on the mental health of youth.","Hawes, Mariah T; Szenczy, Aline K; Klein, Daniel N; Hajcak, Greg; Nelson, Brady D",Psychol Med,240,24

Glucocorticoids may modulate inflammation-mediated lung injury and thereby reduce progression to respiratory failure and death. METHODS: In this controlled, open-label trial comparing a range of possible treatments in patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned patients to receive oral or intravenous dexamethasone (at a dose of 6 mg once daily) for up to 10 days or to receive usual care alone. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Here, we report the preliminary results of this comparison. RESULTS: A total of 2104 patients were assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4321 to receive usual care. Overall, 482 patients (22.9%) in the dexamethasone group and 1110 patients (25.7%) in the usual care group died within 28 days after randomization (age-adjusted rate ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 0.93; P<0.001). The proportional and absolute between-group differences in mortality varied considerably according to the level of respiratory support that the patients were receiving at the time of randomization. In the dexamethasone group, the incidence of death was lower than that in the usual care group among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (29.3% vs. 41.4%; rate ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.81) and among those receiving oxygen without invasive mechanical ventilation (23.3% vs. 26.2%; rate ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) but not among those who were receiving no respiratory support at randomization (17.8% vs. 14.0%; rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.55). CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality among those who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization but not among those receiving no respiratory support.

And it has also served to recognise and find alternative ways to transmit the knowledge. All things considered, the teacher has had the opportunity to contribute in creating an education model capable of boosting the development of new ways and methods of learning. Certain educational techniques and resources have been able to be recognised as ‘present’ or ‘absent’ in our education system. This implies that certain recourses have to be present, or that is required to optimise those that are available in order to teach, to learn, or to evaluate.

Objective: To estimate the association between administration of IL-6 antagonists compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality and other outcomes. Data Sources: Trials were identified through systematic searches of electronic databases between October 2020 and January 2021. Searches were not restricted by trial status or language. Additional trials were identified through contact with experts. Study Selection: Eligible trials randomly assigned patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to a group in whom IL-6 antagonists were administered and to a group in whom neither IL-6 antagonists nor any other immunomodulators except corticosteroids were administered. Among 72 potentially eligible trials, 27 (37.5%) met study selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In this prospective meta-analysis, risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis of odds ratios (ORs) for 28-day all-cause mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. There were 9 secondary outcomes including progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death and risk of secondary infection by 28 days. Results: A total of 10â¯930 patients (median age, 61 years [range of medians, 52-68 years]; 3560 [33%] were women) participating in 27 trials were included. By 28 days, there were 1407 deaths among 6449 patients randomized to IL-6 antagonists and 1158 deaths among 4481 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.79-0.95]; P = .003 based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis). This corresponds to an absolute mortality risk of 22% for IL-6 antagonists compared with an assumed mortality risk of 25% for usual care or placebo. The corresponding summary ORs were 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.92; P < .001) for tocilizumab and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.86-1.36; P = .52) for sarilumab. The summary ORs for the association with mortality compared with usual care or placebo in those receiving corticosteroids were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.68-0.87) for tocilizumab and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.61-1.38) for sarilumab. The ORs for the association with progression to invasive mechanical ventilation or death, compared with usual care or placebo, were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for all IL-6 antagonists, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.82) for tocilizumab, and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.74-1.34) for sarilumab. Secondary infections by 28 days occurred in 21.9% of patients treated with IL-6 antagonists vs 17.6% of patients treated with usual care or placebo (OR accounting for trial sample sizes, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85-1.16). Conclusions and Relevance: In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, administration of IL-6 antagonists, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.

The The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, became a central hub for the provision of trauma services for North Central/East London (NCEL) while providing a musculoskeletal tumour service for the south of England, the Midlands, and Wales and an urgent spinal service for London. This study reviews our paediatric practice over this period in order to share our experience and lessons learned. Our hospital admission pathways are described and the safety of surgical and interventional radiological procedures performed under general anaesthesia (GA) with regards to COVID-19 in a paediatric population are evaluated. Methods: All paediatric patients (&#8804; 16 years) treated in our institution during the six-week peak period of the pandemic were included. Prospective data for all paediatric trauma and urgent elective admissions and retrospective data for all sarcoma admissions were collected. Telephone interviews were conducted with all patients and families to assess COVID-19 related morbidity at 14 days post-discharge. Results: Overall, 100 children underwent surgery or interventional radiological procedures under GA between 20 March and 8 May 2020. There were 35 trauma cases, 20 urgent elective orthopaedic cases, two spinal emergency cases, 25 admissions for interventional radiology procedures, and 18 tumour cases. 78% of trauma cases were performed within 24 hours of referral. In the 97% who responded at two weeks following discharge, there were no cases of symptomatic COVID-19 in any patient or member of their households. Conclusion: Despite the extensive restructuring of services and the widespread concerns over the surgical and anaesthetic management of paediatric patients during this period, we treated 100 asymptomatic patients across different orthopaedic subspecialties without apparent COVID-19 or unexpected respiratory complications in the early postoperative period. The data provides assurance for health care professionals and families and informs the consenting process.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-6:287-292.","Iliadis, Alexis D; Eastwood, Deborah M; Bayliss, Lee; Cooper, Michael; Gibson, Alexander; Hargunani, Rikin; Calder, Peter",Bone Jt Open,240,1

METHODS: We used a descriptive phenomenological approach to understand the lived experience of pregnant women in COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data using a purposive sampling method through in-depth interviews in cyberspace with a semi-structured questionnaire. We used Colaizzi's seven-step content analysis method to analyze the research data with the help of MAXQDA software version 2020. RESULTS: We conducted this descriptive phenomenology study on 19 pregnant women in a period between the 10th to the 20th of May, 2020. The participating women were already pregnant when the first signs of the epidemic appeared in the country and at the time of the interview. We acquired four themes including disruption of the tranquility and regular routines of daily life, new challenges caused by the epidemic, resilience and strength in facing the crisis, and adaptation with new conditions.

Underpinning that response has been a highly effective virus containment strategy which relies on identification, isolation, and contact tracing of cases. The dramatic emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic rendered traditional paper-based systems for managing contact tracing no longer fit for purpose. A rapid digital transformation of the public health contact tracing system occurred to support this effort. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the digital transformation were to shift legacy systems (paper or standalone electronic systems) to a digitally enabled public health system, where data are centered around the consumer rather than isolated databases. The objective of this paper is to outline this case study and detail the lessons learnt to inform and give confidence to others contemplating digitization of public health systems in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This case study is set in Queensland, Australia. Universal health care is available. A multidisciplinary team was established consisting of clinical informaticians, developers, data strategists, and health information managers. An agile ""pair-programming"" approach was undertaken to application development and extensive change efforts were made to maximize adoption of the new digital workflows. Data governance and flows were changed to support rapid management of the pandemic. RESULTS: The digital coronavirus application (DCOVA) is a web-based application that securely captures information about people required to quarantine and creates a multiagency secure database to support a successful containment strategy. CONCLUSION: Most of the literature surrounding digital transformation allows time for significant consultation, which was simply not possible under crisis conditions.

The role of the climate and environment are essential factors to consider in transmission. We explored the association between global meteorological conditions (including mean temperature, wind speed, relative humidity and diurnal temperature range) and new cases of COVID-19 in the whole past year. We assessed the relative risk of meteorological factors to the onset of COVID-19 by using generalized additive models (GAM) and further analyzed the hysteresis effects of meteorological factors using the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Model (DLNM). Our findings revealed that the mean temperature, wind speed and relative humidity were negatively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19, and the diurnal temperature range was positively correlated with daily new cases of COVID-19. These relationships were more apparent when the temperature and relative humidity were lower than their average value (21.07°Cand 66.83%). The wind speed and diurnal temperature range were higher than the average value(3.07 m/s and 9.53 °C). The maximum RR of mean temperature was 1.30 under -23°C at lag ten days, the minimum RR of wind speed was 0.29 under 12m/s at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of range of temperature was 2.21 under 28 °C at lag 24 days, the maximum RR of relative humidity was 1.35 under 4% at lag 0 days. After a subgroup analysis of the countries included in the study, the results were still robust. As the Northern Hemisphere enters winter, the risk of global covid-19 remains high. Some countries have ushered in a new round of COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, active measures must be taken to control the source of infection, block transmission and prevent further spread of COVID-19 in winter.","Yuan, Jie; Wu, Yu; Jing, Wenzhan; Liu, Jue; Du, Min; Wang, Yaping; Liu, Min",Sci Total Environ,240,16

METHODS: We used a panel of 167 samples (77 pre-epidemic and 90 COVID-19 seroconverters) and SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2 and MERS-CoV Spike and/or Nucleopcapsid (NC) proteins to develop a high throughput multiplex screening assay to detect IgG antibodies in human plasma. Assay performances were determined by ROC curves analysis. A subset of the COVID-19+ samples (n = 36) were also tested by a commercial NC-based ELISA test and the results compared with those of the novel assay. RESULTS: On samples collected &#8805;14 days after symptoms onset, the accuracy of the assay is 100 % (95 % CI: 100-100) for the Spike antigen and 99.9 % (95 % CI:99.7-100) for NC. By logistic regression, we estimated that 50 % of the patients have seroconverted at 5.7 ± 1.6; 5.7 ± 1.8 and 7.9 ± 1.0 days after symptoms onset against Spike, NC or both antigens, respectively and all have seroconverted two weeks after symptoms onset. IgG titration in a subset of samples showed that early phase samples present lower IgG titers than those from later phase. IgG to SARS-CoV2 NC cross-reacted at 100 % with SARS-CoV1 NC. Twenty-nine of the 36 (80.5 %) samples tested were positive by the commercial ELISA while 31/36 (86.1 %) were positive by the novel assay. CONCLUSIONS: Our assay is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV2 proteins, suitable for high throughput epidemiological surveys. The novel assay is more sensitive than a commercial ELISA.","Ayouba, Ahidjo; Thaurignac, Guillaume; Morquin, David; Tuaillon, Edouard; Raulino, Raisa; Nkuba, Antoine; Lacroix, Audrey; Vidal, Nicole; Foulongne, Vincent; Le Moing, Vincent; Reynes, Jacques; Delaporte, Eric; Peeters, Martine",J Clin Virol,240,22

It is known that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, initiating the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Since its emergence, a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants have been reported, and the variants that show high infectivity are classified as the variants of concern according to the US CDC. In this study, we performed both all-atom steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations and microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments to characterize the binding interactions between ACE2 and RBD of all current variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta) and two variants of interest (Epsilon and Kappa). We report that the RBD of the Alpha (N501Y) variant requires the highest amount of force initially to be detached from ACE2 due to the N501Y mutation in addition to the role of N90-glycan, followed by Beta/Gamma (K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y) or Delta (L452R and T478K) variant. Among all variants investigated in this work, the RBD of the Epsilon (L452R) variant is relatively easily detached from ACE2. Our results combined SMD simulations and MST experiments indicate what makes each variant more contagious in terms of RBD and ACE2 interactions.

This symptom sometimes may be the only sign of the disease, therefore it must be research widely. OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate odor dysfunction in COVID-19 patients objectively and safely without any risk of transmitting the disease. METHODS: The odor threshold test was performed on 105 patients hospitalized at the XXXX Training and Research Hospital on the COVID-19 pandemic service before any treatment began. Odor threshold was tested using a modification of the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center olfactory function test. COVID-19 signs and symptoms, PCR test results, thorax computed tomography (CT) findings, and length of hospital stay were recorded. Odor tests were scored between 0-8, 0-1 anosmia, 2-3 severely hyposmia, 4 moderate hyposmia, 5 mild hyposmia, 6 and above normosmia. RESULTS: Forty-one (39%) of the 105 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 after the PCR results. Patients with an odor threshold score < 5 were classified as ""Smell-Impaired Group"", patients with an odor threshold score &#8805; 5 were placed in ""Smell Intact Group"". The incidence of female patients in smell-impaired group was significantly higher (p Ë 0.05). The proportion of patients who were PCR-positive for COVID-19 in smell-impaired group was significantly higher (p Ë 0.05) than in smell intact group. Among patients with an odor threshold score from 0 to 1 (anosmic; n = 15), 12 (80%) demonstrated PCR positivity (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Anosmia can be predictive for coronavirus disease.

Various physicochemical parameters can have an impact on the allergenicity of animal proteins. Following our previous review on how physicochemical parameters shape plant protein allergenicity, the same analysis was proceeded here for animal allergens. We found that each parameter can have variable effects, ranging on an axis from allergenicity enhancement to resolution, depending on its nature and the allergen. While glycosylation and phosphorylation are common, both are not universal traits of animal allergens. High molecular structures can favour allergenicity, but structural loss and uncovering hidden epitopes can also have a similar impact. We discovered that there are important knowledge gaps in regard to physicochemical parameters shaping protein allergenicity both from animal and plant origin, mainly because the comparability of the data is poor. Future biomolecular studies of exhaustive, standardised design together with strong validation part in the clinical context, together with data integration model systems will be needed to unravel causal relationships between physicochemical properties and the basis of protein allergenicity.","Costa, Joana; Villa, Caterina; Verhoeckx, Kitty; Cirkovic-Velickovic, Tanja; Schrama, Denise; Roncada, Paola; Rodrigues, Pedro M; Piras, Cristian; Martín-Pedraza, Laura; Monaci, Linda; Molina, Elena; Mazzucchelli, Gabriel; Mafra, Isabel; Lupi, Roberta; Lozano-Ojalvo, Daniel; Larré, Colette; Klueber, Julia; Gelencser, Eva; Bueno-Diaz, Cristina; Diaz-Perales, Araceli; Benedé, Sara; Bavaro, Simona Lucia; Kuehn, Annette; Hoffmann-Sommergruber, Karin; Holzhauser, Thomas",Clin. rev. allergy immunol,240,16

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize research on the mental health impact of waiting and patient-centred mitigation strategies that could be applied in the COVID-19 context. METHODS: Using a scoping review approach, we searched 9 databases for studies on waiting lists and mental health and reported study characteristics, impacts and intervention attributes and outcomes. RESULTS: We included 51 studies that focussed on organ transplant (60.8%), surgery (21.6%) or cancer management (13.7%). Most patients and caregivers reported anxiety, depression and poor quality of life, which deteriorated with increasing wait time. The impact of waiting on mental health was greater among women and new immigrants, and those of younger age, lower socio-economic status, or with less-positive coping ability. Six studies evaluated educational strategies to develop coping skills: 2 reduced depression (2 did not), 1 reduced anxiety (2 did not) and 2 improved quality of life (2 did not). In contrast, patients desired acknowledgement of concerns, peer support, and periodic communication about wait-list position, prioritization criteria and anticipated procedure date. CONCLUSIONS: Findings revealed patient-centred strategies to alleviate the mental health impact of waiting for procedures. Ongoing research should explore how to optimize the impact of those strategies for diverse patients and caregivers, particularly in the COVID-19 context.

This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based sample across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1,316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1,211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and due to uncertain estimates retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n=3,000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for ELISA's manufacturer's specificity was 2.78% (95%HDI 1.81-3.80%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93% (95%CI, 0.00-2.65%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87% (95%HDI, 0.40-1.38%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on November 11, 2020, was 4.06% (95%HDI, 2.97-5.16%) and on October 3, 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29% (95%HDI, 3.18-5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late-April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducting in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.","Poljak, Mario; Valencak, Anja Ostrbenk; Strumbelj, Erik; Vodicar, Polona Maver; Vehovar, Vasja; Rus, Katarina Resman; Korva, Misa; Knap, Natasa; Seme, Katja; Petrovec, Miroslav; Zupan, Blaz; Demsar, Janez; Kurdija, Slavko; Zupanc, Tatjana Avsic",Clin. microbiol. infect,240,29

SARS-CoV-2 triggered an inflammatory response as evidenced by increased IL-6 expression. Of the 25 selenoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 significantly suppressed mRNA expression of ferroptosis-associated GPX4, DNA synthesis-related TXNRD3 and endoplasmic reticulum-resident SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS. Computational analysis has predicted an antisense interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and TXNRD3 mRNA, which is translated with high efficiency in the lung. Here, we confirmed the predicted SARS-CoV-2/TXNRD3 antisense interaction in vitro using DNA oligonucleotides, providing a plausible mechanism for the observed mRNA knockdown. Inhibition of TXNRD decreases DNA synthesis which is thereby likely to increase the ribonucleotide pool for RNA synthesis and, accordingly, RNA virus production.

Across the six mental health trusts there there were a total of 2167 referrals over the first three month lockdown period in 2020, and 170 (7.84%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harm. During a corresponding time period in 2019, there were a total of 3416 referrals and 155 (4.54%) of these referrals were for deliberate self harmConclusionAlthough numbers of referrals for older adults with delberate self harm appeared to stay the same, the severity of these presentations is not clear. Outcomes of referrals and severity of self harm could be explored by examining individual case records. As there have been subsequent lockdowns the data collection period should also be extended to include these.

As of late April, 2020, 895,766 cases of COVID-19 infections were recorded in the United States. This infection was responsible for 50,439 deaths. Because of close, person-to-person proximity, coupled with possible contact with body fluids, transmission of COVID-19 during sexual activity is possible. However, some activities carry higher risks of transmission than others. This article explores the risks of COVID-19 transmission associated with kissing, oral sex (fellatio and annilingus), and anal receptive and anal insertive intercourse among men who have sex with men (MSM). Recommendations for counseling MSM on safer sexual decision-making, many of which are applicable in the general prevention of sexually transmitted infections, are also provided. Nurse practitioners can serve as advocates in preventing sexually associated COVID-19 communication in MSM and contribute to the advancement of this continuously evolving area of public health science.","Blackwell, Christopher W",J Am Assoc Nurse Pract (Online),240,21

DESIGN: Observational, multicenter, time series analysis, of electronic medical records from 15 PICU in Brazil. Data consisted of all March, April, and May PICU admissions from 2017 to 2020. SETTING: Fifteen private PICUs in Brazil. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients admitted to the PICU from March to May since 2017. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The period from March 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020, was considered the ""intervention point"" studied, corresponding to the suspension of school activities and the beginning of physical distancing in Brazil. During the pandemic period studied, there were 28 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (one death). The mean age was higher (p = 0.000), the length of stay was shorter (p = 0.000), but mortality rates were similar among the periods (p = 0.36). The model estimated a reduction of 1,483 PICU admissions from March 2020 to May 2020. At the end of May, there was an estimated drop of -146.6 bronchiolitis admissions (95% CI, -242.8 to -50.3; p = 0.016); -71 asthma admissions (95% CI, -93.6 to -48.63; p = 0.000); and -59 community-acquired pneumonia admissions (95% CI, -74.7 to -43.3; p = 0.000) per period. The model showed no effect of the ""intervention"" (physical distancing) on hospitalization rates for epilepsy, diarrhea, sepsis, bacterial meningitis, or surgery when analyzed individually. When assessed together, the model estimated a reduction of 73.6 admissions (95% IC, -132 to -15.2; p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic strongly affected Brazilian PICUs, reducing admissions, length of stay, and the epidemiological profile. The measures to oppose the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may have prevented thousands of PICU hospitalizations across the country.","Araujo, Orlei Ribeiro de; Almeida, Carlos Gustavo de; Lima-Setta, Fernanda; Prata-Barbosa, Arnaldo; Colleti Junior, José",Pediatric critical care medicine,240,33

By mid-March, London had emerged as the epicenter in the United Kingdom, accounting for 45% of the COVID-19-related mortality. A cancer COVID-19-free ""cold hub,"" through National Health Service partnership with independent institutions, was established to maintain a throughput of surgical oncology patients with an accessible triage system for oncologic specialties. The high population density, commuter volume, and rising COVID-19 incidence heightened the challenge of segregating a vulnerable population that was already at high risk for surgical morbidity and mortality.The aim of this review is to report the experience of developing a multicenter COVID-19-free cold hub with the aim of providing safe surgery for surgical oncology patients. We discuss the timeline, structure, and infection control policy and suggest practical points that may guide other health care systems.The surgical oncology hub treated 1542 patients between March 1 and July 1, 2020. There were no cases of COVID-19-related mortality in a 30-day follow-up. Key strategies for the restructuring of the cancer service included the following: (1) formation of an accessible referral pathway, (2) creation and structuring of cold hub hospitals, (3) development of protocols for infection control and preoperative testing, (4) rapid reorganization of services based on initial feedback, and (5) clear communication and leadership.It has been shown that a surgical oncology cold hub with an accessible referral system and an effective system of preoperative screening system can minimize COVID-19 transmission, morbidity, and mortality, in a region with heavy disease prevalence. This structure represents a safe, ethical, and viable system that can be replicated in other health care systems.","Moriarty, Peter; Chang, Justin; Kayani, Babar; Roberts, Lois; Bourke, Neil; Dann, Christopher; MacArthur, Emma; Haddad, Fares S",J Patient Saf,240,2

These measures are imposed in order to reduce the spread of the disease and to lift the pressure on healthcare systems. Estimating the impact of such interventions as well as monitoring the gradual relaxing of these stringent measures is quintessential to understand how resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic can be controlled for in the future. In this paper we use a stochastic age-structured discrete time compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in Belgium. Our model explicitly accounts for age-structure by integrating data on social contacts to (i) assess the impact of the lockdown as implemented on March 13, 2020 on the number of new hospitalizations in Belgium; (ii) conduct a scenario analysis estimating the impact of possible exit strategies on potential future COVID-19 waves. More specifically, the aforementioned model is fitted to hospital admission data, data on the daily number of COVID-19 deaths and serial serological survey data informing the (sero)prevalence of the disease in the population while relying on a Bayesian MCMC approach. Our age-structured stochastic model describes the observed outbreak data well, both in terms of hospitalizations as well as COVID-19 related deaths in the Belgian population. Despite an extensive exploration of various projections for the future course of the epidemic, based on the impact of adherence to measures of physical distancing and a potential increase in contacts as a result of the relaxation of the stringent lockdown measures, a lot of uncertainty remains about the evolution of the epidemic in the next months.","Abrams, Steven; Wambua, James; Santermans, Eva; Willem, Lander; Kuylen, Elise; Coletti, Pietro; Libin, Pieter; Faes, Christel; Petrof, Oana; Herzog, Sereina A; Beutels, Philippe; Hens, Niel",Epidemics,240,16

In response to these unprecedented challenges, universities are formulating more student development initiatives to support new students to transition into university and produce holistic graduates with essential soft skills. Student engagement evaluation can help inform and enhance the implementation of student development programs. In this study, seven domains of first year university students' engagement were evaluated namely Academic Engagement (AE), Beyondclass Engagement (BE), Intellectual Engagement (IE), Online Engagement (OE), Peer Engagement (PE), Student-staff Engagement (SE) and Transition Engagement (TE). This study found that university freshmen's Online Engagement (OE) was the strongest while their Academic Engagement (AE) was the weakest. This study also discovered that first year university students' engagement were weakest with regard to reading of textbooks before attending class, asking questions in class and borrowing books from the university library. Future student development programs targeted at first year university students could be enhanced by increasing the use of ICT in teaching and learning as well as increasing efforts in assisting new students to transition from school to university learning environments by inculcating good reading habits and encouraging active class participation.","Chong, Yenwan Sin Soo Hooi",Asian Journal of University Education,240,20

This research aims at assessing the effectiveness of institutional communication amid the management of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis in Italy. We first assessed the phenomenon by building a structured theoretical background stressing the concepts of risk communication, community engagement, and health literacy, highlighting the dynamic and continuously changing scenario of communication strategies, also due to the spread of social media and the mutation of conventional media outlets. We sent a questionnaire to a sample of citizens to assess the impact of three predictors, i.e., the perceived communication, the perceived knowledge, and the perceived information. Based on answers, we built an ordered logit model assigning continuous intervals as values for the dependent variables. The observed results enhanced the crucial role of the phenomenon of health literacy and the impact of asymmetric information on the effectiveness of institutional communication. Education played a fundamental role in understanding communication pillars and building an individual consciousness about health risks prevention.","Viola, Carmine Toma Pierluigi Manta Francesco Benvenuto Marco",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,240,13

The effective Lorenz number (L), which relates the thermal to electrical conductance of point contacts, could provide valuable information on the relative contribution of electrons and phonons to thermal transport. Through measuring electrical and thermal transport across point contacts between silver nanowires, we report that L significantly deviates from the Sommerfeld value by up to 5.2 times and exhibits nonmonotonic variation with temperature. Analyses show that these observations are due to the more important phonon contribution to the thermal conductance of the point contact as Sharvin resistance greatly hinders electron transport, which is further confirmed by the size dependence of L with a higher value for a smaller contact size. These results provide critical insights into engineering designs involving point contacts between metal nanostructures.","Xiong, Yucheng; Zhao, Yang; Tao, Yi; Yao, Fengju; Li, Deyu; Xu, Dongyan",Nano lett,240,24

Data for this study was collected using a self-administrated online questionnaire launched during the Chinese government's mandatory national 'self-quarantine' campaign. The survey was distributed using China's most popular social media platform - WeChat as well as a survey panel provided by Tencent Group. Given an initial data set of 980 responses, 11 were removed due to suspicious response patterns. The remaining data of 969 responses were kept for the analysis with an average survey completion time of 7 min. The proposed model of post-pandemic planned behaviors was analyzed using SmartPLS 3. The solution of the PLS-SEM algorithm indicated the validity and reliability of the outer model as well as inner model. Once the reliability and validity of the measurement model were confirmed, a path analysis among the five constructs was executed. A multiple group analysis was carried out between respondents not expecting to shorten their planned holiday (N = 525) and another group of respondents expecting to shorten it. It was found that respondents intended on making considerable changes to their travel behaviour as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5°C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5°C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85).

The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2.

No analysis has yet been published of US media practices for reporting on healthcare worker suicides during the pandemic. Aims: The researchers aimed to evaluate pandemic-era media practices by investigating adherence to best-practice suicide reporting guidelines in coverage of Dr. Lorna Breen's death. Methods: The researchers conducted a content analysis of all unique articles by top outlets reporting Dr. Breen's death between April 26 and 29, 2020, and scored them based on their adherence to the 15 best-practice suicide reporting guidelines. Results: Every media outlet violated an average of at least 5 of 15 suicide guidelines in reporting on Dr. Breen's death; some abided by as few as 2 of 15 recommended guidelines. Seven of 15 guidelines were adhered to by fewer than one third of articles. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, notably easy to include, appeared in only 75% of articles. Limitations: The researchers were limited to reviewing media coverage of one specific instance of COVID-era healthcare worker suicide, making these findings applicable as a prominent case study rather than forming a generalizable claim about suicide reporting during the pandemic or about reporting on healthcare suicides. Conclusion: These violations highlight a range of opportunities to improve suicide prevention in the media, which has a responsibility to ensure reporting does not exacerbate the risk of suicide.

News media coverage of high-profile suicide is associated with an increased risk of subsequent suicides. No analysis has yet been published of US media practices for reporting on healthcare worker suicides during the pandemic. Aims: The researchers aimed to evaluate pandemic-era media practices by investigating adherence to best-practice suicide reporting guidelines in coverage of Dr. Lorna Breen's death. Methods: The researchers conducted a content analysis of all unique articles by top outlets reporting Dr. Breen's death between April 26 and 29, 2020, and scored them based on their adherence to the 15 best-practice suicide reporting guidelines. Results: Every media outlet violated an average of at least 5 of 15 suicide guidelines in reporting on Dr. Breen's death; some abided by as few as 2 of 15 recommended guidelines. Seven of 15 guidelines were adhered to by fewer than one third of articles. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, notably easy to include, appeared in only 75% of articles. Limitations: The researchers were limited to reviewing media coverage of one specific instance of COVID-era healthcare worker suicide, making these findings applicable as a prominent case study rather than forming a generalizable claim about suicide reporting during the pandemic or about reporting on healthcare suicides. Conclusion: These violations highlight a range of opportunities to improve suicide prevention in the media, which has a responsibility to ensure reporting does not exacerbate the risk of suicide. Improved adherence to these guidelines could reduce harm for healthcare workers during the pandemic.","Lynn-Green, Erika E; Jazwinska, Klaudia; Beckman, Adam L; Latham, Stephen R",Crisis,240,9

STUDY DESIGN: A computerized search was conducted using PubMed. An article was considered eligible if it reported data on pediatric patient(s) with neurological involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described a case of an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 5-year-old girl with SARS-CoV-2 infection: this case was also included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Forty-four articles reporting 59 cases of neurological manifestations in pediatric patients were included in our review. Most (32/59) cases occurred in the course of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Neurological disorders secondary to cerebrovascular involvement were reported in 10 cases: 4 children with an ischemic stroke, 3 with intracerebral hemorrhage, 1 with a cerebral sinus venous thrombosis, 1 with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 with multiple diffuse microhemorrhages. Reversible splenial lesions were recognized in 9 cases, benign intracranial hypertension in 4 patients, meningoencephalitis in 4 cases, autoimmune encephalitis in 1 girl, cranial nerves impairment in 2 patients and transverse myelitis in 1 case. Five cases had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and two, including ours, had ADEM. Radiological investigations were performed in almost all cases (45/60): the most recurrent radiological finding was a signal change in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid was proved only in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable in almost all, except in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our research highlights the large range of neurological manifestations and their presumed pathogenic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Nervous system involvement could be isolated, developing during COVID-19 or after its recovery, or arise in the context of a MIS-C. The most reported neurological manifestations are cerebrovascular accidents, reversible splenial lesions, GBS, benign intracranial hypertension, meningoencephalitis; ADEM is also a possible complication, as we observed in our patient. Further studies are required to investigate all the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying pathogenic mechanism.","Siracusa, L; Cascio, A; Giordano, S; Medaglia, A A; Restivo, G A; Pirrone, I; Saia, G F; Collura, F; Colomba, C",Ital J Pediatr,240,16

The aim of this study was to determine whether disparities exist in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to COVID-19. METHODS: We analyzed data from 1216 adults in the March 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation 'Coronavirus Poll', to determine levels of KAPs across different groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of KAPs. RESULTS: In contrast to White respondents, Non-White respondents were more likely to have low knowledge (58% versus 30%; P < 0.001) and low attitude scores (52% versus 27%; P < 0.001), but high practice scores (81% versus 59%; P < 0.001). By multivariate regression, White race (odds ratio [OR] 3.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-5.50), higher level of education (OR 1.80; 95% CI: 1.46-2.23) and higher income (OR 2.06; 95% CI: 1.58-2.70) were associated with high knowledge of COVID-19. Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status and political views were all associated with KAPs. CONCLUSIONS: Racial and socioeconomic disparity exists in the levels of KAPs related to COVID-19.

Protein aggregation in brain can be considered as one of the important reasons behind the neurodegeneration. SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) binds to heparin and heparin binding proteins. Moreover, heparin binding accelerates the aggregation of the pathological amyloid proteins present in the brain. In this paper, we have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binds to a number of aggregation-prone, heparin binding proteins including Aß, &#945;-synuclein, tau, prion, and TDP-43 RRM. These interactions suggests that the heparin-binding site on the S1 protein might assist the binding of amyloid proteins to the viral surface and thus could initiate aggregation of these proteins and finally leads to neurodegeneration in brain. The results will help us to prevent future outcomes of neurodegeneration by targeting this binding and aggregation process.","Idrees, Danish; Kumar, Vijay",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,240,20

Assessing the associations between human behavior, infection, and social measures is essential to understand achievable reductions in cases and identify the factors driving changes in social dynamics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nighttime population volumes, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the implementation of public health and social measures in Tokyo. METHODS: We used mobile phone location data to estimate populations between 10 PM and midnight in seven Tokyo metropolitan areas. Mobile phone trajectories were used to distinguish and extract on-site dining from stay-at-work and stay-at-home behaviors. Numbers of new cases and symptom onsets were obtained. Weekly mobility and infection data from March 1 to November 14, 2020, were analyzed using a vector autoregression model. RESULTS: An increase in the number of symptom onsets was observed 1 week after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=0.60, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). The effective reproduction number significantly increased 3 weeks after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=1.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.89). The nighttime population volume increased significantly following reports of decreasing numbers of confirmed cases (coefficient=-0.44, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.15). Implementation of social measures to restaurants and bars was not significantly associated with nighttime population volume (coefficient=0.004, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The nighttime population started to increase after decreasing incidence of COVID-19 was announced. Considering time lags between infection and behavior changes, social measures should be planned in advance of the surge of an epidemic, sufficiently informed by mobility data.","Nakanishi, Miharu; Shibasaki, Ryosuke; Yamasaki, Syudo; Miyazawa, Satoshi; Usami, Satoshi; Nishiura, Hiroshi; Nishida, Atsushi",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,240,24

The purpose of this paper is to do the following: 1) provide an overview of the WHS of care in VHA and applicability in addressing employee resiliency;2) provide a brief history of employee well-being efforts in VHA to date;3) share new priorities from VHA leadership as they relate to Employee Whole Health strategy and implementation;and 4) provide a summary of the impacts of WHS of care delivery on employees. The WHS of care utilizes all therapeutic, evidence-based approaches to support self-care goals and personal health planning. Extending these approaches to employees builds upon 10 years of foundational work supporting employee health and well-being in VHA. In 2017, one facility in each of the 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) in VHA was selected to participate in piloting the WHS of care with subsequent evaluation by VA’s Center for Evaluating Patient-Centered Care (EPCC). Early outcomes, from an employee perspective, suggest involvement in the delivery of the WHS of care and personal use of the whole health approach have a meaningful impact on the well-being of employees and how they experience the workplace. During the COVID-19 pandemic, VHA has continued to support employees through virtual resources to support well-being and resiliency. VHA's shift to this patient-centered model is supporting not only Veteran care but also employee health and well-being at a time when increased support is needed.","Reddy, K. P.; Schult, T.

In the model, represented in the form of a three-dimensional tetrahedron, each of the faces represents inputs in the manufacturing of the ABHS product, which are the type and amount of alcohol, the inactive ingredients, the formulation and the manufacturing practices. The four corners of the tetrahedron represent the product performance factors which include product efficacy, sensory characteristics, usage and compliance and product safety. The multidimensional approach to the formulation and evaluation of ABHS shows that several factors contribute to the effectiveness and utility of these products.

Until today, the best solution for the moment remains prevention (Social distancing, hand disinfection, use of masks, partial or total sanitary containment, etc.), there is also the emergence of drug treatment (research and development, clinical trials, use on patients). Recent reviews emphasized the role of membrane lipids in the infectivity mechanism of SARS-COV-2. Cholesterol-rich parts of cell membranes serve as docking places of host cells for the viruses. Coronavirus 2 is a member of a virus family with lipid envelope that fuses with host cell through endocytosis, internalizing its components in the cell. In vitro cell models have shown that depletion of cholesterol by cyclodextrin, and particularly methyl beta cyclodextrin disturb the host cell membrane lipid composition this way reducing the attachment of the virus to the protein receptors. This review aims to summarize the state of the art of research concerning the use of cyclodextrin or its complexes as a potential treatment against this new virus and update work already published.","Sofiane, Fatmi; Lamia, Taouzinet; Mohamed, Skiba; Mokrane, Iguer-Ouada",Curr. drug deliv,240,20

The aim of present study was to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures on emotional well-being and disease activity in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) through a telemedicine approach. METHODS: An on-line survey, including demographic characteristics, disease-activity and psychometric scales (Stress-related Vulnerability Scale, Resiliency scale), Zung Anxiety and Depression Self-assessment Scale), was anonymously administered to FM, RA and healthy controls (HC). Disease activities were compared to the pre-lockdown cohort referring to our centre. RESULTS: Levels of anxiety and depression worthy of psychiatric attention were documented in 36.7% of FM, 14.6% of RA, 12.5% of HC and in 50% of FM, 17.1% of RA, 15% of HC, respectively. HC featured the highest stress scores, followed FM and then RA. RA showed higher resiliency than FM. Both anxiety and depression scores were significantly higher in FM than RA and HC. Disease severity was higher in RA patients and lower in FM patients when compared to the respective historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown significantly affected emotional well-being and disease activity of patients suffering from rheumatic diseases. While HC showed a higher vulnerability to stress, RA patients showed a greater resilience compared to both HC and to FM patients, especially. Emotional disturbances are greater in patients with RDs and in particular with FM. The use of a telemedicine approach to screen for severe symptoms represents a useful addition to the overall management of rheumatic patients.","Iannuccelli, C.; Lucchino, B.; Gioia, C.; Dolcini, G.; Favretti, M.; Franculli, D.; Di Franco, M.",Clin Exp Rheumatol,240,20

There is limited evidence on COVID-19 preparedness of such services in the Asia-Pacific region. AIM: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of hospice and palliative care services in the Asia-Pacific region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: An online cross-sectional survey was developed based on methodology guidance. Asia-Pacific Hospice and Palliative Care Network subscribers (n = 1551) and organizational members (n = 185) were emailed. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Ninety-seven respondents completed the survey. Around half of services were hospital-based (n = 47, 48%), and public-funded (n = 46, 47%). Half of services reported to have confirmed cases (n = 47, 49%) and the majority of the confirmed cases were patients (n = 28, 61%). Staff perceived moderate risk of being infected by COVID-19 (median: 7/10). > 85% of respondents reported they had up-to-date contact list for staff and patients, one-third revealed challenges to keep record of relatives who visited the services (n = 30, 31%), and of patients visited in communities (n = 29, 30%). Majority of services (60%) obtained adequate resources for infection control except face mask. More than half had no guidance on Do Not Resuscitate orders (n = 59, 66%) or on bereavement care for family members (n = 44, 51%). CONCLUSION: Recommendations to strengthen the preparedness of palliative care services include: 1) improving the access to face mask; 2) acquiring stress management protocols for staff when unavailable; 3) reinforcing the contact tracing system for relatives and visits in the community and 4) developing guidance on patient and family care during patient's dying trajectory.","Lin, Cheng-Pei; Boufkhed, Sabah; Kizawa, Yoshiyuki; Mori, Masanori; Hamzah, Ednin; Aggarwal, Ghauri; Namisango, Eve; Higginson, Irene J; Goh, Cynthia; Harding, Richard",Am J Hosp Palliat Care,240,16

Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. RESULTS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,714 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays (&#8805;5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male gender (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for individuals to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as symptoms appear, and to isolate away from household contacts; this is particularly important in neighbourhoods with large family sizes and/or crowded households.","Paul, Lauren A; Daneman, Nick; Brown, Kevin A; Johnson, James; van Ingen, Trevor; Joh, Eugene; Wilson, Sarah E; Buchan, Sarah A",Clin. infect. dis,240,16

The inquiries concern what this tells us about education as framed and constrained as a part of society. Our observations are based on statements presented by the government and public agencies, mass media and websites. We identified an assemblage of interwoven agents such as institutions, laws, regulations and recommendations, pandemic manuals, statistics and media. All these were brought together by actions and ideas to handle a pandemic when there were no preventive vaccines. The overarching principle was to educate the population to competent actions in dealing with the pandemic. To keep schools open was part of that principle combined with caretaking ambitions. This assemblage looked like a centralistic machine but it was not; risks were pushed back to local authorities and schools. In conclusion, we note that education is vital in the overarching strategy to deal with the pandemic in Sweden in terms of trust in people and governmentality.","Lindblad, Sverker; Lindqvist, Anders; Runesdotter, Caroline; Wärvik, Gun-Britt",Z Erziehwiss,240,30

This study described the prevalence and identified correlates of OLD among people who inject drugs (PWID). METHODS: In 2012-2016, a community-based cohort of PWID who had injected within the past month were enrolled in a study to assess HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) andMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and their related risk factors. Data were obtained through face-to-face interviews, serological testing and spirometry. Baseline data were used for a cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence and correlates of OLD, defined as FEV1/FVC < 0.7. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with OLD. RESULTS: Among 516 participants who had complete spirometry and interview results, the mean age was 43.3 years, 73.6 % were male, 9.5 % were Black, 91.1 % smoked cigarettes and 18.2 % had OLD. Few (9.6 %) PWID with OLD reported a previous diagnosis of COPD although many (44.7 %) reported related symptoms.

In our institute, a tertiary oncologic public hospital with high surgical volume, we prioritize maintaining cancer treatment as well as possible. The aim of this study is to evaluate if uro-oncological surgeries at pandemic are safe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent uro-oncological procedures. Epidemiological data, information on COVID-19 infection related to surgery and clinical characteristics of non-survival operative patients with COVID-19 infections were analyzed. RESULTS: From 213 patients analyzed, Covid-19 symptoms were noticed in 8 patients at preoperative process or at hospital admission postponing operation; 161 patients were submitted to elective surgery and 44 to emergency surgery. From patients submitted to elective surgeries, we had 1 patient with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 (0,6%), with mild symptoms and quick discharge. From the urgencies group, we had 6(13%)patients tested positive; 5 were taken to ICU with 4 deaths. CONCLUSION: Elective uro-oncological procedures at the COVID-19 epidemic period in a COVID-19-free Institute are safe, and patients who need urgent procedures, with a long period of hospitalization, need special care to avoid COVID-19 infection and its outcomes.","Silva, Gabriel Carvalho Dos Anjos; Abe, Daniel Kanda; Pedrenho, Rubens; Vilares, Rafael Nascimento; Cordeiro, Mauricio Dener; Coelho, Rafael Ferreira; Nahas, William Carlos",Int Braz J Urol,240,20

This ongoing pandemic has resulted in the death of millions of people globally. About one and a half thousand people have died due to this illness in Ethiopia. The clinical presentations of the disease vary with geography and populations. We therefore aimed at investigating the clinical characteristics of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in North-East Ethiopia. Methods: real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted for 18,112 individuals suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection during June 27 to October 20, 2020, at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center. Recorded data of 372 Ethiopians who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection at Woldia university COVID-19 testing center were retrospectively extracted and analyzed using SPSS v25.0. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: nearly 2.1% of the screened participants were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among them, three fourth of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were male, with an overall median age of 30 years. About 85% of the patients were asymptomatic. The most common clinical manifestations were cough (14.2%), followed by fever (11.0%) and headache (8.6%), whereas hypertension (1.6%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (1.6%) diabetes mellitus (1.1%), and chronic respiratory diseases (1.1%) were relatively the most common comorbidities noted. The case-fatality ratio was found at 1.6%. Age and underlying comorbidities had a statistically significant association with severity and poor outcome of patients (P < 0.001). Conclusion: the finding from this study indicated that older age and people with underlying comorbidities are at high risk of having the severe disease and poor outcomes. Hence, appropriate care and priority should be given to these people to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by this illness. The presence of higher asymptomatic infection is the possible indicator of potential asymptomatic transmissions within the community. This highlights the need for widespread testing, and contact tracing to flatten the transmission curve.","Geteneh, Alene; Alemnew, Birhan; Tadesse, Selamyhun; Girma, Abebe",Pan Afr Med J,240,13

The implementation of non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI), including travel ban, proved to be an effective way for controlling the epidemic spreading, e.g., the ban of inter-city transportation stops transporting virus through passengers between cities. However, travel ban could significantly impact many industries, e.g. tourism and logistics, thus jeopardizing the regional economy. This paper focus on assisting the national or regional government to make dynamic decisions on restricting and recovering intercity multi-modal travel services. Our model can characterize impacts of inter-city traffic on the spread of the COVID-19, as well as on the regional economy. By applying a reinforcement learning approach, we develop an online optimization model to identify the modal-specific travel banning strategy that can balance the epidemic control as well as the negative impacts on regional economy. The numerical study based on a network of multiple cities in China shows that the proposed approach can generate better strategies compared with some existing methods.","An, Yunlong; Lin, Xi; Li, Meng; He, Fang",,240,1

Knowledge about the mode of transmission as well as assessing the effectiveness of the preventive measures would aid in containing the outbreak of the coronavirus. Presently, respiratory droplets, physical contact and aerosols/air-borne have been reported as the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of the virus. Besides, some of the other possible modes of transmission are being explored by the researchers, with some studies suggesting the viral spread through fecal-oral, conjunctival secretions, flatulence (farts), sexual and vertical transmission from mother to the fetus, and through asymptomatic carriers, etc. Aim: The primary objective was to review the present understanding and knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and also to suggest recommendations in containing and preventing the novel coronavirus. METHODS: A review of possible modes of transmission of the novel SARS-CoV-2 was conducted based on the reports and articles available in PubMed and ScienceDirect.com that were searched using keywords, 'transmission', 'modes of transmission', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'novel coronavirus', and 'COVID-19'. Articles referring to air-borne, conjunctiva, fecal-oral, maternal-fetal, flatulence (farts), and breast milk transmission were included, while the remaining were excluded. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The modes of transmission linked to SARS-CoV-2 were identified and the available literature on each of these is described in detail in view of the possibilities of viral transmission through various modes of transmission. The review provides updated and necessary information on the possible modes of transmission for the health care workers and the lay public under one umbrella that can also be considered during framing guidelines in order to prevent and control the viral spread.","Mukhra, Richa; Krishan, Kewal; Kanchan, Tanuj",Acta Biomed,240,13

Data on clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Japan are limited in the literature. This study aimed to describe the clinical courses and outcomes of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: This is a single-center case series study. Patients with COVID-19 treated with mechanical ventilation (MV) were reviewed retrospectively. Data on baseline characteristics, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were collected. RESULTS: Between February 2, 2020, and June 30, 2020, 14 critically ill patients with COVID-19 were treated with MV. Most patients were male and had comorbidities, especially hypertension or diabetes; 35.7% were overweight and 21.4% were obese. The majority of the patients had dyspnea on admission. The median duration of MV was 10.5 days, and the 28-day mortality rate was 35.7%. In the four patients with COVID-19 who died, the cause of death was respiratory failure.

METHODS: Literature review and expert opinion. SHORT CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19, is considered to be transmitted via droplets rather than aerosols, but droplets with strong directional airflow support may spread further than 2 m. High rates of COVID-19 infections in healthcare-workers (HCWs) have been reported from several countries. Respirators such as filtering face piece (FFP) 2 masks were designed to protect HCWs, while surgical masks were originally intended to protect patients (e.g., during surgery). Nevertheless, high quality standard surgical masks (type II/IIR according to European Norm EN 14683) appear to be as effective as FFP2 masks in preventing droplet-associated viral infections of HCWs as reported from influenza or SARS. So far, no head-to-head trials with these masks have been published for COVID-19. Neither mask type completely prevents transmission, which may be due to inappropriate handling and alternative transmission pathways. Therefore, compliance with a bundle of infection control measures including thorough hand hygiene is key. During high-risk procedures, both droplets and aerosols may be produced, reason why respirators are indicated for these interventions.","Sommerstein, Rami; Fux, Christoph Andreas; Vuichard-Gysin, Danielle; Abbas, Mohamed; Marschall, Jonas; Balmelli, Carlo; Troillet, Nicolas; Harbarth, Stephan; Schlegel, Matthias; Widmer, Andreas",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,240,10

Material and Methods: In a case-control study, 14 patients with severe bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia (positive RT-PCR), treated with SOC and rectal ozone, were evaluated before-and-after treatment and compared with SOC (14 patients) in a 10-day follow-up period. Ozone protocol consisted of 8 sessions (1 session/day) of intra-rectal ozone (150 mL volume, 35 µg/mL concentration [5.25mg total dose]). The SOC protocol included O2 supply, antivirals (Remdesivir), corticosteroids (Dexamethasone/Metilprednisolone), monoclonal antibodies (Anakinra/Tocilizumab), antibiotics (Azytromicine), and anticoagulants (Enoxaparine). Primary outcome variables were the following: (a) clinical (O2 saturation and O2 supply); (b) biochemical (lymphocyte count, fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, ferritin, LDH, IL-6, and CRP); (c) radiological Taylor's scale. Secondary outcome variables were the following: (a) hospitalization length of stay, (b) mortality rate. Results: At baseline, ozone/SOC groups were not different on age, comorbidities, O2 saturation, and O2 supply. Patients in the ozone group improved O2 saturation and decrease O2 supply. SOC maintained O2 saturation and required more O2 supply. Lymphocyte count improved only in the ozone group and with statistical difference (p<0.05). Biomarkers of inflammation (fibrinogen, D-dimer, urea, LDH, CRP, and IL-6) decreased in both groups, but only significantly in favor of the ozone group (p<0.05). Ferritin showed a significant decrease in the ozone group but an increase on the SOC group. Radiological pneumonitis decreased on both groups but the decrease was only significant in the ozone group (p<0.0001). Mortality and length of stay, although not significant, were inferior in the ozone group. Conclusion: Compassionate use of rectal ozone improved O2 saturation, reduced O2 supply, decreased inflammation biomarkers, and improved Taylor's radiological scale significantly when compared to the SOC group. Mortality and length of stay were inferior in the ozone group, but this difference was not significant.","Fernández-Cuadros, Marcos Edgar; Albaladejo-Florín, María Jesús; Álava-Rabasa, Sandra; Gallego-Galiana, Juan; Pérez-Cruz, Gerardo Fabiel; Usandizaga-Elio, Isabel; Pacios, Enrique; Torres-García, David E; Peña-Lora, Daiana; Casique-Bocanegra, Luz; López-Muñoz, María Jesús; Rodríguez-de-Cía, Javier; Pérez-Moro, Olga Susana",SN Compr Clin Med,240,24

Alternative methodologies to PCR and immunodiagnostics that would not require specific reagents are worthy to investigate not only for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic but also to detect other emergent pathogenic threats. Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. In this proof-of-concept study, simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions. These results pave the way for the development of time-efficient viral diagnostic tests based on mass spectrometry.","Gouveia, Duarte; Miotello, Guylaine; Gallais, Fabrice; Gaillard, Jean-Charles; Debroas, Stéphanie; Bellanger, Laurent; Lavigne, Jean-Philippe; Sotto, Albert; Grenga, Lucia; Pible, Olivier; Armengaud, Jean",J Proteome Res,240,1

In this paper, we develop two different models to capture the trend of a number of cases and also predict the cases in the days to come, so that appropriate preparations can be made to fight this disease. The first one is a mathematical model accounting for various parameters relating to the spread of the virus, while the second one is a non-parametric model based on the Fourier decomposition method (FDM), fitted on the available data. The study is performed for various countries, but detailed results are provided for the India, Italy, and United States of America (USA).

Activity and weight data were extracted for 14 days before (February 2020) and 14 days during (April 2020) COVID-19 restrictions. Participants reported their recreational physical activity, diet and wellbeing during these periods. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine change over time. Participants slept 27 minutes longer (95% CI 9-51), got up 38 minutes later (95% CI 25-50), and did 50 fewer minutes (95% CI -69--29) of light physical activity during COVID-19 restrictions. Additionally, participants engaged in more cycling but less swimming, team sports and boating or sailing. Participants consumed a lower percentage of energy from protein (-0.8, 95% CI -1.5--0.1) and a greater percentage of energy from alcohol (0.9, 95% CI 0.2-1.7). There were no changes in weight or wellbeing. Overall, the effects of COVID-19 restrictions on lifestyle were small; however, their impact on health and wellbeing may accumulate over time. Further research examining the effects of ongoing social distancing restrictions are needed as the pandemic continues.","Curtis, Rachel G; Olds, Timothy; Ferguson, Ty; Fraysse, François; Dumuid, Dorothea; Esterman, Adrian; Hendrie, Gilly A; Brown, Wendy J; Lagiseti, Rajini; Maher, Carol A",PLoS One,240,20

One critique of such programs focuses on the uncertainty around whether seropositivity means immunity from repeat infection. However, an additional important consideration is that the low positive predictive value of serological tests in the setting of low population seroprevalence and imperfect test specificity will lead to many false-positive 'passport' holders. Here, we pose a simple question: how many false-positive 'passports' could be issued while maintaining herd immunity in the workforce? Answering this question leads to a simple mathematical formula for the minimum requirements of serological tests for a passport program, which depend on population prevalence and the value of R0. Our work replaces speculation in the press with rigorous analysis and will need to be considered in policy decisions that are based on individual and population serology results.","Larremore, Daniel B; Bubar, Kate M; Grad, Yonatan H",Clin. infect. dis,240,1

Through the diagnostic social-ecological system (SES) framework, this review paper aimed to investigate what and how the multifaceted social, physical, and governance factors affected the success level of seven selected Asia-Pacific countries (namely, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia, and New Zealand) in combatting COVID-19. Drawing on statistical data from the Our World In Data website, we measured the COVID-19 severity or abatement success level of the countries on the basis of cumulative positive cases, average daily cases, and mortality rates for the period of 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. A qualitative content analysis using three codes, i.e., present (P), partially present (PP), and absent (A) for each SES attribute, as well as score calculation and rank ordering for government response effectiveness and the abatement success level across the countries, was undertaken. Not only did the standard coding process ensure data comparability but the data were deemed substantially reliable with Cohen's kappa of 0.76. Among 13 attributes of the SES factors, high facility adequacy, comprehensive COVID-19 testing policies, strict lockdown measures, imposition of penalty, and the high trust level towards the government seemed to be significant in determining the COVID-19 severity in a country. The results show that Vietnam (ranked first) and New Zealand (ranked second), with a high presence of attributes/design principles contributing to high-level government stringency and health and containment indices, successfully controlled the virus, while Indonesia (ranked seventh) and Japan (ranked sixth), associated with the low presence of design principles, were deemed least successful. Two lessons can be drawn: (i) having high number of P for SES attributes does not always mean a panacea for the pandemic; however, it would be detrimental to a country if it lacked them severely, and (ii) some attributes (mostly from the governance factor) may carry higher weightage towards explaining the success level. This comparative study providing an overview of critical SES attributes in relation to COVID-19 offers novel policy insights, thus helping policymakers devise more strategic, coordinated measures, particularly for effective country preparedness and response in addressing the current and the future health crisis.","Ling, Gabriel Hoh Teck; Md Suhud, Nur Amiera Binti; Leng, Pau Chung; Yeo, Lee Bak; Cheng, Chin Tiong; Ahmad, Mohd Hamdan Haji; Ak Matusin, Ak Mohd Rafiq",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),240,29

The actual coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation, especially in regions that are less affected, has not yet been determined. This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in a frontline hospital in Tokyo, Japan. In this cross-sectional observational study, screening was performed on consented HCWs, including medical, nursing, and other workers, as part of a mandatory health checkup. The screening test results and clinical characteristics of the participants were recorded. The antibody seroprevalence rate among the 4147 participants screened between July 6 and August 21, 2020, was 0.34% (14/4147). There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence rate between frontline HCWs with a high exposure risk and HCWs working in other settings with a low exposure risk. Of those seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, 64% (9/14) were not aware of any symptoms and had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the extent of infection and immune status in HCWs in Japan, which has a relatively low prevalence of COVID-19.

The negative effect of such a lockdown may propagate to other regions through supply chains because of supply and demand shortages. Applying an agent-based model to the actual supply chains of nearly 1.6 million firms in Japan, we simulate what would happen to production activities outside Tokyo if production activities that are not essential to citizens' survival in Tokyo were shut down for a certain period. We find that if Tokyo were locked down for a month, the indirect effect on other regions would be twice as large as the direct effect on Tokyo, leading to a total production loss of 27 trillion yen in Japan or 5.2% of the country's annual GDP. Although the production that would be shut down in Tokyo accounts for 21% of the total production in Japan, the lockdown would result in an 86% reduction of the daily production in Japan after one month.","Inoue, Hiroyasu; Todo, Yasuyuki",PLoS One,240,16

Baseline data come from the Norwegian Counties Public Health Survey (participation rate 46%, of which 59% took part in a COVID-19 follow-up study). RESULTS: Overall loneliness was stable or falling during the lockdown. However, some subgroups, single individuals and older women, reported slightly increased loneliness during lockdown. Interestingly, individuals with low social support and high levels of psychological distress and loneliness before the pandemic experienced decreasing loneliness during the pandemic.

In January 2020, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced air traffic restriction in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study's aim is to empirically examine the policy effectiveness. METHOD: The data from 2 third-party platforms are used in this investigation. The COVID-19 data from the platform DXY and the air traffic data from Airsavvi are matched to each other. The robust panel regression with controlling city effect and time effect is conducted. RESULTS: The curvilinear relations are found between the air traffic restriction and the existing cases, and the recovery rate (quadratic term = 9.006 and -0.967, respectively). As the strength of air traffic restriction is growing, the negative effect (-8.146) of air traffic restriction on the existing cases and the positive effect (0.961) of air traffic restriction on the recovery rate, respectively, begin decreasing. CONCLUSION: On the macro level, the air traffic restriction may help alleviate the growth of existing cases and help raise the recovery rate of COVID-19 in megacities of China, but both these effects will marginally recede as the restriction strength is intensifying.","Li, Jiannan; Wang, Zhaoguo; Yuan, Bocong; Liang, Haixuan; Liang, Wenqi",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,240,24

Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly demanded to develop treatments for COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 92.06% identity in their N protein RBDs' sequences, which results in very similar structures. However, the SARS-CoV-2 is more easily to spread. Utilizing multi-scale computational approaches, this work studied the fundamental mechanisms of the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, including their stabilities and binding strengths with RNAs at different pH values. Electrostatic potential on the surfaces of N proteins show that both the N proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have dominantly positive potential to attract RNAs. The binding forces between SARS-CoV N protein and RNAs at different distances are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, both in directions and magnitudes. The electric filed lines between N proteins and RNAs are also similar for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The folding energy and binding energy dependence on pH revealed that the best environment for N proteins to perform their functions with RNAs is the weak acidic environment.","Guo, Wenhan; Xie, Yixin; E Lopez-Hernandez, Alan; Sun, Shengjie; Li, Lin",Math Biosci Eng,240,21

A systematic review,12.6891985,10.055975,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. RESULTS: The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. CONCLUSION: In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.","Ölcer, Sabahat; Yilmaz-Aslan, Yüce; Brzoska, Patrick",BMC Public Health,240,23

The aim of this study was to measure the immediate impact of COVID-19 on surgical oncology practice volume. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients treated at an NCI-Comprehensive Cancer Center was performed. ""Pre-COVID"" era was defined as January-February 2020 and ""COVID"" as March-April 2020. Primary outcomes were clinic visits and operative volume by surgical oncology subspecialty. RESULTS: Abouyt 907 new patient visits, 3897 follow-up visits, and 644 operations occurred during the study period. All subspecialties experienced significant decreases in new patient visits during COVID, though soft tissue oncology (Mel/Sarc), gynecologic oncology (Gyn/Onc), and endocrine were disproportionately affected. Telehealth visits increased to 11.4% of all visits by April. Mel/Sarc, Gyn/Onc, and Breast experienced significant operative volume decreases during COVID (25.8%, p = 0.012, 43.6% p < 0.001, and 41.9%, p < 0.001, respectively), while endocrine had no change and gastrointestinal oncology had a slight increase (p = 0.823) in the number of cases performed. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are wide-ranging within surgical oncology subspecialties. The addition of telehealth is a viable avenue for cancer patient care and should be considered in surgical oncology practice.","Gazivoda, Victor; Greenbaum, Alissa; Roshal, Joshua; Lee, Jenna; Reddy, Lekha; Rehman, Shahyan; Kangas-Dick, Aaron; Gregory, Stephanie; Kowzun, Maria; Stephenson, Ruth; Laird, Amanda; Alexander, H R; Berger, Adam C",J Surg Oncol,240,24

METHOD: This is a scoping review developed in six stages. The sixth stage was developed with registered nurses who work in the Brazil Organ Donation System. To consolidate the information and prepare all assumptions, the legislation in force in Brazil was followed. RESULTS: Recommendations from 19 articles identified in the literature were analyzed; additionally, 52 professionals who work at Brazil Organ Donation System participated in the research. Four care assumptions were formed: investigation of community transmission, investigation of clinical situations, screening for COVID-19 signs and symptoms, and investigation of alterations presented in the physical examination. Such assumptions are formed by 34 care guidelines. DISCUSSION: Care assumptions were prepared to guide and support registered nurses during assessment and validation of potential organ and tissue donors. From this perspective, assumptions certainly promote safety, effectiveness and quality in the service offered during the organ and tissue donation process in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to empowering registered nurses in this scenario. Quality and bio-surveillance through the donation stages have been discussed extensively in recent times, to improve donation and transplantations by valuing care, safety, and quality of life of recipients. CONCLUSION: The care assumptions presented in this study support and subsidize the daily practice of registered nurses who work in assessing and validating potential organ and tissue donors, enabling these professionals to make decisions based on secure information.","da Silva-Knihs, Neide; Erbs-Pessoa, João Luis; Pestana-Magalhães, Aline Lima; Schuantes-Paim, Sibele Maria; Fischer-Wachholz, Laísa; Lima-Silva, Elza; de Aguiar-Roza, Bartira",Enferm. intensiva (Ed. impr.),240,15

Instead of just focusing on the transport sector, the authors propose an integrated approach to housing and mobility. This approach acknowledges the challenges posed by inadequate housing and dependence on motorised transport during the COVID19 crisis. In contrast, adequate housing and cycling became paramount resources while confronting the pandemic. Using Santiago de Chile as a case study, this research examines how different relocation scenarios for its current housing deficit cannot only affect the ability to implement stay-at-home measures, but also the potential of cycling as a relevant commuting alternative. The current location of the families suffering this deficit is compared to three scenarios: compact, pericentral and extended. In light of the learnings from the COVID19 crisis, a housing-cycling policy becomes a tool for resilience;equity is achieved by enforcing the right to housing, by increasing job opportunities among the poor, and by reducing the dependence on expensive motorised transport;decarbonisation is achieved by promoting active transportation and reducing the dependence on motorisation.","Valenzuela-Levi, N.; Echiburu, T.; Correa, J.; Hurtubia, R.; Muñoz, J.

Most archaeologists had no alternative but to adapt to it through concessions to the free-market economy and to the so-called mitigations taking place within development. However, it is now apparent that the ongoing global socio-ecological disaster we are facing cannot be reversed with compromises but rather with a radical engagement against the injunctions of competition and growth. I suggest that we must anticipate the necessary transformations of archaeology in the coming decades, before archaeology becomes a technical avatar of the neo-liberal dogma, or before its complete annihilation for being deemed ‘superfluous’ (Wurst 2019, 171) by the capitalist regime. In this paper, I will use the idea of ‘degrowth’ to propose a new paradigm for archaeology by applying the concepts of civil disobedience, voluntary simplicity, redistribution of means and the ethics of no-growth.","Zorzin, Nicolas",Archaeological Dialogues,240,3

For this pandemic, which is still in effect, mobilization has started all over the world, and various restrictions and precautions have been taken to prevent the spread of this disease. In addition, infected people must be identified in order to control the infection. However, due to the inadequate number of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests, Chest computed tomography (CT) becomes a popular tool to assist the diagnosis of COVID-19. In this study, two deep learning architectures have been proposed that automatically detect positive COVID-19 cases using Chest CT X-ray images. Lung segmentation (preprocessing) in CT images, which are given as input to these proposed architectures, is performed automatically with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Since both architectures contain AlexNet architecture, the recommended method is a transfer learning application. However, the second proposed architecture is a hybrid structure as it contains a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memories (BiLSTM) layer, which also takes into account the temporal properties. While the COVID-19 classification accuracy of the first architecture is 98.14%, this value is 98.70% in the second hybrid architecture. The results prove that the proposed architecture shows outstanding success in infection detection and, therefore this study contributes to previous studies in terms of both deep architectural design and high classification success.","Aslan, Muhammet Fatih; Unlersen, Muhammed Fahri; Sabanci, Kadir; Durdu, Akif",Appl Soft Comput,240,1

As a result, medical practices have limited access to in-person visits. This poses a challenge to maintain appropriate patient care while preventing a substantial backlog of patients once stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. In practices that are naïve to telehealth as an alternative option, providers and staff are experiencing challenges with telemedicine implementation. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide on how to rapidly integrate telemedicine into practice during a pandemic. METHODS: We built a toolkit that details the following 8 essential components to successful implementation of a telemedicine platform: provider and staff training, patient education, an existing electronic medical record system, patient and provider investment in hardware, billing and coding integration, information technology support, audiovisual platforms, and patient and caregiver participation. RESULTS: Rapid integration of telemedicine in our practice was required to be compliant with our institution's COVID-19 task force. Within 3 days of this declaration, our large specialty-care clinic converted to a telemedicine platform and we completed 638 visits within the first month of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Effective and efficient integration of a telemedicine program requires extensive staff and patient education, accessory platforms to facilitate video and audio communication, and adoption of new billing codes that are outlined in this toolkit.","Smith, Whitney R; Atala, Anthony J; Terlecki, Ryan P; Kelly, Erin E; Matthews, Catherine A",J Am Coll Surg,240,16

Its safety and tolerability were confirmed in healthy human volunteers. In this study, our primary objective was to determine the safety, and the secondary objective was to assess the efficacy of centhaquine in patients with hypovolemic shock. METHODS: A prospective, multicentre, randomized phase II study was conducted in male and female patients aged 18-70 years with hypovolemic shock having systolic BP &#8804; 90 mmHg. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the control or centhaquine group. The control group received 100 ml of normal saline infusion over 1 h, while the centhaquine group received 0.01 mg/kg of centhaquine in 100 ml normal saline infusion over 1 h. Every patient received standard of care (SOC) and was followed for 28 days. RESULTS: Fifty patients were included, and 45 completed the trial: 22 in the control group and 23 in the centhaquine group. The demographics of patients in both groups were comparable. No adverse event related to centhaquine was recorded in the 28-day observation period. The baseline, Injury Scoring System score, haemoglobin, and haematocrit were similar in both groups. However, 91% of the patients in the centhaquine group needed major surgery, whereas only 68% in the control group (p = 0.0526). Twenty-eight-day all-cause mortality was 0/23 in the centhaquine group and 2/22 in the control group. The percent time in ICU and ventilator support was less in the centhaquine group than in the control group. The total amount of vasopressors needed in the first 48 h of resuscitation was lower in the centhaquine group than in the control group (3.12 ± 2.18 vs. 9.39 ± 4.28 mg). An increase in systolic and diastolic BP from baseline through 48 h was more marked in the centhaquine group than in the control group. Compared with the control group, blood lactate level was lower by 1.75 ± 1.07 mmol/l in the centhaquine group on day 3 of resuscitation. Improvements in base deficit, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) score and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were greater in the centhaquine group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: When added to SOC, centhaquine is a well-tolerated and effective resuscitative agent. It improves the clinical outcome of patients with hypovolemic shock.

There have been efforts to identify digital competencies for different health care worker groups; however, an overview of these efforts has yet to be consolidated and analyzed. OBJECTIVE: The review aims to identify and study existing digital health competency frameworks for health care workers and provide recommendations for future digital health training initiatives and framework development. METHODS: A literature search was performed to collate digital health competency frameworks published from 2000. A total of 6 databases including gray literature sources such as OpenGrey, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Google, and websites of relevant associations were searched in November 2019. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by the reviewers. The included evidence is narratively described in terms of characteristics, evolution, and structural composition of frameworks. A thematic analysis was also performed to identify common themes across the included frameworks. RESULTS: In total, 30 frameworks were included in this review, a majority of which aimed at nurses, originated from high-income countries, were published since 2016, and were developed via literature reviews, followed by expert consultations. The thematic analysis uncovered 28 digital health competency domains across the included frameworks. The most prevalent domains pertained to basic information technology literacy, health information management, digital communication, ethical, legal, or regulatory requirements, and data privacy and security. The Health Information Technology Competencies framework was found to be the most comprehensive framework, as it presented 21 out of the 28 identified domains, had the highest number of competencies, and targeted a wide variety of health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health training initiatives should focus on competencies relevant to a particular health care worker group, role, level of seniority, and setting. The findings from this review can inform and guide digital health training initiatives. The most prevalent competency domains identified represent essential interprofessional competencies to be incorporated into health care workers' training. Digital health frameworks should be regularly updated with novel digital health technologies, be applicable to low- and middle-income countries, and include overlooked health care worker groups such as allied health professionals.","Nazeha, Nuraini; Pavagadhi, Deepali; Kyaw, Bhone Myint; Car, Josip; Jimenez, Geronimo; Tudor Car, Lorainne",J Med Internet Res,240,24

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear. METHODS: The Passive Immunity Trial for Our Nation (PassITON) is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the USA to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio &#8804; 0.73 for the primary outcome. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19. These data will be useful to guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the current pandemic and for informing decisions about whether developing a standardized infrastructure for collecting and disseminating convalescent plasma to prepare for future viral pandemics is indicated.

However, reports on SpO2 characteristics (patterns and dynamics) are scarce and none, to our knowledge, has analysed high resolution continuous SpO2 in COVID-19. MethodsSpO2 signal sampled at 1Hz and clinical data were collected from COVID-19 departments at the Rambam Health Care Campus (Haifa, Israel) between May 1st, 2020 and February 1st, 2021. Data from a total of 367 COVID-19 patients, totalling 27K hours of continuous SpO2 recording, could be retrieved, including 205 non-critical and 162 critical cases. Desaturations based on different SpO2 threshold definitions and oximetry derived digital biomarkers (OBMs) were extracted and compared across severity and support levels. FindingsAn absolute SpO2 threshold at 93% was the most efficient in discriminating between critical and non-critical patients without support or under oxygen support. Under no support, the non-critical group depicted a fold change (FC) of 1 {middle dot}8 times more frequent desaturations compared to the critical group. However, the hypoxic burden was 1 {middle dot}6 times more important in critical versus non-critical patients. Other OBMs depicted significant differences, notably the percentage of time below 93% SpO2 (CT93) was the most discriminating OBM. Mechanical ventilation depicted a strong effect on SpO2 by significantly reducing the frequency (1 {middle dot}85 FC) and depth (1 {middle dot}21 FC) of desaturations. OBMs related to periodicity and hypoxic burden were markedly affected up to several hours before the initiation of the mechanical ventilation. InterpretationThis is the first report investigating continuous SpO2 measurements in hospitalized patients affected with COVID-19. SpO2 characteristics differ between critical and non-critical patients and are impacted by the level of support. OBMs from high resolution SpO2 signal may enable to anticipate clinically relevant events, monitoring of treatment response and may be indicative of future deterioration.

Two-thirds of those surveyed reported some type of distress related to the pandemic (i.e. difficulty coping or negative impact on emotional and mental health). While there were no changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms from prior to COVID-19 to 10 week later in the group as a whole, self-reported distress predicted increases in both anxiety and depression across the two timepoints. Furthermore, adults with higher levels of anxiety prior to the pandemic were more likely to report distress, and women were more likely to report a negative impact of the pandemic on their emotional and mental health. Findings highlight the importance of monitoring with adults with autism spectrum disorder to assess their need for mental health support, and providing ongoing support to those who already experience anxiety even before the pandemic.","Adams, Ryan E; Zheng, Shuting; Taylor, Julie Lounds; Bishop, Somer L",Autism,240,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The causes of mortality in the Veneto region (Italy) during the first epidemic wave, March-April 2020, were compared with the corresponding months of the previous two years. Both the underlying cause of death (UCOD), and all diseases reported in the death certificate (multiple causes of death) were investigated; a further analysis was carried out through a simulation where the UCOD was selected after substituting ICD-10 codes for COVID with unspecified pneumonia. RESULTS: Overall 10,222 deaths were registered in March-April 2020, corresponding to a 24% increase compared to the previous two years. COVID-19 was mentioned in 1,444 certificates, and selected as the UCOD in 1,207 deaths. Based on the UCOD, the increases in mortality were observed for COVID and related respiratory conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and ill-defined causes. Multiple causes of death and the simulation analysis demonstrated further increases in mortality related to dementia/Alzheimer and chronic lower respiratory diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This first report demonstrates an increase of several causes of death during the pandemic, underlying the need of a continuous surveillance of mortality records through different analytic strategies.","Fedeli, U; Schievano, E; Avossa, F; Pitter, G; Barbiellini Amidei, C; Grande, E; Grippo, F",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,240,25

It is believed that early reports of COVID-19 cases were noticed in December 2019 and soon after it became a global public health emergency. It is advised that COVID-19 transmits through human to human contact and in most cases, it remains asymptomatic. Several approaches are being utilized to control the outbreak of this fatal viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are known signature therapeutic tool for the viral diseases; they are small non-coding RNAs that target the mRNAs to inhibit their post-transcriptional expression, therefore, impeding their functions, can serve as watchdogs or micromanagers in the cells. AREAS COVERED: This review work delineated COVID-19 and its association with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the possible role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and therapeutic potential of miRNAs and their effective delivery to treat COVID-19.

A possible unifying explanation for these phenomena may be the presence of profound endothelial dysfunction and injury. This review provides an overview on the association of endothelial dysfunction with COVID-19 and its therapeutic implications. Endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of the key comorbidities that increase risk for severe COVID-19 such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease or heart failure. Preliminary studies indicate that vascular endothelial cells can be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and evidence of widespread endothelial injury and inflammation is found in advanced cases of COVID-19. Prior evidence has established the crucial role of endothelial cells in maintaining and regulating vascular homeostasis and blood coagulation. Aggravation of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 may therefore impair organ perfusion and cause a procoagulatory state resulting in both macro- and microvascular thrombotic events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins are known to improve endothelial dysfunction. Data from smaller observational studies and other viral infections suggests a possible beneficial effect in COVID-19. Other treatments that are currently under investigation for COVID-19 may also act by improving endothelial dysfunction in patients. Focusing therapies on preventing and improving endothelial dysfunction could improve outcomes in COVID-19. Several clinical trials are currently underway to explore this concept.","Nägele, Matthias P; Haubner, Bernhard; Tanner, Felix C; Ruschitzka, Frank; Flammer, Andreas J",Atherosclerosis,240,27

There are some concerns that high density may be a risk factor that makes it challenging to contain the pandemic. This study aims to investigate the link between density and pandemic spread through a case study of Tehran that has been the epicenter of the pandemic in Iran. Based on data obtained from an online platform and analyzed using structural equation modeling, we found that density alone cannot be considered a risk factor for the spread of COVID-19. In fact, density alone did not explain the geographic distribution pattern of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths across the 22 municipal districts of Tehran. We, therefore, argue that efforts should be made to minimize concerns about living in dense urban environments. Indeed, residents of high-density districts can live safely when an outbreak occurs, provided they make some changes in lifestyle and follow public health instructions. Based on the findings, and considering other benefits of compact cities (e.g., climate change mitigation) planners and policy makers are encouraged to continue promoting compact urban forms.

Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)-guided HF management using the CardioMEMS&#8482; HF system was shown to be safe and reduce HF hospitalisation (HFH) rates in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III patients. However, these findings have not been replicated in health systems outside the United States. Therefore, the CardioMEMS European Monitoring Study for Heart Failure (MEMS-HF) evaluated the safety, feasibility, and performance of this device in Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 234 NYHA class III patients (68 ± 11 years, 22% female, &#8805;1 HFH in the preceding year) from 31 centres were implanted with a CardioMEMS sensor and underwent PAP-guided HF management. One-year rates of freedom from device- or system-related complications and from sensor failure (co-primary outcomes) were 98.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 95.8-100.0] and 99.6% (95% CI 97.6-100.0), respectively. Survival rate was 86.2%. For the 12 months post- vs. pre-implant, HFHs decreased by 62% (0.60 vs. 1.55 events/patient-year; hazard ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.31-0.48; P < 0.0001). After 12 months, mean PAP decreased by 5.1 ± 7.4 mmHg, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall/clinical summary scores increased from 47.0 ± 24.0/51.2 ± 24.8 to 60.5 ± 24.3/62.4 ± 24.1 (P < 0.0001), and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire sum score improved from 8.7 ± 5.9 to 6.3 ± 5.1 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Haemodynamic-guided HF management proved feasible and safe in the health systems of Germany, The Netherlands, and Ireland.

While a large body of research focuses on DDoS detection and protection, to date we ultimately failed to eradicate DDoS altogether. Yet, the landscape of DDoS attack mechanisms is even evolving, demanding an updated perspective on DDoS attacks in the wild. In this paper, we identify up to 2608 DDoS amplification attacks at a single day by analyzing multiple Tbps of traffic flows at a major IXP with a rich ecosystem of different networks. We observe the prevalence of well-known amplification attack protocols (e.g., NTP, CLDAP), which should no longer exist given the established mitigation strategies. Nevertheless, they pose the largest fraction on DDoS amplification attacks within our observation and we witness the emergence of DDoS attacks using recently discovered amplification protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, ARMS, Ubiquity Discovery Protocol). By analyzing the impact of DDoS on core Internet infrastructure, we show that DDoS can overload backbone-capacity and that filtering approaches in prior work omit 97% of the attack traffic.","Kopp, Daniel; Dietzel, Christoph; Hohlfeld, Oliver",,240,32

OBJECTIVE: We examine the use of a nature and art-related activity retreat designed for researchers. The purpose was to evaluate if and how researchers perceived different workshop experiences set in nature as meaningful and important with regards to their self-care. METHODS: A mixed group of six researchers from Sweden, Finland, and the United States met for a three-day retreat consisting of self-selected nature and art-related activities. From data constituted from participant reflections, a focus group interview, a three months follow-up questionnaire, and an analysis of the workshops undertaken, three major themes were identified: ""Sharing and connection"", ""Embodiment"" and ""Nature"". RESULTS: Analysis of the workshop-style exercises did not show significant variance in reported meaningfulness and usefulness related to the activity itself. However, there was a strong correlation between perceived value and shared experience where the sharing of the natural space was felt to put humanity into perspective. CONCLUSION: Organizing and systematizing health preventive retreats for researchers in academia may be an important part of the sustainabile academic community in which the researcher needs to be better taken care of in a more embodied way. Although this study was conducted prior to COVID-19, such retreats and potentially also online versions, could be useful for managing the pandemic and afterwards, in our new ""normal"".","Bojner Horwitz, Eva; Spännäri, Jenni; Langley, Julia; Jacobs, Bette; Osika, Walter",Work,240,20

To date, many biomarkers reflecting the main pathophysiological characteristics of the disease have been identified and associated with the risk of developing severe disease. Lymphopenia represents the hallmark of the disease, and it can be detected since the early stage of infection. Increased levels of several inflammatory biomarkers, including c-reactive protein, have been found in COVID-19 patients and associated with an increased risk of severe disease, which is characterised by the so-called ""cytokine storm"". Also, the increase of cardiac and liver dysfunction biomarkers has been associated with poor outcome.

The need to implement social distancing measures, coupled with the reduced availability of staff, has dictated that the practice of orthopaedics shifts to focus on acute care whilst redistributing resources to front-line specialities. This was facilitated by the cancellation of electives and the reduction of outpatient clinics.

Results: The exhaled aerosol particles are generated by normal breathing in the deep lung through reopening of collapsed small airways during inspiration. These mucus/surfactant aerosols (size range between 0.2 and 0.6 µm) can transport viruses out of the lungs of patients and be present in the room air for hours.

Respiratory failure in COVID-19 might represent a novel pathologic entity. RESEARCH QUESTION: How does the lung histopathology described in COVID-19 compare with the lung histopathology described in SARS and H1N1 influenza? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to characterize the lung histopathologic features of COVID-19 and compare them against findings of other recent viral pandemics, H1N1 influenza and SARS. We systematically searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies published up to June 24, 2020, using search terms for COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS with keywords for pathology, biopsy, and autopsy. Using PRISMA-IPD guidelines, our systematic review analysis included 26 articles representing 171 COVID-19 patients; 20 articles representing 287 H1N1 patients; and eight articles representing 64 SARS patients. RESULTS: In COVID-19, acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) was reported in 88% of patients, which was similar to the proportion of cases with DAD in both H1N1 (90%) and SARS (98%). Pulmonary microthrombi were reported in 57% of COVID-19 and 58% of SARS patients, as compared with 24% of H1N1 influenza patients. INTERPRETATION: DAD, the histologic correlate of ARDS, is the predominant histopathologic pattern identified in lung pathology from patients with COVID-19, H1N1 influenza, and SARS. Microthrombi were reported more frequently in both patients with COVID-19 and SARS as compared with H1N1 influenza.

Research into the pathophysiology is ongoing, and findings will likely assist in identifying new therapeutic options to augment those in existence today that are still insufficient for the care of a large population of patients. Recent evidence describes the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of fibromyalgia. This study provides a systematic, thorough review of the evidence alongside a review of the seminal data regarding the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and current treatment options. Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread chronic pain, fatigue, and depressive episodes without an organic diagnosis, which may be prevalent in up to 10% of the population and carries a significant cost in healthcare utilization, morbidity, a reduced quality of life, and productivity. It is frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities. The diagnosis is clinical and usually prolonged, and diagnostic criteria continue to evolve. Some therapies have been previously described, including neuropathic medications, milnacipran, and antidepressants. Despite some level of efficacy, only physical exercise has strong evidence to support it. Cannabis has been used historically to treat different pain conditions since ancient times. Recent advances allowed for the isolation of the active substances in cannabis and the production of cannabinoid products that are nearly devoid of psychoactive influence and provide pain relief and alleviation of other symptoms. Many of these, as well as cannabis itself, are approved for use in chronic pain conditions. Evidence supporting cannabis in chronic pain conditions is plentiful; however, in fibromyalgia, they are mostly limited. Only a handful of randomized trials exists, and their objectivity has been questioned. However, many retrospective trials and patient surveys suggest the significant alleviation of pain, improvement in sleep, and abatement of associated symptoms. Evidence supporting the use of cannabis in chronic pain and specifically in fibromyalgia is being gathered as the use of cannabis increases with current global trends. While the current evidence is still limited, emerging data do suggest a positive effect of cannabis in fibromyalgia. Cannabis use is not without risks, including psychiatric, cognitive, and developmental as well as the risks of addiction. As such, clinical judgment is warranted to weigh these risks and prescribe to patients who are more likely to benefit from this treatment. Further research is required to define appropriate patient selection and treatment regimens.","Berger, Amnon A; Keefe, Joseph; Winnick, Ariel; Gilbert, Elasaf; Eskander, Jonathan P; Yazdi, Cyrus; Kaye, Alan D; Viswanath, Omar; Urits, Ivan",Best Pract Res Clin Anaesthesiol,240,26

METHODS AND MAIN OBJECTIVE: This work examines the impact of Vienna's first lockdown on ground-level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and total oxidant (Ox). The analysis runs over January to September 2020 and considers business as usual scenarios created with machine learning models to provide a baseline for robustly diagnosing lockdown-related air quality changes. Models were also developed to normalise the air pollutant time series, enabling facilitated intervention assessment. CORE FINDINGS: NO2 concentrations were on average -20.1% [13.7-30.4%] lower during the lockdown. However, this benefit was offset by amplified O3 pollution of +8.5% [3.7-11.0%] in the same period. The consistency in the direction of change indicates that the NO2 reductions and O3 increases were ubiquitous over Vienna. Ox concentrations increased slightly by +4.3% [1.8-6.4%], suggesting that a significant part of the drops in NO2 was compensated by gains in O3. Accordingly, 82% of lockdown days with lowered NO2 were accompanied by 81% of days with amplified O3. The recovery shapes of the pollutant concentrations were depicted and discussed. The business as usual-related outcomes were broadly consistent with the patterns outlined by the normalised time series. These findings allowed to argue further that the detected changes in air quality were of anthropogenic and not of meteorological reason. Pollutant changes on the machine learning baseline revealed that the impact of the lockdown on urban air quality were lower than the raw measurements show. Besides, measured traffic drops in major Austrian roads were more significant for light-duty than for heavy-duty vehicles. It was also noted that the use of mobility reports based on cell phone movement as activity data can overestimate the reduction of emissions for the road transport sector, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles. As heavy-duty vehicles can make up a large fraction of the fleet emissions of nitrogen oxides, the change in the volume of these vehicles on the roads may be the main driver to explain the change in NO2 concentrations. INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS: A probable future with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dropping slower than emissions of nitrogen oxides could risk worsened urban O3 pollution under a VOC-limited photochemical regime. More holistic policies will be needed to achieve improved air quality levels across different regions and criteria pollutants.","Brancher, Marlon",Environ Pollut,240,16

They filed petitions, emphasizing that distance learning could not be equated to traditional classroom-based learning, that educational services delivered to the full extent, and that educational quality had decreased. On those grounds, students required cutting tuition fees down to the size of those in part-time or extramural education. To understand whether universities can afford making this step, we undertake to measure the price that they have paid for the transition to distance learning. For this purpose, we use data from a survey of faculty teaching and curriculum organization practices carried out at a federal university between March 23, 2020 and June 21, 2020, which involved 4,099 faculty members, as well as financial records of some departments within that university. Findings show that teaching workload reduced by 15% with distance learning during the pandemic, and the number of contact hours decreased 1.7 times. However, the overall amount of faculty workload increased by 50%, first of all due to a 2.4-time rise in curriculum organization activities. Therefore, the transition to distance education led to a significant increase in faculty workload, given that contact hours were preserved. Furthermore, the university invested heavily in the transition to distance learning and continuity of educational processes during the pandemic, in particular by financing the establishment of a new department for digitalization of learning processes. © 2021, Mir Rossii All Rights Reserved.","Larionova, V.; Semenova, T.; Murzakhanova, E.; Daineko, L.",Mir Rossii,240,4

Thus, development of novel adjuvant that offers safe and effective immunity is of urgent need. Materials and Methods: The present research engineers a novel chicken adjuvant with potent immune-potentiating capability by incorporating avian tollï»¿-like receptor 21 (TLR21) agonist CpG ODN 2007 with a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based hollow nanoparticle platform (CpG-NP), which subsequently assessed ex vivo and in vivo. Results: CpG-NPs with an average diameter of 164 nm capable of sustained release of CpG for up to 96 hours were successfully prepared. With the ex vivo model of chicken bone marrowï»¿-derived dendritic cells (chBMDCs), CpG-NP was engulfed effectively and found to induce DC maturation, promoting dendrite formation and upregulation of CD40, CD80 and CCR7. In addition to enhanced expression of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12 and IFN-Î³, 53/84 immuneï»¿-related genes were found to be stimulated in CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs, whereas only 39 of such genes were stimulated in free CpG-treated cells. These upregulated genes suggest immune skewing toward T helper cell 1 bias and evidence of improved mucosal immunity upon vaccination with the CpG-NP. The CpG-NP-treated chBMDCs showed protective effects to DF-1 cells against avian influenza virus H6N1 infection. Upon subsequent coupling with infectious bronchitis virus subunit antigen administration, chickens were immunostimulated to acquire higher humoral immune response and protective response against viral challenge. Conclustion: This work presents a novel hollow CpG-NP formulation, demonstrating effective and long-lasting immunostimulatory ability ex vivo and in vivo for chickens, as systemically compared to free CpG. This enhanced immune stimulation benefits from high stability and controlled release of internal component of nanoparticles that improve cellular delivery, lymphoid organ targeting and sustainable DC activation. CpG-NP has broad application potential in antiviral and vaccine development.","Lin, Shu-Yi; Yao, Bing-Yu; Hu, Che-Ming Jack; Chen, Hui-Wen",Int J Nanomedicine,240,16

So, this puts many people including the farmers and the customers at a bigger risk when they sell or buy products physically in a market place. This is a major challenge to an Indian farmer today to sell the product at the right price at the right time. Moreover, social distancing is the need of the hour, and hence, it is an even bigger challenge to monitor the market place to avoid physical contact. Also, many initiatives by governments, local bodies, and cooperative societies to eliminate the intermediaries are not turning effective due to the non-awareness, non-accessibility, ignorance, and ease of usage difficulties. Keeping the current pandemic situation in mind and social distancing being the need of the hour, this paper proposes a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR) wherein the farmer and the customer can sell and buy products online, i.e., without any physical contact. In the current technology era, online market platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Olx are effectively cutting short these supply-chain overheads by establishing a direct connection between buyer and seller. Hence, the proposed implementation of a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR)-based online market place for farmers which even ensure social distancing will help to reduce the spread of the virus.

Cyberchondria can be a vulnerability factor for developing anxiety in a pandemic situation, particularly when the Internet is flooded with (mis)information. The aim of our study was to examine how cyberchondria is related to changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. Repeated cross-sectional data collection was conducted during two waves over a period of three weeks (N1 = 888; N2 = 966). The first began on the day of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Croatia (February 24th, 2020) and the second wave began three weeks later, on the day the first COVID-19 fatality was recorded in Croatia (March 19th, 2020). Participants completed an online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention (information seeking, avoidance and hygiene) and a measure of cyberchondria (Short Cyberchondria Scale, SCS). We analysed whether changes to the epidemiological situation during the period between the two waves of data collection led to an increase in COVID-19 related behaviour directly and indirectly via an increase in COVID-19 concerns. The results indicated that, between the two waves of research, there was a pronounced increase in concerns regarding COVID-19 (b = 1.11, p < .001) as well as significant behavioural changes (b = 1.18-2.34, p < .001). Also, results demonstrated that cyberchondria plays a moderating role in these changes. In the first wave, persons with severe cyberchondria were already intensely concerned with safety behaviours. High cyberchondria and high levels of concern about the COVID-19 are associated with intense avoidance behaviours, R2 = .63, p < .001. A moderated partial mediation model was confirmed, in which the effect of the epidemiological situation was weaker for those with higher results on the SCS (as indicated by index of moderated mediation between -.10 and -.15, p < .05). As such, cyberchondria is a contributing factor to long-term anxiety and its impact during pandemic on the general mental health burden should therefore be further investigated.","Jokic-Begic, Natasa; Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Mikac, Una",PLoS One,240,8

Here, we conducted longitudinal analysis over 1.8 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 183 countries or territories to capture vaccination-associated viral evolutionary patterns. To augment this macroscale analysis, we performed viral genome sequencing in 23 vaccine breakthrough COVID-19 patients and 30 unvaccinated COVID-19 patients for whom we also conducted machine-augmented curation of the electronic health records (EHRs). Strikingly, we find the diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 lineages is declining at the country-level with increased rate of mass vaccination (n = 25 countries, mean correlation coefficient = -0.72, S.D. = 0.20). Given that the COVID-19 vaccines leverage B-cell and T-cell epitopes, analysis of mutation rates shows neutralizing B-cell epitopes to be particularly more mutated than comparable amino acid clusters (4.3-fold, p < 0.001). Prospective validation of these macroscale evolutionary patterns using clinically annotated SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences confirms that vaccine breakthrough patients indeed harbor viruses with significantly lower diversity in known B cell epitopes compared to unvaccinated COVID-19 patients (2.3-fold, 95% C.I. 1.4-3.7). Incidentally, in these study cohorts, vaccinated breakthrough patients also displayed fewer COVID-associated complications and pre-existing conditions relative to unvaccinated COVID-19 patients. This study presents the first known evidence that COVID-19 vaccines are fundamentally restricting the evolutionary and antigenic escape pathways accessible to SARS-CoV-2. The societal benefit of mass vaccination may consequently go far beyond the widely reported mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and amelioration of community transmission, to include stemming of rampant viral evolution.","Niesen, Michiel; Anand, Praveen; Silvert, Eli; Suratekar, Rohit; Pawlowski, Colin; Ghosh, Pritha; Lenehan, Patrick; Hughes, Travis; Zemmour, David; OHoro, John C; Yao, Joseph D; Pritt, Bobbi S; Norgan, Andrew; Hurt, Ryan T; Badley, Andrew D; Venkatakrishnan, AJ; Soundararajan, Venky",,240,9

The past year has highlighted risks to immunosuppressed cancer patients and shown the need for health equity among vulnerable groups. In this study, we describe the utilization of virtual visits by patients with gynecologic malignancies and assess their social vulnerability. METHODS: Virtual visit data of 270 gynecology oncology patients at a single institution from March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020 was obtained by querying a cohort discovery tool. Through geocoding, the CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) was utilized to assign social vulnerability indices to each patient and the results were analyzed for trends and statistical significance. RESULTS: African American patients were the most vulnerable with a median SVI of 0.71, Asian 0.60, Hispanic 0.41, and Caucasian 0.21. Eighty-seven percent of patients in this study were Caucasian, 8.9% African American, 3.3% Hispanic, and 1.1% Asian, which is comparable to the baseline institutional gynecologic cancer population. The mean census tract SVI variable when comparing patients to all census tracts in the United States was 0.31 (range 0.00 least vulnerable to 0.98 most vulnerable). CONCLUSIONS: Virtual visits were utilized by patients of all ages and gynecologic cancer types. African Americans were the most socially vulnerable patients of the cohort. Telemedicine is a useful platform for cancer care across the social vulnerability spectrum during the pandemic and beyond.

Sixty-eight patients with breast cancer admitted in Ningde Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University from February 2014 to August 2015 were collected, and the expression level of KLF9 in cancerous tissue (n=68) and normal tissue (n=68) of the patients was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The relationship between the expression and clinical pathological features and prognosis of patients was analyzed. The expression level of KLF9 in cancerous tissue was significantly lower than that in normal tissue (P<0.05). The expression in breast cancer tissue was not significantly correlated with age, height, menstrual status, lymph node metastasis or pathological differentiation (P>0.05), but was significantly correlated with tumor size and clinical stage (P<0.05). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates in the high expression group were significantly higher than those in the low expression group (P<0.001). Univariate Cox regression analysis was carried out according to the 3-year survival of the patients, and the results showed that tumor size (P=0.009), lymph node metastasis (P=0.002), pathological differentiation (P=0.015), clinical stage (P=0.013), and KLF9 (P=0.018) were factors affecting the survival of breast cancer patients. Subsequently, multivariate Cox regression analysis of the indicators with differences showed that those indicators were independent predictors of survival of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, KLF9 expression is low in breast cancer tissue, and its expression level is related to tumor size and clinical stage. Moreover, tumor size >5 cm, lymph node metastasis, low pathological differentiation, high clinical stage and low expression of KLF9 are all important factors that cause death of patients.","Jiang, Zirong; Xu, Zhiping; Hu, Tinghui; Song, Bin; Li, Feng; Wang, Kaiyin",Oncol Lett,240,5

During social isolation, many sensory laboratories were unable to provide services, making virtual sensory sessions relevant to studying different label concepts and design preferences among consumers. This study proposed a novel virtual sensory system to analyze coffee labels using videoconference, self-reported, and biometric analysis software from video recordings to obtain sensory and emotional responses from 69 participants (power analysis: 1 − β &gt; 0.99) using six different label concepts: (i) fun, (ii) bold, (iii) natural, (iv) everyday, (v) classic, and (vi) premium. The results show that the label concept rated as having the highest perceived quality was premium, presenting significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) compared to all of the other concepts. The least perceived quality score was attributed to the bold concept due to the confronting aroma lexicon (cheese dip), which is supported by previous studies. Furthermore, even though graphics, colors, and the product name can be considered positive attributes, they do not determine perceived quality or purchase intention, which was found for the bold, everyday, and classic concepts. The findings from this study were as expected and are consistent with those from similar publications related to labels, which shows that the proposed virtual method for sensory sessions and biometrics is reliable. Further technology has been proposed to use this system with multiple participants, which could help beverage companies perform virtual sensory analysis of new products’ labels.","Claudia Gonzalez, Viejo Zhang Hanyan Khamly Annabel Xing Yunjia Fuentes Sigfredo",Beverages,240,16

It is indicated by the reputed organizations and medical fraternity that corona will stay here for a longer period contrary to the earlier assumptions. Hence the purpose of this study is to suggest a strategy which balances both preventive measures and economic losses to control the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: There is a need for the identification of the critical success factors (CSFs) for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies to control the pandemic with an economy-centric approach. Findings: The six CSFs identified are “Effective communication”, “Social distancing”, “Adopting new technology”, “Modify the rules and regulation at workplace”, “Sealing the borders of the territory” and “Strong leadership and government control”. Research limitations/implications: The study has a vital contribution to literature as no previous study has identified CSFs for developing COVID-19 preventive strategies while focusing on the economy. Practical implications: Further, these identified CSFs are helpful in medium and longer-term planning which is required to rebalance and re-energize the economy following this epidemic crisis. Originality/value: The study has given a model that depicts the cause and influence relationship between the key factors in the system under question. The importance of study increases many fold, as resources are limited and the outcome of the study could be used to channelize the resources effectively.","Kashyap, Ankur; Raghuvanshi, Juhi",Manag.

Due to the exponential growth of infections, many healthcare systems across the world are under pressure to care for increasing amounts of at-risk patients. Given the high number of infected patients, identifying patients with the highest mortality risk early is critical to enable effective intervention and optimal prioritisation of care. Here, we present the COVID-19 Early Warning System (CovEWS), a clinical risk scoring system for assessing COVID-19 related mortality risk. CovEWS provides continuous real-time risk scores for individual patients with clinically meaningful predictive performance up to 192 hours (8 days) in advance, and is automatically derived from patients' electronic health records (EHRs) using machine learning. We trained and evaluated CovEWS using de-identified data from a cohort of 66430 COVID-19 positive patients seen at over 69 healthcare institutions in the United States (US), Australia, Malaysia and India amounting to an aggregated total of over 2863 years of patient observation time. On an external test cohort of 5005 patients, CovEWS predicts COVID-19 related mortality from $78.8\%$ ($95\%$ confidence interval [CI]: $76.0$, $84.7\%$) to $69.4\%$ ($95\%$ CI: $57.6, 75.2\%$) specificity at a sensitivity greater than $95\%$ between respectively 1 and 192 hours prior to observed mortality events - significantly outperforming existing generic and COVID-19 specific clinical risk scores. CovEWS could enable clinicians to intervene at an earlier stage, and may therefore help in preventing or mitigating COVID-19 related mortality.","Schwab, Patrick; Mehrjou, Arash; Parbhoo, Sonali; Celi, Leo Anthony; Hetzel, Jurgen; Hofer, Markus; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Bauer, Stefan",,240,16

Sorting nexin 10 (SNX10) has been reported to be an important regulator in embryonic development and human diseases, however, little is known about its role in cardiac disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of SNX10 expression in AF. METHODS: Nineteen valvular heart disease patients with AF and nine valvular heart disease patients with sinus rhythm (SR) were enrolled. Atrial tissue samples from patients undergoing open heart surgery were examined. Atrial tissues of normal hearts were obtained from two cases' autopsies. The SNX10 expression and its associations with the degree of fibrosis were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome staining. RESULTS: SNX10 expression was detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac cells in human myocardial tissue. The SNX10 expression level was higher in the SR group than in the AF group (P=0.023). SNX10 expression was negatively associated with the degree of fibrosis (P=0.017, Spearman rho=-0.447), the New York Heart Association degree (P=0.003, Spearman rho=-0.545), left atrial diameter (P=0.038, Spearman rho=-0.393), right atrial diameter (P=0.043, Spearman rho=-0.386), and the brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level 24 hours after surgery (P=0.030, Spearman rho=-0.426), but not the BNP level before surgery and 72 hours after surgery. No statistical significance was observed between SNX10 and the level of troponin T and C-reactive protein. CONCLUSION: Decreased SNX10 might serve as a potential risk factor in AF of the valvular heart disease.","Yao, Jianping; Hou, Jian; Lv, Linhua; Song, Chen; Zhang, Mingxia; Wu, Zhongkai",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,240,1

The aim of this work was to evaluate the presence of protocols, management in the emergency department (ED) and the availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds for severe COVID-19 patients attended in Spanish hospital EDs during the first peak of the 2020 pandemic. METHODS: Questionnaire collecting data regarding ED care in March-April 2020 aimed at all Spanish public health care EDs. The respondents were the Chiefs of EDs. The variables of interest were: 1) Presence and of compliance with ED protocols for decision making and adequacy of therapeutic effort;2) management of COVID-19 patients with non-invasive mechanical ventilation (NIMV) or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in the ED;and 3) ICU bed accessibility for ED patients. The results were compared based on the characteristics of the hospital, impact of the pandemic and autonomous community. A descriptive and inferential analysis of the variables studied was performed using the chi-square test and analysis of variance. RESULTS: A total of 246 questionnaires (89%) were received. Protocols were available in 136 EDs (57.1%). Globally, the protocol was applied in >95% of the EDs, although this was less frequent (76%) in EDs with high impact of the pandemic. 53% of the EDs managed patients with severe COVID-19 with NIMV/HFNC in the ED itself, and 19.4% suffered from lack of ICU beds. The lack of ICU beds for severe COVID-19 patients in the ED significantly differed among periods, and more marked in hospitals with ICU and with high pandemic impact. CONCLUSIONS: It is needed to generalize the implementation of protocols in EDs for the management of severe COVID-19 patients and improve the capacity of the ICUs to homogeneously adjust to the needs.","Miro, O.; Alquezar-Arbe, A.; Pinera, P.; Jacob, J.; Martin, A.; Llorens, P.; Jimenez, S.; Gonzalez Del Castillo, J.; Garcia-Lamberechts, E.

By tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data, the tru-AI approach is designed to calculate surrogates for measuring important disease-related observational quantities over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach, we analyzed service requests for automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT using a commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based prioritization of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in patients with emergent clinical findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism.We analyzed data of N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast head CT studies at a major US healthcare system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020, and compared two observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1-30, 2020. Results: Although daily CT scan counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/- 7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be observed by AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p<0.05), with approximately one daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data in radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile exploratory tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on healthcare.","Wismuller, Axel; Stockmaster, Larry",,240,25

METHODS: A total of 2,558 upper respiratory tract (URT) and lower respiratory tract (LRT) specimens from 138 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease were analyzed. Measurements of sequential viral loads were aggregated using the cubic spline smoothing function of a generalized additive model. The time to negative conversion was compared between symptom groups using survival analysis. RESULTS: In URT samples, viral RNA levels peaked on day 4 after symptom onset and rapidly decreased until day 10 for both E and RdRp genes, whereas those in LRT samples immediately peaked from symptom onset and decreased until days 15.6 and 15.0 for E and RdRp genes, respectively. Median (interquartile range) time to negative conversion was significantly longer in symptomatic (18.0 [13.0-25.0] days) patients than in asymptomatic (13.0 [9.5-17.5] days) patients. The more types of symptoms a patient had, the longer the time to negative conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The viral load rapidly changes depending on the time after symptom onset; the viral shedding period may be longer with more clinical symptoms. Different isolation policies should be applied depending on disease severity.","Lim, Ah-Young; Cheong, Hae-Kwan; Oh, Yoon Ju; Lee, Jae Kap; So, Jae Bum; Kim, Hyun Jin; Han, Boram; Park, Sung Won; Jang, Yongsun; Yoon, Chang Yong; Park, Yun Ok; Kim, Jong-Hun; Kim, Jin Yong",Int J Infect Dis,240,24

Though short-term immune-related adverse events are routinely described, longer-term immune consequences and sequential immune monitoring are not as well defined. In 2006, six healthy volunteers received TGN1412, a CD28 superagonist antibody, in a first-in-man clinical trial and suffered from cytokine storm. After the initial cytokine release, antibody effect-specific immune monitoring started on Day + 10 and consisted mainly of evaluation of dendritic cell and T-cell subsets and 15 serum cytokines at 21 time-points over 2 years. All patients developed problems with concentration and memory; three patients were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Mild neutropenia and autoantibody production was observed intermittently. One patient suffered from peripheral dry gangrene, required amputations, and had persistent Raynaud's phenomenon. Gastrointestinal irritability was noted in three patients and coincided with elevated Î³Î´T-cells. One had pruritus associated with elevated IgE levels, also found in three other asymptomatic patients. Dendritic cells, initially undetectable, rose to normal within a month. Naïve CD8+ T-cells were maintained at high levels, whereas naïve CD4+ and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells started high but declined over 2 years. T-regulatory cells cycled circannually and were normal in number. Cytokine dysregulation was especially noted in one patient with systemic symptoms. Over a 2-year follow-up, cognitive deficits were observed in all patients following TGN1412 infusion. Some also had signs or symptoms of psychological, mucosal or immune dysregulation. These observations may discern immunopathology, treatment targets, and long-term monitoring strategies for other patients undergoing immunotherapy or with cytokine storm.","Panoskaltsis, Nicki; McCarthy, Neil E; Stagg, Andrew J; Mummery, Catherine J; Husni, Mariwan; Arebi, Naila; Greenstein, David; Price, Claire L; Al-Hassi, Hafid O; Koutinas, Michalis; Mantalaris, Athanasios; Knight, Stella C",,240,24

Moreover, due to the current pandemic, some countries have prioritized health resources towards COVID-19 management, making it more challenging to appropriately care for other potentially disabling and fatal diseases such as stroke. The aim of this study is to identify and describe changes in stroke epidemiological trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is an international, multicenter, hospital-based study on stroke incidence and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will describe patterns in stroke management, stroke hospitalization rate, and stroke severity, subtype (ischemic/hemorrhagic), and outcomes (including in-hospital mortality) in 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic, comparing them with the corresponding data from 2018 and 2019, and subsequently 2021. We will also use an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis to assess the change in stroke hospitalization rates before, during, and after COVID-19, in each participating center. CONCLUSION: The proposed study will potentially enable us to better understand the changes in stroke care protocols, differential hospitalization rate, and severity of stroke, as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, this will help guide clinical-based policies surrounding COVID-19 and other similar global pandemics to ensure that management of cerebrovascular comorbidity is appropriately prioritized during the global crisis. It will also guide public health guidelines for at-risk populations to reduce risks of complications from such comorbidities.","Abootalebi, Shahram; Aertker, Benjamin M; Andalibi, Mohammad Sobhan; Asdaghi, Negar; Aykac, Ozlem; Azarpazhooh, M Reza; Bahit, M Cecilia; Barlinn, Kristian; Basri, Hamidon; Shahripour, Reza Bavarsad; Bersano, Anna; Biller, Jose; Borhani-Haghighi, Afshin; Brown, Robert D; Campbell, Bruce Cv; Cruz-Flores, Salvador; De Silva, Deidre Anne; Napoli, Mario Di; Divani, Afshin A; Edgell, Randall C; Fifi, Johanna T; Ghoreishi, Abdoreza; Hirano, Teruyuki; Hong, Keun-Sik; Hsu, Chung Y; Huang, Josephine F; Inoue, Manabu; Jagolino, Amanda L; Kapral, Moira; Kee, Hoo Fan; Keser, Zafer; Khatri, Rakesh; Koga, Masatoshi; Krupinski, Jerzy; Liebeskind, David S; Liu, Liping; Ma, Henry; Maud, Alberto; McCullough, Louise D; Meyer, Dawn Matherne; Mifsud, Victoria; Morovatdar, Negar; Nilanont, Yongchai; Oxley, Thomas J; Özdemir, Atilla Özcan; Pandian, Jeyaraj; Pantoni, Leonardo; Papamitsakis, Nikolaos I H; Parry-Jones, Adrian; Phan, Thanh",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,240,16

However, the scale of the problem is unquantified, impeding development of effective mitigations. We aimed to ascertain what has happened to general practice contacts for acute physical and mental health outcomes during the pandemic. METHODS: Using de-identified electronic health records from the Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) Aurum (covering 13% of the UK population), between 2017 and 2020, we calculated weekly primary care contacts for selected acute physical and mental health conditions: anxiety, depression, self-harm (fatal and non-fatal), severe mental illness, eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, acute alcohol-related events, asthma exacerbation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, acute cardiovascular events (cerebrovascular accident, heart failure, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attacks, unstable angina, and venous thromboembolism), and diabetic emergency. Primary care contacts included remote and face-to-face consultations, diagnoses from hospital discharge letters, and secondary care referrals, and conditions were identified through primary care records for diagnoses, symptoms, and prescribing. Our overall study population included individuals aged 11 years or older who had at least 1 year of registration with practices contributing to CPRD Aurum in the specified period, but denominator populations varied depending on the condition being analysed. We used an interrupted time-series analysis to formally quantify changes in conditions after the introduction of population-wide restrictions (defined as March 29, 2020) compared with the period before their introduction (defined as Jan 1, 2017 to March 7, 2020), with data excluded for an adjustment-to-restrictions period (March 8-28). FINDINGS: The overall population included 9â863â903 individuals on Jan 1, 2017, and increased to 10â226â939 by Jan 1, 2020. Primary care contacts for almost all conditions dropped considerably after the introduction of population-wide restrictions. The largest reductions were observed for contacts for diabetic emergencies (odds ratio 0·35 [95% CI 0·25-0·50]), depression (0·53 [0·52-0·53]), and self-harm (0·56 [0·54-0·58]). In the interrupted time-series analysis, with the exception of acute alcohol-related events (0·98 [0·89-1·10]), there was evidence of a reduction in contacts for all conditions (anxiety 0·67 [0·66-0·67], eating disorders 0·62 [0·59-0·66], obsessive-compulsive disorder [0·69 [0·64-0·74]], self-harm 0·56 [0·54-0·58], severe mental illness 0·80 [0·78-0·83], stroke 0·59 [0·56-0·62], transient ischaemic attack 0·63 [0·58-0·67], heart failure 0·62 [0·60-0·64], myocardial infarction 0·72 [0·68-0·77], unstable angina 0·72 [0·60-0·87], venous thromboembolism 0·94 [0·90-0·99], and asthma exacerbation 0·88 [0·86-0·90]). By July, 2020, except for unstable angina and acute alcohol-related events, contacts for all conditions had not recovered to pre-lockdown levels. INTERPRETATION: There were substantial reductions in primary care contacts for acute physical and mental conditions following the introduction of restrictions, with limited recovery by July, 2020. Further research is needed to ascertain whether these reductions reflect changes in disease frequency or missed opportunities for care. Maintaining health-care access should be a key priority in future public health planning, including further restrictions. The conditions we studied are sufficiently severe that any unmet need will have substantial ramifications for the people with the conditions as well as health-care provision.

In light of this question, the present essay tries to discern the role of international law in handling disease outbreaks. It wants to know whether there are sufficient international legal safeguards to address disease outbreaks and whether liability can be fastened on nation-states (including their people), international organisations, etc., if they are found to be directly and substantially responsible for such outbreaks. It dissects theoretical frameworks, analyses and interprets the existing literature to conclude that a 'one-size-fits-all' international legal approach is required to control disease outbreaks. It eventually recommends the need to have a Pandemic Convention. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Banerjee, R.; Kumar, A.",International Journal of Public Law and Policy,240,16

We construct an efficient filtered simplicial complex (FSC) such that the voids in our FSC are in one-to-one correspondence with the anomalies. Our approach goes beyond simply identifying anomalies; it also encodes information about the relationships between anomalies. We use vineyards, which one can interpret as time-varying persistence diagrams (an approach for visualizing PH), to track how the locations of the anomalies change over time. We conduct two case studies using spatially heterogeneous COVID-19 data. First, we examine vaccination rates in New York City by zip code.

L'objectif de cette étude était de décrire les conséquences à quatre mois chez les patients ayant été hospitalisés pour COVID-19 au printemps 2020. Dans une étude prospective de cohorte non contrôlée, les survivants du COVID-19 hospitalisés dans un hôpital universitaire en France entre le 1er mars et le 29 mai 2020 ont fait l'objet d'une évaluation téléphonique quatre mois après leur sortie, entre le 15 juillet et le 18 septembre 2020, évaluant les symptômes respiratoires, cognitifs et fonctionnels. Tous les patients présentant des symptômes cliniquement significatifs, ainsi que tous les patients hospitalisés dans une unité de soins intensifs (USI) ont été convoqués pour une évaluation approfondie en hôpital de jour (HDJ) pluridisciplinaire (épreuves fonctionnelles respiratoires, tomodensitométrie pulmonaire, tests psychométriques et cognitifs). Parmi 834 patients éligibles, 478 ont pu être évalués lors de la consultation téléphonique (âge moyen 61 (écart type (ET) : 16) ans, 201 hommes, 277 femmes). Lors de l'entretien téléphonique, 244/478 (51 %) patients ont déclaré au moins un symptôme qui n'existait pas avant le COVID-19 : fatigue chez 134/431 (31 %), symptômes cognitifs chez 86/416 (21 %) et dyspnée d'apparition nouvelle chez 78/478 (16 %) patients. Parmi ces 478 patients, 177 (37 %) ont été évalués de manière plus approfondie en HDJ, dont 97 des 142 patients ayant été hospitalisés en soins intensifs. Le score médian du Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI20), évalué chez 130 patients, était de 4,5 [IQR, 3,0-5,0] pour l' « altération de la motivation » et de 3,7 [IQR, 3,0-4,5] pour la « fatigue mentale » (5 étant le pire état de fatigue ressenti). Le score médian du SF36 évaluant la qualité de vie, évalué chez 145 patients, était de 25 [IQR, 25,0-75,0] pour la sous-dimension « Rôle limité en raison de problèmes physiques » (pire score : 0, meilleur score : 100). Des anomalies de la tomodensitométrie pulmonaire ont été observées chez 108/171 (63 %) patients, principalement des opacités persistantes en verre dépoli. Des lésions fibrotiques ont été observées chez 33/171 (19 %) patients au total, incluant 19/49 (39 %) patients ayant présenté un syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë, impliquant &lt; 25 % du parenchyme chez tous les patients sauf un. Des symptômes d'anxiété, de dépression et de stress post-traumatiques ont été observés chez 22/94 (23 %), 17/94 (18 %) et 7/94 (7 %) patients ayant été admis en USI, respectivement. La fraction d'éjection ventriculaire gauche était &lt; 50 % chez 8/83 (10 %) patients post-USI. Deux nouvelles maladies rénales chroniques ont été observées, toutes deux chez des patients post-USI. La sérologie anti-SARS COV2 était positive chez 172/177 (97 %) patients. Quatre mois après l'hospitalisation pour COVID-19, les patients de cette large cohorte rapportaient fréquemment des symptômes non présents auparavant, et les anomalies du scanner pulmonaire étaient courants chez ceux qui ont été testés. Ces résultats sont limités par l'absence de données pré-COVID dans cette cohorte ou de groupe témoin ;des études supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour le suivi de ces symptômes sur le long terme et leur association avec la maladie.

For low overall infection levels in the population, pooling of samples can drastically amplify the testing efficiency. Here we present a formula to estimate the optimal pooling size, the efficiency gain (tested persons per test), and the expected upper bound of missed infections in the pooled testing, all as a function of the populationwide infection levels and the false negative/positive rates of the currently used PCR tests. Assuming an infection level of 0.1 % and a false negative rate of 2 %, the optimal pool size is about 32, the efficiency gain is about 15 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 1 % the optimal pool size is 11, the efficiency gain is 5.1 tested persons per test. For an infection level of 10 % the optimal pool size reduces to about 4, the efficiency gain is about 1.7 tested persons per test. For infection levels of 30 % and higher there is no more benefit from pooling. To see to what extent replicates of the pooled tests improve the estimate of the maximal number of missed infections, we present all results for 1, 3, and 5 replicates.","Hanel, Rudolf; Thurner, Stefan",,240,21

This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method to implement virtual screening with convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The descriptors represent chemical molecules, and these descriptors are input into the CNN framework to train a model and predict active compounds. When compared to other machine learning methods, including random forest, naive Bayes, decision tree, and support vector machine, the proposed CNN model's evaluation of the test set showed an accuracy of 0.86, a sensitivity of 0.45, a specificity of 0.96, a precision of 0.73, a recall of 0.45, an F-measure of 0.55, and a ROC of 0.71. The CNN model screened 17 out of 918 phytochemical compounds; 60 out of 423 from the natural product NCI divset IV; 17,831 out of 112,267 from the ZINC natural product database; and 315 out of 1556 FDA-approved drugs as anti-SARS-CoV agents. Further, to prioritize drug-like compounds, Lipinski's rule of five was applied to screen anti-SARS-CoV compounds (excluding FDA-approved drugs), resulting in 10, 59, and 14,025 hit molecules. Out of 10 phytochemical compounds, 9 anti-SARS-CoV agents belonged to the flavonoid group. In conclusion, the proposed CNN model can prove useful for developing novel target-specific anti-SARS-CoV compounds.","Kumari, Madhulata; Subbarao, Naidu",Comput Biol Med,240,24

We interviewed 136 German subjects over five weeks from the end of March to the end of April 2020 during the first wave of infections about their preferred interpersonal distance (IPD) before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, subjects adapted to distance requirements and preferred a larger IPD. This enlarged IPD was judged to partially persist after the pandemic crisis. People anticipated keeping more IPD to others even if there was no longer any risk of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also sampled two follow-up measurements, one in August, after the first wave of infections had been flattened, and one in October 2020, at the beginning of the second wave. Here, we observed that IPD varied with the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 within Germany. Overall, our data indicated that adaptation to distance requirements might happen asymmetrically. Preferred IPD rapidly adapted in response to distance requirements, but an enlargement of IPD may partially linger after the COVID-19 pandemic-crisis. We discuss our findings in light of proxemic theory and as an indicator for socio-cultural adaptation beyond the course of the pandemic.","Welsch, Robin; Wessels, Marlene; Bernhard, Christoph; Thönes, Sven; von Castell, Christoph",Sci Rep,240,29

Well-being is a critical priority for the cancer organization because burnout adversely impacts the quality of care, patient satisfaction, the workforce, and overall practice success. To date, 45% of U.S. ASCO member medical oncologists report experiencing burnout symptoms of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. As the COVID-19 pandemic remains widespread with periods of outbreaks, recovery, and response with substantial personal and professional consequences for the clinician, it is imperative that the oncologist, team, and organization gain direct access to resources addressing burnout. In response, the Clinician Well-Being Task Force was created to improve the quality, safety, and value of cancer care by enhancing oncology clinician well-being and practice sustainability. Well-being is an integrative concept that characterizes quality of life and encompasses an individual's work- and personal health-related environmental, organizational, and psychosocial factors. These resources can be useful for the cancer organization to develop a well-being blueprint: a detailed start plan with recognized strategies and interventions targeting all oncology stakeholders to support a culture of community in oncology.","Hlubocky, Fay J; Shanafelt, Tait D; Back, Anthony L; Paice, Judith A; Tetzlaff, Eric D; Friese, Christopher R; Kamal, Arif H; McFarland, Daniel C; Lyckholm, Laurie; Gallagher, Colleen M; Chatwal, Monica; Saltzman, Joel; Dudzinski, Denise; Burke, John M; James, Ted A; Page, Ray D; Boyle, Deborah A; Gonzalez, Maria M; Srivastava, Piyush",Am Soc Clin Oncol Educ Book,240,20

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Communities in Honolulu, Hawai'i. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 430 older Chinese Americans aged 55 years and older. MEASURES: Measures included ACP contemplation, ACP discussion, and EOL preference in burial planning, immigrant status, family cohesion, family conflict, demographic information, and health status. RESULTS: Results show that in comparison to foreign-born Chinese Americans, US-born Chinese Americans were more likely to have ACP contemplation [odds ratio (OR) 2.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39-5.63], ACP discussion (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.50-6.08), and preferences for burial plans at the end of life (OR 4.56, 95% CI 2.04-10.18).

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF and its short-term mortality risk in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed in abstracting data and assessing validity. We searched MEDLINE and Scopus to locate all the articles published up to January 31, 2021, reporting data on pre-existing AF among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was calculated using a random effects model and presenting the related 95% confidence interval (CI), while the mortality risk was estimated using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) and related 95% CI. Statistical heterogeneity was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Twelve studies, enrolling 15.562 COVID-19 patients (mean age 71.6 years), met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence of pre-existing AF was 11.0% of cases (95% CI: 7.8-15.2%, p < 0.0001) with high heterogeneity (I2 = 95.2%).

Faced up with the unprecedented nature of this situation, the liberal psychotherapist is led to rethink some aspects of the framework of his practice in order to preserve the thread of the transferential relationship. The authors develop a clinical reflection on the clinical setting in a pandemic period by exploring in particular the dynamics of telephone sessions. For telephone interviews, the question of the sound envelope is central, in particular regarding the psychic function of silence. We choose to illustrate our point with short vignettes than by relying on long-term clinical cases, more likely to represent the variety of new clinical situations encountered and the questions that accompany them. This article introduces his point by recounting the plague epidemic in ancient Greece to show the impact of the environment on humans and its collective fantasy implications. Being faced up with death, contamination, the invisible enemy brings out a palpable concern. It is indeed quite remarkable that these same reactions and concerns in front of death caused by the pandemic match whith what is related by Thucydides who survived the plague, which affected Athens during the Peloponnesian War. In another context, Winnicott highlights the place and importance of the therapeutic environment. It is both a question of adjusting the framework according to the context while maintaining certain intangible aspects representing the permanence of the link and its framework. A framework cannot exist without being kept, which is equivalent to thinking of the framework above all as an internal framework, questioning the clinician about what he values and what he makes sense in his practice. In the current context, these questions arise from the perspective of a certain flexibility, depending on the human context (child, adolescent, consultations, etc.) or external context (crisis linked to a virus, etc.) showing that it is more than never question of exercising on a case-by-case basis, taking into account changes in the environment. The initial observation during this period of confinement concerns the fact that some patients contact a therapist for the first time by telephone and wish to initiate psychotherapy (during this period) when they explain that such an initiative was not possible. despite the difficulties already encountered in the past. But there is also the opposite case: patients who have no intention of continuing the work already started during this time. Thus, faced up with the injunction of confinement, they show themselves in the psychic impossibility of following the treatment by other means such as, for example, telephone sessions. In this perspective, the silence on the phone takes on a different tone; silence reveals itself to be a source of greater anxiety than in presence: the presence of bodies, of its movements perceptible as imperceptible, of a gesture that carries or accompanies the senses, breathing, the visual context of the office and of its ""decor"", represent as many essential elements in the usual capacity of the frame; in the absence of these basic sensory elements, silence can be experienced as a void, or even a gap in the bond, opening Pandora's box of paranoid fantasies acting unconsciously. If silence is representative of the whole framework, it promotes in this context the partialization of the clinician's body reduced to one ear and not to a whole body. Here, it is the change of framework that mobilizes the difference, established by Mr. Klein, between the partial and total object; this circumstance neo-framework could therefore call for regressive movements, undoing the silence of its symbolic function when the bodies are present.","Houssier, Florian; Christaki, Angélique; Vlachopoulou, Xanthie",Ann. med.-psychol,240,16

DESIGN: Rapid review with meta-analysis and narrative synthesis. METHODS: We searched databases including Embase, Medline, medRxiv and Google Scholar up to 26 August 2020 for studies describing COVID-19 outcomes in PLWH and conducted a meta-analysis of higher quality studies. RESULTS: We identified 1908 studies and included 19 in the review. In a meta-analysis of five studies, PLWH had a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality [hazard ratio 1.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.62-2.34] compared with people without HIV. Risk of death remained elevated for PLWH in a subgroup analysis of hospitalized cohorts (hazard ratio 1.60, 95% CI: 1.12-2.27) and studies of PLWH across all settings (hazard ratio 2.08, 95% CI: 1.69-2.56). Eight other studies assessed the association between HIV and COVID-19 outcomes, but provided inconclusive, lower quality evidence due to potential confounding and selection bias. There were insufficient data on the effect of CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load on COVID-19 outcomes. Eleven studies reported COVID-19 outcomes by ART-regimen. In the two largest studies, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-based regimens were associated with a lower risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes, although these analyses are susceptible to confounding by co-morbidities. CONCLUSION: Emerging evidence suggests a moderately increased risk of COVID-19 mortality among PLWH. Further investigation into the relationship between COVID-19 outcomes and CD4+ T-cell count, HIV viral load, ART and the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is warranted.","Mellor, Maya M; Bast, Anne C; Jones, Nicholas R; Roberts, Nia W; Ordóñez-Mena, José M; Reith, Alastair J M; Butler, Christopher C; Matthews, Philippa C; Dorward, Jienchi",AIDS,240,1

Traditionally, community prevalence has been assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However, despite the increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been met in most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method for communities to determine disease prevalence. This is further complicated by the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and spread varies across different spatial, temporal, and demographics. In this study, we understand trends in the spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms surveys as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess community disease prevalence, even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability. Using individually reported symptom data from various populations, our method predicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive for COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 60.40\% with 95\% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than the original in a population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported symptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15 (MRE of 23.61\% with 95\% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York.

SARS-COV2 transmission to healthcare personnel (HCP) and hospitalized patients is a significant challenge. Our hospital is a quaternary healthcare system with more than 500 beds and 8,000 HCP. Between April 1 and April 17, 2020, we instituted several infection prevention strategies to limit transmission of SARSCOV2 including universal masking of HCP and patients, surveillance testing every two weeks for high-risk HCP and every week for cluster units, and surveillance testing for all patients on admission and prior to invasive procedures. On July 6, 2020, we implemented universal face shield for all healthcare personnel upon entry to facility. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of face shield policy on SARS-COV2 infection among HCP and hospitalized patients. Methods. The preintervention period (April 17, 2020-July 5, 2020) included implementation of universal face masks and surveillance testing of HCP and patients. The intervention period (July 6, 2020-July 26, 2020) included the addition of face shield to all HCP (for patient encounters and staff-to-staff encounters). We used interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression to examine the effect of our intervention on the difference in proportion of HCP positive for SARS-COV2 (using logistic regression) and HAI (using Poisson regression). We defined significance as p values &lt; 0.05. Results. Of 4731 HCP tested, 192 tested positive for SARS-COV2 (4.1%). In the preintervention period, the weekly positivity rate among HCP increased from 0% to 12.9%. During the intervention period, the weekly positivity rate among HCP decreased to 2.3%, with segmented regression showing a change in predicted proportion positive in week 13 (18.0% to 3.7%, p&lt; 0.001) and change in the post-intervention slope on the log odds scale (p&lt; 0.001). A total of 14 HAI cases were identified. In the preintervention period, HAI cases increased from 0 to 5. During the intervention period, HAI cases decreased to 0. There was a change between pre-intervention and post-intervention slope on the log scale was significant (p&lt; 0.01). Conclusion. Our study showed that the universal use of face shield was associated with significant reduction in SARS-COV2 infection among HCP and hospitalized patients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this observational longitudinal study was to identify nonoverlapping severity subgroups (ie, clusters) among patients with COVID-19, based exclusively on clinical data and standard laboratory tests obtained during patient assessment in the emergency department. METHODS: We applied unsupervised machine learning to a data set of 853 patients with COVID-19 from the HM group of hospitals (HM Hospitales) in Madrid, Spain. Age and sex were not considered while building the clusters, as these variables could introduce biases in machine learning algorithms and raise ethical implications or enable discrimination in triage protocols. RESULTS: From 850 clinical and laboratory variables, four tests-the serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the number of neutrophils-were enough to segregate the entire patient pool into three separate clusters. Further, the percentage of monocytes and lymphocytes and the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) distinguished cluster 3 patients from the other two clusters. The highest proportion of deceased patients; the highest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the highest number of neutrophils; and the lowest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 1. Cluster 2 included a lower proportion of deceased patients and intermediate levels of the previous laboratory tests. The lowest proportion of deceased patients; the lowest levels of AST, ALT, LDH, and CRP; the lowest number of neutrophils; and the highest percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes characterized cluster 3. CONCLUSIONS: A few standard laboratory tests, deemed available in all emergency departments, have shown good discriminative power for the characterization of severity subgroups among patients with COVID-19.","Benito-León, Julián; Del Castillo, Mª Dolores; Estirado, Alberto; Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Serrano, J Ignacio",J Med Internet Res,240,30

Of note are also the observed elevations in D-dimer which correlated with disease severity and mortality. It has also has been theorized that microthrombi may play a role in the dysfunction of the respiratory system which may correspond with the elevation of D-dimer. We decided to observe the relationship between D-dimer on presentation and changes in right heart function and hemodynamics as measured by right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP). Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 21 patients who had D-dimer measured on arrival to the hospital and also had transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) done during the course of their hospital stay. RVSP was calculated on each of the 21 patients. Results: In our sample of 21 patients, there was a statistically significant association between D-dimer levels and RVSP. Conclusions: Based on our results, there is evidence that elevated D-dimer levels in patients infected with Covid-19 are associated with elevated RVSP. This raises the question as to whether or not there would be benefit in treatment (i.e. therapeutic anticoagulation) to try and prevent right ventricular dysfunction in patients with Covid-19;this question would require further research to fully answer.","Gioia, M.; Friedman, A.; Erdinc, B.; Amoda, O.; Majumder, M.; Sahni, S.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,240,21

The online survey took â¼10-15 min to complete, the survey was available from March 31 to April 20, 2020. Results: Two hundred sixty-four (n = 264, 60.8%) individuals had used telemedicine on or before December 2019 and 170 (39.2%) individuals used telemedicine for the first time January 2020 or later. There were no significant differences in demographics between groups, except that new users were more likely to have a primary care physician [F(407) = 13.51, p < 0.001]. Satisfaction of telemedicine was measured using a 10-item scale, demonstrating that all participants were overall satisfied with their telemedicine experience(s), (mean = 1.67, standard deviation = 0.61). Broadly, the differences in perceptions between the groups included the reasons for using telemedicine, perceptions of quality of in-person care, continuity of care, and a technical issue.

Further, due to frequent antigenic shifts and drift of influenza viruses, annual reformulation and revaccination are required in order to match circulating strains. Thus, the development of a universal influenza vaccine (UIV) is critical for long-term protection against all seasonal influenza virus strains, as well as to provide protection against a potential pandemic virus. One of the most important strategies in the development of UIVs is the selection of optimal targeting antigens to generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies or cross-reactive T cell responses against divergent influenza virus strains. However, each type of target antigen for UIVs has advantages and limitations for the generation of sufficient immune responses against divergent influenza viruses.

Government agencies and medical institutions have encouraged people to use medical information technology (MIT) to manage their conditions and promote personal health. In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19 and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly important to contain disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand people’s intention to use the electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting their intention to use this platform. METHODS: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use. Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly disagree” (1 point) to “strongly agree” (5 points). Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software. RESULTS: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected (female: 219/350, 62.6%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0%; university-level education: 228/350, 65.1%; occupation as student: 195/350, 56.6%; average monthly income <NT $30,000 [<US $1054.89]: 230/350, 65.7%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4%; and health status perceived as “good”: 171/350, 48.9%).

The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated that the most important factor affecting respondents’ behavioral intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07). CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation model with a strong goodness of fit.

The results allow designing haematological and electrophoretic profiles typical of each group, most likely depending on the management and on the health status of the group rather than on the prevalence of FIP. In fact, many cats from the colonies with open management and frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases other than FIP had one or more haematological and/or electrophoretical changes consistent with FIP, compared with the reference ranges. In the case of non‐specific clinical signs such as fever or neurological signs because of diseases other than FIP, these cats would be erroneously considered as affected by FIP and euthanasized. The use of internal ranges designed on the basis of repeated samplings from non‐symptomatic cats allows avoiding these misinterpretations. Results from cats with symptoms consistent with FIP living in the same colonies were also compared with both the reference ranges and the internal ones: such a comparison demonstrated that the use of internal ranges rarely affected the possibility to correctly diagnose the disease in cats with symptoms suggestive of FIP.","Paltrinieri, S.; Comazzi, S.; Spagnolo, V.; Giordano, A.",J Vet Med A Physiol Pathol Clin Med,240,11

METHODS: We evaluated 11 risk stratification scores in a binational retrospective cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia in São Paulo and Barcelona: Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), CURB, CURB-65, qSOFA, Infectious Disease Society of America and American Thoracic Society Minor Criteria, REA-ICU, SCAP, SMART-COP, CALL, COVID GRAM and 4C. The primary and secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and seven-day intensive-care unit (ICU) admission respectively. We compared their predictive performance using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, calibration plots and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 1363 patients, the mean (SD) age was 61 (16) years. The 30-day in-hospital mortality rate was 24.6% (228/925) in São Paulo and 21.0% (92/438) in Barcelona. For in-hospital mortality, we found higher AUROCs for PSI (0.79, 95%CI 0.77–0.82), 4C (0.78, 95%CI 0.75–0.81), COVID GRAM (0.77, 95%CI 0.75–0.80), and CURB-65 (0.74 95%CI 0.72–0.77). Results were similar for both countries. For most 1-20% threshold range in decision curve analysis, PSI would avoid a higher number of unnecessary interventions, followed by the 4C score. All scores had poor performance (AUROC<0.65) for seven-day ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Recent clinical COVID-19 assessment scores had comparable performance to standard pneumonia assessment tools.

COVID-19 prevention and containment policies can be considered under the core goal of social and individual interests. In this study we analyzed the complexity between individual and public interests as they conflict when implementing disease preventative measures on an epidemic scale. The analysis was used to explore this complex landscape of conflicting social, public, and legal interests to quantify the potential benefits of public acceptance. Here we use the large-scale COVID-19 epidemic backdrop to examine legal norms of the emergency management legal framework. We find that the implementation of emergency management legal system measures involves the resolution of both direct and indirect conflicts of interest among public groups, individual groups, and various subsets of each. When competing interests are not balanced, optimal policies cannot be achieved to serve and safeguard shared social and community stability, whereas effective social outcomes are obtainable through the development of targeted policies as defined within the emergency management legal system. A balanced legal framework in regards to emergency management legal norms can more effectively serve to mitigate and prevent the continued spread of emerging infectious diseases. Further developing innovative procedural mechanisms as a means to ensure emergency response intervention should take into account the weighted interest of the different social parties to determine priorities and aims to protect legitimate public interests.","Zhang, Chao; Hong, Lei; Ma, Ning; Sun, Guohui",Healthcare (Basel),240,2

To address this gap, we conducted a systematic post-mortem surveillance study to directly measure the fatal impact of CV19 in an urban African population. Design We enrolled deceased individuals at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) Morgue in Lusaka, Zambia. We obtained nasopharyngeal swabs for testing via reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) against the SARS-2 Coronavirus. We stratified deaths by CV19 status, by location, age, sex, and underlying risk factors. Setting UTH is the largest tertiary care referral hospital in Zambia and its morgue registers ~80% of Lusaka's deaths. Participants Participants of all ages were enrolled if within 48 hours of death and if the next of kin or representative provided written informed consent. Results We enrolled 372 participants between June and September 2020, and had PCR results for 364 (99.5%). CV19 was detected in 70/364 (19.2%). The median age for CV19+ deaths was 48 years (IQR 36-72 years) and 70% were male. Most CV19+ deaths (51/70, 72.8%) occurred in the community; none had been tested for CV19 antemortem. Among the 19/70 facility deaths, six were tested antemortem. Among the 52/70 CV19 deaths with symptoms data, 44/52 had typical symptoms of CV19 (cough, fever, shortness of breath), of whom only five were tested antemortem. We identified CV19 among seven children; only one had been tested antemortem. The proportion of CV19+ deaths increased with age, but 75.7% of CV19+ deaths were aged <60 years. The five most common co-morbidities among CV19+ deaths were: tuberculosis (31.4%); hypertension (27.1%); HIV/AIDS (22.9%); alcohol use (17.1%); and diabetes (12.9%). Conclusions Contrary to expectations, CV19+ deaths were common in Lusaka. The majority occurred in the community where testing capacity is lacking. Yet few who died at facilities were tested, despite presenting with typical symptoms of CV19. Therefore, CV19 cases were under reported because testing was rarely done, not because CV19 was rare. If our data are generalizable, the impact of CV19 in Africa has been vastly underestimated.","Mwananyanda, L.; gill, c.; MacLeod, W.; Kwenda, G.; Pieciak, R.; Mupila, Z.; Mupeta, F.; Forman, L.; Ziko, L.; Etter, L.; Thea, D.",,240,3

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, like SARS-CoV-1, uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor to initiate infection. Compounds that interfere with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain protein (RBD)-ACE2 receptor interaction may function as entry inhibitors. Here, we used a dual strategy of molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) screening of compound libraries to identify those that bind to human ACE2 or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Molecular modeling screening interrogated 57,641 compounds and focused on the region of ACE2 that is engaged by RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and vice versa. SPR screening used immobilized human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to evaluate the binding of these proteins to a library of 3,141 compounds. These combined screens identified compounds from these libraries that bind at K(D) (equilibrium dissociation constant) <3 μM affinity to their respective targets, 17 for ACE2 and 6 for SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Twelve ACE2 binders and six of the RBD binders compete with the RBD-ACE2 interaction in an SPR-based competition assay. These compounds included registered drugs and dyes used in biomedical applications. A Vero-E6 cell-based SARS-CoV-2 infection assay was used to evaluate infection blockade by candidate entry inhibitors. Three compounds demonstrated dose-dependent antiviral in vitro potency—Evans blue, sodium lifitegrast, and lumacaftor.

In conclusion, intranasal vaccination reduced shedding in two different SARS-CoV-2 animal models, justifying further investigation as a potential vaccination route for COVID-19 vaccines.","van Doremalen, Neeltje; Purushotham, Jyothi N.; Schulz, Jonathan E.; Holbrook, Myndi G.; Bushmaker, Trenton; Carmody, Aaron; Port, Julia R.; Yinda, Claude K.; Okumura, Atsushi; Saturday, Greg; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian; Hanley, Patrick W.; Smith, Brian J.; Lovaglio, Jamie; Anzick, Sarah L.; Barbian, Kent; Martens, Craig; Gilbert, Sarah; Lambe, Teresa; Munster, Vincent J.",bioRxiv,240,1

Currently, effective, evidence-based interventions and resources helping people after bowel cancer to adopt new lifestyle habits are lacking. The aim of this trial is to test the Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyle After Bowel Cancer (HEAL-ABC) intervention to inform a future definitive randomised controlled trial. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial. A total of 72 survivors who have completed surgery and all anticancer treatments will be recruited. The intervention group will receive HEAL-ABC resources based on behaviour change theory combined with supportive telephone calls informed by motivational interviewing every 2 weeks during the 3-month intervention, and once a month for 6 months to follow-up. Participants in the control group will follow usual care and have access to resources available in the public domain. The study is testing feasibility of the intervention including adherence and ability to collect data on anthropometry, body composition, diet, physical activity, behaviour change, quality of life, blood markers, contact with healthcare services, morbidities and overall survival. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will add to the evidence base by addressing an area where there is a paucity of data. This study on lifestyle interventions for people after colorectal cancer follows the Medical Research Council guidance on evaluating complex interventions in clinical practice. It focuses on people living after treatment for colorectal cancer and targets an important research area identified by cancer survivors as a research priority reported by the National Cancer Institute and James Lind Alliance UK.

Analyzing the psychological outcomes, COVID-19 could be interpreted as a collective traumatic event that can generate symptoms related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Considering this, the purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to investigate the relationship between intrusive thoughts and fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and between intrusive thoughts and mental health; second, to test the mediating role of hyperarousal and avoidance in these two relationships. In order to reach these aims, the present study investigated these relationships and tested a mediation model in two cross-sectional studies in Italy. Altogether, 627 individuals and 495 workers completed an online survey for study 1 and study 2, respectively. Mediation analyses were performed via the SPSS macro PROCESS; the significance of total, direct, and indirect effect was tested via bootstrapping. The results showed that within the PTSD framework, hyperarousal compared with avoidance mediated the relationship between intrusion and the analyzed outcomes. In conclusion, the present study provided empirical evidence for the influence of hyperarousal on individual consequences such as fear of COVID-19 and mental health. Research, as well as theoretical and practical implications, are discussed.","Sanchez-Gomez, Martin; Giorgi, Gabriele; Finstad, Georgia Libera; Urbini, Flavio; Foti, Giulia; Mucci, Nicola; Zaffina, Salvatore; León-Perez, José M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,240,16

In jawed vertebrates they are represented by three paralogs, PA28α, PA28β, and PA28γ, which assemble as heptameric hetero (PA28αβ) or homo (PA28γ) rings on one or both extremities of the 20S proteasome cylindrical structure. While they share high sequence and structural similarities, the three isoforms significantly differ in terms of their biochemical and biological properties. In fact, PA28α and PA28β seem to have appeared more recently and to have evolved very rapidly to perform new functions that are specifically aimed at optimizing the process of MHC class I antigen presentation. In line with this, PA28αβ favors release of peptide products by proteasomes and is particularly suited to support adaptive immune responses without, however, affecting hydrolysis rates of protein substrates. On the contrary, PA28γ seems to be a slow-evolving gene that is most similar to the common ancestor of the PA28 activators family, and very likely retains its original functions. Notably, PA28γ has a prevalent nuclear localization and is involved in the regulation of several essential cellular processes including cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, chromatin structure and organization, and response to DNA damage. In striking contrast with the activity of PA28αβ, most of these diverse biological functions of PA28γ seem to depend on its ability to markedly enhance degradation rates of regulatory protein by 20S proteasome. The present review will focus on the molecular mechanisms and biochemical properties of PA28γ, which are likely to account for its various and complex biological functions and highlight the common features with the PA28αβ paralog.","Cascio, Paolo",Biomolecules,240,22

In parallel, the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of mobility and social distancing among citizens. The monitoring of such aspects appeared prominent for reactive decision-making and the effective tracking of the infection chain. In parallel to the proximity sensing among people, indeed, the concept of social distancing has captured the attention to signal processing algorithms enabling short-to-medium range distance estimation to provide behavioral models in the emergency. By exploiting the availability of smart devices, the synergy between mobile network connectivity and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), cooperative ranging approaches allow computing inter-personal distance measurements in outdoor environments through the exchange of light-weight navigation data among interconnected users. In this paper, a model for Inter-Agent Ranging (IAR) is provided and experimentally assessed to offer a naive collaborative distancing technique that leverages these features. Although the technique provides distance information, it does not imply the disclosure of the user’s locations being intrinsically prone to protect sensitive user data. A statistical error model is presented and validated through synthetic simulations and real, on-field experiments to support implementation in GNSS-equipped mobile devices. Accuracy and precision of IAR measurements are compared to other consolidated GNSS-based techniques showing comparable performance at lower complexity and computational effort.","Minetto, Alex; Nardin, Andrea; Dovis, Fabio",Sensors (Basel),240,21

Using an integrated dataset from Chile, we estimated the direct and indirect (spillover) causal effects of localized lockdowns on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Our results show that the effectiveness of localized lockdowns is strongly modulated by duration and is affected by spillover effects from neighboring geographic areas. Our projections suggest that extending localized lockdowns will slow down the epidemic but by themselves will be unable to control epidemic growth due to spillovers from neighboring areas with high interdependencies, unless those contiguous areas also implement lockdowns.","Li, Y.; Undurraga, E.

We further explored options to achieve the theoretical herd immunity with age-varying immunity scenarios. As of June 21, 2021, when a quarter of the population received at least one dose of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, the contact-adjusted immunity level was 12.5% under the social distancing level 1.

The aim of this study was to survey junior high and high school students in China to better understand the psychological consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey using structural questionnaires was conducted from April 7, 2020, to April 24, 2020. Demographic information and general information related to the pandemic were collected. Psychological consequences were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Influencing factors were assessed by the Brief Resilience Scale and Coping Style Questionnaire. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 493 junior high school students (male = 239, mean age = 13.93 years) and 532 high school students (male = 289, mean age = 17.08 years). Resilience and positive coping were protective factors for the occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in junior high and high school students (p < .05). Positive coping was a protective factor for trauma-related distress in junior high school students (p < .05). Negative coping is a risk factor for depression, anxiety, stress symptoms, and trauma-related distress in junior high and high school students (p < .05).

METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, Social Science Research Network, and Research Square databases (from December 1, 2019 to May 15, 2020) were searched to identify studies that reported the associations of CKD/AKI and disease severity/mortality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and meta-regression was performed. RESULTS: In total, 42 studies enrolling 8,932 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The quality of most included studies was moderate to high. Compared with patients without previously diagnosed CKD, those with CKD had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.64–3.24) or death (OR 5.11, 95% CI 3.36–7.77). Similarly, compared with patients without AKI, those with AKI had a significantly increased risk of progressing to a severe condition (OR 11.88, 95% CI 9.29–15.19) or death (OR 30.46, 95% CI 18.33–50.59). Compared with patients with previously diagnosed CKD, those with AKI were more likely to progress to a severe condition (pgroup < 0.001, I(2) = 98.3%) and even to death (pgroup < 0.001, I(2) = 96.5%). Age had a significant impact on the association between CKD and disease severity (p = 0.001) but had no impact on the associations between AKI and disease severity (p = 0.80), between CKD and mortality (p = 0.51), or between AKI and mortality (p = 0.86). Four important complications (cardiac injury, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and liver injury) did not significantly affect the associations between CKD/AKI and disease severity/mortality, indicating that CKD/AKI may be independent clinical prognostic indicators for patients with COVID-19.

High throughput screening assays are needed for lead discovery and optimization of small molecule SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. In this work, we have applied viral pseudotyping to establish a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 entry assay. Here, the pseudotyped particles (PP) contain SARS-CoV-2 spike in a membrane enveloping both the murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol polyprotein and luciferase reporter RNA. Upon addition of PP to HEK293-ACE2 cells, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the ACE2 receptor on the cell surface, resulting in priming by host proteases to trigger endocytosis of these particles, and membrane fusion between the particle envelope and the cell membrane. The internalized luciferase reporter gene is then expressed in cells, resulting in a luminescent readout as a surrogate for spike-mediated entry into cells. This SARS-CoV-2 PP entry assay can be executed in a biosafety level 2 containment lab for high throughput screening. From a collection of 5,158 approved drugs and drug candidates, our screening efforts identified 7 active compounds that inhibited the SARS-CoV-2-S PP entry. Of these seven, six compounds were active against live replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus in a cytopathic effect assay.

While some patient characteristics are seen as relevant for unequal treatment and others not, it is known that they all may influence treatment decisions. How biomarkers influence these decisions is not known, nor is their ethical relevance well discussed. METHODS: We distributed an email survey designed to elicit treatment preferences from Norwegian doctors working with cancer patients. In a forced-choice conjoint analysis pairs of hypothetical patients were presented, and we calculated the average marginal component effect of seven individual patient characteristics, to estimate how each of them influence doctors’ priority-setting decisions. RESULTS: A positive biomarker status increased the probability of being allocated the new drug, while older age, severe comorbidity and reduced physical function reduced the probability. Importantly, sex, education level and smoking status had no significant influence on the decision. CONCLUSION: Biomarker status is perceived as relevant for priority setting decisions, alongside more well-known patient characteristics like age, physical function and comorbidity. Based on our results, we discuss a framework that can help clarify whether biomarker status should be seen as an ethically acceptable factor for providing unequal treatment to patients with the same disease.

AIMS: To describe end‐of‐life symptoms and care needs of people dying of COVID‐19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included consecutive admitted patients who died at a Victorian tertiary referral hospital from 1 January to 30 September directly due to COVID‐19. Clinical characteristics, symptoms, and use of supportive therapies including medications and non‐pharmacological interventions in the last three days of life were extracted. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 58 patients (median age 87 years IQR 81, 90) predominantly admitted from home (n = 30), who died after a median of 11 days (IQR 6, 28) in the acute medical (n = 31) or aged care (n = 27) wards of the hospital. The median Charlson Comorbidity Score was 7 (IQR 5,8). Breathlessness (n = 42), agitation (n = 36) and pain (n = 33) were the most frequent clinician‐reported symptoms in the final three days of life, with most requiring opioids (n = 52), midazolam (n = 40), with dose escalation commonly being required. While oxygen therapy was commonly used (n = 47), few (n = 13) required an anti‐secretory agent. CONCLUSIONS: This study presents one of the first and largest Australian report of the end of life and symptom experience of people dying of COVID‐19. This information should help clinicians to anticipate palliative care needs of these patients, for example recognising that higher starting doses of opioids and sedatives may help reduce prevalence and severity of breathlessness and agitation near death.

To address urgent needs in inconvenient sites, a simple colorimetric diagnostic device equipped with a capillary tube with porous hydrogel and immunocomplex particles was developed for the rapid detection of biomarkers (16 min). In this device, probe particles attach to capture particles (dp = 40 µm) and form sandwiched immunocomplexes in the presence of target biomarkers, and a red color progressively emerges when the sandwiched immunocomplex particles are blocked by the porous hydrogel embedded inside the glass capillary. Colorimetric aggregation was recorded using a smartphone and analyzed with imaging software. The limit of detection reached 1 ng/mL and showed a maximum of 79% accuracy compared with that obtained through a conventional spectrophotometric technique. The level of a diabetic retinopathy (DR) biomarker, lipocalin-1 (LCN-1), was measured in 1 µL of a human tear sample and used in testing the practicability of the proposed device. All healthy subjects showed lower intensity levels than the other diabetic counterparts (proliferative DR or nonproliferative DR patients), implying the potential of this device in clinical applications. Overall, the diagnostic device facilitates point-of-care-testing and provides a low-cost (~1 USD), compact, and reliable tool for early diagnosis in resource-limited areas.","Guzman, John Mello Camille C.; Hsu, Sheng-Min; Chuang, Han-Sheng",Biosensors (Basel),240,26

Outpatient oncology treatment has potential to leave cancer patients unmonitored for long periods while at risk of clinical deterioration which has been exaggerated during the COVID19 pandemic. Visits to cancer clinics and hospitals risk exposing immunocompromised patients to infectious complications. Remote patient reported outcomes monitoring systems have been developed for use in cancer treatment, showing benefits in economic and survival outcomes. While advanced devices such as pulmonary artery pressure monitors and implantable loop recorders have proven benefits in cardiovascular care, similar options do not exist for oncology. Here we review the current literature around remote patient monitoring in cancer care and propose the use of reliable devices for capturing and reporting patient symptoms and physiology.","McGregor, Bradley A; Vidal, Gregory A; Shah, Sumit A; Mitchell, James D; Hendifar, Andrew E",Cureus,240,24

This strategy has been well demonstrated in the surveillance and control of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) epidemics. This study aims to leverage contact tracing data to investigate the degree of spread and the formation of transmission cascades composing of multiple clusters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An algorithm on mining relationships between clusters for network analysis is proposed with 3 steps: horizontal edge creation, vertical edge consolidation, and graph reduction. The constructed network was then analyzed with information diffusion metrics and exponential-family random graph modeling. With categorization of clusters by exposure setting, the metrics were compared among cascades to identify associations between exposure settings and their network positions within the cascade using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Experimental results illustrated that transmission cascades containing or seeded by daily activity clusters spread faster while those containing social activity clusters propagated farther. Cascades involving work or study environments consisted of more clusters, which had a higher transmission range and scale. Social activity clusters were more likely to be connected, whereas both residence and healthcare clusters did not preferentially link to clusters belonging to the same exposure setting. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed algorithm could contribute to in-depth epidemiologic investigation of infectious disease transmission to support targeted nonpharmaceutical intervention policies for COVID-19 epidemic control.","Kwan, Tsz Ho; Wong, Ngai Sze; Yeoh, Eng-Kiong; Lee, Shui Shan",J Am Med Inform Assoc,240,10

A largely unexplored strategy to reduce mRNA hydrolysis is to redesign RNAs to form double-stranded regions, which are protected from in-line cleavage and enzymatic degradation, while coding for the same proteins. The amount of stabilization that this strategy can deliver and the most effective algorithmic approach to achieve stabilization remain poorly understood. Here, we present simple calculations for estimating RNA stability against hydrolysis, and a model that links the average unpaired probability of an mRNA, or AUP, to its overall hydrolysis rate. To characterize the stabilization achievable through structure design, we compare AUP optimization by conventional mRNA design methods to results from more computationally sophisticated algorithms and crowdsourcing through the OpenVaccine challenge on the Eterna platform. We find that rational design on Eterna and the more sophisticated algorithms lead to constructs with low AUP, which we term ‘superfolder’ mRNAs. These designs exhibit a wide diversity of sequence and structure features that may be desirable for translation, biophysical size, and immunogenicity. Furthermore, their folding is robust to temperature, computer modeling method, choice of flanking untranslated regions, and changes in target protein sequence, as illustrated by rapid redesign of superfolder mRNAs for B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.1.7 variants of the prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increases in in vitro mRNA half-life by at least two-fold appear immediately achievable.","Wayment-Steele, Hannah K; Kim, Do Soon; Choe, Christian A; Nicol, John J; Wellington-Oguri, Roger; Watkins, Andrew M; Parra Sperberg, R Andres; Huang, Po-Ssu; Participants, Eterna; Das, Rhiju",Nucleic Acids Res,240,33

Methods: The minimal inhibitory concentration of a phosphate-free detergent (Palmolive) needed to achieve total bacterial kill off was determined. 3D printed polylactic acid plastic samples were coated with silicone. Plaster, fiberglass, plastic, and silicone-coated plastic samples were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus. After bacterial inoculation, scanning electron microscopy of the samples was performed to visualize bacterial adherence to the materials' surface. Using either sterile water or a 5% detergent solution, the materials were subjected to washings. Each material was run in 30 replicates: 6 without washing, 6 with sterile water for 1 minute, 6 with detergent for 1 minute, 6 with sterile water for 3 minutes, and 6 with detergent for 3 minutes. The replicates that did not undergo a washing trial represented the initial bacterial inoculation. Samples were then rinsed and sonicated in polysorbate to isolate the remaining adherent bacteria on the materials’ surface. The sonicated solutions were plated, incubated, and counted for quantification of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria. This protocol was repeated for a total of four trials. Results: During inoculation, there were significantly less bacteria that adhered to silicone-coated 3D printed plastic (58879 CFU) compared to plastic (217479 CFU), plaster (140063 CFU), and fiberglass (550546 CFU). Silicone coating showed further superiority. Silicone-coated 3D printed plastic was able to be decontaminated as demonstrated by significantly fewer remaining bacteria (9.3%) on its surface after being washed with a 5% detergent solution (1797 CFU) compared to sterile water (19321 CFU). The mean remaining bacteria on silicone-coated 3D printed plastic was significantly less than that remaining on all other materials when washed with either sterile water or a detergent solution for both durations of 1 minute and 3 minutes. Conclusions: The current study demonstrates that significantly less bacteria adhere to the surface of 3D printed plastic with silicone coating showing added protection and that this material can be decontaminated to a greater degree with washing than conventional casting materials. These results provide evidence that 3D printed casts can be washed and successfully decontaminated during a patient’s period of immobilization, which is advantageous especially during an infectious crisis such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Massaglia, Joseph E; Lebowitz, Cory; Fitzgerald, Keith; Hickok, Noreen J; Beredjiklian, Pedro; Rivlin, Michael",Cureus,240,28

Healthcare workers (HCWs) constitute a population which is significantly affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide. In Mexico, the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER) is the principal national reference of respiratory diseases. Aim: To evaluate the efficiency of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-healthcare workers (INER-HCW). Methods: Currently, the INER has 250 beds and 200 respiratory ventilators to support COVID-19 patients in critical condition. On March 1st, 2020, the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program was launched to mitigate the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among the INER-HCW. Findings: From March 1st to October 1st, 2020, 71.5% of INER-HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 77% of them were frontline workers. Among the tested INER-HCWs, 10.4% were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nonetheless, nosocomial infection represented only 3.8% of the cases and the mortality was null. Fifty-three of INER-HCWs positive to SARS-CoV-2 had a negative test 42–56 days post-diagnosis and were returned to service. Finally, although a change in the PPE implemented on May 11th, 2020, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not affected. Conclusion: INER has a lower incidence of HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the mean of the national report. The implementation of the INER-POL-TRAB-COVID19 program is efficient to decrease the risk of infection among the HCWs. Our findings suggest that the implementation of a similar program at a national level can be helpful to provide a safe environment to HCWs and to prevent the collapse of health institutions.","Salazar, Miguel Ángel; Chavez-Galan, Leslie; Castorena-Maldonado, Armando; Mateo-Alonso, Maribel; Diaz-Vazquez, Nadia Otilia; Vega-Martínez, Ana María; Martínez-Orozco, José Arturo; Becerril-Vargas, Eduardo; Sosa-Gómez, Fernando Manuel; Patiño-Gallegos, Hilda; Alonso-Martínez, Delfino; López-Segundo, Enrique; Vidal, Fernando; Velasco-González, Luis Joan; Pérez-Pulido, Silvia; Santillán-Doherty, Patricio; Regalado-Pineda, Justino; Salas-Hernández, Jorge; Buendía-Roldán, Ivette",Front Public Health,240,33

The deadly corona virus-containing aerosol enters the atmospheric air through sneezing, exhalation, or talking, assembling with the particulate matter, and subsequently transferring to the respiratory system. This recent outbreak illustrates that the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus-2 is deadlier for aged people than for other age groups. It is evident that the airway diameter reduces with age, and an accurate understanding of SARS aerosol transport through different elderly people's airways could potentially help the overall respiratory health assessment, which is currently lacking in the literature. This first-ever study investigates SARS COVID-2 aerosol transport in age-specific airway systems. A highly asymmetric age-specific airway model and fluent solver (ANSYS 19.2) are used for the investigation. The computational fluid dynamics measurement predicts higher SARS COVID-2 aerosol concentration in the airway wall for older adults than for younger people. The numerical study reports that the smaller SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol deposition rate in the right lung is higher than that in the left lung, and the opposite scenario occurs for the larger SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol rate. The numerical results show a fluctuating trend of pressure at different generations of the age-specific model. The findings of this study would improve the knowledge of SARS coronavirus-2 aerosol transportation to the upper airways which would thus ameliorate the targeted aerosol drug delivery system.","Islam, Mohammad S.; Larpruenrudee, Puchanee; Saha, Suvash C.; Pourmehran, Oveis; Paul, Akshoy Ranjan; Gemci, Tevfik; Collins, Richard; Paul, Gunther; Gu, Yuantong",Phys Fluids (1994),240,24

The potential to ventilate more than one patient with a single ventilator, a so-called split ventilator setup, provides an emergency solution. Our hypothesis is that ventilation can be individualized by adding a flow restrictor to limit tidal volumes, add PEEP, titrate FiO(2) and monitor ventilation. This way we could enhance optimization of patient safety and clinical applicability. We performed bench testing to test our hypothesis and identify limitations. We performed a bench testing in two test lungs: (1) determine lung compliance (2) determine volume, plateau pressure and PEEP, (3) illustrate individualization of airway pressures and tidal volume with a flow restrictor, (4a) illustrate that PEEP can be applied and individualized (4b) create and measure intrinsic PEEP (4c and d) determine PEEP as a function of flow restriction, (5) individualization of FiO(2). The lung compliance varied between 13 and 27 mL/cmH(2)O. Set ventilator settings could be applied and measured. Extrinsic PEEP can be applied except for settings with a large expiratory time. Volume and pressure regulation is possible between 70 and 39% flow restrictor valve closure. Flow restriction in the tested circuit had no effect on the other circuit or on intrinsic PEEP. FiO(2) could be modulated individually between 0.21 and 0.8 by gradually adjusting the additional flow, and minimal affecting FiO(2) in the other circuit. Tidal volumes, PEEP and FiO(2) can be individualized and monitored in a bench testing of a split ventilator. In vivo research is needed to further explore the clinical limitations and outcomes, making implementation possible as a last resort ventilation strategy.

Non-drug, non-surgical treatments are recommended by OA clinical guidelines, yet there have only ever been two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating such strategies in people with first MTP joint OA. Foot orthoses are a common non-drug, non-surgical strategy used by allied health professionals for people with first MTP joint OA, however, it is unknown whether these devices are effective in improving the symptoms associated with the condition. This clinical trial aimed to determine whether contoured foot orthoses lead to greater reductions in first MTP joint pain on walking compared to sham flat insoles in people with first MTP joint OA. METHODS: The FORT trial (Foot ORthoses for big Toe joint osteoarthritis) is a two-arm participant- and assessor-blinded, multi-site RCT conducted in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, Australia. We are recruiting 88 community-dwelling people with symptomatic radiographic first MTP joint OA. Following baseline assessment, participants are randomized to receive either: i) contoured foot orthoses; or ii) sham flat insoles following baseline assessment. Participants have two visits with a study podiatrist where they are provided with their allocated insoles, to be worn daily for 12 weeks at all times when wearing shoes. The primary outcome is self-reported first MTP joint pain on walking (numerical rating scale), assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include additional measures of first MTP joint and foot pain, physical function, quality of life, participant-perceived global ratings of change (pain and function), and level of physical activity. DISCUSSION: This study will provide novel evidence about whether contoured foot orthoses improve pain and other symptoms compared to sham insoles in people with first MTP joint OA. Outcomes will help to inform clinical guidelines and practice about the use of foot orthoses for managing symptoms in this under-researched group of people with OA.

Since February 4, 2020, Belgian Health authorities reported more than 90568 cases, of which 8.3% were HCWs. Data on clinical characteristics, sources of infection and humoral immune response of HCWs with COVID-19 remain scarce. AIM: Analyse the clinical characteristics, humoral immune response, sources of contamination, and outcomes among HCWs with COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective study includes 176 HCWs with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in a teaching hospital in Belgium. Between March 1(st), and May 31(th) 2020, all HCWs with symptoms suspect of COVID-19 were tested through a RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab. Serological testing was performed between 55 and 137 days after the onset of symptoms. FINDINGS: Median age was 40.8 years and 75% were female. Median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 4.39 days. Most frequent symptoms were cough and headache (75% respectively). Fever accounted for 68.7%.

Here, we identify a GII.17 cluster IIIb-specific blockade epitope by monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based epitope mapping. Four mAbs (designated as M1 to M4) were generated from mice immunized with virus-like particle (VLP) of a GII.17 cluster IIIb strain. Among them, M1 and M3 reacted specifically with the cluster IIIb VLP but not with the VLPs from clusters II or IIIa. Moreover, M1 and M3 dose-dependently blocked cluster IIIb VLP binding with its ligand, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs). Epitope mapping revealed that M1 and M3 recognized the same highly exposed epitope consisting of residues 293–296 and 299 in the capsid protein VP1. Sequence alignment showed that the M1/M3 epitope sequence is highly variable among different GII.17 clusters whereas it is identical for cluster IIIIb strains. These data define a dominant blockade epitope of GII.17 norovirus and provide evidence that blockade epitope evolution contributes to the emergence of GII.17 cluster IIIb strains.","Yi, Yufang; Wang, Xiaoli; Wang, Shuxia; Xiong, Pei; Liu, Qingwei; Zhang, Chao; Yin, Feifei; Huang, Zhong",Emerging microbes & infections,240,16

Methods The present study is an attempt to elucidate inhibition potential of andrographolide and its derivatives along with an associated binding mechanism through virtual screening and molecular docking simulation studies. Results Our findings revealed structural conformation changes in 150 loop, secondary sialic acid binding site residues of ACZ97474 {Neuraminidase (A/Blore/NIV236/2009(H1N1)}. Andrographolide have been identified as the highest binging energy of −10.88 Kcal/mol, 3 hydrogen bond interactions (Arg152, Lys150, and Gly197), total intermolecular energy of −12.07 Kcal/mol with bioactivity value (Ki) of 10.59 nmol/L, while the Food and Drug Admistraton approved drug Oseltamivir and Zanamivir have shown 2 and 4 hydrogen bond interactions with binding energies of −6.28 Kcal/mol and −7.73Kcal/mol, respectively, which is higher than andrographolide. The guanidine group of Arg152 has binding affinities to the hydrophilic nature of the inhibitors (-OH and =O groups), as identified by docking of andrographolide (CID: 5318517) on neuraminidase. Conclusions Hence, andrographolide has the potential to inhibit neuraminidase activity of H1N1 and may be used as an alternative medicinal therapy for swine flu positive patient. With potent antiviral activity and a potentially new mechanism of action, andrographolide may warrant further evaluation as a possible therapy for influenza.","Seniya, Chandrabhan; Shrivastava, Shilpi; Singh, Sanjay Kumar; Khan, Ghulam Jilani",Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Disease,240,16

The pathophysiology of the disease is complex and mostly unknown. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms that promote progression of the disease is critical to overcome this pandemic. To address such issues, recent studies have reported transcriptomic profiles of cells, tissues and fluids from COVID-19 patients that mainly demonstrated activation of humoral immunity, dysregulated type I and III interferon expression, intense innate immune responses and inflammatory signaling. Here, we provide novel perspectives on the pathophysiology of COVID-19 using robust functional approaches to analyze public transcriptome datasets. In addition, we compared the transcriptional signature of COVID-19 patients with individuals infected with SARS-CoV-1 and Influenza A (IAV) viruses. We identified a core transcriptional signature induced by the respiratory viruses in peripheral leukocytes, whereas the absence of significant type I interferon/antiviral responses characterized SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified the higher expression of genes involved in metabolic pathways including heme biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and tryptophan metabolism. A BTM-driven meta-analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from COVID-19 patients showed significant enrichment for neutrophils and chemokines, which were also significant in data from lung tissue of one deceased COVID-19 patient. Importantly, our results indicate higher expression of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation both in peripheral mononuclear leukocytes and BALF, suggesting a critical role for mitochondrial activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, these data point for immunopathological features and targets that can be therapeutically exploited to control COVID-19.","Gardinassi, Luiz G.; Souza, Camila O.

In addition, there are only limited manufacturing facilities of such clothing available worldwide, due to a lack of available knowledge about relevant technologies, ineffective supply chains, and stringent regulatory requirements. Therefore, there remains a clear unmet need for coordinating the actions and efforts from scientists, engineers, manufacturers, suppliers, and regulatory bodies to develop and produce safe and effective protective clothing using the technologies that are locally available around the world.

Since first appearance on December of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has cause extremely high levels of mortality, morbidity, global economic breakdown, and the consequent human suffering. The main diagnostic test for the confirmation of symptomatic individuals is the detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase–quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR). Additionally, serology techniques, such as ELISA are useful to measure the antibodies produced in humans after contact with the virus, as well as the direct presence of viral antigens. In this study we aim to assemble and evaluate four ELISA assays to measure the presence of IgG or IgM specific for the viral Spike protein in COVID-19 patients, using either the full recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein or the fragment corresponding to the receptor binding domain. As a control, we analyzed a group of pre-pandemic serum samples obtained before 2017. Strong reactivity was observed against both antigens. A few pre-pandemic samples displayed high OD values, suggesting the possibility of some cross reactivity. All four assays show very good repeatability, both intra- and inter-assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis allowed the definition of cutoffs and evaluation of performance for each ELISA by estimation of the area under the curve. This performance parameter was high for all tests (AUC range: 0.98–0.99). Multiple comparisons between tests revealed no significant difference between each other (P values: 0.24–0.95). Our results show that both antigens are effective to detect both specific IgG and IgM antibodies, with high sensitivity (range 0.92–0.99), specificity (range 0.93–0.97) and congruence with the RT-PCR test (Cohen´s Kappa range 0.87–0.93). These assays will allow health authorities to have a new tool to estimate seroprevalence, in order to manage and improve the severe sanitary situation caused by this virus.","de la Guardia, Carolina; Rangel, Giselle; Villarreal, Alcibiades; Goodridge, Amador; Fernández, Patricia L.; Lleonart, Ricardo",PLoS One,240,1

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically close to SARS-CoV, thus it is important to define the between antigenic cross-reactivity and neutralization. In this study, we firstly analyzed 20 convalescent serum samples collected from SARS-CoV infected individuals during the 2003 SARS outbreak. All patient sera reacted strongly with the S1 subunit and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV, cross-reacted with the S ectodomain, S1, RBD, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2, and neutralized both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-driven infections. Multiple panels of antisera from mice and rabbits immunized with a full-length S and RBD immunogens of SARS-CoV were also characterized, verifying the cross-reactive neutralization against SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, we found that a palm civet SARS-CoV-derived RBD elicited more potent cross-neutralizing responses in immunized animals than the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, informing a strategy to develop a universe vaccine against emerging CoVs. SummarySerum antibodies from SARS-CoV infected patients and immunized animals cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 suggests strategies for universe vaccines against emerging CoVs.","Zhu, Yuanmei; Yu, Danwei; Han, Yang; Yan, Hongxia; Chong, Huihui; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei; Li, Taisheng; He, Yuxian",bioRxiv,240,1

Relatively little is known about the associated morphologic and molecular changes in the circulation of these patients. In particular, platelet and erythrocyte pathology might result in severe vascular issues, and the manifestations may include thrombotic complications. These thrombotic pathologies may be both extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary and may be central to respiratory failure. Previously, we reported the presence of amyloid microclots in the circulation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigate the presence of related circulating biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin, and P-selectin. These biomarkers are well-known to interact with, and cause pathology to, platelets and erythrocytes. We also study the structure of platelets and erythrocytes using fluorescence microscopy (using the markers PAC-1 and CD62PE) and scanning electron microscopy. Thromboelastography and viscometry were also used to study coagulation parameters and plasma viscosity. We conclude that structural pathologies found in platelets and erythrocytes, together with spontaneously formed amyloid microclots, may be central to vascular changes observed during COVID-19 progression, including thrombotic microangiopathy, diffuse intravascular coagulation, and large-vessel thrombosis, as well as ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Consequently, this clinical snapshot of COVID-19 strongly suggests that it is also a true vascular disease and considering it as such should form an essential part of a clinical treatment regime.","Venter, Chantelle; Bezuidenhout, Johannes Andries; Laubscher, Gert Jacobus; Lourens, Petrus Johannes; Steenkamp, Janami; Kell, Douglas B.; Pretorius, Etheresia",Int J Mol Sci,240,2

Based upon the self-determination and social role theories, this study intends to bridge the gap empirically. The hypotheses are largely supported by 215 respondents. Unexpectedly, the research findings show that for females, locatability and personalization are more important in predicting their information disclosure intention, whereas for males, the social benefit has more of an impact on information disclosure intention, which is opposite to the hypotheses and convention.

METHODS: CORTICOVID is a single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective study involving severe/critical COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate ARDS. Lung total severity score was obtained according to Chung and colleagues. Moreover, the relative percentages of lung total severity score by ground glass opacities, consolidations, crazy paving, and linear bands were computed. Chest HRCT scores, P/F ratio, and laboratory parameters were evaluated before (pre-CS) and 7–10 days after (post-CS) methylprednisolone of 0.5–0.8 mg/kg/day. FINDINGS: A total of 34 severe/critical COVID-19 patients were included in the study, of which 17 received Standard of Care (SoC) and 17 CS therapy in add-on. CS treatment disclosed a significant decrease in HRCT total severity score [median = 6 (IQR: 5–7.5) versus 10 (IQR: 9–13) in SoC, p < 0.001], as well in single consolidations [median = 0.33 (IQR: 0–0.92) versus 6.73 (IQR: 2.49–8.03) in SoC, p < 0.001] and crazy paving scores [mean = 0.19 (SD = 0.53) versus 1.79 (SD = 2.71) in SoC, p = 0.010], along with a significant increase in linear bands [mean = 2.56 (SD = 1.65) versus 0.97 (SD = 1.30) in SoC, p = 0.006]. GGO score instead did not significantly differ at the end of treatment between the two groups. Most post-CS GGO, however, derived from previous consolidations and crazy paving [median = 1.5 (0.35–3.81) versus 2 (1.25–3.8) pre-CS; p = 0.579], while pre-CS GGO significantly decreased after methylprednisolone therapy [median = 0.66 (0.05–1.33) versus 1.5 (0.35–3.81) pre-CS; p = 0.004]. CS therapy further determined a significant improvement in P/F levels [median P/F = 310 (IQR: 235.5–370) versus 136 (IQR: 98.5–211.75) in SoC; p < 0.001], and a significant increase in white blood cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils absolute values. CONCLUSION: The improvement of all chest HRCT findings further supports the role of CS adjunctive therapy in severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia.","Calabrese, Cecilia; Pafundi, Pia Clara; Mollica, Mariano; Annunziata, Anna; Imitazione, Pasquale; Lanza, Maurizia; Polistina, Giorgio; Flora, Martina; Guarino, Salvatore; Palumbo, Cristiana; Fiorentino, Giuseppe",Ther Adv Respir Dis,240,22

Environmental surveillance traditionally provides information on location of populations with contagious, infected individuals since infectious poliovirus is excreted whether infections are asymptomatic or symptomatic. Here, we describe development of rapid (1 week turnaround time, TAT), quantitative RT-PCR of poliovirus RNA extracted directly from concentrated environmental surveillance samples to infer the number of infected individuals excreting poliovirus. The quantitation method was validated using data from vaccination with bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). The method was then applied to infer the weekly number of excreters in a large, sustained, asymptomatic outbreak of wild type 1 poliovirus in Israel (2013) in a population where >90% of the individuals received three doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Evidence-based intervention strategies were based on the short TAT for direct quantitative detection. Furthermore, a TAT shorter than the duration of poliovirus excretion allowed resampling of infected individuals. Finally, the method documented absence of infections after successful intervention of the asymptomatic outbreak. The methodologies described here can be applied to outbreaks of other excreted viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), where there are (1) significant numbers of asymptomatic infections; (2) long incubation times during which infectious virus is excreted; and (3) limited resources, facilities, and manpower that restrict the number of individuals who can be tested and re-tested.","Perepliotchikov, Yuri; Ziv-Baran, Tomer; Hindiyeh, Musa; Manor, Yossi; Sofer, Danit; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Stephens, Laura; Mendelson, Ella; Weil, Merav; Bassal, Ravit; Anis, Emilia; Singer, Shepherd Roee; Kaliner, Ehud; Cooper, Gillian; Majumdar, Manasi; Markovich, Michal; Ram, Daniela; Grotto, Itamar; Gamzu, Ronni; Martin, Javier; Shulman, Lester M.",Vaccines (Basel),240,1

The reference test for the anti-spike neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) ability to counteract the viral infection is the virus neutralization test (VNT). Great interest is developing on reliable serological assays allowing antibodies concentration and antibody protective titer correlation. The aim of our study was to detect nAbs serum levels in paucisymptomatic, symptomatic and vaccinated subjects, to find a cut-off value able to protect from virus infection. nAbs serum levels were detected by a competitive automated immunoassay, in association to VNT with the SARS-CoV-2 original and British variant strains. The median nAbs concentrations were: 281,3 BAU/ml for paucisymptomatics; 769,4 BAU/ml for symptomatics; 351,65 BAU/ml for the vaccinated cohort; 983 BAU/ml considering only the second dose vaccinated individuals. The original strain VNT analysis showed 1:80 median neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated subjects; 1:160 in symptomatic patients; 1:160 in the second dose groups. The British variant VNT analysis showed lower neutralization titers in paucisymptomatic and vaccinated groups (1:40); the same titer in symptomatic patients (1:160); the second dose group confirmed the original strain titer (1:160). In conclusion, our data showed optimal correlations with a proportional increase between neutralizing activity and antibody concentration, making nAbs detection a good alternative to virus neutralization assays, difficult to carry out in routine laboratories. Finally, ROC curve analysis established a cut-off of 408,6 BAU/ml to identify subjects with a low risk of infection.","Cristiano, Antonio; Nuccetelli, Marzia; Pieri, Massimo; Sarubbi, Serena; Pelagalli, Martina; Calugi, Graziella; Tomassetti, Flaminia; Bernardini, Sergio",Int Immunopharmacol,240,1

Current recommendations suggest mask usage solely during HCW contact with Covid-19 patients, namely plain medical mask for low-risk contacts and N95 for aerosol generating procedures. The distinction regarding the escalation of mask complexity depending on contact type is nevertheless based on plausible theoretical assumptions rather than hard evidence of a clear benefit. Conversely, we suggest that at least a plain mask should be used during all HCWs’ contacts in healthcare facilities which constitute a highly probable but often overlooked means of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among HCWs.","Tsilingiris, Dimitrios; Papatheodoridi, Margarita; Kapelios, Chris J.",Intern Emerg Med,240,15

Serological assays are both cost- and time-effective compared to cellular assays, but cellular immune responses may provide a diagnostic value to determine previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in seronegative individuals. However, potential cross-reactive T cell responses stemming from prior encounters with human coronaviruses (HCoVs) may affect assay specificity. In this study, we evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of a SARS-CoV-2 IFN-γ Release Assay (IGRA) based on the FluoroSpot method employing commercially available SARS-CoV-2-specific peptide pools, as well as an in-house designed SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool restricted to 5 amino acid stretches or less aligning with endemic HCoVs. Blood samples were obtained from healthcare workers (HCW) 5–6 months post SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) IgG and nucleocapsid (N) IgG dual seroconversion (n = 187) and HCW who had been S IgG and N IgG dual seronegative at repeated occasions, including the current sampling time point (n = 102). In addition, samples were obtained 4 to 5 months post infection from 55 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Assay specificity and sensitivity were calculated with serology as a reference standard for HCW. The in-house generated peptide pool displayed a specificity of 96.1%, while the commercially available peptide pools displayed specificities of 80.4% and 85.3%, respectively. Sensitivity was higher in a cohort of previously hospitalized COVID-19 patients (96.4% and 84.0% for the commercially available peptide pools and 92.7% for the in-house generated peptide pool) compared to the HCW cohort (92.0% and 66.8% for the commercially available peptide pools and 76.0% for the in-house generated peptide pool). Based on these findings, the individual diagnostic value of T cell immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 currently appears to be limited but remain an important research tool ahead.","Mangsbo, Sara M.; Havervall, Sebastian; Laurén, Ida; Lindsay, Robin; Jernbom Falk, August; Marking, Ulrika; Lord, Martin; Buggert, Marcus; Dönnes, Pierre; Christoffersson, Gustaf; Nilsson, Peter; Hober, Sophia; Phillipson, Mia; Klingström, Jonas; Thålin, Charlotte",PLoS One,240,20

Identifying patients with the highest potential diagnostic yield may help to avoid morbidity in patients unlikely to benefit from the procedure. We sought to determine which patient factors, specifically chest computed tomography (CT) findings, affected diagnostic yield of BAL. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of immunocompromised patients who underwent FOB with BAL from 01/01/2010 to 12/31/2011 at an academic medical center was performed. The lung lobe lavaged, characteristics of pulmonary infiltrate on radiograph, patient symptoms, and diagnostic yield were collected. A positive diagnostic yield was defined as a positive microbiological culture, finding on cytopathologic staining, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, alveolar eosinophilia or a positive immunologic or nucleic acid assay. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic yield was 52.6%. Infiltrates that were predominantly reticular or nodular by CT had a lower diagnostic yield than predominantly consolidated, ground-glass, or tree-in-bud infiltrates (36.5% vs. 61.2%, P = 0.0058). The diagnostic yield was significantly improved in patients with both fever and chest symptoms compared to patients without symptoms (61.3% vs. 29.6%, P = 0.0066). CONCLUSION: CT findings of reticular and nodular infiltrates portend a worse diagnostic yield from BAL than those that are alveolar in nature. Symptomatic patients are more likely to have diagnostic FOB with BAL than asymptomatic patients.","Brownback, Kyle R.; Simpson, Steven Q.",Ann Thorac Med,240,30

A primary stressor of SCs and their subsequent shocks derives from disruption propagation (i.e., the ripple effect) through related networks. In this paper, we conceptualize current state and future research directions on the ripple effect for pandemic context. We scrutinize the existing OR (Operational Research) studies published in international journals dealing with disruption propagation and structural dynamics in SCs. Our study pursues two major contributions in relation to two research questions. First, we collate state-of-the-art research on disruption propagation in SCs and identify a methodical taxonomy along with theories displaying their value and applications for coping with the impacts of pandemics on SCs. Second, we reveal and systemize managerial insights from theory used for operating (adapting) amid a pandemic and during times of recovery, along with becoming more resistant to future pandemics. Streamlining the literature allowed us to reveal several new research tensions and novel categorizations and classifications. The outcomes of our study show that methodical contributions and the resulting managerial insights can be categorized into three levels, i.e., network, process, and control. Our analysis reveals that adaptation capabilities play the most crucial role in managing the SCs under pandemic disruptions. Our findings depict how the existing OR methods can help coping with the ripple effect at five pandemic stages (i.e., Anticipation; Early Detection; Containment; Control and Mitigation; and Elimination) following the WHO classification. The outcomes and findings of our study can be used by industry and researchers alike to progress the decision-support systems guiding SCs amid the COVID-19 pandemic and toward recovery.

The critical drivers and specific strategies for improving implementation and sustainment are largely unknown. Rigorous pragmatic research is needed to understand CoCM implementation processes and outcomes. METHODS: This study is a hybrid Type 2 randomized roll-out effectiveness-implementation trial of CoCM in 11 primary care practices affiliated with an academic medical center. The Collaborative Behavioral Health Program (CBHP) was developed as a means of improving access to effective mental health services for depression. Implementation strategies are provided to all practices. Using a sequential mixed methods approach, we will assess key stakeholders’ perspectives on barriers and facilitators of implementation and sustainability of CBHP. The speed and quantity of implementation activities completed over a 30-month period for each practice will be assessed. Economic analyses will be conducted to determine the budget impact and cost offset of CBHP in the healthcare system. We hypothesize that CBHP will be effective in reducing depressive symptoms and spillover effects on chronic health conditions. We will also examine differential outcomes among racial/ethnic minority patients. DISCUSSION: This study will elucidate critical drivers of successful CoCM implementation. It will be among the first to conduct economic analyses on a fee-for-service model utilizing billing codes for CoCM.

This study examined the relationship between social media use at work and well-being at work for millennials and members of former generations in Finland. The research data contained focus group interviews (N = 52), an expert organization survey (N = 563), and a nationally representative survey (N = 1817). Well-being measures included technostress, burnout, psychological distress, and a set of background variables. Content analysis and linear regression models were used as analysis methods. The results showed that millennials have various intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for social media use at work. Intrinsic motivations included employees’ personal choice and their pure interest to follow the market and discussions in their own field. Extrinsic motivations were related mainly to organizations’ work culture and personal branding. The survey findings revealed, however, that millennials were not only more active social media users for work, but they also experienced higher technostress and burnout than members of former generations. Social media use motivations were associated with both higher and lower technostress and burnout depending on motivation, indicating that social media use can have both positive and negative effects. Overall, our findings suggest that employees tend to utilize social media more if their needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness are fulfilled.","Oksa, Reetta; Saari, Tiina; Kaakinen, Markus; Oksanen, Atte",Int J Environ Res Public Health,240,12

Accurate laboratory detection of the virus is critical in order to contain the spread. Although real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the cornerstone of laboratory diagnosis, there have been conflicting reports on the diagnostic accuracy of this method. Methods: A retrospective review was performed on all hospitalized patients tested for SARS CoV 2 (at St. Pauls Hospital in Vancouver, BC) from March 13 to April 12, 2020. Diagnostic accuracy of initial PCR on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs was determined against a composite reference standard which included a clinical assessment of the likelihood of COVID 19 by medical experts, initial and repeat PCR, and post-hoc serological testing. Results: A total of 323 patients were included in the study, 33 (10.2%) tested positive and 290 (89.8%) tested negative by initial PCR. Patients testing positive were more likely to exhibit features of cough (66.7% vs 39.3%), shortness of breath (63.6% vs 35.9%), fever (72.7% vs 27.6%), radiographic findings (83.3% vs 39.6%) and severe outcomes including ICU admission (24.2% vs 9.7%) and mortality (21.2% vs 6.2%) compared to patients testing negative. Serology was performed on 90 patients and correlation between serology and PCR was 98.9%. There were 90 patients included in the composite reference standard. Compared to the composite reference standard, initial PCR had sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI 74.0 to 99.9%), specificity of 100% (95% CI 94.9 to 100%), positive predictive value of 100% (95% CI 81.5 to 100%) and a negative predictive value of 98.6% (95% CI 92.5 to 100%).

This study aimed to provide evidence for the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention designed to improve diet and physical activity in families with FH. DESIGN: A parallel, randomised, waitlist-controlled, feasibility pilot trial. SETTING: Three outpatient lipid clinics in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Families that comprised children (aged 10–18 years) and their parent with genetically diagnosed FH. INTERVENTION: Families were randomised to either 12-week usual care or intervention. The behavioural change intervention aimed to improve dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviours. It was delivered to families by dietitians initially via a single face-to-face session and then by four telephone or email follow-up sessions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility was assessed via measures related to recruitment, retention and intervention fidelity. Postintervention qualitative interviews were conducted to explore intervention acceptability. Behavioural (dietary intake, physical activity and sedentary time) and clinical (blood pressure, body composition and blood lipids) outcomes were collected at baseline and endpoint assessments to evaluate the intervention’s potential benefit. RESULTS: Twenty-one families (38% of those approached) were recruited which comprised 22 children and 17 adults with FH, and 97% of families completed the study. The intervention was implemented with high fidelity and the qualitative data revealed it was well accepted. Between-group differences at the endpoint assessment were indicative of the intervention’s potential for improving diet in children and adults. Evidence for potential benefits on physical activity and sedentary behaviours was less apparent. However, the intervention was associated with improvements in several CVD risk factors including LDL-C, with a within-group mean decrease of 8% (children) and 10% (adults).

We characterized the transcriptional changes in CD16+ monocytes from PBMC of people with COVID-19, and from healthy individuals using publicly available single cell RNA sequencing data. CD16+ monocytes from people with COVID-19 compared to those from healthy individuals expressed transcriptional changes indicative of increased cell activation, and induction of a migratory phenotype. We also analyzed COVID-19 cases based on severity of the disease and found that mild cases were characterized by upregulation of interferon response and MHC class II related genes, whereas the severe cases had dysregulated expression of mitochondrial and antigen presentation genes, and upregulated inflammatory, cell movement, and apoptotic gene signatures. These results suggest that CD16+ monocytes in people with COVID-19 contribute to a dysregulated host response characterized by decreased antigen presentation, and an elevated inflammatory response with increased monocytic infiltration into tissues.

However, the role of children in the COVID-19 pandemic is still uncertain. This systematic review of early studies synthesises evidence on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the severity and clinical outcomes in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 by children in the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed. Reviewers extracted data from relevant, peer-reviewed studies published up to July 4th 2020 during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak using a standardised form and assessed quality using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. For studies included in the meta-analysis, we used a random effects model to calculate pooled estimates of the proportion of children considered asymptomatic or in a severe or critical state. We identified 2775 potential studies of which 128 studies met our inclusion criteria; data were extracted from 99, which were then quality assessed. Finally, 29 studies were considered for the meta-analysis that included information of symptoms and/or severity, these were further assessed based on patient recruitment. Our pooled estimate of the proportion of test positive children who were asymptomatic was 21.1% (95% CI: 14.0–28.1%), based on 13 included studies, and the proportion of children with severe or critical symptoms was 3.8% (95% CI: 1.5–6.0%), based on 14 included studies. We did not identify any studies designed to assess transmissibility in children and found that susceptibility to infection in children was highly variable across studies. Children’s susceptibility to infection and onward transmissibility relative to adults is still unclear and varied widely between studies. However, it is evident that most children experience clinically mild disease or remain asymptomatically infected. More comprehensive contact-tracing studies combined with serosurveys are needed to quantify children’s transmissibility relative to adults. With children back in schools, testing regimes and study protocols that will allow us to better understand the role of children in this pandemic are critical.","Gaythorpe, Katy A.

At present twOfficentral public health control strategies have emerged: mitigation and suppression (e.g, [5]). Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by reducing interactions (and both raise questions of sustainability and long-term tactics). Complementary to those approaches, here we develop and analyze an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests [6, 7] to identify and deploy recovered individuals as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, i.e., to develop what we term ‘shield immunity’ at the population scale. Recovered individuals, in the present context, represent those who have developed protective, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are no longer shedding virus [8]. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services (including but not limited to tending to the elderly [9], hospital care, schools, and food supply) while decreasing the probability of transmission during such essential interactions. We show that a shield immunity approach may significantly reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of an outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing.

Although its mechanism of action remains unclear, this drug appears to potentiate the innate response. Acute phase proteins are one of the key components of innate immunity and studies describing their use as a monitoring tool for the immune system in animals undergoing interferon‐ω therapy are lacking. This study aimed to determine whether interferon‐ω therapy influences acute phase protein concentrations namely serum amyloid‐A, α‐1‐glycoprotein and C‐reactive protein. METHODS: A single‐arm study was performed using 16 cats, living in an animal shelter, naturally infected with retroviruses and subjected to the interferon‐ω therapy licensed protocol. Samples were collected before (D0), during (D10 and D30) and after therapy (D65). Serum amyloid‐A and C‐reactive protein were measured by specific enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay kits and α‐1‐glycoprotein by single radial immunodiffusion. RESULTS: All the acute phase proteins significantly increased in cats undergoing interferon‐ω therapy (D0/D65: P<0·05) CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Acute phase proteins appear to be reasonable predictors of innate‐immune stimulation and may be useful in the individual monitoring of naturally retroviral infected cats undergoing interferon‐ω therapy.","Leal, R.

Analysis of confirmed COVID-19 patients' hospital length of stay in Sichuan can be informative to decision-making in other regions of the world. Design A retrospective cross-sectional study. Data and Method Data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Sichuan Province were obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Reporting System (NNDRS) and field survey. We collected information on demographic, epidemiological, clinical characteristics, and the length of hospital stay for confirmed patients. We conducted an exploratory analysis using adjusted multivariate cox-proportional models. Participants A total of 538 confirmed patients of COVID-19 infection in Sichuan Province from January to March 2020. Outcome measure The length of hospital stay after admissions for confirmed patients. Results From January 16, 2020 to March 4, 2020, 538 human cases of COVID-19 infection were laboratory-confirmed, and were hospitalized for treatment. Among these, 271 (50%) were 45 years of age or above, 285 (53%) were male, 450 (84%) were considered as having mild symptoms. The median hospital length of stay was 19 days (interquartile range (IQR): 14-23, Range: 3-41). Adjusted multivariate analysis showed that longer hospital length of stay was associated with factors aged 45 and over (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60-0.91), those admitted to provincial hospital (HR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.54-0.99), and those with serious illness (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.90); living in areas with more than 5.5 healthcare workers per 1000 population (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.05-1.65) was associated with shorter hospital length of stay.

Given reiterated treatments of immunogenic biopharmaceuticals should lead to antibody responses precluding repeated administration, the development of flagellin not inducing specific antibodies would greatly expand the chances of clinical applications. Here we computationally identified immunogenic regions in Vibrio vulnificus flagellin B and deimmunized by simply removing a B cell epitope region. The recombinant deimmunized FlaB (dFlaB) maintains stable TLR5-stimulating activity. Multiple immunization of dFlaB does not induce FlaB-specific B cell responses in mice. Intranasally co-administered dFlaB with influenza vaccine enhanced strong Ag-specific immune responses in both systemic and mucosal compartments devoid of FlaB-specific Ab production. Notably, dFlaB showed better protective immune responses against lethal viral challenge compared with wild type FlaB. The deimmunizing B cell epitope deletion did not compromise stability and adjuvanticity, while suppressing unwanted antibody responses that may negatively affected vaccine antigen-directed immune responses in repeated vaccinations. We explain the underlying mechanism of deimmunization by employing molecular dynamics analysis.","Khim, Koemchhoy; Bang, Yong Jun; Puth, Sao; Choi, Yoonjoo; Lee, Youn Suhk; Jeong, Kwangjoon; Lee, Shee Eun; Rhee, Joon Haeng",NPJ Vaccines,240,16

To this end, we propose and evaluate a novel mobile sonouroflowmetry (SUF) method that estimates the urinary flow rate from a sound signal recorded using a mobile phone. By linearly mapping the total sound energy to the total voided volume, the sound energy curve is transformed to a flow rate curve allowing the estimation of the flow rate over time. An evaluation using data from 44 healthy young men showed high similarity between the UF and SUF flow rates with a mixed-effects model correlation coefficient of 0.993 and a mean root mean square error of 2.37 ml/s. Maximum flow rates were estimated with an average absolute error of 2.41 ml/s. Future work on mobile uroflowmetry can use these results as an initial benchmark for flow rate estimation accuracy.","El Helou, Elie; Naba, Joy; Youssef, Karim; Mjaess, Georges; Sleilaty, Ghassan; Helou, Samar",Sci Rep,240,26

However, there is an upper bound on daily testing volume because of limited healthcare staff and working hours, as well as different testing methods, such as random testing and contact-tracking testing. In this study, a network-based epidemic transmission model combined with a testing mechanism was proposed to study the role of testing in epidemic control. The aim of this study was to determine how testing affects the spread of epidemics and the daily testing volume needed to control infectious diseases. METHODS: We simulated the epidemic spread process on complex networks and introduced testing preferences to describe different testing strategies. Different networks were generated to represent social contact between individuals. An extended susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was adopted to simulate the spread of epidemics in these networks. The model establishes a testing preference of between 0 and 1; the larger the testing preference, the higher the testing priority for people in close contact with confirmed cases. RESULTS: The numerical simulations revealed that the higher the priority for testing individuals in close contact with confirmed cases, the smaller the infection scale. In addition, the infection peak decreased with an increase in daily testing volume and increased as the testing start time was delayed. We also discovered that when testing and other measures were adopted, the daily testing volume required to keep the infection scale below 5% was reduced by more than 40% even if other measures only reduced individuals’ infection probability by 10%. The proposed model was validated using COVID-19 testing data. CONCLUSIONS: Although testing could effectively inhibit the spread of infectious diseases and epidemics, our results indicated that it requires a huge daily testing volume. Thus, it is highly recommended that testing be adopted in combination with measures such as wearing masks and social distancing to better manage infectious diseases. Our research contributes to understanding the role of testing in epidemic control and provides useful suggestions for the government and individuals in responding to epidemics.","Cui, Yapeng; Ni, Shunjiang; Shen, Shifei",BMC Infect Dis,240,18

However, it remains unclear whether and how SARS-CoV-2 crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was occasionally detected in the vascular wall and perivascular space, as well as in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in the infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Moreover, the permeability of the infected vessel was increased. Furthermore, disintegrity of BBB was discovered in the infected hamsters by administration of Evans blue. Interestingly, the expression of claudin5, ZO-1, occludin and the ultrastructure of tight junctions (TJs) showed unchanged, whereas, the basement membrane was disrupted in the infected animals. Using an in vitro BBB model that comprises primary BMECs with astrocytes, SARS-CoV-2 was found to infect and cross through the BMECs. Consistent with in vivo experiments, the expression of MMP9 was increased and collagen IV was decreased while the markers for TJs were not altered in the SARS-CoV-2-infected BMECs. Besides, inflammatory responses including vasculitis, glial activation, and upregulated inflammatory factors occurred after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, Embase and the WBE Consortium Registry according to PRISMA guidelines for relevant articles published until 31st July 2021. Relevant data were extracted and summarized. Quality of each paper was assessed using an assessment tool adapted from Bilotta et al.'s tool for environmental science. Of 763 studies identified, 92 studies distributed across 34 countries were shortlisted for qualitative synthesis. A total of 26,197 samples were collected between January 2020 and May 2021 from various locations serving population ranging from 321 to 11,400,000 inhabitants. Overall sample positivity was moderate at 29.2% in all examined settings with the spike (S) gene having maximum rate of positive detections and nucleocapsid (N) gene being the most targeted. Wastewater signals preceded confirmed cases by up to 63 days, with 13 studies reporting sample positivity before the first cases were detected in the community. At least 50 studies reported an association of viral load with community cases. While wastewater surveillance cannot replace large-scale diagnostic testing, it can complement clinical surveillance by providing early signs of potential transmission for more active public health responses. However, more studies using standardized and validated methods are required along with risk analysis and modelling to understand the dynamics of viral outbreaks.","Shah, Shimoni; Gwee, Sylvia Xiao Wei; Ng, Jamie Qiao Xin; Lau, Nicholas; Koh, Jiayun; Pang, Junxiong",Sci Total Environ,240,6

This impression may be incorrect, because not all cats experimentally exposed to FIPV develop FIP. There is also a belief that the incidence of FIP may be affected by a number of host, virus, and environmental cofactors. However, the contribution of these cofactors to immunity and disease incidence has not been determined. The present study followed 111 random-bred specific pathogen free (SPF) cats that were obtained from a single research breeding colony and experimentally infected with FIPV. The cats were from several studies conducted over the past 5 years, and as a result, some of them had prior exposure to feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) or avirulent FIPVs. The cats were housed under optimized conditions of nutrition, husbandry, and quarantine to eliminate most of the cofactors implicated in FIPV infection outcome and were uniformly challenge exposed to the same field strain of serotype 1 FIPV. Forty of the 111 (36%) cats survived their initial challenge exposure to a Type I cat-passaged field strains of FIPV. Six of these 40 survivors succumbed to FIP to a second or third challenge exposure, suggesting that immunity was not always sustained. Exposure to non-FIP-inducing feline coronaviruses prior to challenge with virulent FIPV did not significantly affect FIP incidence but did accelerate the disease course in some cats. There were no significant differences in FIP incidence between males and females, but resistance increased significantly between 6 months and 1 or more years of age. Genetic testing was done on 107 of the 111 infected cats. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) segregated the 107 cats into three distinct families based primarily on a common sire(s), and resistant and susceptible cats were equally distributed within each family. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on 73 cats that died of FIP after one or more exposures (cases) and 34 cats that survived (controls) demonstrated four significant associations after 100k permutations. When these same cats were analyzed using a sib-pair transmission test, three of the four associations were confirmed although not with genome-wide significance. GWAS was then done on three different age groups of cases to take into account age-related resistance, and different associations were observed. The only common and strong association identified between the various GWAS case configurations was for the 34.7–45.8 Mb region of chromosome A3. No obvious candidate genes were present in this region.","Pedersen, Niels C.; Liu, Hongwei; Gandolfi, Barbara; Lyons, Leslie A.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,240,0

Thus, this paper aims to investigate anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and burnout in a sample of MHPs. We conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional study on 167 participants: 56 MHPs, 57 physicians working closely with COVID-19 patients, and 54 physicians not working closely with such patients. MHPs reported good overall mental health. Most MHPs reported no post-traumatic stress, and their scores were significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients. MHPs’ hyperarousal scores were also significantly lower compared to HPs working closely with COVID-19 patients, while their intrusion scores were statistically significantly lower than those of all other professionals. Multivariable logistic regressions showed that MHPs had lower odds of exhibiting state anxiety and low personal accomplishment compared to HPs not working closely with COVID-19 patients. In sum, MHPs seem to show almost preserved mental health.

We aimed to examine adaptive immune cells in non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 shedding. 37 non-severe patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence that were transferred to Zhongnan hospital of Wuhan University were retrospectively recruited to the PP (persistently positive) group, which was further allocated to PPP group (n = 19) and PPN group (n = 18), according to their testing results after 7 days (N = negative). Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Data from age- and sex-matched non-severe patients at disease onset (PA [positive on admission] patients, n = 37), and lymphocyte subpopulation measurements from matched 54 healthy subjects were extracted for comparison (HC). Compared with PA patients, PP patients had much improved laboratory findings. The absolute numbers of CD3(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and NK cells were significantly higher in PP group than that in PA group, and were comparable to that in healthy controls. PPP subgroup had markedly reduced B cells and T cells compared to PPN group and healthy subjects. Finally, paired results of these lymphocyte subpopulations from 10 PPN patients demonstrated that the number of T cells and B cells significantly increased when the SARS-CoV-2 tests turned negative. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 presence in non-severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced numbers of adaptive immune cells. Monitoring lymphocyte subpopulations could be clinically meaningful in identifying fully recovered COVID-19 patients.","Liu, Bing; Han, Junyan; Cheng, Xiaohuan; Yu, Long; Zhang, Li; Wang, Wei; Ni, Lan; Wei, Chaojie; Huang, Yafei; Cheng, Zhenshun",Sci Rep,240,30

Besides a reactivation of retired healthcare workers, medical students were considered to support this task. We herein analysed the commitment of medical students during the COVID-19-pandemic as well as their burdens and anxieties. Methods: Via an online survey, medical students in Germany were asked regarding these themes. The survey period took place during a two-week period in April and Mai 2020. 1241 questionnairs were included in the analysis. Results: 67.9% [65.3; 70.5] of the participants reported that they volunteered during the pandemic. Simultaneously, 88.9% [86.9; 90.5] of the participants stated to be against a compulsory recruitment in this context. Students who volunteered showed a significantly lower anxiety index than students, who did not volunteer. Concerns about transferring the virus to patients or relatives were significantly higher than concerns about the students own infection. Conclusion: The results of this survey study suggest that the majority of students are working voluntary during the pandemic. They declared mostly that they had adequate opportunities to protect themselves.

This study was conducted to clarify the patient’s characteristics whose disease progressed to severe status. Methods The medical records of all consecutive 300 Japanese patients hospitalized at our institution between February and November 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics were evaluated to compare between mild (no oxygen needed), moderate (oxygen needs of 1-4 L/min), and severe diseases (oxygen needs of 5 L/min or more). Results The median age was 68 years old, with 123 (41.0%) males and 177 (59.0%) females. Of these, 199 patients (66.3%), 55 patients (18.3%), 46 patients (15.3%) patients were in the mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease groups, respectively. Patients with severe disease were more likely to be older, have more comorbidities, and tended to have higher body mass index. In laboratory data, lymphocyte count, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), LDH, and AST on admission were significantly associated with the severity. In multivariate analysis, age and CRP were the independent risk factors for severe disease (OR = 1.050, 1.130, respectively). The optimal cut-off value for age was 74 years old and that for CRP was 3.15 mg/dL. Conclusions Age and CRP were independently associated with disease severity of COVID-19 in multivariate analysis. Additionally, the numbers of underlying disease, lymphocyte count, and inflammatory markers such as LDH and D-dimer may also be related to disease severity.","Otoshi, Ryota; Hagiwara, Eri; Kitayama, Takaaki; Yamaya, Takafumi; Higa, Katsuyuki; Murohashi, Kota; Sato, Yozo; Tabata, Erina; Shintani, Ryota; Okabayashi, Hiroko; Ikeda, Satoshi; Niwa, Takashi; Nakazawa, Atsuhito; Oda, Tsuneyuki; Okuda, Ryo; Sekine, Akiamasa; Kitamura, Hideya; Baba, Tomohisa; Komatsu, Shigeru; Ogura, Takashi",J Infect Chemother,240,1

The respiratory microbiome comprises all airway and lung tissue-associated microbes. These micro-organisms occur throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with different populations and distinct burdens at specific sites and can be classified as pathogenic or commensal. AREAS COVERED: The majority of studies investigating the respiratory microbiome have focused on bacteria; however, emerging evidence has revealed the composition of the lung virome, the global viral communities present in the lung tissue. In this review, we searched PubMed and used keywords such as airway microbiome. We restricted outputs to English language and did not limit by any dates. We summarize the up-to-date knowledge on how the microbiome interacts with the host immune system and influences the pathogenesis of pulmonary viral infections. EXPERT OPINION: The relationship between colonizing microbes and the host is complex and various factors need to be considered in order to appreciate its pathophysiological consequences. Understanding these intricate mechanisms of interaction among the respiratory microbiome, viruses and the immune response may lead to the development of better therapies to treat or prevent respiratory viral infections.","Porto, Bárbara N; Moraes, Theo J",Expert Rev Respir Med,240,6

Viruses have evolved various strategies to block autophagy and even subvert it for their replication and release. Here, we demonstrated that ORF3a of the COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy activity by blocking fusion of autophagosomes/amphisomes with lysosomes. The late endosome-localized ORF3a directly interacts with and sequestrates the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) component VPS39, thereby preventing HOPS complex from interacting with the autophagosomal SNARE protein STX17. This blocks assembly of the STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8 SNARE complex, which mediates autophagosome/amphisome fusion with lysosomes. Expression of ORF3a also damages lysosomes and impairs their function. SARS-CoV-2 virus infection blocks autophagy, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes/amphisomes, and causes late endosomal sequestration of VPS39. Surprisingly, ORF3a from the SARS virus SARS-CoV fails to interact with HOPS or block autophagy. Our study reveals a mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 evades lysosomal destruction and provides insights for developing new strategies to treat COVID-19.","Miao, Guangyan; Zhao, Hongyu; Li, Yan; Ji, Mingming; Chen, Yong; Shi, Yi; Bi, Yuhai; Wang, Peihui; Zhang, Hong",Dev Cell,240,18

However, recent administrative changes have hollowed out their flexibility to serve communities. We use administrative data on past budgetary allocations per capita to public health departments at upper tier local areas (UTLAs) of England to examine whether public health funding levels were correlated with more rapid control of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic between March and July of 2020. The dependent variable was the number of days between a UTLA's 10th case of COVID-19 and the day when new cases per 100,000 peaked and began to decline. Our models controlled for regional socio-economic factors. We found no correlation between local public health expenditure and the speed of control of COVID-19. However, overall public expenditure allocated to improve local areas helped reduce time to reach peak. Contrary to expectation, more dense areas such as London experienced shorter duration. Higher income areas had more rapid success in accelerating the time of the first peak in the first wave of their local COVID-19 incidence.

Occupancy modeling uses repeated sampling to estimate probability of false negative results, like those linked to rapid tests, for generating unbiased prevalence estimates. METHODS: We developed a simulation study to estimate SARS-CoV-2 prevalence using rapid, low-sensitivity, low-cost tests and slower, high-sensitivity, higher cost tests across a range of disease prevalence and sampling strategies. RESULTS: Occupancy modeling overcame the low sensitivity of rapid tests to generate prevalence estimates comparable to more accurate, slower tests. Moreover, minimal repeated sampling was required to offset low test sensitivity at low disease prevalence (0.1%), when rapid testing is most critical for informing disease management. CONCLUSIONS: Occupancy modeling enables the use of rapid tests to provide accurate, affordable, real-time estimates of the prevalence of emerging infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to determine the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in northern and western Uganda. METHODS For our prospective epidemiological study, we established acute rheumatic fever clinics at two regional hospitals in the north (Lira district) and west (Mbarara district) of Uganda and instituted a comprehensive acute rheumatic fever health messaging campaign. Communities and health-care workers were encouraged to refer children aged 3-17 years, with suspected acute rheumatic fever, for a definitive diagnosis using the Jones Criteria. Children were referred if they presented with any of the following: (1) history of fever within the past 48 h in combination with any joint complaint, (2) suspicion of acute rheumatic carditis, or (3) suspicion of chorea. We excluded children with a confirmed alternative diagnosis. We estimated incidence rates among children aged 5-14 years and characterised clinical features of definite and possible acute rheumatic fever cases. FINDINGS Data were collected between Jan 17, 2018, and Dec 30, 2018, in Lira district and between June 5, 2019, and Feb 28, 2020, in Mbarara district. Of 1075 children referred for evaluation, 410 (38%) met the inclusion criteria; of these, 90 (22%) had definite acute rheumatic fever, 82 (20·0%) had possible acute rheumatic fever, and 24 (6%) had rheumatic heart disease without evidence of acute rheumatic fever. Additionally, 108 (26%) children had confirmed alternative diagnoses and 106 (26%) had an unknown alternative diagnosis. We estimated the incidence of definite acute rheumatic fever among children aged 5-14 years as 25 cases (95% CI 13·7-30·3) per 100 000 person-years in Lira district (north) and 13 cases (7·1-21·0) per 100 000 person-years in Mbarara district (west). INTERPRETATION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to estimate the incidence of acute rheumatic fever in sub-Saharan Africa. Given the known rheumatic heart disease burden, it is likely that only a proportion of children with acute rheumatic fever were diagnosed. These data dispel the long-held hypothesis that the condition does not exist in sub-Saharan Africa and compel investment in improving prevention, recognition, and diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever.

Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes.

We evaluated the performance of the PowerChek MERS (upE & ORF1a) real-time PCR Kit (PowerChek MERS assay; Kogene Biotech, Korea) a one-step rRT-PCR assay for the qualitative detection of MERS-CoV. METHODS: We evaluated PowerChek MERS assay performance in comparison with nested RT-PCR and sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes. To evaluate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, 100 clinical specimens (50 positive and 50 negative for MERS-CoV) were simultaneously tested by using the PowerChek MERS and sequencing assays. Assay performance, including limit of detection and precision, was evaluated in vitro by using MERS-CoV RNA transcripts. Analytical specificity was evaluated with a diverse collection of 16 respiratory virus–positive clinical specimens and 14 respiratory bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The 95% limits of detection of the PowerChek MERS assay for the upE and the open rading frame (ORF)1a were 16.2 copies/µL and 8.2 copies/µL, respectively. No cross-reactivity was observed. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the PowerChek MERS assay were both 100% (95% confidence interval, 91.1–100%).

This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I† = 1/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.","Khatri, B.

We investigated how the initial COVID-19 public lockdown, impacted the risk of being hospitalised with a major cardiovascular event (MCE: myocardial infarction/stroke/heart failure) according to educational level. METHODS: We grouped all Danish residents according to educational attainment level (low, medium, high) and age (40–59, 60–69, ≥70 years). In each group, we calculated the age-standardised and sex standardised risk of MCE hospitalisation in the initial COVID-19 lockdown-period (13 March 2020–3 May 2020) and in the corresponding calendar period in 2019. We calculated age-standardised and sex-standardised risks to investigate whether the COVID-19 lockdown had a differential effect on MCE incidence according to educational level. RESULTS: In the period in 2019, 2700 Danish residents were hospitalised with MCE, compared with only 2290 during the lockdown. During lockdown, the risk of hospitalisation for MCE decreased among residents aged ≥70 with low education (risk difference (RD) −46.2 (−73.2; −19.2) per 100,000) or medium education (RD −23.2 (−50.8; 4.3) per 100 000), but not among residents with high education (RD 5.1 (−32.3; 42.5), per 100 000). The risk of hospitalisation for MCE did not decrease significantly for the younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 lockdown is associated with a reduced incidence for MCE, especially among low educated, elderly residents. This raises concern for undertreatment that without clinical awareness and action may widen the educational gap in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","Andersen, Julie; Strandberg-Larsen, Katrine; Gerds, Thomas; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Blanche, Paul; Andersson, Charlotte; Køber, Lars; Fosbøl, Emil; Phelps, Matthew; Kragholm, Kristian; Andersen, Mikkel Porsborg; Østergaard, Lauge; Butt, Jawad; Schou, Morten",J Epidemiol Community Health,240,33

Many patients with COVID-19 suffer from persistent symptoms, many of which may potentially be reversed by high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Yet, the safety and tolerability of HIIT after COVID-19 is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the fidelity, tolerability and safety of three different HIIT protocols in individuals that had recently been hospitalised due to COVID-19. Methods. The study was a randomised cross-over trial. We compared three supervised HIIT protocols (4×4, 6×1, 10-20-30) in 10 individuals recently discharged after hospitalisation for severe COVID-19. Each HIIT protocol had a duration of 38 min and was performed with a 1-week washout between them. Outcomes included adverse events, exercise training intensity and tolerability assessed by the Likert scale (1–10). Results. All 10 participants aged 61 (mean, SD 8) years (5 males) completed all three HIIT protocols with no adverse events. High intensities were achieved in all three protocols, although they differed in terms of time spent with a heart rate ≥85% of maximum (mean (SD); 4×4: 13.7 (6.4) min; 10-20-30: 12.1 (3.8) min; 6×1: 6.1 (5.6) min; p=0.03). The three protocols were all well tolerated with similar Likert scale scores (mean (SD); 4×4: 8 (2), 10-20-30: 8 (2), 6×1: 9 (2), p=0.72). Conclusion.

The intention is to share catalytic, synergistic, and interdisciplinary field lessons from the author’s firsthand experiences for the benefit of renaissance communities, researchers, and practitioners seeking new beginnings and stimulation of new thinking beyond their sightlines. Lessons are presented in ten areas [1] integrating legal, ethical, and natural considerations; [2] recognizing diverse types of land ownership; [3] discovering shared ethics and values; [4] modernizing planning practice; [5] using Participatory Action Research (PAR); [6] working with limited access to science, technology, and planning resources; [7] using science to inform and enlighten the planning process; [8] riding the coattails of popular movements; [9] recognizing human relationships with natural environments; and [10] educating and informing citizens as a force for nature. These ten lessons, contextualized within Critical Theory and Participatory Action Research (PAR), lead the author to an “inflective” PAR paradigm for land use planning that links planning, participation, and science.

In this review we describe similarities, both in structural terms and sequence determinants of their TM and juxtamembrane regions. The TM domains are essential not only for anchoring the proteins in membranes but also have functional roles. Both TM segments contain GxxxG motifs that drive TM associations within the lipid bilayer. They also each possess similar sequence motifs, positioned at the membrane interface preceding their TM domains. These domains are known as cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif in gp41 and CRAC-like motif in APP. Moreover, in the cytoplasmic domain of both proteins other α-helical membranotropic regions with functional implications have been identified. Recent drug developments targeting both diseases are reviewed and the potential use of TM interaction modulators as therapeutic targets is discussed.","Abad, Concepción; Martínez-Gil, Luis; Tamborero, Silvia; Mingarro, Ismael",Biochim Biophys Acta Biomembr,240,5

While China has been able to rapidly eliminate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, Germany – as well as most of Europe and the Americas – is struggling with high numbers of cases and deaths. Objective: We analyse COVID-19 epidemiology and control strategies in China and in Germany, two countries which have chosen profoundly different approaches to deal with the epidemic. Methods: In this narrative review, we searched the literature from 1 December 2019, to 4 December 2020. Results: China and several neighbours (e.g. Australia, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand) have achieved COVID-19 elimination or sustained low case numbers. This can be attributed to: (1) experience with previous coronavirus outbreaks; (2) classification of SARS-CoV-2 in the highest risk category and consequent early employment of aggressive control measures; (3) mandatory isolation of cases and contacts in institutions; (4) broad employment of modern contact tracking technology; (5) travel restrictions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 re-importation; (6) cohesive communities with varying levels of social control. Conclusions: Early implementation of intense and sustained control measures is key to achieving a near normal social and economic life.","Lu, Guangyu; Razum, Oliver; Jahn, Albrecht; Zhang, Yuying; Sutton, Brett; Sridhar, Devi; Ariyoshi, Koya; von Seidlein, Lorenz; Müller, Olaf",Global health action,240,21

Most interventions focus on an individual, but dietary and physical activity behaviors occur with, or are influenced by, domestic partners. According to interdependence theory, couples who approach behavior change as a problem to be tackled together versus independently are more likely to utilize communal coping processes to promote behavior change. We utilized interdependence theory to develop a partner-assisted intervention to increase long-term weight loss. Methods Community-dwelling individuals (index participants) cohabitating with a partner with 1) overweight and at least one obesity-related comorbidity or 2) obesity are randomized to participate in a standard weight management program alone or with their partner. The weight management program involves biweekly, in-person, group sessions focusing on weight loss for six months, followed by three group sessions and nine telephone calls focusing on weight loss maintenance for twelve months. In the partner-assisted arm, partners participate in half of the group sessions and telephone calls. Couples receive training in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for couples, including sharing thoughts and feelings and joint problem solving, to increase communal coping. The primary outcome is participant weight loss at 24 months, with caloric intake and moderate-intensity physical activity as secondary outcomes. Partner weight and caloric intake will also be analyzed. Mediation analyses will examine the role of interdependence variables and social support. Discussion This trial will provide knowledge about effective ways to promote long-term weight loss and the role of interdependence constructs in weight loss.

We address this question in a model of the dynamics of policy effectiveness drawing upon the results of a large panel survey implemented in Germany during the first and second waves of the pandemic. We observe increased opposition to vaccinations were they to be legally required. In contrast, for voluntary vaccinations, there was higher and undiminished support. We find that public distrust undermines vaccine acceptance, and is associated with a belief that the vaccine is ineffective and, if enforced, compromises individual freedom. We model how the willingness to be vaccinated may vary over time in response to the fraction of the population already vaccinated and whether vaccination has occurred voluntarily or not. A negative effect of enforcement on vaccine acceptance (of the magnitude observed in our panel or even considerably smaller) could result in a large increase in the numbers that would have to be vaccinated unwillingly in order to reach a herd-immunity target. Costly errors may be avoided if policy makers understand that citizens’ preferences are not fixed but will be affected both by the crowding-out effect of enforcement and by conformism. Our findings have broad policy applicability beyond COVID-19 to cases in which voluntary citizen compliance is essential because state capacities are limited and because effectiveness may depend on the ways that the policies themselves alter citizens’ beliefs and preferences.","Schmelz, Katrin; Bowles, Samuel",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,240,20

A study of the effects of these interventions in terms of adoption can help shape public health decisions. Also, the efficacy of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions can be affected by public behaviours in events such as election rallies, festivals, and protest events, as captured from social media. Social media analytics can offer crucial public health insights. Here, we examined mask use and mask fit in the United States, especially during the first large-scale public gathering post-pandemic, the Black Lives Matter (BLM). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the utilization and fit of face masks and social distancing in the USA from social media and events of large physical gatherings through publicly available social media images from six cities and the BLM protests. METHODS: 2.04 million publicly available social media images were collected and analyzed from the six cities between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We used correlation tests to examine the relationships between the online mask usage trends and the COVID-19 cases. We looked for significant changes in mask-wearing patterns and group posting before and after important policy decisions. For BLM protests, we analyze 195,452 posts from New York and Minneapolis from May 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020. We looked at differences in adopting the preventive measures in the BLM protests through the mask-fit score. RESULTS: The average percentage of group pictures dropped from 8.05% to 4.65% post the lockdown week. New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis observed an increase of 5%, 7.4%, 7.4%, 6.5%, 5.6%, and 7.1% in mask wearing online, respectively, between February 2020 and May 2020. Boston and Minneapolis observed a significant increase of 3% and 7.4% mask-wearing after the mask mandates. A difference of 6.2% and 8.3% were found in the group pictures between BLM posts and Non-BLM posts for New York City and Minneapolis. In contrast, the difference between BLM and NON-BLM posts in the percentage of masked faces in group pictures was 29% and 20.1% for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. Of the masked faces in protests, 35% wore the mask with a fit score greater than 80%. CONCLUSIONS: The study finds a significant drop in the group posting when the stay-at-home laws were applied and a significant increase in mask wearing for two of the three cities when the mask mandates were applied. Although a general positive trend towards mask-wearing and social distancing is observed, a high percentage of posts did not adhere to the guidelines. BLM-related posts were found to capture the lack of seriousness to safety measures through a high percentage of group pictures and low mask fit scores. Thus, the methodology used provides a directional indication of how government policies can be indirectly monitored through social media.","Singh, Asmit Kumar; Mehan, Paras; Sharma, Divyanshu; Pandey, Rohan; Sethi, Tavpritesh; Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam",JMIR public health and surveillance,240,1

Adolescents and young children spend a lot of time using MD, Internet, and social networks. The age of initial use is getting lower to 12 years old. The aim of this research is to study children’s use and perception of MD. The Italian Paediatric Society (SIP) conducted a Survey on Italian children in collaboration with Skuola.net using an online questionnaire. A total of 10,000 questionnaires were completed. Children admitted they spend more than 3 h (41%), more than 2 h (29%), more than 1 h (21%) and less than 1 h (9%) daily. Problematic MD use has been found with children using MD before sleeping (38%), during school (24%), and at wake up in the morning (21%). Addiction was documented in 14% of adolescents. Among the reported consequences, low academic outcomes, and reduced concentration (24%), neck and back pain (12%), insomnia (10%), and mood disturbances (7%) were referred. Adolescents may have a low perception of the risks related to excessive MD. The duration of time spent using media devices is a main risk factor. In this context, parents should strongly discourage excessive MD use, mainly during school, at bedtime, and wake-up. Additionally, parents should be informed and start conversations with their children on the potential negative effects of prolonged MD use.","Spina, Giulia; Bozzola, Elena; Ferrara, Pietro; Zamperini, Nicola; Marino, Francesco; Caruso, Cinthia; Antilici, Livia; Villani, Alberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,240,24

Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators’ levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.","Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Oliveira, Wógenes N.; Rodrigues, Victor M.; Albuquerque, Nathan A.; Alencar, Éverton N.; Egito, Eryvaldo S.T.",Biomed Pharmacother,240,15

The surveys aimed to collect coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related information in Ecuador and Sri Lanka using mobile phones. In Ecuador, a Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) survey was conducted. In Sri Lanka, an evaluation of a novel medicine delivery system was conducted. Using the established mobile network operator channels and technical assistance provided through The Bloomberg Philanthropies Data for Health Initiative (D4H), Ministries of Health fielded a population-based COVID-19-specific MPS using Surveda, the open source data collection tool developed as part of the initiative. A total of 1,185 adults in Ecuador completed the MPS in 14 days. A total of 5,001 adults over the age of 35 in Sri Lanka completed the MPS in 44 days. Both samples were adjusted to the 2019 United Nations Population Estimates to produce population-based estimates by age and sex.

Vitamin D has recently been linked to many metabolic diseases and schizophrenia. Vitamin D plays essential roles in the brain in the context of neuroplasticity, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, neuroprotection, and neurotransmission. Vitamin D receptors are demonstrated in most brain regions that are related to schizophrenia. However, very few studies in the literature examine the effects of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) on schizophrenia symptoms. METHODS: This study aimed to examine the effects of vitamin D replacement on positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. Serum 25OHD levels of 52 schizophrenia patients were measured. SANS and SAPS were used to evaluate the severity of schizophrenia symptoms, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test: CV4 was used for cognitive assessment. The study was completed with 40 patients for various reasons. The patients whose serum 25OHD reached optimal levels after vitamin D replacement were reevaluated with the same scales in terms of symptom severity. The SPSS 25 package program was used for statistical analysis. The Independent-Samples t-test was used to examine the relationship between the variables that may affect vitamin D levels and the vitamin D level and to examine whether vitamin D levels had an initial effect on the scale scores. RESULTS: The mean plasma 25OHD levels of the patients was 17.87 ± 5.54. A statistically significant relationship was found only between the duration of sunlight exposure and 25 OHD level (p < 0.05). The mean SANS and SAPS scores of the participants after 25OHD replacement (23.60 ± 15.51 and 7.78 ± 8.84, respectively) were statistically significantly lower than mean SANS and SAPS scores before replacement (51.45 ± 17.96 and 18.58 ± 15.59, respectively) (p < 0.001 for all). Only the total attention score was significantly improved after replacement (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The data obtained from our study suggest that eliminating the 25OHD deficiency together with antipsychotic treatment can improve the total attention span and positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. The 25OHD levels should be regularly measured, replacement should be started when necessary, and the patients should be encouraged to get sunlight exposure to keep optimal 25OHD levels.","Neriman, Aras; Hakan, Yilmaz; Ozge, Ucuncu",BMC Psychiatry,240,17

We find that the majority of people support most public health measures introduced, but that they also see significant side effects of these policies, and that they consider many of these side effects as unacceptable in a cost–benefit analysis. We also find that people judged the threat of COVID-19 via the magnitude of the policy response, and that they do not use their perception of the personal threat to themselves or close others to guide their support for policy. Polling data only offer one simple perspective and do not illustrate the ambivalence many people feel around lockdown policies. There is also a meaningful risk of public opinion and government policy forming a symbiotic relationship, which impacts upon how effectively such policies are implemented both now, and in relation to future threats.","Foad, Colin M.

METHODS: We included all FAERS reports from the US and Canada from November 7, 2019 to July 15, 2020 and divided the study period into three equal time intervals (pre‐pandemic, first pandemic, second pandemic). We focused on methotrexate, a broadly used drug unrelated to COVID‐19, and (hydroxy)chloroquine, another broadly used drug implicated in COVID‐19 treatment. Using descriptive statistics, we compared reporting characteristics before and after the COVID‐19 outbreak. RESULTS: During the study period, 366 998 cases (60% female, median age: 59 years) were submitted to FAERS. The daily median number of reports (1796 in the pre‐pandemic, 1810 in the second pandemic time interval) and other characteristics remained stable. The daily median number of reports for methotrexate decreased from 28 in the pre‐pandemic to 15 in the second pandemic time interval, with no considerable differences in other characteristics. The daily median number of reports for (hydroxy)chloroquine increased slightly from 1 in the pre‐pandemic to 3 in the second pandemic time interval, while there were also changes in the demographics of cases and an increase in the proportion of cases reported by health professionals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall reporting to FAERS did not change after the outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic.

High-spatial-resolution, age-specific risk mapping of this indicator can provide valuable information for health resource allocation. The age-prevalence relationships may be different among areas of the study region, but previous geostatistical models usually ignored the spatial-age interaction. METHODS: We took Guangdong province, the province with the largest population and economy in China, as a study case. We collected two-week illness data and other potential influencing predictors from the fifth National Health Services Survey in 2013 and other open-access databases. Bayesian geostatistical binary regression models were developed with spatial-age structured random effect, based on which, high-resolution, age-specific two-week illness prevalence rates, as well as number of people reporting two-week illness, were estimated. The equality of health resource distribution was further evaluated based on the two-week illness mapping results and the health supply data. RESULTS: The map across all age groups revealed that the highest risk was concentrated in the central (i.e., Pearl River Delta) and northern regions of the province. These areas had a two-week illness prevalence > 25.0%, compared with 10.0–20.0% in other areas. Age-specific maps revealed significant differences in prevalence between age groups, and the age-prevalence relationships also differed across locations. In most areas, the prevalence rates decrease from age 0 to age 20, and then increase gradually. Overall, the estimated age- and population-adjusted prevalence was 16.5% [95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 14.5–18.6%], and the estimated total number of people reporting illness within the two-week period was 17.5 million (95% BCI: 15.5–19.8 million) in Guangdong Province. The Lorenz curve and the Gini coefficient (resulted in 0.3526) showed a moderate level of inequality in health resource distribution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a Bayesian geostatistical modeling framework with spatial-age structured effect to produce age-specific, high-resolution maps of the two-week illness prevalence rate and the numbers of people reporting two-week illness in Guangdong province.

Here we investigate the immune events from the acute state up to four weeks post SARS-CoV-2 infection, in non-human primates (NHP) with heterogeneous pulmonary pathology. We show a robust migration of CD16 expressing monocytes to the lungs occurring during the acute phase, and we describe two subsets of interstitial macrophages (HLA-DR(+)CD206(−)): a transitional CD11c(+)CD16(+) cell population directly associated with IL-6 levels in plasma, and a long-lasting CD11b(+)CD16(+) cell population. Trafficking of monocytes is mediated by TARC (CCL17) and associates with viral load measured in bronchial brushes. We also describe associations between disease outcomes and high levels of cell infiltration in lungs including CD11b(+)CD16(hi) macrophages and CD11b(+) neutrophils. Accumulation of macrophages is long-lasting and detectable even in animals with mild or no signs of disease. Interestingly, animals with anti-inflammatory responses including high IL-10:IL-6 and kynurenine to tryptophan ratios show less severe illness. Our results unravel cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 and suggest that NHP may be appropriate models to test immune therapies.","Fahlberg, M. D.; Blair, R. V.; Doyle-Meyers, L. A.; Midkiff, C.

A total of 850 adolescents from three Chinese secondary schools participated in the survey during the pandemic outbreak, and the data were analyzed by hierarchical linear regression. The results show that COVID-19-related stressors were a vulnerability factor in predicting adjustment. Adolescents' adjustment could be attributed to both individual-level (e.g., coping) and class-level (e.g., a class-level indicator of coping) characteristics. Specifically, problem-based coping and online learning satisfaction can promote adolescents' adjustment directly or serve as a buffer against the negative impact of stressors on adjustment, while emotion-based coping is a vulnerability factor in predicting adjustment directly or as a risk factor in strengthening the relation between stressors and adjustment. Compared with male adolescents and adolescents with high socio-economic status, female and impoverished adolescents reported poorer adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings enrich our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' adjustment and are helpful in improving adolescents' adjustment during the pandemic.","Li, Xiaoshan; Tang, Xiujuan; Wu, Hou; Sun, Pengyong; Wang, Min; Li, Li",Front Psychiatry,240,26

In this analysis, we look at the mutational landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, a structure that is antigenic and allows for viral binding to the host. We analyze 104193 GISAID sequences acquired on October 15th, 2020 with a majority of sequences (96%) containing point mutations. We report high frequency mutations with improved binding affinity to ACE2 including S477N, N439K, V367F, and N501Y and address the potential impact of RBD mutations on antibody binding. The high frequency S477N mutation is present in 6.7% of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences, co-occurs with D614G, and is currently present in 14 countries. To address RBD-antibody interactions we take a subset of human derived antibodies and define their interacting residues using PDBsum. Our analysis shows that adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 enlists broad coverage of the RBD suggesting that antibody mediated immunity should be sufficient to resolve infection in the presence of RBD point mutations that conserve structure.","Mejdani, Marios; Haddadi, Kiana; Pham, Chester; Mahadevan, Radhakrishnan",bioRxiv,240,11

One possible way to prevent mental health problems is to build-up coping resources that promote resilience to the effects of disaster work. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a resilience building workshop, the Disaster Worker Resiliency Training Program (DWRT), in disaster workers previously exposed to Hurricane Sandy. METHODS: Disaster workers (N = 167) were randomly assigned to the DWRT workshop (n = 78) or a waitlist (n = 89). Workers completed self-report measures on healthy lifestyle behaviors, perceived stress, depression, and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms at baseline and 3-month follow-up. They also completed a measure assessing subsequent trauma-exposure between the baseline and 3-month post-intervention. RESULTS: Participants in the workshop condition, as compared to those in a waitlist control, reported significantly greater improvements from pre-intervention (T1) to 3-month follow-up (T2) in healthy lifestyle behaviors (η(2) = .03; p = .03), stress management (η(2) = .03, p = .04), and spiritual growth (η(2) = .03, p = .02). Among participants reporting subsequent trauma exposures between T1 and T2 (n = 101), participants in the waitlist condition, were more likely to report significant increases in perceived stress (η(2) = .07, p < .01), PTSD (η(2) = .05, p = .03), and depression (η(2) = .07, p < .01) symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the resilience workshop promoted engagement in positive health behaviors and reduced the incidence of mental health symptoms, especially when administered prior to a repeat trauma exposure.

For many aspects of global health there is a dearth of research, yet evidence is urgently needed to address major challenges. Obtaining such data within a meaningful timeframe requires a fundamental change in the planning and setting up of research studies. Typically, protocols are developed in closed groups and often never shared. However, many operational processes in research are generic, irrespective of the disease or design. Thus, removal of duplication and sharing methods could speed up research. This research methodology project investigates whether researchers can be persuaded to share methods and if this will streamline research. Methods The theory of communities of practice (in which distinct specialists working on a problem collaborate to solve it) guided this project. The Global Health Network was created to enable communities of practice to form to develop protocols, exchange research instruments, and share skills. We measured uptake, effect, and benefit of the Network through surveys, questionnaires, interviews with target audiences (research teams in low-income and middle-income countries), and analysis of digital access. Findings Since 2011, more than 60 000 researchers, nurses, technicians, and scientists from almost all low-income and middle-income countries have used the project to share research methods, knowledge, and processes. 21 specialised communities of practice have formed collaborations that are actively exchanging methods. More than 250 research guidance notes have been shared that provide specific guidance for various research methods—eg, an international respiratory disease network has released three open-access novel coronavirus protocols and groups working in maternal health are listing the samples they have stored with the invitation for others to collaborate. These qualitative and quantitative data show that these exchanges are highly beneficial for guiding and improving research operations, and that there is a willingness to share. Interpretation Scientists compete for funding and publication and therefore sharing methods and knowledge can be perceived as disadvantageous. However, if use of protocols and methods developed by wide and open consensus can help to quickly gain high quality data, then better progress could be made for all and disease research could be changed to improve health.

Aim of our study is to evaluate the incidence and predictors of sustained tachyarrhythmias in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19, and their potential association with disease severity and in‐hospital mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter observation study including consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 admitted to emergency department of ten Italian Hospitals from February 15(th) to March 15(th) 2020. The prevalence and the type of incident sustained arrhythmias have been collected. The correlation between the most prevalent arrhythmias and both baseline characteristics and the development of ARDS and in‐hospital mortality has been evaluated. RESULTS: 414 hospitalized patients with COVID‐19 (66.9 ± 15.0 years, 61.1% male) were included in the present study. During a median follow‐up of 28 days (IQR: 12‐ 45), the most frequent incident sustained arrhythmia was AF (N: 71; 17.1%), of which 50 (12.1%) were new‐onset and 21 (5.1%) were recurrent, followed by VT (N: 14, 3.4%) and supraventricular arrhythmias (N: 5, 1.2%). Incident AF, both new‐onset and recurrent, did not affect the risk of severe adverse events including ARDS and death during hospitalization; in contrast incident VT significantly increased the risk of in‐hospital mortality (RR: 2.55; P:0.003). CONCLUSIONS: AF is the more frequent incident tachyarrhythmia; however, it not seems associated to ARDS development and death. On the other hand, incident VT is a not frequent but independent predictor of in‐hospital mortality among hospitalized COVID‐19 patients.","Russo, Vincenzo; Di Maio, Marco; Mottola, Filiberto; Pagnano, Gianpiero; Attena, Emilio; Verde, Nicoletta; Di Micco, Pierpaolo; Silverio, Angelo; Scudiero, Fernando; Nunziata, Luigi; Fele, Nunzia; D’Andrea, Antonello; Parodi, Guido; Albani, Stefano; Scacciatella, Paolo; Nigro, Gerardo; Severino, Sergio",Eur J Clin Invest,240,32

The basic reproduction number is defined and local stability analysis is carried out at each equilibrium point in terms of the reproduction number R 0 . The model is fitted mathematically and makes the data India specific. Additionally, we examined sensitivity analysis of the model. These outcomes recommend how to control the spread of corona, keeping in mind contact and recovery rate.

DESIGN: A single-center prospective observational study was carried out. SETTING: ICU of a tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive adults with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTION: Renal replacement therapy. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Demographic data, medical history, illness severity, type of oxygen therapy, laboratory data and use of renal replacement therapy to generate a logistic regression model describing independent risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Of the total of 166 patients, 51% were mechanically ventilated and 26% required renal replacement therapy. The overall hospital mortality rate was 36%, versus 56% for those requiring renal replacement therapy, and 68% for those with both mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. The logistic regression model identified four independent risk factors for mortality: age (adjusted OR 2.8 [95% CI 1.8–4.4] for every 10-year increase), mechanical ventilation (4.2 [1.7–10.6]), need for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (2.3 [1.3–4.0]) and C-reactive protein (1.1 [1.0–1.2] for every 10 mg/L increase). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy was associated to a high mortality rate similar to that associated to the need for mechanical ventilation, while multiorgan failure necessitating both techniques implied an extremely high mortality risk.","Burke, E.; Haber, E.; Pike, C.W.; Sonti, R.",Med Intensiva (Engl Ed),240,27

The survey consisted of an ad hoc questionnaire comprising clinical and sociodemographic information and the Spanish versions of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES). RESULTS: The final sample included 21,207 individuals [mean age (SD) = 39.7 (14.0); females: 14,768 (69.6%)].

However, the clinical phenotype and its pathogenesis remain unclear. We here present data on complaints and results of a diagnostic workup of patients presenting to the post-COVID clinic at the University Medical Center Freiburg. METHODS Retrospective data analysis of persistently symptomatic patients presenting to our clinic at least 6 months after onset of acute COVID-19. All patients were assessed by a doctor and routine laboratory analysis was carried out. Quality of life was assessed using SF-36 questionnaire. In case of specific persisting symptoms, further organ-specific diagnostic evaluation was performed, and patients were referred to respective departments/specialists. FINDINGS 132 Patients (58 male, 74 female; mean age 53.8 years) presented to our clinic at least 6 months after COVID-19. 79 (60 %) had been treated as outpatients and 53 (40 %) as inpatients. Most common complaints were persistent fatigue (82 %) and dyspnea on exertion (61 %). Further common complaints were impairments of concentration (54 %), insomnia (43 %), and impairments of smell or taste (35 %). Quality of life was reduced in all sections of the SF-36 questionnaire, yielding a reduced working capacity. Significant pathological findings in laboratory, echocardiographic and radiological work-up were rare. Impairments in lung function tests were more common in previously hospitalized patients. CONCLUSION Patients presenting 6 months after onset of acute COVID-19 suffer from a diverse spectrum of symptoms with impaired quality of life, also referred to as Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Further research is needed to determine the frequency of these post-COVID syndromes and their pathogenesis, natural course and treatment options.

Qualitative interviews explored smokers’ challenges with smoking cessation, barriers to accessing and using smoking cessation services, and experience using social media and text messaging. The quantitative survey assessed smoking and quitting behaviors, and social media and text messaging use patterns. RESULTS: Qualitative data revealed that participants faced various barriers to accessing cessation services, including the lack of awareness about services, skepticism about treatment effects, reliance on willpower for cessation, and time constraints. WeChat was mainly used to maintain social networking and acquire information. Participants rarely used text messaging or other social media platforms. Quantitative data showed that 55% of participants had no plan to quit smoking. Among those who reported past-year quit attempts (45%), 55% used cessation assistance. WeChat was the most frequently used platform with 94% users. CONCLUSIONS: WeChat has potential to serve as an easily accessible platform for delivering smoking cessation treatment among Chinese immigrant populations. Research is warranted to explore the feasibility and efficacy of employing WeChat in smoking cessation treatment.","Jiang, Nan; Zhang, Yidan; Qian, Xiaokun; Thorpe, Lorna; Trinh-Shevrin, Chau; Shelley, Donna",Tob Prev Cessat,240,1

As a result, caregivers of children newly diagnosed with severe and life-threatening food allergic reactions experience clinically significant symptoms of psychological distress, including fatigue, anxiety, depressed mood, social isolation, and substantially reduced quality of life. Despite this recognition, there is a lack of caregiver-centered self-management interventions to address these concerns. OBJECTIVE: In this protocol, we propose to develop and conduct feasibility testing of a technology-enhanced, self-management, mobile health, smartphone app intervention called Food Allergy Symptom Self-Management with Technology for Caregivers (FASST) designed to meet the psychosocial health needs of caregivers of children with a new diagnosis of food allergy. METHODS: This pilot study uses qualitative work (Phase I) to inform a 4-week longitudinal randomized controlled trial (Phase II). In Phase I, 10 caregivers of children (≤18 years old) with established food allergy (≥1 year from diagnosis) will participate in semistructured interviews to inform the development of the FASST app. In Phase II, 30 caregivers of children (≤18 years old) with a newly diagnosed food allergy (≤90 days from diagnosis) will be randomized 2:1 to receive the FASST intervention (n=20) or control condition (basic app with educational resources; n=10). Process measures include feasibility, caregiver acceptability, adherence, and satisfaction. Outcome measures include caregiver fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep, self-efficacy, and quality of life measured at baseline, week 4, and 3 months post study completion. RESULTS: Phase I study activities have been completed, and Phase II participant enrollment into the randomized controlled trial is expected to commence in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: With limited readily available resources at their disposal, the results from this study have the potential to provide caregivers of children with a newly diagnosed food allergy a tool to help them self-manage and mitigate negative psychosocial factors during a critical time period in the caregiving/condition trajectory.

This study aimed to determine impact of LOS on short-term outcomes and associated factors of LOS in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). METHODS: A total of 3615 patients with STEMI after PPCI in the China Acute Myocardial Infarction registry were included in the analysis. Predictors of prolonged LOS were analyzed by multivariate logistic regression model with generalized estimating equation. The impact of LOS on 30-day clinical outcomes was assessed. RESULTS: The median LOS was 9 (7, 12) days. Patients with a longer LOS (>7 days) were older, more often in lower-level hospitals, had more periprocedural complications and hospitalization expense. Fourteen variables, such as weekend admission and lower-level hospitals, were identified as independent associated factors of prolonged LOS. There were no significant difference in 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), readmission, and functional status between patients with LOS≤7d and LOS>7d after multivariate adjustment and propensity score matching. However, patients who discharged over one week had better medication adherence (adjusted odds ratio: 0.817, 95% confidence interval: 0.687–0.971, P=0.022). Significant interaction was observed in medication use between gender and LOS (P(interaction)=0.038). CONCLUSION: Patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI experienced a relatively long LOS in China, which resulted in more medical expenses but no improvement on 30-day MACCE, readmission, and functional recovery. Poor 30-day medication adherence with short LOS reflects unsatisfying transition of management from hospital to community. More efforts are needed to reduce LOS safely and improve the efficiency of medical care.","Lv, Junxing; Zhao, Qinghao; Yang, Jingang; Gao, Xiaojin; Zhang, Xuan; Ye, Yunqing; Dong, Qiuting; Fu, Rui; Sun, Hui; Yan, Xinxin; Li, Wei; Yang, Yuejin; Xu, Haiyan",Int J Gen Med,240,20

Standard epidemic risk estimates involve assuming that infections occur according to a branching process and correspond to the probability that the outbreak persists beyond the initial stochastic phase. However, an alternative assessment is to predict whether or not initial cases will lead to a severe epidemic in which available control resources are exceeded. We show how this risk can be estimated by considering three practically relevant potential definitions of a severe epidemic; namely, an outbreak in which: (i) a large number of hosts are infected simultaneously; (ii) a large total number of infections occur; and (iii) the pathogen remains in the population for a long period. We show that the probability of a severe epidemic under these definitions often coincides with the standard branching process estimate for the major epidemic probability. However, these practically relevant risk assessments can also be different from the major epidemic probability, as well as from each other. This holds in different epidemiological systems, highlighting that careful consideration of how to classify a severe epidemic is vital for accurate epidemic risk quantification.","Thompson, R.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, difficult decisions are being made about the allocation of scarce resources. Respect for autonomy cannot justify rationing decisions. Justice can be invoked to justify rationing. However, this leaves an uncomfortable tension between the principles. Dignity is not a useless concept because it is able to account for why we respect autonomy and for why it can be legitimate to override autonomy in times of critical care resource shortages. Dignity affirms the worth of the human individual as a meaning-making embodied subject, who is always in relationship to others, the world, time, and transcendence, and who realizes their dignity through their moral behaviour. Such an understanding means people should be helped to make morally right decisions about their own treatment, which may include forgoing potentially beneficial treatment for the good of others. Respect for dignity does not require fulfilling the morally wrong choices of one who insists on treatment at the expense of others. Dignity also protects the discretion of clinicians to make decisions appropriate to their competence by prohibiting the application of broad-based criteria such as age.","Kirchhoffer, David G.",J Bioeth Inq,240,23

DSD commonly occurs in older hospitalized patients and is associated with worse outcomes, including higher rates of mortality and institutionalization, compared to inpatients with delirium or dementia alone. This narrative review summarizes the screening, diagnosis, management, and pathophysiology of DSD and concludes by highlighting opportunities for future research. Studies were identified via Medline and PsycINFO keyword search, and handsearching reference lists. Conceptually, DSD could be considered an “acute exacerbation” of dementia precipitated by a noxious insult akin to an acute exacerbation of heart failure or acute on chronic renal failure. However, unlike other organ systems, there are no established biomarkers for delirium, so DSD is diagnosed and monitored clinically. Because cognitive dysfunction is common to both delirium and dementia, the diagnosis of DSD can be challenging. Inattention, altered levels of arousal, and motor dysfunction may help distinguish DSD from dementia alone. An informant history suggestive of an acute change in cognition or alertness should be investigated and managed as delirium until proven otherwise. The key management principles include prevention, identifying and treating the underlying precipitant(s), implementing multicomponent interventions to create an ideal environment for brain recovery, preventing complications, managing distress, and monitoring for resolution. Informing and involving family members or caregivers throughout the patient journey are essential because there is significant prognostic uncertainty, including the risk of persistent cognitive and functional decline following DSD and relapse. Furthermore, informal carers can provide significant assistance in management. Emerging evidence demonstrates that increased exposure to delirium is associated with neuronal injury and worse cognitive outcomes although the mechanisms through which this occurs remain unclear. Given the clinical overlap between delirium and dementia, studying shared pathophysiological pathways may uncover diagnostic tests and is an essential step in therapeutic innovation.","Nitchingham, Anita; Caplan, Gideon A",Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat,240,29

For these causes, the contribution of years lived with disability (YLD) - put simply, ill-health - is what drives DALYs, not mortality. Being able to monitor trends in YLD closely is particularly relevant for countries that sit high on the socio-demographic spectrum of development, as it contributes more than half of all DALYs. There is a paucity of data on how the population-level occurrence of disease is distributed according to severity, and as such, the majority of global and national efforts in monitoring YLD lack the ability to differentiate changes in severity across time and location. This raises uncertainties in interpreting these findings without triangulation with other relevant data sources. Our commentary aims to bring this issue to the forefront for users of burden of disease estimates, as its impact is often easily overlooked as part of the fundamental process of generating DALY estimates. Moreover, the wider health harms of the COVID-19 pandemic have underlined the likelihood of latent and delayed demand in accessing vital health and care services that will ultimately lead to exacerbated disease severity and health outcomes.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 and severity of COVID-19 infection were identified from the reimbursement data using diagnosis codes and based on whether respiratory support was used, respectively. Odds ratios were estimated using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for age, sex, region, healthcare utilization, and insurance status. Results: The COVID-19 group (5,172 of 65,149) was younger and showed higher proportion of females. 5.6% (293 of 5,172) of COVID-19 cases were severe. The severe COVID-19 group had older patients and a higher male ratio than the non-severe group.

Design Retrospective single-center observational study. Setting and participants: N = 81 patients with COVID-19 confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), at the Geriatrics department of a general hospital in Belgium. Measure ments: Frailty was graded according to the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Demographic, biochemical and radiological variables, co-morbidities, symptoms and treatment were extracted from electronic medical records. Results Participants (N = 48 women, 59%) had a median age of 85 years (range 65 – 97 years), median CFS score of 7 (range 2 – 9), and 42 (52%) were long-term care residents. Within six weeks, eighteen patients died. Mortality was significantly but weakly associated with age (Spearman r = 0.241, P = 0.03) and CFS score (r = 0.282, P = 0.011), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r = 0.301, P = 0.009), lymphocyte count (r = -0.262, P = 0.02) and RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct, r = -0.285, P = 0.015). Mortality was not associated with long-term care residence, dementia, delirium or polypharmacy. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, CFS, LDH and RT-PCR Ct (but not age) remained independently associated with mortality. Both age and frailty had poor specificity to predict survival. A multivariable model combining age, CFS, LDH and viral load significantly predicted survival.

Aim of the study is to determine neuroprotective effects of the musk of muskrat on focal cerebral ischemia. The protective effects against focal cerebral ischemia were evaluated using a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (90-minute occlusion followed by 24-hour reperfusion). Musk of muskrat was collected from scent bag of muskrat and orally administered at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg twice at times of 0 and 90 min after occlusion. The effects on sensorimotor dysfunction were investigated by using balance beam test and rotarod test after brain ischemia.

The bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS). The review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020155779). A number of 7613 studies after duplicate removing were extracted by two independent researchers, followed by screening and assessment for eligibility, conducted by two independent researchers in two steps (based on title and abstract). Afterwards, the full texts were obtained and after reviewing, a number of 24 studies were included. The synthetic description of the results was prepared, structured around exposure (vitamin D supplementation/status) and outcome (components of mental health). The included studies were conducted either in groups of healthy individuals, or individuals with mental health problems, and they assessed following issues: behavior problems, violence behaviors, anxiety, depressive symptoms/depression, aggressive disorder, psychotic features, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, suicidal incident, as well as general patterns, as follows: mental health, level of distress, quality of life, well-being, mood, sleep patterns. The vast majority of assessed studies, including the most prominent ones (based on the NOS score) supported potential positive influence of vitamin D on mental health in children. As a limitation of the analysis, it should be indicated that studies conducted so far presented various studied groups, outcomes and psychological measures, so more studies are necessary to facilitate comparisons and deepen the observations. Nevertheless, vitamin D intake within a properly balanced diet or as a supplementation, except for a safe sun exposure, should be indicated as an element supporting mental health in children, so it should be recommended to meet the required 25(OH)cholecalciferol blood level in order to prevent or alleviate mental health problems.","Głąbska, Dominika; Kołota, Aleksandra; Lachowicz, Katarzyna; Skolmowska, Dominika; Stachoń, Małgorzata; Guzek, Dominika",Nutrients,240,6

A systematic review,12.880205,10.390907,2021-04-29,"Objectives: the aim of this study was to test Rutherford Health (RH) staff for the presence of SARS CoV-2 antibodies to reduce the risk of infection to cancer patients. Setting: Between 14 and 24 April 2020 we tested 161 staff at four locations: our cancer centres in Reading - Berkshire, Newport - S Wales, Liverpool - Merseyside, and Bedlington in Northumberland. Participants: Testing was available to all staff who were on site at the four locations named above at the time the study was carried out. 161 staff (80 men, 81 women) gave voluntary consent to have the tests and all testing gave rise to valid results. Interventions: We used the South Korean test for antibodies to SARS CoV-2: Sugentech SGTi-flex COVID-19 IgM/IgG1. For each test, blood was collected and added to the sample well of the test cassette and buffer solution added. The test result was legible after 15 minutes. Outcome measures: The number of tests positive for the presence of antibodies was the primary outcome measure. The ratio of tests positive for the presence of IgM antibodies versus IgG antibodies was the secondary outcome measure. Results: Between 14 and 24 April 2020, 161 staff (age m = 43) were tested at four Rutherford Cancer Care centres that offer proton beam therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Out of 161, 12 samples (7.50%) tested positive of which 7 samples (4.35%) detected IgM only, 2 samples (1.24%) detected IgG only and 3 samples (1.86%) detected both IgM and IgG. Conclusions: The low seroconversion rate in the sample population limits the current utility of the test as a way of reducing risk to vulnerable patient populations but longitudinal retesting will provide further data.","Sikora, Karol; Barwick, Ian; Hamilton, Ceri",,240,20

METHODS: Twenty-four patients hospitalized with H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia at our hospital between September 2009 and January 2010 were included. The patients underwent thin-section CT 3 years after recovery. Abnormal pulmonary lesion patterns (ground-glass opacity, consolidation, parenchymal bands, air trapping, and reticulation) and evidence of fibrosis (architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis, or honeycombing) were evaluated on follow-up thin-section CT. Patients were assigned to Group 1 (with CT evidence of fibrosis) and Group 2 (without CT evidence of fibrosis). Demographics, rate of mechanical ventilation therapy, rate of intensive care unit admission, cumulative prednisolone-equivalent dose, laboratory tests results (maximum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase [AST], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and creatine kinase [CK]), and peak radiographic opacification of 24 patients during the course of their illness in the hospital were compared between two groups. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was present in 17 of 24 (70.8%) patients and fibrosis occurred in 10 of 24 (41.7%) patients. Patients in Group 1 (10/24; 41.7%) had a higher rate of mechanical ventilation therapy (Z = −2.340, P = 0.019), higher number of doses of cumulative prednisolone-equivalent (Z = −2.579, P = 0.010), higher maximum level of laboratory tests results (AST [Z = −2.140, P = 0.032], LDH [Z = −3.227, P = 0.001], and CK [Z = −3.345, P = 0.019]), and higher peak opacification on chest radiographs (Z = −2.743, P = 0.006) than patients in group 2 (14/24; 58.3%). CONCLUSIONS: H1N1 virus-associated pneumonia frequently is followed by long-term pulmonary sequelae, including fibrotic changes, in lung parenchyma. Patients who need more steroid therapy, need more mechanical ventilation therapy, had higher laboratory tests results (maximum levels of AST, LDH, and CK), and had higher peak opacification on chest radiographs during treatment are more likely to develop lung fibrosis.","Xing, Zhi-Heng; Sun, Xin; Xu, Long; Wu, Qi; Li, Li; Wu, Xian-Jie; Shao, Xu-Guang; Zhao, Xin-Qian; Wang, Jing-Hua; Ma, Long-Yan; Wang, Kai",Chin Med J (Engl),240,32

The lectin LSECtin is encoded in the same chromosomal locus as DC-SIGN/R and is coexpressed with DC-SIGNR on sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver and lymphnodes. Here, we show that LSECtin enhances infection driven by filovirus glycoproteins (GP) and the S protein of SARS coronavirus, but does not interact with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 and hepatitis C virus envelope proteins. Ligand binding to LSECtin was inhibited by EGTA but not by mannan, suggesting that LSECtin unlike DC-SIGN/R does not recognize high-mannose glycans on viral GPs. Finally, we demonstrate that LSECtin is N-linked glycosylated and that glycosylation is required for cell surface expression. In summary, we identified LSECtin as an attachment factor that in conjunction with DC-SIGNR might concentrate viral pathogens in liver and lymph nodes.","Gramberg, Thomas; Hofmann, Heike; Möller, Peggy; Lalor, Patricia F.; Marzi, Andrea; Geier, Martina; Krumbiegel, Mandy; Winkler, Thomas; Kirchhoff, Frank; Adams, David H.; Becker, Stephan; Münch, Jan; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Virology,240,16

The general correlation between base composition and codon usage bias suggests that mutational pressure rather than natural selection is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in these samples. By comparative analysis of the codon usage patterns of 40 ORFs of DHV, we found that all of DHV-1 strains grouped in genotype C; the DHV-N strains isolated in South Korea and China clustered into genotypes B; and the DHV-N strains isolated from Taiwan clustered into genotypes A. The findings revealed that more than one subtype of DHV-1 circulated in East Asia. Furthermore, the results of phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values and Clustal W method indicated obvious phylogenetic congruities. This suggested that better genome consistency of DHV may exist in nature and phylogenetic analyses based on RSCU values maybe a good method in classifying genotypes of the virus.

Nevertheless, strategies for the modification of docking recognition and antifouling elements to obtain covalent-like stability without the disruption of the graphene band structure are still needed. In this work, we conducted surface engineering of graphene through heterofunctional supramolecular-covalent scaffolds based on vinylsulfonated-polyamines (PA-VS). In these scaffolds, one side binds graphene through multivalent π-π interactions with pyrene groups, and the other side presents vinylsulfonated pending groups that can be used for covalent binding. The construction of PA-VS scaffolds was demonstrated by spectroscopic ellipsometry, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements. The covalent binding of -SH, -NH2, or -OH groups was confirmed, and it evidenced great chemical versatility. After field-effect studies, we found that the PA-VS-based scaffolds do not disrupt the semiconducting properties of graphene. Moreover, the scaffolds were covalently modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which improved the resistance to nonspecific proteins by almost 7-fold compared to the widely used PEG-monopyrene approach. The attachment of recognition elements to PA-VS was optimized for concanavalin A (ConA), a model lectin with a high affinity to glycans. Lastly, the platform was implemented for the rapid, sensitive, and regenerable recognition of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ferritin in lab-made samples. Those two are the target molecules of major importance for the rapid detection and monitoring of COVID-19-positive patients. For that purpose, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were bound to the scaffolds, resulting in a surface coverage of 436 ± 30 ng/cm2. KD affinity constants of 48.4 and 2.54 nM were obtained by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ferritin binding on these supramolecular scaffolds, respectively.","Piccinini, Esteban; Allegretto, Juan A; Scotto, Juliana; Cantillo, Agustín L; Fenoy, Gonzalo E; Marmisollé, Waldemar A; Azzaroni, Omar",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,240,20

These multiple and interacting crises have elicited growing appeals to the need for transformation. Yet while the scholarly literature on transformations is expanding rapidly, the concept risks becoming an empty buzzword or an alibi for superficial interventions and business-as-usual responses within research, policy and practice communities. In this perspective, we look more closely at what is needed to generate the deep and enduring changes that are called for to address multiple, interacting challenges. We do this by focusing on the prefix ‘trans-’, which signifies moving “across, over, or beyond” the current state of affairs, and we consider how the potential for equitable and sustainable transformations lies in our capacity to transcend entrenched boundaries and limits. Focusing on transdisciplinary, transgressive, and transcendent approaches, we reflect on how individuals, groups, and organizations can plant seeds and help to nurture the potential for radical transformative change at all scales.","Vogel, Coleen; O’Brien, Karen",Sustain Sci,240,1

While most vaccine strategies for these viruses are developed around a programmed antibody response, relatively less attention is paid to our innate immune defenses that can determine the outcome of a viral infection via the production of antiviral cytokines like Type I Interferons. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the “cytokine storm” induced by aberrant activation of the innate immune response against a viral pathogen may sometimes offer replicative advantage to the virus thus promoting disease pathogenesis. Thus, it is important to fine tune the responses of the innate immune network that can be achieved via a deeper insight into the candidate molecules involved. Several pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the Toll like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and the retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) recognize cytosolic RNA viruses and mount an antiviral immune response. RLRs recognize invasive viral RNA produced during infection and mediate the induction of Type I Interferons via the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) molecule. It is an intriguing fact that the mitochondrion, one of the cell’s most vital organelle, has evolved to be a central hub in this antiviral defense. However, cytokine responses and interferon signaling via MAVS signalosome at the mitochondria must be tightly regulated to prevent overactivation of the immune responses. This review focuses on our current understanding of the innate immune sensing of the host mitochondria by the RLR-MAVS signalosome and its specificity against some of the emerging/re-emerging RNA viruses like Ebola, Zika, Influenza A virus (IAV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that may expand our understanding for novel pharmaceutical development.","Dutta, Sourav; Das, Nilanjana; Mukherjee, Piyali",Front Microbiol,240,18

For couples in particular, this extraordinary rise in concern, combined with the stress posed by the virus containment measures, such as prolonged cohabitation and lack of support networks, may have increased the likelihood of couple problems. At the same time, however, COVID-19 concerns may have been a stimulus to activate couples’ stress management processes. A couple’s resource, which may have an important role in dealing with COVID-19 concerns and stress, is dyadic coping, i.e., the process through which partners face stress together. Drawing on a sample of 1,823 Italian individuals involved in a couple relationship, the current study tested a serial mediation model in which concerns about COVID-19 predicted psychological well-being, through both explicit stress communication and perceived partner dyadic coping responses. In addition, the study explored whether this dyadic coping process functioned the same way in satisfied and dissatisfied couples. Results showed that concerns about the situation related to COVID-19 significantly threatened individuals’ psychological well-being. However, these concerns positively predicted explicit stress communication, which in turn positively predicted perceived partner’s dyadic coping responses, which finally positively predicted psychological well-being. In addition, in the group of dissatisfied individuals, the association between explicit stress communication and perceived partners’ dyadic coping responses was not significant. The present study adds to the research on couples’ coping by testing for the first time the whole theoretical model of dyadic coping and does so during a global emergency situation. The study also suggests key components of preventive interventions for individuals in couples.","Donato, Silvia; Parise, Miriam; Pagani, Ariela Francesca; Lanz, Margherita; Regalia, Camillo; Rosnati, Rosa; Iafrate, Raffaella",Front Psychol,240,23

Meanwhile, the presence of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","Chen, Qi-Lin; Li, Jia-Qi; Xiang, Zhi-Dan; Lang, Yue; Guo, Guo-Ji; Liu, Zhi-Hong",Kidney Dis (Basel),240,16

Stochastic simulations of dynamics on networks are performed and compared to output of pairwise models for several realistic examples of infectious diseases to illustrate the role played by the number of stages in the disease dynamics. These results show that a higher number of disease stages results in faster epidemic outbreaks with a higher peak prevalence and a larger final size of the epidemic.

At our institution, we observed severe tongue edema develop in some of these patients. Hence, we sought to determine the incidence of tongue edema in this cohort and whether prone positioning was a risk factor associated with this complication. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: A single‐system retrospective cohort study of patients intubated for respiratory failure secondary to COVID‐19 who subsequently developed clinically notable tongue edema from March 13 to July 5, 2020. RESULTS: 260 patients were intubated for COVID‐19‐related respiratory failure during the study period. 158 patients (60.8%) underwent at least one episode of proning. Twelve patients in total (4.6%) developed clinically significant tongue edema. Eleven of the twelve patients (91.7%) who developed tongue edema underwent proning prior to the development of edema. Prone positioning was associated with an increased incidence of tongue edema (odds ratio [OR] 7.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96–59.46, P = .027). In all proned patients who developed edema, this complication was noted during proning or shortly after supination (range, 0–4 days). Tongue edema was primarily managed with conservative measures; one patient required tracheostomy for definitive management. CONCLUSIONS: Tongue edema appears to develop in a subset of patients with COVID‐19 who are intubated. It appears to be associated with prone positioning but is likely multifactorial in nature. Further investigation into its incidence and pathophysiology is warranted.

This study aimed to evaluate both the association of social frailty with the physical function and the efficacy of intradialytic exercise as a therapy for social frailty among hemodialysis patients. METHODS: All 16 outpatient hemodialysis patients in the hemodialysis department of a single medical center were enrolled in this single-center prospective single-arm interventional study. Patients received five questions which asked about going out infrequently, lack of visiting friends, feeling unhelpful to friends or family, living alone, and lack of talking with someone. Those to whom two or more of the above were applicable were categorized as socially frail. All patients were placed into exercise therapy to be performed during their thrice-weekly hemodialysis visits. Participants’ physical function (walking speed), muscle strength (grip strength), muscle mass (appendicular skeletal muscle mass index), and social frailty were evaluated at baseline and after 3 months of therapy. RESULTS: Four (25%) of the 16 participants (median age 71.5 years, 8 women) were categorized as being socially frail. In comparison to the non-socially frail group (non-SF), the socially frail group (SF) had a significantly lower walking speed (0.70 ± 0.12 m/s vs 1.15 ± 0.26 m/s, p = 0.005) and significantly worse performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery. Three months of intradialytic exercise therapy significantly improved their walking speed, from 1.04 ± 0.30 m/s to 1.16 ± 0.29 m/s (p = 0.003). intradialytic exercise therapy significantly improved walking speed in both the SF group and the non-SF group. The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic unexpectedly occurred in the middle of the intervention period of this study, and although it was not statistically significant, the number of socially frail individuals among our participants increased to seven (43.8%, p = 0.248). CONCLUSIONS: Social frailty was associated with reduced physical function among hemodialysis patients. Intradialytic exercise therapy improved physical function regardless of the presence of social frailty. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN-CTR, UMIN-CTR000038313.

It is highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells, such as syncytiotrophoblasts, cytotrophoblasts, endothelial cells, and the vascular smooth muscle cells of primary and secondary villi. However other route of transplacental infection cannot be ruled out. Pathological examinations have demonstrated that syncytiotrophoblasts are often infected with SARS-CoV-2, but fetuses are not always infected. These findings suggest the presence of a placental barrier, even if it is not completely effective. As the frequency and molecular mechanisms of intrauterine vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have not been determined to date, intensive clinical examinations by repeated ultrasound and fetal heart rate monitoring are strongly recommended for pregnant women infected with COVID-19. In addition, careful investigation of placental samples after delivery by both morphological and molecular methods is also strongly recommended.","Komine-Aizawa, Shihoko; Takada, Kazuhide; Hayakawa, Satoshi",Placenta,240,21

In this study, next-generation sequencing was performed to obtain entire genome sequences of picornavirus from a picornavirus-positive bat feces sample (16BF77) and to explore novel viruses in a pooled bat sample (16BP) from samples collected in South Korea, 2016. Fourteen mammalian viral sequences were identified from 16BF77 and 29 from 16BP, and verified by RT-PCR. The most abundant virus in 16BF77 was picornavirus. Highly variable picornavirus sequences encoding 3D(pol) were classified into genera Kobuvirus, Shanbavirus, and an unassigned group within the family Picornaviridae. Amino acid differences between these partial 3D(pol) sequences were ≥ 65.7%. Results showed that one bat was co-infected by picornaviruses of more than two genera. Retrovirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus A sequences also were found in the BP sample. The retrovirus and coronavirus genomes were identified in nine and eight bats, respectively. Korean bat retroviruses and coronavirus demonstrated strong genetic relationships with a Chinese bat retrovirus (RfRV) and coronavirus (HKU5-1), respectively. A co-infection was identified in one bat with a retrovirus and a coronavirus. Our results indicate that Korean bats were multiply infected by several mammal viruses.","Lee, Sook-Young; Chung, Chul-Un; Park, Jun Soo; Oem, Jae-Ku",Sci Rep,240,14

Indoor air pollution, such as house dust mites and secondhand smoke, can significantly increase the onset of AR, while pet dander may affect the exacerbation of AR symptoms in children. Furthermore, traffic related air pollution and pollen are outdoor air pollutants that can affect immune competency and airway responsiveness, increasing the risk of AR in children. Climate change has increased AR in children, as growth patterns of allergenic species have changed, resulting in longer pollen seasons. More extreme and frequent weather events also contribute to the deterioration of indoor air quality due to climate change. Additionally, viruses provoke respiratory tract infections, worsening the symptoms of AR, while viral infections alter the immune system. Although viruses and pollution influence development and exacerbation of AR, a variety of treatment and prevention options are available for AR patients. The protective influence of vegetation (greenness) is heavily associated with air pollution mitigation, relieving AR exacerbations, while the use of air filters can reduce allergic triggers. Oral antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids are common pharmacotherapy for AR symptoms. In this review, we discuss the environmental risk factors for AR and summarize treatment strategies for preventing and managing AR in children.","Wu, Allison C.; Dahlin, Amber; Wang, Alberta L.",Children (Basel),240,6

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess incidence and disease course of COVID-19 in patients with severe asthma on biologic therapy (omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab), as compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population. METHODS: COVID-19 cases were identified through a prospective ongoing survey between March 17 and April 30, 2020 among all severe asthma specialists from 15 hospitals of the Dutch Severe Asthma Registry RAPSODI. From these cases, data was collected on patient characteristics, including co-morbidities, COVID-19 disease progression and asthma exacerbations. Findings were then compared with COVID-19 data from the general Dutch population. RESULTS: Of 634 severe asthma patients who received biologic therapy in RAPSODI, 9 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. Seven patients (1.1%) required hospitalization for oxygen therapy, of which 5 were admitted to the intensive care for intubation and mechanical ventilation. One patient died (0.16%). All intubated patients had ≥1 co-morbidities. Odds (95%CI) for COVID-19 related hospitalization and intubations were 14 (6.6–29.5) and 41 (16.9–98.5) times higher, respectively, compared to the Dutch population. One patient presented with an asthma exacerbation. CONCLUSION: Patients with severe asthma using biologic therapy showed to have a more severe course of COVID-19 compared to the general population. This may be due to co-morbidities, the severity of asthmatic airway inflammation, the use of biologics, or a combination of these.","Eger, Katrien; Hashimoto, Simone; Braunstahl, Gert Jan; Brinke, Anneke ten; Patberg, Kornelis W.; Beukert, Annelies; Smeenk, Frank; van der Sar–van der Brugge, Simone; Weersink, Els J.M.; Bel, Elisabeth H.",Respir Med,240,1

Virus isolation, hemagglutination and receptor-destroying enzyme activity showed that the buffalo coronavirus (BuCoV) is closely related to BCoV but possesses some different biological properties. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the 3′ end (9.6 kb) of the BuCoV RNA revealed a genomic organization typical of group 2 coronaviruses. Moreover, the genetic distance between BuCoV and BCoV was proven to be the same or even higher than the distance between other ruminant coronaviruses and BCoV.

The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days. This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the analysis process. Methods: Meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo. Results: Five English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available. Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio 0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01). Conclusions: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.

Methods. A cross-sectional, professional pharmacy organization listserver–based online survey of a target group of health-system pharmacists across the United States was conducted. The survey was sent out through professional organization listservers and was anonymous and voluntary. The survey questionnaire included items regarding demographics and employment characteristics, COVID-19–related questions, a survey of respondents’ perceptions of the prevalence and severity of burnout, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQOL). The ProQOL assessed respondents for compassion satisfaction (subcategorized as burnout and STS) and compassion fatigue. Descriptive statistics was used to assess the prevalence of burnout and STS. RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-four health-system pharmacists completed the survey. Based on respondents’ self-ratings of burnout, 47% were identified as having current burnout and 81% as having a history of burnout. Based on ProQOL scoring, 65.3% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high likelihood of burnout, which was a prevalence higher than that indicated by respondents’ self-ratings. Additionally, 51.4% of respondents were identified as having a moderate or high probability of STS and 99.4% as having a moderate or high probability of compassion satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The survey found that over half of health-system pharmacists were affected with burnout, half with STS, and three-fourths with compassion satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, the development of burnout and STS in these health-system pharmacists may lead to several work-related consequences (eg, increase risk of medical errors, depression); therefore, addressing burnout and STS is crucial. Further studies of the consequences of burnout and STS during the COVID-19 pandemic are needed.","Jones, Adam M; Clark, John S; Mohammad, Rima A",Am J Health Syst Pharm,240,16

Here, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (also known as STI571, Gleevec) can inhibit the expression of the endogenous ACE2 gene at both the transcript and protein levels. Treatment with imatinib resulted in inhibition of cell entry of the viral pseudoparticles (Vpps) in cell culture. In FVB mice orally fed imatinib, tissue expression of ACE2 was reduced, specifically in the lungs and renal tubules, but not in the parenchyma of other organs such as the heart and intestine.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, screen time has considerably increased. The need to quarantine and utilize remote learning prompted our review of the basis for current screen time recommendations and more recent research. RECENT FINDINGS The broad stroke of recent research points to an association of increased video game screen time with sedentary lifestyle and its related harms. However, there also are specific instances where video games have been found to be therapeutically useful for certain populations. SUMMARY In light of these findings, it is prudent for the pediatrician to explore more of the 'why' of video game use as opposed to purely the 'how much'.

However, with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, disruptions in routine health care pose a significant risk in reversing the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction. METHODS: Using the World Health Organization’s health systems building blocks framework we examined the mechanisms by which the pandemic may impact neonatal health. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by the government to control its spread could indirectly set back the gains made in neonatal mortality reduction in Ethiopia by weakening the health system building blocks. On the other hand, by exposing longstanding issues in the health system, the pandemic has pressed health sector stakeholders to urgently test innovative approaches to maintain delivery of essential health care. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the Ministry of Health of Ethiopia strike a right balance between the control of the pandemic and ensuring provision of essential neonatal health services. As the pandemic continues to spread in the country, the government should avoid verticalization of pandemic response efforts and adopt a diagonal investment approach to effectively respond to the pandemic as well as build health system resilience to maintain the gains made in the neonatal health.","Estifanos, Abiy Seifu; Kazmi, Kescha; Morris, Shaun K.",Matern Child Health J,240,1

Some reports showed that subjects with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia after being discharged could have several sequelae, but there are few studies on gas exchange and exercise capacity complications in these subjects. AIMS: To describe residual gas exchange abnormalities during recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. METHODS: In an observational study, â¼90 d after onset of disease, we scheduled almost 200 subjects for an out-patient visit with pulmonary function testing and computed tomography of the lungs. Lung mechanics by using body plethysmography, gas exchange with diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide determined by the single-breath technique (DLCOsb) and diffusing lung capacity for nitric oxide determined by the single-breath technique (DLNOsb), and exercise ability by using the 6-min walk test (6MWT) were measured in the subjects. The results were compared between those who required invasive mechanical ventilation and those who did not. RESULTS: A total of 171 subjects were included, the majority (96%) had signs of residual pneumonia (such as an excess of high attenuation areas) on computed tomography of the lungs.

Beyond economical, nutritional, socio-cultural, and religious functions, the inherent adaptability of indigenous birds to diverse environmental conditions also provides a unique genetic resource critical for addressing the global challenges of food security in this world impacted by climatic change and human population growth. Nevertheless, until recently, the potential of the indigenous chicken remained largely untapped for no strong reason. In this review, we offer an overview of food and nutritional security with a special focus on chicken breeding in East Africa. We highlighted and combined confirming evidence of production performance, phenotypic variability, and genetic diversity of East African indigenous chicken using both morphological and molecular tools. Previous attempts to improve the productivity of indigenous chicken are highlighted, and possible future breeding plans and areas of immediate research are suggested. Considering how indigenous chicken strongly affects the livelihood of the majority of households, and since the poultry sector is likely to be strongly affected by climate change, we recommended that the prospects of chicken breeding in Africa should create a permanent balance between the competing needs of genetic improvement and the genetic diversity of indigenous chickens. ABSTRACT: The focus of this review is to offer an overview of food and nutritional security, to identify associated constraints, and propose possible alternative solutions for improving the East African poultry sub-sector in the pursuit of food security, focusing on chicken breeding. To better understand the prospects of the poultry industry, we highlighted and combined confirming evidence of the phenotypic variability and genetic diversity of East African chicken genetic resources using both morphological and molecular tools, as well as performance traits. Furthermore, this work gives a detailed indication of what would be lost if indigenous chicken populations are left to suffer the ongoing massive genetic erosions due to various factors, not limited to indiscriminate crossbreeding. Previous and recent attempts to improve the productivity of indigenous chicken are highlighted, and possible future breeding plans and areas of immediate research are suggested as well. This review concludes that under the prevailing conditions, the village chicken production system appears to be the most imperious production system that needs to be extensively developed ; however, for the sustainability of the industry, the proposed improvement strategies should create a permanent balance between the competing needs of genetic improvement and the genetic diversity of the indigenous chicken genetic resource.","Pius, Lenox Omondi; Strausz, Péter; Kusza, Szilvia",Biology (Basel),240,20

Approximately one-third of patients are candidates for systemic immunosuppressive treatments, such as synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, because of disease extensions, localization in sensitive or visible areas and/or resistance to topical treatments. These therapies have been associated with increased risk of infection, including upper respiratory tract viral infection. Psoriasis is frequently associated with cardio-metabolic comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes, that are risk factors for poor prognosis in the case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. A narrative review of the literature based on an electronic search of the PubMed(®) database was undertaken with the objective of investigating whether there is an increased risk of COVID-19 infection in psoriasis patients on systemic treatment. Original articles, such as case reports, published up to 1 November 2020 were included. There is no evidence that patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis receiving systemic treatments, including biologics, have higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or increased hospitalization and death related to COVID-19 compared to the general population. Several case reports described full recovery from COVID-19 with favorable outcomes in psoriasis patients who were being treated with synthetics or biologicals.

METHODS Thirty participants were randomised to continue in Sp (n = 15) or wear somofilcon A daily disposable CL (n = 15) ('group'). A surgical face mask (Type II R) was worn for at least one hour per day on four or more days per week. After two weeks, participants completed the Quality of Life Impact of Refractive Correction Questionnaire (QIRC), a two-part face mask usability questionnaire and graded ocular-related symptoms using 0-100 visual analogue scales. RESULTS There was no difference between groups for overall QIRC score but some individual question scores reflected better quality of life in the CL: 'outdoor activities', 'keep fit' and 'able to do things' (all p < 0.05). Differences in favour of the CL were seen for the following in the face mask usability questionnaire: 'breathing', 'heat', 'comfort on ears', 'overall comfort', 'walking', 'driving', 'reading', 'computer use', 'exercising' and 'socialising' (all p < 0.05). Significant differences were also seen for the 0-100 VAS symptoms probing vision quality in favour of the CL: glare, distance and near vision, fogging, restricted field of view and peripheral blur. CONCLUSION This work supports anecdotal reports that CL are a better vision correction option than Sp when used in conjunction with a face mask. Participants reported a range of benefits to the CL/face mask combination for vision-related symptoms, breathing and heat-related symptoms and a number of day-to-day activities including walking, driving and exercising. All of the benefits relating to the CL are likely to result in improved adherence to face mask use. Overall, the findings of this work suggest that where possible, CL should be the preferred vision correction option for people using face masks.","Maldonado-Codina, Carole; Navascues-Cornago, Maria; Plowright, Andrew J; Mirza, Aftab; Smith, Sarah; Read, Michael L; Vega, Jose; Orsborn, Gary N; Morgan, Philip B",Contact lens & anterior eye : the journal of the British Contact Lens Association,240,1

Since the discovery of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats, attempts to isolate a SL-CoV from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help with these investigations and as tools to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) were captured from the wild and transported live to the laboratory for primary cell culture preparation using a variety of different methods and culture media. Primary cells were successfully cultured from 20 different organs. Cell immortalisation can occur spontaneously, however we used a retroviral system to immortalise cells via the transfer and stable production of the Simian virus 40 Large T antigen and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein. Initial infection experiments with both cloned and uncloned cell lines using Hendra and Nipah viruses demonstrated varying degrees of infection efficiency between the different cell lines, although it was possible to infect cells in all tissue types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The approaches developed and optimised in this study should be applicable to bats of other species. We are in the process of generating further cell lines from a number of different bat species using the methodology established in this study.","Crameri, Gary; Todd, Shawn; Grimley, Samantha; McEachern, Jennifer A.; Marsh, Glenn A.; Smith, Craig; Tachedjian, Mary; De Jong, Carol; Virtue, Elena R.; Yu, Meng; Bulach, Dieter; Liu, Jun-Ping; Michalski, Wojtek P.; Middleton, Deborah; Field, Hume E.; Wang, Lin-Fa",PLoS One,240,24

The long-term effects of the current health crisis are bringing about changes in cultural demand and offer and highlighting the need to adapt and to think of new ways of functioning. Taking its cue from this situation, the research underlying our article set out to investigate the ways in which Romania’s independent creative sector is adapting. We achieved this by means of conducting 25 semi-structured interviews and undertaking case studies of two cities that are among the most effervescent from the point of view of cultural and creative industries, Timișoara and Cluj-Napoca. With the strengthening of this sector as the aim in view, the forms of early social resilience we identified are capable in the short term of taking action to ensure the survival of some of the spaces; in the medium term, through activating mechanisms that encourage entrepreneurial spirit, they will be able to adapt to any external shock.","Popa, Nicolae; Pop, Ana-Maria; Marian-Potra, Alexandra-Camelia; Cocean, Pompei; Hognogi, Gheorghe-Gavrilă; David, Nicoleta Afrodita",Int J Environ Res Public Health,240,20

There have been scales developed to measure individuals' digital literacy competencies; however, intervention programs have been only a few. This research paper articulates design details, validity, reliability and effectiveness of a new online modulated digital literacy intervention program (DLIP). For the development of DLIP, digital literacy is stipulated in this research as a universal framework that consists of six different literacies; media, information, technology, computer, visual, and communication literacy. An online module has been designed for each of these six literacies, and the concept of game-based learning has been used to engage the users and secure high user satisfaction. To test the reliability of the intervention, the Kuder- Richardson- 20 (KR-20) test was performed. The developed intervention was deemed to be reliable with the KR-20 value of 0.86. The construct validity was measured using the spearman’s correlation test and since the values for all the constructs were above 0.3, the DLIP was valid. The effectiveness of the DLIP was evaluated by calculating the effect size. The Cohen’s d test was used and the results show that the intervention was moderately effective.

Obesity as a unifying risk factor for severe COVID-19 is an emerging hypothesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether excessive body weight per se, was a risk factor for developing a severe form of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 131 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia in a single center of the internal medicine department in Marseille, France. We recorded anthropometric and metabolic parameters such as fasting glycaemia, insulinemia, HOMA-IR, lipids, and all clinical criteria linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the admission. Excess body weight was defined by a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m(2). The occurrence of a serious event was defined as a high-debit oxygen requirement over 6 L/min, admission into the intensive care unit, or death. RESULTS: Among 113 patients, two thirds (n = 76, 67%) had an excess body weight. The number of serious events was significantly higher in excess body weight patients compared to normal weight patients (respectively 25% vs 8%, p = 0.03) although excess body weight patients were younger (respectively 63.6 vs 70.3 years old, p = 0.01). In multivariate analyses, the excess body weight status was the only predictor for developing a serious event linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an odds ratio at 5.6 (95% CI: 1.30–23.96; p = 0.02), independently of previous obesity associated comorbidities. There was a trend towards a positive association between the BMI (normal weight, overweight and obesity) and the risk of serious events linked to COVID-19, with a marked increase from 8.1% to 20% and 30.6% respectively (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Excess body weight was significantly associated with severe forms of the disease, independently of its classical associated comorbidities. Physicians and specialists in Public Health must be sensitized to better protect people with an excess body weight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Pietri, Léa; Giorgi, Roch; Bégu, Audrey; Lojou, Manon; Koubi, Marie; Cauchois, Raphael; Grangeot, Rachel; Dubois, Noémie; Kaplanski, Gilles; Valéro, René; Béliard, Sophie",Metabolism,240,16

The results show that: (1) the epidemic spread rapidly from January 24 to February 20, 2020, and the distribution of the epidemic areas tended to be stable over time. The epidemic spread rate in Hubei province, in its surrounding, and in some economically developed cities was higher, while that in western part of China and in remote areas of central and eastern China was lower. (2) The global and local spatial correlation characteristics of the epidemic distribution present a positive correlation. Specifically, the global spatial correlation characteristics experienced a change process from agglomeration to decentralization. The local spatial correlation characteristics were mainly composed of the‘high-high’ and ‘low-low’ clustering types, and the situation of the contiguous layout was very significant. (3) The population inflow from Wuhan and the strength of economic connection were the main factors affecting the epidemic spread, together with the population distribution, transport accessibility, average temperature, and medical facilities, which affected the epidemic spread to varying degrees. (4) The detection factors interacted mainly through the mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and their influence on the epidemic spread rate exceeded that of single factors. Besides, each detection factor has an interval range that is conducive to the epidemic spread.","Xie, Zhixiang; Qin, Yaochen; Li, Yang; Shen, Wei; Zheng, Zhicheng; Liu, Shirui",Sci Total Environ,240,20

More robust immune activation in women has been proposed to contribute to decreased disease severity, although systemic inflammation has been associated with worse outcomes in COVID-19 infection. Whether systemic inflammation contributes to sex differences in COVID-19 infection is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined sex differences in inflammatory markers among 453 men (mean age 61) and 328 women (mean age 62) hospitalized with COVID-19 infection at the Massachusetts General Hospital from March 8 to April 27, 2020. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine the association of sex with initial and peak inflammatory markers. Exploratory analyses examined the association of sex and inflammatory markers with 28-day clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Initial and peak CRP were higher in men compared with women after adjustment for baseline differences (initial CRP: ß 0.29, SE 0.07, p = 0.0001; peak CRP: ß 0.31, SE 0.07, p<0.0001) with similar findings for IL-6, PCT, and ferritin (p<0.05 for all). Men had greater than 1.5-greater odds of dying compared with women (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.04–2.80, p = 0.03). Sex modified the association of peak CRP with both death and ICU admission, with stronger associations observed in men compared with women (death: OR 9.19, 95% CI 4.29–19.7, p <0.0001 in men vs OR 2.81, 95% CI 1.52–5.18, p = 0.009 in women, P(interaction) = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In a sample of 781 men and women hospitalized with COVID-19 infection, men exhibited more robust inflammatory activation as evidenced by higher initial and peak inflammatory markers, as well as worse clinical outcomes.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are the largest known group of positive-sense RNA viruses surviving on an extensive number of natural hosts. CoVs are enveloped and non-segmented viruses with a size between 80 and 120 nm. CoV attachment to the surface receptor and its subsequent entrance into cells is mediated by Spike glycoprotein (S). For enhanced CoV entry and successful pathogenesis of CoV, proteolytic processing and receptor-binding act synergistically for induction of large-scale S conformational changes. The shape, size and orientation of receptor-binding domains in viral attachment proteins are well conserved among viruses of different classes that utilize the same receptor. Therefore, investigations unraveling the distribution of cellular receptors with respect to CoV entry, structural aspects of glycoproteins and related conformational changes are highly significant for understanding virus invasion and infection spread. We present the characteristic features of CoV S-Proteins, their significance for CoVs and related receptor binding activities for pathogenesis and viral survival. We are analyzing the novel role of S-protein of CoVs along with their interactive receptors for improving host immunity and decreasing infection spread.

In this paper, we discuss three such metaphors—the masks of objectivity, of infallibility, and of benevolence—and their powerful role in medicine. These masks can be viewed as inflexible barriers to communication, contributing to the traditional authoritarian relationship between doctor and patient and concealing the authenticity and vulnerability of physicians. COVID masks, by contrast, offer a more nuanced and morally complex metaphor for thinking about protecting people from harm, authentic and trustworthy communication, and attention to potential inequities both in and beyond medical settings. We highlight the morally relevant challenges and opportunities that masks evoke and suggest that there is much to be gained from rethinking the mask metaphor in medicine.","Grubbs, Lindsey; Geller, Gail",J Med Humanit,240,22

METHODS: This is a descriptive cross‐sectional study, whose demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory data (arterial lactate, bicarbonate, and plasma thiamine) were obtained in the first hours of admission to the intensive care unit. Patients with diabetes were compared with individuals without diabetes, and the correlation was performed between thiamine and lactate levels. Thiamine levels <28 μg/L were considered as thiamine deficiency. RESULTS: Overall, 270 patients met the inclusion criteria; 51.1% were men, and the median age was 74 years (66.8‐81). The median value of thiamine was 54.0 μg/L (38‐72.3), and 15.6% had thiamine deficiency. Among patients with diabetes, 26.3% had thiamine deficiency, and 69.3% had hyperlactatemia.

Wide‐ranging changes to healthcare delivery have occurred, especially in hospitals and EDs. Health services have made local decisions about care pathways, in some cases deviating from what would, until recently, have been considered widely accepted care. These changes bring with them new medicolegal risk for clinicians. In Australia, civil liability Acts provide protection for professionals when the criterion of having undertaken ‘competent’ practice that would be ‘widely accepted’ ‘in the circumstances’ is met. There is doubt how courts, and the medical experts who advise them, will evaluate clinical care provided during the pandemic when health services have developed local care pathways and there is no nationally accepted standard.","Kelly, Anne‐Maree",Emerg Med Australas,240,5

METHODS: Using positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), we constructed a spreadsheet tool for determining the minimum clinical specificity (conditional on NPV or PPV, sensitivity and prevalence) and minimum clinical sensitivity (conditional on NPV or PPV, specificity and prevalence) of tests. RESULTS: At a prevalence of 1%, there are no minimum sensitivity requirements to achieve a desired NPV of 60%-95% for a given clinical specificity above 20%. It is not possible to achieve 60-95% PPV even with 100% clinical sensitivity, except when the clinical specificity is near 100%. The opposite trend is seen in high prevalence settings (60%), where a relatively low minimum clinical sensitivity is required to achieve a desired PPV for a given clinical specificity, and a higher minimum clinical specificity is required to achieve a desired NPV for a given clinical sensitivity. DISCUSSION: The selection of laboratory tests and the testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2 involves delicate trade-offs between NPV and PPV based on prevalence and clinical sensitivity and clinical specificity. Practitioners and health authorities should carefully consider the clinical scenarios under which the test result will be used and select the most appropriate testing strategy that fulfils the a priori defined clinical performance specification.","Ping Loh, Tze; Lord, Sarah J; Bell, Katy; Kathryn Bohn, Mary; Yee Lim, Chun; Markus, Corey; Fares Taie, Hernan; Adeli, Khosrow; Lippi, Giuseppe; Sandberg, Sverre; Horvath, Andrea",Clin Biochem,240,1

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = −.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

In a screen for new models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we identified human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of ACE2 expression. Remarkably, H522 infection requires the E484D S variant; viruses expressing wild-type S are not infectious. Anti-S monoclonal antibodies differentially neutralize SARS-CoV-2 E484D S in H522 cells as compared to ACE2-expressing cells. Sera from vaccinated individuals block this alternative entry mechanism, whereas convalescent sera are less effective. Though the H522 receptor remains unknown, depletion of surface heparan sulfates block H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling reveal alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling. These findings establish an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor for the E484D SARS-CoV-2 variant, which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.","Puray-Chavez, Maritza; LaPak, Kyle M.; Schrank, Travis P.; Elliott, Jennifer L.; Bhatt, Dhaval P.; Agajanian, Megan J.; Jasuja, Ria; Lawson, Dana Q.; Davis, Keanu; Rothlauf, Paul W.; Liu, Zhuoming; Jo, Heejoon; Lee, Nakyung; Tenneti, Kasyap; Eschbach, Jenna E.; Mugisha, Christian Shema; Cousins, Emily M.; Cloer, Erica W.; Vuong, Hung R.; VanBlargan, Laura A.; Bailey, Adam L.; Gilchuk, Pavlo; Crowe, James E.; Diamond, Michael S.; Hayes, D.

A significant increase in circulating plasmablasts is characteristic of COVID-19 though the underlying mechanisms and its prognostic implications are not known. Here, we demonstrate that in the acute phase of COVID-19, activated PD-1highCXCR5-CD4+ T cells, peripheral helper T cells, (Tph) are significantly increased and promote inflammatory tissue-homing plasmablasts in patients with stable but not severe COVID-19. Analysis of scRNA-seq data revealed that plasmablasts in stable patients express higher levels of tissue-homing receptors including CXCR3. The increased Tph cells exhibited ""B cell help"" signatures similar to that of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells and promoted B cell differentiation in vitro. Compared with cTfh cells, Tph cells produced more IFN{gamma}, inducing tissue-homing chemokine receptors on plasmablasts. Finally, expansion of activated Tph cells was correlated with the frequency of CXCR3+ plasmablasts in the acute phase of patients with stable disease. Our results demonstrate a novel role for Tph cells in acute viral immunity by inducing ectopic, antibody secreting plasmablasts.","Asashima, H.; Mohanty, S.; Comi, M.; Ruff, W. E.; Hoehn, K.

There is limited data on whether a specific symptom or collection of symptoms may be useful to predict test positivity. METHODS: An anonymous electronic survey was publicized through social media to query participants with COVID‐19 testing. Respondents were questioned regarding 10 presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities and COVID‐19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID positivity. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using receiver operating characteristic analysis (ROC). RESULTS: One‐hundred and forty‐five participants with positive COVID‐19 testing and 157 with negative results were included. Participants had a mean age of 39 years, and 214 (72%) were female. Smell or taste change, fever, and body ache were associated with COVID‐19 positivity, and shortness of breath and sore throat were associated with a negative test result (p<0.05). A model using all 5 diagnostic symptoms had the highest accuracy with a predictive ability of 82% in discriminating between COVID‐19 results. To maximize sensitivity and maintain fair diagnostic accuracy, a combination of 2 symptoms, change in sense of smell or taste and fever was found to have a sensitivity of 70% and overall discrimination accuracy of 75%. CONCLUSION: Smell or taste change is a strong predictor for a COVID‐19 positive test result. Using the presence of smell or taste change with fever, this parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 75% of COVID‐19 test results. A larger cohort of respondents will be necessary to refine classifier performance. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: A mixed methods design was utilized. Qualitative methods, such as reviewing existing questionnaires that measured caregiver work productivity losses and performing one-on-one interviews with caregivers, were used for VOLP adaptation and online conversion. Quantitative methods were used to evaluate feasibility and validity of the online VOLP. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire for caregivers was included to compare its absenteeism and presenteeism outcomes and their correlations with VOLP outcomes. RESULTS: When adapting the VOLP for caregivers, our qualitative analysis showed the importance of adding three major components: caregiving time, work productivity loss related to volunteer activities and caregivers’ lost job opportunities. A total of 383 caregivers who completed online survey were included in our final quantitative analysis. We found small Spearman rank correlations between VOLP and WPAI, observing a larger correlation between their absenteeism [r = 0.49 (95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.60)] than their presenteeism [r = 0.36 (0.24–0.47)]. Correlations between VOLP outcomes and total caregiving hours were larger for absenteeism [r = 0.38 (0.27–0.47)] than presenteeism [r = 0.22 (0.10–0.34)]. Correlations between WPAI outcomes and total caregiving hours were smaller for absenteeism [r = 0.27 (0.15–0.38)] than presenteeism [r = 0.35 (0.23–0.46)]. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence of the feasibility and preliminary validity evidence of the adapted VOLP caregiver questionnaire in measuring productivity losses due to caregiving responsibilities, when compared with the results for WPAI and the results from the previous patient-VOLP validation study.","Gelfand, Aaron; Sou, Julie; Sawatzky, Rick; Prescott, Katrina; Pearce, Alison; Anis, Aslam H.; Lee, Christine; Zhang, Wei",Front Psychol,240,20

In spite of several observational studies and a few randomized controlled trials, the effect of hydroxychloroquine on patients with COVID 19 infection remains unclear. We undertook this systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine among patients with COVID 19 infection. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, medRxiv, and other relevant resources until May 13, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and observational studies in which hydroxychloroquine was adminstered and compared to a control group. Data were extracted, and quality assessment of the studies was carried out. We evaluated symptomatic progression, mortality, viral clearance, the evolution of changes on chest CT imaging, and adverse events. A fixed or random-effects model was used depending on outcome heterogeneity. Results We included eleven studies including, three randomized controlled trials and eight observational studies. Among these, 2354 patients received hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination, while 1952 did not. Mortality was reported at different points of time. The overall mortality was not significantly different among patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to the control group (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 0.76 to 2.62; p = 0.28). Clinical worsening or lack of symptomatic improvement did not differ between patients who received hydroxychloroquine compared to those who did not (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6 to 2.02; p = 0.76). Viral clearance, assessed by RT-PCR, did not differ significantly between the hydroxychloroquine and the control groups (OR: 1.13, CI: 0.26 to 5.01; p = 0.87). The evolution of changes on chest CT imaging was reported only in two studies; a more pronounced improvement was observed with the use of hydroxychloroquine compared to standard care (OR: 2.68, CI: 1.1 to 6.6; P = 0.03). The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher with hydroxychloroquine (OR: 4.1, CI: 1.42 to 11.88; p = 0.009). Conclusions Our meta-analysis does not suggest improvement in clinical progression, mortality, or viral clearance by RT PCR among patients with COVID 19 infection who are treated with hydroxychloroquine. There was a significantly higher incidence of adverse events with hydroxychloroquine use.","Chacko, J.; Brar, G.; Premkumar, R.",,240,31

The set of initial data, from which the number of infected people decrease to zero, is generated by a new type of Lyapunov functions defined in the sense of viability theory. The associated controls are provided via selections of adequately designed feedback map. The existence of such selections is improved by using Micheal selection theorem. Finally, an application to the SIRS epidemic model, with numerical simulations, is given to show the efficiency of our approach.
