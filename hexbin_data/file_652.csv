Given the poor knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning IPF onset and progression, a better understanding of the cellular processes and molecular pathways involved is essential for the development of effective therapies, currently lacking. Besides a number of established IPF-associated risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, environmental factors, comorbidities, and viral infections, several other processes have been linked with this devastating disease. Apoptosis, senescence, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and epithelial cell migration have been shown to play a key role in IPF-associated tissue remodeling. Moreover, molecules, such as chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, adenosine, glycosaminoglycans, non-coding RNAs, and cellular processes including oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and alternative polyadenylation have been linked with IPF development. Importantly, strategies targeting these processes have been investigated to modulate abnormal cellular phenotypes and maintain tissue homeostasis in the lung. This review provides an update regarding the emerging cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the onset and progression of IPF.","Phan, Thị Hằng Giang; Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.; Giordo, Roberta; Eid, Ali Hussein; Fois, Alessandro Giuseppe; Zinellu, Angelo; Mangoni, Arduino Aleksander; Pintus, Gianfranco",Cell Mol Life Sci,652,1

Clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of reported cases of Zika that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without laboratory confirmation. Applying this method to weekly reported case data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 944,700 (95% CrI: 884,900–996,400) Zika cases occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using molecular methods versus 608,400 (95% CrI: 442,000–821,800) Zika cases that occurred when assuming all confirmed cases were diagnosed using serological methods. Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher reported cases of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil. Given that Zika, dengue, and chikungunya appear likely to co-circulate in the Americas and elsewhere for years to come, our methodology has the potential to enhance the interpretation of passive surveillance data for these diseases going forward. Likewise, our methodology could also be used to help resolve transmission dynamics of other co-circulating diseases with similarities in symptomatology and potential for misdiagnosis.","Oidtman, Rachel J.; España, Guido; Perkins, T.

However, the error rate of long-read technologies is higher than that of short-read technologies. This has a direct consequence on the base quality of genome assemblies, particularly in coding regions where sequencing errors can disrupt the coding frame of genes. In the case of diploid genomes, the consensus of a given gene can be a mixture between the two haplotypes and can lead to premature stop codons. Several methods have been developed to polish genome assemblies using short reads and generally, they inspect the nucleotide one by one, and provide a correction for each nucleotide of the input assembly. As a result, these algorithms are not able to properly process diploid genomes and they typically switch from one haplotype to another. Herein we proposed Hapo-G (Haplotype-Aware Polishing Of Genomes), a new algorithm capable of incorporating phasing information from high-quality reads (short or long-reads) to polish genome assemblies and in particular assemblies of diploid and heterozygous genomes.","Aury, Jean-Marc; Istace, Benjamin",NAR Genom Bioinform,652,1

This ability is crucial for survival as epithelia are essential to provide the ultimate barrier against the external environment, protecting the underlying tissues. Tissue stem and progenitor cells are responsible for self-renewal and repair during homeostasis and following injury. Upon wounding, epithelial tissues undergo different phases of haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodelling, often resulting in fibrosis and scarring. In this review, we explore the phenotypic differences between the skin, the oesophagus and the oral mucosa. We discuss the plasticity of these epithelial stem cells and contribution of different fibroblast subpopulations for tissue regeneration and wound healing. While these epithelial tissues share global mechanisms of stem cell behaviour for tissue renewal and regeneration, the oral mucosa is known for its outstanding healing potential with minimal scarring. We aim to provide an updated review of recent studies that combined cell therapy with bioengineering exporting the unique scarless properties of the oral mucosa to improve skin and oesophageal wound healing and to reduce fibrotic tissue formation. These advances open new avenues toward the ultimate goal of achieving scarless wound healing.","Pereira, Diana; Sequeira, Inês",Front Cell Dev Biol,652,1

However, fraction-based antioxidant activity and their antimutagenic potential are not yet fully investigated. Different extracts of the seeds P. nigrum were obtained by sequential extraction in different solvents. All extracts were evaluated for antibacterial and antioxidant activities using different methods. The most active fraction was analyzed for antimutagenic activity using the Ames Salmonella test. The antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was found to be more prominent compared to ESβL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. The MIC values were found to be lower against MRSA than K. pneumoniae. The extract showing highest antioxidant activity (methanol extract) was further tested for antimutagenic activity both against direct and indirect-acting mutagens. A varying level of antimutagenic activity was shown by methanol extract at highest tested concentration (200 µg/plate). Alkaloids, phenols, and flavonoids were detected as major class of compounds in methanol extract. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis showed the presence of various phytocompounds. Based on molecular docking of two major active phytocompounds (piperine and copaene), they were found to interact at the minor groove of DNA. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed that both the ligands were quite stable with DNA under physiological conditions. The ability of phytocompounds to interact with DNA might be reducing the interaction of mutagens and could be one of the possible mechanism of anti-mutagenic activity of P. nigrum extract. This study highlights the antioxidant and antimutagenic potential of Piper nigrum.

This approach attempts to optimize the therapies and the patient care based on the individual patient characteristics. Its success highly depends on the way the characterization of the disease and its evolution, the patient’s classification, its follow-up and the treatment could be optimized. Thus, personalized medicine must combine innovative tools to measure, integrate and model data. Towards this goal, clinical metabolomics appears as ideally suited to obtain relevant information. Indeed, the metabolomics signature brings crucial insight to stratify patients according to their responses to a pathology and/or a treatment, to provide prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, and to improve therapeutic outcomes. However, the translation of metabolomics from laboratory studies to clinical practice remains a subsequent challenge. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are the two key platforms for the measurement of the metabolome. NMR has several advantages and features that are essential in clinical metabolomics. Indeed, NMR spectroscopy is inherently very robust, reproducible, unbiased, quantitative, informative at the structural molecular level, requires little sample preparation and reduced data processing. NMR is also well adapted to the measurement of large cohorts, to multi-sites and to longitudinal studies. This review focus on the potential of NMR in the context of clinical metabolomics and personalized medicine. Starting with the current status of NMR-based metabolomics at the clinical level and highlighting its strengths, weaknesses and challenges, this article also explores how, far from the initial “opposition” or “competition”, NMR and MS have been integrated and have demonstrated a great complementarity, in terms of sample classification and biomarker identification. Finally, a perspective discussion provides insight into the current methodological developments that could significantly raise NMR as a more resolutive, sensitive and accessible tool for clinical applications and point-of-care diagnosis. Thanks to these advances, NMR has a strong potential to join the other analytical tools currently used in clinical settings.","Letertre, Marine P.

In this paper, we offer an interpretation for the slow growth based on Minsky’s financial instability hypothesis and recent literature on financialization and growth. We analyze the balance sheet of large non-financial companies over the period 2012–2019, a period that comprises the positive investment cycle—initiated during the commodities boom which lasted from the second half of the 2000s until 2014—the 2015–2016 recession, and the period preceding the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Minsky’s taxonomy of financial profiles, we map a proxy for financial instability at the firm level based on Davis et al. (2019). We also propose an aggregate financial stability index. We conclude that after the 2015–2016 recession, companies have been restructuring their debt profile and adopting a defensive behavior, increasing their liquidity preference. Our analysis supports the interpretation that, even with the sharp fall in domestic real interest rates, the degree of confidence on expectations to recover investment in productive assets is low. This corroborates with the thesis that agents’ decisions do not respond only to supply stimulus, but are guided by expectations of future returns, which fundamentally depend on the performance of aggregate demand. Since 2015, Brazilian economic policy has been driven by fiscal consolidation, which has proven ineffective in increasing economic growth.","Mantoan, Eduardo; Centeno, Vinícius; Feijo, Carmem",Rev Evol Polit Econ,652,27

Existing literature indicates the primary caregiver, typically the mother, is instrumental in vaccine decision-making, but this may vary in contexts. We investigated the role of stakeholders in India who influence caregivers vaccination perceptions, as this is essential to developing strategies to promote vaccine acceptance and improve uptake. Methods: This research was conducted in 2019 in Mewat District in Haryana, an area in India with extremely low vaccination coverage. We conducted six focus group discussions with 60 participants in the following categories: fathers of children under-5 years old, expectant mothers, mothers-in-law, community health workers, and community influencers such as locally elected officials and religious leaders. Results: Our results highlighted four themes that influence vaccine uptake. First, while caregivers associated vaccination with reductions in specific diseases, they also noted that vaccination services brought broad health gains, including improved nutrition, antenatal guidance, and social support. Second, community health workers critically influenced, positively or negatively, caregivers vaccination perceptions. Third, community health workers faced gaps in their education such as limited training on vaccine side-effects, placing them at a disadvantage when dealing with families. Finally, we found that mothers-in-law, fathers, and religious leaders influence caregivers perceptions of vaccination. Conclusions: Communication of broader benefits of vaccines and vaccination services by community health workers could be impactful in increasing vaccine acceptance. Vaccine uptake could potentially be improved by facilitating community health workers ownership over vaccine acceptance and uptake by involving them in the design and implementation of interventions to target mothers and mothers-in-law. A bottom-up approach, leveraging community health workers knowledge to design interventions, and giving a voice to key members of the household and society beyond mothers alone, may sustain health improvement in low vaccine coverage areas.","Dhaliwal, B.; Chandrashekhar, R.; Rattani, A.; Seth, R.; Closser, S.; Jain, A.; Bloom, D.; Shet, A.",,652,1

Information was also obtained on the patients' age, sex, and urgency, along with the type of case (outpatient/inpatient), admitting ward, and a small number of tracer diagnoses (I21, myocardial infarction; J44, COPD; and I61, I63, I64, G45, stroke /TIA), as well as on the number of COVID-19 cases and of tests performed for SARS-CoV-2, as a measure of the number of cases in which COVID-19 was suspected or at least included in the differential diagnoses. RESULTS: A total of 1 022 007 emergency room consultations were analyzed, of which 546 940 took place in 2019 and 475 067 in 2020. The number of consultations with a positive test for the COVID-19 pathogen was 3122. The total number of emergency room consultations in the observation period was 13% lower in 2020 than in 2019, with a maximum drop by 38% coinciding with the highest number of COVID-19 cases (calendar week 14; 572 cases).

Furthermore, answers regarding the clinical picture, diagnostic approach, and treatment options are discussed. Most of therapeutic options considered for SARS-CoV-2 treatment (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma) failed to confirm significant efficiency. On the contrary, vaccines for widescale use are already available despite the initial skepticism. In the beginning of the pandemic, 25.2% (18.2% vs. 32.2%) considered that there will not be an effective COVID-19 vaccine, while 41.6% (43.0% vs. 40.2%) thought that a vaccine would be available after at least 12 months. In conclusion, initially, following only a 1 month period, Romanian physicians’ intention to consider treatments such as hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 decreased significantly. Moreover, confidence in the efficiency of available protective measures increased, and the rates of separation from household members decreased. © 2021 by the authors.

To understand the etiology of these neurological sequelae, we utilized single-cell sequencing and examined the immune cell profiles from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Neuro-COVID patients compared with patients with non-inflammatory and autoimmune neurological diseases or with viral encephalitis. The CSF of Neuro-COVID patients exhibited an expansion of dedifferentiated monocytes and of exhausted CD4+ T cells. Neuro-COVID CSF leukocytes featured an enriched interferon signature; however, this was less pronounced than in viral encephalitis. Repertoire analysis revealed broad clonal T cell expansion and curtailed interferon response in severe compared with mild Neuro-COVID patients.

Hydroxychloroquine-identical matched placebo tablets will ensure that all participants are taking the same number and dosing regimen of tablets across the three trial arms. There is no variation in the dose of hydroxychloroquine by weight. The dosing regimen for the three arms of the study (A, B, C) are described in further detail below. Arm A: Active Hydroxychloroquine (- daily dosing and placebo-matched hydroxychloroquine - weekly dosing). Form: Tablets Route: Oral. Dose and Frequency: Active hydroxychloroquine: Days 1-2: Loading phase - 400mg (2 x 200mg tablets) taken twice a day for 2 days Days 3 onwards: Maintenance Phase - 200mg (1 x 200mg tablet) taken once daily, every day for 90 days (~3 months) Matched Placebo hydroxychloroquine: Days 3 onwards: Maintenance Phase - 2 tablets taken once a week on the same day each week (every 7th day) for 90 days (~3 months) Arm B: Active Hydroxychloroquine (- weekly dosing and placebo matched hydroxychloroquine - daily dosing.) Form: Tablets Route: Oral. Dose and Frequency: Active hydroxychloroquine: Days 1-2: Loading Phase - 400mg (2 x 200mg tablets) taken twice daily for 2 days Days 3 onwards: Maintenance Phase - 400mg (2 x 200mg tablets) taken once a week on the same day each week (every 7th day) for 90 days (~3 months) Matched Placebo hydroxychloroquine: Days 3 onwards: Maintenance Phase - 1 tablet taken once daily for 90 days (~3 months) Arm C: Matched placebo Hydroxychloroquine (- daily dosing and matched placebo hydroxychloroquine - weekly dosing.)

MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to diagnosis of positive COVID-19 disease (defined by record of date of symptoms onset and confirmed by laboratory test) RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomised to either hydroxychloroquine dosed daily with weekly placebo, HCQ dosed weekly with daily placebo, or placebo dosed daily and weekly. Randomisation will be in a 3:3:2 ratio [hydroxychloroquine-(daily), hydroxychloroquine-(weekly), placebo], using stratified block randomisation. Random block sizes will be used, and stratification will be by study site. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants and trial investigators consenting participants, delivering trial assessments and procedures will be blinded to intervention. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A sufficient number of participants will be enrolled so that approximately 1000 participants in total will have data suitable for the primary statistical analysis. It is anticipated that approximately 1,200 participants will need to be enrolled in total, to allow for a 20% dropout over the period of the trial. This would result in approximately 450:450:300 participants randomised to hydroxychloroquine daily, hydroxychloroquine weekly+daily matched placebo or matched-placebo daily and weekly.

This effect could be enhanced by mutations in positions 417, 484 and 493 (especially K417N, E484K, Q493K and Q493R), and to a lesser extent by mutations in positions 486 and 499 (such as F486L and P499T). Such enhancements due to more favourable binding interactions with residues on the complementary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interface, are however, unlikely to sustain mouse infectivity on their own based on theoretical and experimental evidence to date. Our current understanding thus points to the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants of concern infecting mice, while Delta and Delta Plus lack a similar biomolecular basis to do so. This paper identifies a list of countries where local field surveillance of mice is encouraged because they may have come in contact with humans who had the virus with adaptive mutation(s).

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and nitrotyrosine (NT) are pro-inflammatory biomolecules associated with satiety and increased body weight. We evaluated whether MCP-1 and NT are associated with decreased inflammation or increased body mass during etanercept therapy in active RA patients. METHODS: RA patients with moderate to high disease activity were enrolled to receive add-on etanercept (25 mg subcutaneous injection, biweekly) for at least one year, combined with sustained treatment with conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). RESULTS: Forty patients received add-on etanercept and 15 received DMARDs alone. At the end of one year, etanercept significantly reduced the disease activity score of 28 joints, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Moreover, etanercept significantly increased the body weight, body mass index (BMI), as well as MCP-1 and NT levels, compared to that in the csDMARD-only group. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum MCP-1 and NT levels in RA patients with moderate to high disease activity, who underwent one-year etanercept treatment, might be attributed to increase in body weight and BMI rather than induction of more severe autoimmune inflammation.","Huang, Hsien-Hao; Chen, Liang-Yu; Chen, Kuan-Yang; Lee, Yu-Chi; Tsai, Chang-Youh; Chen, Chih-Yen",Neuropeptides,652,10

While single nucleotide polymorphisms (Y-SNPs) indicate distant evolutionary ancestry, short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) are able to identify close familial kinships. Detailed chrY analysis provides thus both biogeographical background information as paternal lineage identification. The rapid advancement of high-throughput massive parallel sequencing (MPS) technology in the past decade has revolutionized genetic research. Using MPS, single-base information of both Y-SNPs as Y-STRs can be analyzed in a single assay typing multiple samples at once. In this study, we present the first extensive chrY-specific targeted resequencing panel, the ‘CSYseq’, which simultaneously identifies slow mutating Y-SNPs as evolution markers and rapid mutating Y-STRs as patrilineage markers. The panel was validated by paired-end sequencing of 130 males, distributed over 65 deep-rooted pedigrees covering 1,279 generations. The CSYseq successfully targets 15,611 Y-SNPs including 9,014 phylogenetic informative Y-SNPs to identify 1,443 human evolutionary Y-subhaplogroup lineages worldwide. In addition, the CSYseq properly targets 202 Y-STRs, including 81 slow, 68 moderate, 27 fast and 26 rapid mutating Y-STRs to individualize close paternal relatives. The targeted chrY markers cover a high average number of reads (Y-SNP = 717, Y-STR = 150), easy interpretation, powerful discrimination capacity and chrY specificity. The CSYseq is interesting for research on different time scales: to identify evolutionary ancestry, to find distant family and to discriminate closely related males. Therefore, this panel serves as a unique tool valuable for a wide range of genetic-genealogical applications in interdisciplinary research within evolutionary, population, molecular, medical and forensic genetics.","Claerhout, Sofie; Verstraete, Paulien; Warnez, Liesbeth; Vanpaemel, Simon; Larmuseau, Maarten; Decorte, Ronny",PLoS Genet,652,12

Viruses interfere with many cell functions, particularly critical pathways for cell death, by affecting various intracellular mediators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a major example of these mediators because they are involved in many (if not most) cellular mechanisms. Virus-regulated miRNAs have been implicated in three cell death pathways, namely, apoptosis, autophagy, and anoikis. Several molecules (e.g., BECN1 and B cell lymphoma 2 [BCL2] family members) are involved in both apoptosis and autophagy, while activation of anoikis leads to cell death similar to apoptosis. These mechanistic similarities suggest that common regulators, including some miRNAs (e.g., miR-21 and miR-192), are involved in different cell death pathways. Because the balance between cell proliferation and cell death is pivotal to the homeostasis of the human body, miRNAs that regulate cell death pathways have drawn much attention from researchers. miR-21 is regulated by several viruses and can affect both apoptosis and anoikis via modulating various targets, such as PDCD4, PTEN, interleukin (IL)-12, Maspin, and Fas-L. miR-34 can be downregulated by viral infection and has different effects on apoptosis, depending on the type of virus and/or host cell. The present review summarizes the existing knowledge on virus-regulated miRNAs involved in the modulation of cell death pathways. Understanding the mechanisms for virus-mediated regulation of cell death pathways could provide valuable information to improve the diagnosis and treatment of many viral diseases.","Sadri Nahand, Javid; Shojaie, Layla; Akhlagh, Seyed Amirreza; Ebrahimi, Mohammad Saeid; Mirzaei, Hamid Reza; Bannazadeh Baghi, Hossein; Mahjoubin-Tehran, Maryam; Rezaei, Nima; Hamblin, Michael R.; Tajiknia, Vida; Rahimian, Neda; Mirzaei, Hamed",Mol Ther Nucleic Acids,652,26

Effect modification between DM and obesity was assessed with a statistical interaction term and an exploration of stratum‐specific effects. RESULTS: Out of 3,533 patients, a total of 1,134 (32%) had DM, 1,256 (36%) had obesity, and 430 (12%) had both.

A statistical trend for potential interaction between DM and obesity was observed (P = 0.20). Stratified analyses showed potential increased risk with obesity compared with normal weight among patients with DM (HR 1.34 [95% CI: 1.04‐1.74]) and patients without DM (HR 1.18 [95% CI: 0.96‐1.43]). CONCLUSIONS: DM and obesity are independent risk factors associated with COVID‐19 severity. Stratified analyses suggest that obesity may confer greater risk to patients with DM compared with patients without DM, and this relationship requires further exploration.","Tchang, Beverly G.; Askin, Gulce; Sahagun, Ageline; Hwang, Jonathan; Huang, Hao; Mendelsohn Curanaj, Felicia A.; Seley, Jane J.; Safford, Monika M.; Alonso, Laura C.; Aronne, Louis J.; Shukla, Alpana P.",Obesity (Silver Spring),652,20
