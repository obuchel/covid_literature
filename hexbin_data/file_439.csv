4336,Pregnancy-specific malarial immunity and risk of malaria in pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes: a systematic review,2020-01-16,"BACKGROUND: In endemic areas, pregnant women are highly susceptible to Plasmodium falciparum malaria characterized by the accumulation of parasitized red blood cells (pRBC) in the placenta. In subsequent pregnancies, women develop protective immunity to pregnancy-associated malaria and this has been hypothesized to be due to the acquisition of antibodies to the parasite variant surface antigen VAR2CSA. In this systematic review we provide the first synthesis of the association between antibodies to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and pregnancy and birth outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based studies (published up to 07 June 2019) of pregnant women living in P. falciparum endemic areas that examined antibody responses to pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens and outcomes including placental malaria, low birthweight, preterm birth, peripheral parasitaemia, maternal anaemia, and severe malaria. RESULTS: We searched 6 databases and identified 33 studies (30 from Africa) that met predetermined inclusion and quality criteria: 16 studies contributed estimates in a format enabling inclusion in meta-analysis and 17 were included in narrative form only. Estimates were mostly from cross-sectional data (10 studies) and were heterogeneous in terms of magnitude and direction of effect. Included studies varied in terms of antigens tested, methodology used to measure antibody responses, and epidemiological setting. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC and VAR2CSA antigens, measured at delivery, were associated with placental malaria (9 studies) and may therefore represent markers of infection, rather than correlates of protection. Antibody responses to pregnancy-specific pRBC, but not recombinant VAR2CSA antigens, were associated with trends towards protection from low birthweight (5 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst antibody responses to several antigens were positively associated with the presence of placental and peripheral infections, this review did not identify evidence that any specific antibody response is associated with protection from pregnancy-associated malaria across multiple populations. Further prospective cohort studies using standardized laboratory methods to examine responses to a broad range of antigens in different epidemiological settings and throughout the gestational period, will be necessary to identify and prioritize pregnancy-specific P. falciparum antigens to advance the development of vaccines and serosurveillance tools targeting pregnant women.","Cutts, Julia C.; Agius, Paul A.; Zaw Lin; Powell, Rosanna; Moore, Kerryn; Draper, Bridget; Simpson, Julie A.; Fowkes, Freya J.

4482,Risk factors for pneumonia and influenza hospitalizations in long-term care facility residents: a retrospective cohort study,2020-02-10,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed the results of a 3-year surveillance study on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of healthcare associated-infections (HAIs) in elderly inpatients in a large tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: Real-time surveillance was performed from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. All HAIs were identified by infection control practitioners and doctors. Inpatient data were collected with an automatic surveillance system. RESULTS: A total of 134,637 inpatients including 60,332 (44.8%) elderly ≥60 years were included. The overall incidence of HAI was 2.0%. The incidence of HAI in elderly patients was significantly higher than that in non-elderly patients (2.6% vs. 1.5%, χ(2) = 202.421, P < 0.01) and increased with age. The top five sites of HAIs in the elderly were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood stream, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and surgical site. The five most common pathogens detected in elderly HAI patients were Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the elderly was lower than in the non-elderly, catheter-associated urinary tract infections were more common in elderly patients, and the rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was similar between groups. The numbers of male patients and patients with comorbidities and special medical procedures (e.g., intensive care unit admission, cerebrovascular disease, brain neoplasms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignant tumor, malignant hematonosis, and osteoarthropathy) were significantly higher in the elderly group, but the number of patients who underwent surgery was lower. CONCLUSION: We observed a significantly higher overall incidence of HAI in elderly inpatients ≥60 compared to non-elderly inpatients < 60 years, but the trend was different for device-associated HAIs, which was attributed to the higher rates of comorbidities and special medical procedures in the elderly group. The main HAI sites in elderly inpatients were the lower respiratory tract, urinary tract, and bloodstream, and the main pathogens were gram-negative bacilli and Candida albicans.","Zhao, Xia; Wang, Lihong; Wei, Nan; Zhang, Jingli; Ma, Wenhui; Zhao, Huijie; Han, Xu",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7011547/,439

Therefore, intense searching of new leading structures and active substances, which may be used as new drugs, especially against strain resistant to all available therapeutics, is very important. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) has attracted a lot of attention as a molecular target for bacterial resistance over several decades, resulting in a number of useful agents. Trimethoprim (TMP), (2,4-diamino-5-(3′,4′,5′-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine) is the well-known dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor and one of the standard antibiotics used in urinary tract infections (UTIs). This review highlights advances in design, synthesis, and biological evaluations in structural modifications of TMP as DHFR inhibitors. In addition, this report presents the differences in the active site of human and pathogen DHFR. Moreover, an excellent review of DHFR inhibition and their relevance to antimicrobial and parasitic chemotherapy was presented.","Wróbel, Agnieszka; Arciszewska, Karolina; Maliszewski, Dawid; Drozdowska, Danuta",J Antibiot (Tokyo),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102388/,439

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in NASH. However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of B cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of NASH to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses. We also highlight the mechanisms affecting liver immune tolerance in the setting of steatohepatitis that favour lymphocyte activation. Finally, we analyse emerging evidence concerning the possible application of immune modulating treatments in NASH therapy.","Sutti, Salvatore; Albano, Emanuele",Nat Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222953/,439
11359,"The effect of balneotherapy on body mass index, adipokine levels, sleep disturbances, and quality of life of women with morbid obesity",2020-05-06,"Unconsented intimate exams (UIEs) on men and women are known to occur for training purposes and diagnostic reasons, mostly during gynecological surgeries but also during prostate examinations and abdominal surgeries. UIEs most often occur on anesthetized patients but have also been reported on conscious patients. Over the last 30 years, several parties—both within and external to medicine—have increasingly voiced opposition to these exams. Arguments from medical associations, legal scholars, ethicists, nurses, and some physicians have not compelled meaningful institutional change. Opposition is escalating in the form of legislative bans and whistleblower reports. Aspiring to professional and scientific detachment, institutional consent policies make no distinction between intimate exams and exams on any other body part, but patients do not think of their intimate regions in a detached or neutral way and believe intimate exams call for special protections. UIEs are found to contribute to moral erosion and moral distress of medical students and compromise the sacred trust between the medical community and the general public. This paper refutes the main arguments in favor of the status quo, identifies a series of harms related to continuing the current practice, and proposes an explicit consent policy for intimate exams along with specific changes to medical school curriculum and institutional culture. Because patients are the rights-holders of their bodies, consent practices should reflect and uphold patient values which call for explicit consent for intimate exams.","Bruce, Lori",HEC Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223770/,439
12573,Compartment syndrome of the hand as a complication of prolonged mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation,2020-03-02,"Nuclear RNAi provides a highly tractable system to study RNA-mediated chromatin changes and epigenetic inheritance. Recent studies have indicated that the regulation and function of nuclear RNAi-mediated heterochromatin are highly complex. Our knowledge of histone modifications and the corresponding histonemodifying enzymes involved in the system remains limited. In this study, we show that the heterochromatin mark, H3K23me3, is induced by nuclear RNAi at both exogenous and endogenous targets in C. elegans. In addition, dsRNA-induced H3K23me3 can persist for multiple generations after the dsRNA exposure has stopped. We demonstrate that the histone methyltransferase SET-32, methylates H3K23 in vitro. Both set-32 and the germline nuclear RNAi Argonaute, hrde-1, are required for nuclear RNAi-induced H3K23me3 in vivo. Our data poise H3K23me3 as an additional chromatin modification in the nuclear RNAi pathway and provides the field with a new target for uncovering the role of heterochromatin in transgenerational epigenetic silencing.","Schwartz-Orbach, Lianna; Zhang, Chenzhen; Sidoli, Simone; Amin, Richa; Kaur, Diljeet; Zhebrun, Anna; Ni, Julie; Gu, Sam G",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7431132/,439

Previous studies show that resveratrol binds and inhibits DNA polymerases and some other enzymes; however, the binding and functioning mechanisms remain unknown. The elucidated knowledge of inhibitory mechanisms of resveratrol will assist us in new drug discovery. We utilized molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to reveal how resveratrol and structurally similar compounds bind to various nucleotide-dependent enzymes, specifically, DNA polymerases, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and ribonucleotide reductase. The results show that resveratrol and its analogs exert their inhibitory effects by competing with the substrate dNTPs in these enzymes and blocking elongation of chain polymerization. In addition, the results imply that resveratrol binds to a variety of other ATP-/NTP-binding proteins.","Wu, Yifei; Hsieh, Tze-chen; Wu, Joseph M.; Wang, Xiaoxiao; Christopher, Joshua S.; Pham, Amanda H.; Swaby, Justin David-Li; Lou, Lei; Xie, Zhong-Ru",Biomolecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7563984/,439
14706,Compromised Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue is a Risk Factor for Postoperative Septic Complications in HIV-Seropositive Trauma Patients,2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Accidents and the resulting injuries are among the world’s biggest health care issues, often causing long-term effects on psychological and physical health. With regard to psychological consequences, accidents can cause a wide range of burdens including adjustment problems. Although adjustment problems are among the most frequent mental health problems, there are few specific interventions available. The newly developed program SelFIT (German acronym: Selber wieder fit nach einem Unfall; “fit again after an accident”) aims to remedy this situation by offering a low-threshold, web-based self-help intervention for psychological distress after an accident. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the SelFIT program plus care as usual (CAU) compared to only CAU. Furthermore, the program’s user-friendliness, acceptance, and adherence are assessed. We expect that the use of SelFIT will be associated with a greater reduction in psychological distress, greater improvement in mental and physical well-being, and greater cost-effectiveness compared to CAU. METHODS: Adults (n=240) experiencing adjustment problems due to an accident they had between 2 weeks and 2 years before entering the study will be randomized into either the intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group receive direct access to SelFIT. The control group receives access to the program after 12 weeks. There are 6 measurement points for both groups (baseline as well as after 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 weeks). The main outcome is a reduction in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms that indicate adjustment problems. Secondary outcomes include well-being, optimism, embitterment, self-esteem, self-efficacy, emotion regulation, pain, costs of health care consumption, and productivity loss, as well as the program’s adherence, acceptance, and user-friendliness. RESULTS: Recruitment began in December 2019 and will continue at least until January 2021, with the option to extend this for another 6 months until July 2021. As of July 2020, 324 people have shown interest in participating, and 48 people have given their informed consent. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study examining a web-based self-help program designed to treat adjustment problems resulting from an accident. If effective, the program could complement the still limited offerings for secondary and tertiary prevention of psychological distress after an accident.

This manuscript outlines the protocol for a process evaluation embedded in a cluster randomised trial of a digital depression prevention intervention delivered to secondary school students (the Future Proofing Study). The purpose is to describe the methods that will be used to capture process evaluation data within this trial. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a hybrid type 1 design, a mixed-methods approach will be used with data collected in the intervention arm of the Future Proofing Study. Data collection methods will include semistructured interviews with school staff and study facilitators, automatically collected intervention usage data and participant questionnaires (completed by school staff, school counsellors, study facilitators and students). Information will be collected about: (1) how the intervention was implemented in schools, including fidelity; (2) school contextual factors and their association with intervention reach, uptake and acceptability; (3) how school staff, study facilitators and students responded to delivering or completing the intervention. How these factors relate to trial effectiveness outcomes will also be assessed. Overall synthesis of the data will provide school cluster-level and individual-level process outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of New South Wales (NSW) Human Research Ethics Committee (HC180836; 21st January 2019) and the NSW Government State Education Research Applications Process (SERAP 2019201; 19th August 2019). Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and discussed at conferences. Our process evaluation will contextualise the trial findings with respect to how the intervention may have worked in some schools but not in others. This evaluation will inform the development of a model for rolling out digital interventions for the prevention of mental illness in schools.

NO(2), SO(2), CO and O(3) were considered the main components of pollution that affected the health of people; thus, various joint regression models were built to reveal the causal direction from these individual pollutants to PM(2.5) concentrations. In this causal centrality analysis, Beijing was the most important area in the Jing-Jin-Ji region because of its developed economy and large population. Pollutants in Beijing and peripheral cities were studied. The results showed that NO(2) pollutants play a vital role in the PM(2.5) concentrations in Beijing and its surrounding areas. An obvious causality direction and betweenness centrality were observed in the northern cities compared with others, demonstrating the fact that the more developed cities were most seriously polluted. Superior performance with causal centrality characteristics in the recognition of PM(2.5) concentrations has been achieved.","Wang, Bocheng",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997926/,439

In this observational cohort study, we evaluated a CT-based assessment of the adipose tissue distribution as a potential non-invasive prognostic parameter in critical illness. METHODS: Routine CT-scans upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) were used to analyze the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue areas at the 3(rd) lumbar vertebra in 155 patients. Results were correlated with various prognostic markers and both short-term- and overall survival. Multiple statistical tools were used for data analysis. RESULTS: We observed a significantly larger visceral adipose tissue area in septic patients compared to non-sepsis patients. Interestingly, patients requiring mechanical ventilation had a significantly higher amount of visceral adipose tissue correlating with the duration of mechanical ventilation. Moreover, both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue area significantly correlated with several laboratory markers. While neither the visceral nor the subcutaneous adipose tissue area was predictive for short-term ICU survival, patients with a visceral adipose tissue area above the optimal cut-off (241.4 cm(2)) had a significantly impaired overall survival compared to patients with a lower visceral adipose tissue area. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports a prognostic role of the individual adipose tissue distribution in critically ill patients. However, additional investigations need to confirm our suggestion that routine CT-based assessment of adipose tissue distribution can be used to yield further information on the patients’ clinical course. Moreover, future studies should address functional and metabolic analysis of different adipose tissue compartments in critical illness.","Wirtz, Theresa H.; Loosen, Sven H.; Schulze-Hagen, Maximilian; Weiskirchen, Ralf; Buendgens, Lukas; Abu Jhaisha, Samira; Brozat, Jonathan F.; Puengel, Tobias; Vucur, Mihael; Paffenholz, Pia; Kuhl, Christiane; Tacke, Frank; Trautwein, Christian; Luedde, Tom; Roderburg, Christoph; Koch, Alexander",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8051769/,439
17154,Does Liberal Prehospital and In-Hospital Tranexamic Acid Influence Outcome in Severely Injured Patients? A Prospective Cohort Study,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: South Africa is marked by high rates of both HIV and alcohol use, and there is a detrimental synergistic relationship between these two epidemics. The Institute of Medicine recommends integrated care for alcohol use treatment and HIV, but implementation of integrated services remains a challenge in South Africa. This protocol describes a study designed to evaluate trainer, provider-, and patient encounter-level outcomes relating to the national rollout of a cascade train-the-trainer model of task-sharing to build capacity of the HIV workforce to deliver Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to address risky alcohol use. METHODS: This 5 year protocol consists of two phases. First, we will finalize development of a robust SBIRT train-the-trainer model, which will include an SBIRT Trainer Manual, Provider Resource Guide, fidelity observational coding system, case vignettes, and a curriculum for ongoing consultation sessions. Materials will be designed to build the capacity of novice trainers to train lay workers to deliver SBIRT with fidelity. Second, we will recruit 24–36 trainers and 900 providers in order to evaluate the effects of the SBIRT train-the-trainer model on trainer- (e.g., fidelity, knowledge), provider- (e.g., SBIRT attitudes, confidence, acceptability), and patient encounter- (e.g., proportion receiving screening, brief intervention, referral to treatment) level variables. Data on patient encounters will be tracked by providers on programmed tablets or scannable paper forms in real-time. Providers will report on SBIRT delivery on an ongoing basis over a 6-months period. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that trainer-level factors will account for a substantial proportion of variability in provider-level factors which will, in turn, account for a substantial proportion of variability in patient encounter-level outcomes. DISCUSSION: This protocol will allow us to take advantage of a unique national training initiative to gather comprehensive data on multi-level factors associated with the implementation of SBIRT in HIV service settings. In the long-term, this research can help to advance the implementation of integrated alcohol-HIV services, providing lessons that can extend to other low-and-middle income countries confronting dual epidemics.","Kuo, Caroline C.; Sibeko, Goodman; Akande, Morayo; Allie, Shaheema; Tisaker, Nurain; Stein, Dan J.; Becker, Sara J.",Addict Sci Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8085637/,439
18450,Prevalence and risk factors of preoperative deep venous thrombosis in closed patella fracture: a prospective cohort study,2021-06-23,"The immune response is hypothesized as an important factor in the disease outcome of leptospirosis. Exaggerated immune response may promote tissue damage that lead to severe disease outcome. In this study TNF, IL-10, sTNFR1 levels were measured among sixty-two hospitalized leptospirosis confirmed patients in Sri Lanka. Thirty-one serum samples from healthy individuals were obtained as controls. PCR–RFLP method was used to identify TNF gene polymorphisms and to determine their association with TNF expression and disease severity in leptospirosis. TNF (p = 0.0022) and IL-10 (p < 0.0001) were found to be significantly elevated in leptospirosis patients, while sTNFR1 (p < 0.0001) was significantly suppressed. TNF was not significantly elevated in patients with complications while the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was significantly elevated among patients with complications (p = 0.0011) and with mortality (p = 0.0088). The ratio of IL-10 to TNF was higher among patients with complications (p = 0.0008) and in fatal cases (p = 0.0179). No association between TNF gene polymorphisms and TNF expression was detected due to the low frequency of heterozygous and mutated genes present in this study population. Thus the findings of the study show that elevated levels of IL-10 in the acute phase of disease could lead to severe outcomes and a high IL-10/TNF ratio is observed in patients with complications due to leptospirosis.","Nisansala, Thilini; Weerasekera, Manjula; Ranasinghe, Nilantha; Marasinghe, Chamil; Gamage, Chandika; Fernando, Neluka; Gunasekara, Chinthika",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8221277/,439

This work discusses important determinants for parents of implementing a meat reduced diet for their children. A questionnaire was conducted with 90 parents of children aged 5–8 years living in Germany, where they had to choose one out of three options of a dish, namely meaty, reduced meat and no meat, for their child. The results show that the parent’s attachment to meat and the associated attitudes and habits play a crucial role in their meal choice and therefore eating behaviour, including consumed amounts of meat, of their child. Moreover, perceived tastiness, healthiness and balanced serving style, as well as the child’s preferences influences the parent’s decision. The findings of this work provide valuable insights to the food industry and food producers, health professionals and public health, as it highlights the background, as well as some drivers and barriers for parents choosing a dish with less meat for their children.","Erhardt, Julia; Olsen, Annemarie",Foods,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393896/,439
21362,Characteristics and Quality of National Cardiac Registries: A Systematic Review,2021-09-22,"Considerable clinical evidence supports that increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is linked to immune extravasation of CNS parenchyma during neuroinflammation. Although BBB permeability and immune extravasation are known to be provoked by vascular endothelial growth factor-A (i.e., VEGF-A) and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), respectively, the mechanisms that link both processes are still elusive. The interleukin-20 (i.e., IL-20) cytokine signaling pathway was previously implicated in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and is known to induce cellular response by way of signaling through IL-20 receptor subunit β (i.e., IL-20RB). Dysregulated IL-20 signaling is implicated in many inflammatory pathologies, but it’s contribution to neuroinflammation has yet to be reported. We hypothesize that the IL-20 cytokine, and the IL cytokine subfamily more broadly, play a key role in CNS neuroinflammation by signaling through IL-20RB, induce VEGF activity, and enhance both BBB-permeability and CXCL12-mediated immune extravasation. To address this hypothesis, we actively immunized IL-20RB(–/–) mice and wild-type mice to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and found that IL-20RB(–/–) mice showed amelioration of disease progression compared to wild-type mice. Similarly, we passively immunized IL-20RB(–/–) mice and wild-type mice with myelin-reactive Th1 cells from either IL-20RB(–/–) and wild-type genotype. Host IL-20RB(–/–) mice showed lesser disease progression than wild-type mice, regardless of the myelin-reactive Th1 cells genotype. Using multianalyte bead-based immunoassay and ELISA, we found distinctive changes in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines between IL-20RB(–/–) mice and wild-type mice at peak of EAE. We also found detectable levels of all cytokines of the IL-20 subfamily within CNS tissues and specific alteration to IL-20 subfamily cytokines IL-19, IL-20, and IL-24, expression levels. Immunolabeling of CNS region-specific microvessels confirmed IL-20RB protein at the spinal cord microvasculature and upregulation during EAE. Microvessels isolated from macaques CNS tissues also expressed IL-20RB. Moreover, we identified the expression of all IL-20 receptor subunits: IL-22 receptor subunit α-1 (IL-22RA1), IL-20RB, and IL-20 receptor subunit α (IL-20RA) in human CNS microvessels. Notably, human cerebral microvasculature endothelial cells (HCMEC/D3) treated with IL-1β showed augmented expression of the IL-20 receptor. Lastly, IL-20-treated HCMEC/D3 showed alterations on CXCL12 apicobasal polarity consistent with a neuroinflammatory status. This evidence suggests that IL-20 subfamily cytokines may signal at the BBB via IL-20RB, triggering neuroinflammation.","Dayton, Jacquelyn R.; Yuan, Yinyu; Pacumio, Lisa P.; Dorflinger, Bryce G.; Yoo, Samantha C.; Olson, Mariah J.; Hernández-Suárez, Sara I.; McMahon, Moira M.; Cruz-Orengo, Lillian",Front Cell Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8452993/,439
21363,American Heart Association Precision Medicine Platform Addresses Challenges in Data Sharing,2021-08-30,"BACKGROUND: South Africa faces a heavy burden of disease, which impacts resource allocation. The needs of South Africa require efficient translation into pharmaceutical expenditure for medicine provision, to ensure availability of medicines. Given that South Africa faces various challenges with medicine provision accompanied by rising pharmaceutical expenditure, this study aimed to report on the considerations and methods used to determine the healthcare budget for South Africa, and how it is translated into pharmaceutical expenditure for medicines provision on the Standard Treatment Guidelines and Essential Medicines List and non-essential medicines in the public sector. METHOD: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews guided by a discussion guide were conducted with seven pharmaceutical officials involved in the budget and resource allocation process, between October 2019 and March 2020. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Once the interviews were coded by the first author they were verified by the other authors. Data were thematically analysed. RESULTS: This study depicted the knowledge and participation of pharmaceutical services in the budget process. The National and Provincial Department of Health have improved pharmaceutical budgeting by making strides towards a collaborative, informed, and more evidence-based approach. Pharmaceutical services have roles in advising on requirements; commenting where necessary, constantly monitor and taking accountability for their budget. The main considerations that determined the budget included population size and growth, historical expenditure, the extra heavy burden of disease and incidence rate, demand data and forecasting. The local and provincial pharmacy and therapeutics committee play a vital role in monitoring the budget and expenditure; ensuring adherence to guidelines; controlling the extent to which non-Essential Medicine List items are used and advising accordingly. CONCLUSION: This was the first study to report on the decision and thought processes of the healthcare budget and its translation into pharmaceutical expenditure for medicine provision in South Africa. Many factors were considered to inform the budget, with the Standard Treatment Guideline and Essential Medicines List being the principal guide for medicine provision. This process was well-controlled and monitored by the pharmaceutical therapeutics committee. Documenting the South African experience can assist other countries in their budget decisions for medicines.","Moodley, Lirosha; Suleman, Fatima; Perumal-Pillay, Velisha Ann",J Pharm Policy Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8453029/,439

Humans infected by Chlamydia psittaci may suffer from unapparent subclinical infection, with symptoms ranging from mild flulike illness to severe SARS. As a typical animal-based infectious disease, psittacosis rarely has pulmonary signs but a long illness course, despite its clinical manifestation characterized by severe pulmonary lesions. Repeated onsets of psittacosis may lead to chronic diseases.","Mi, Haifeng; Li, Hongjun; Yu, Jianan",Radiology of Infectious Diseases: Volume 2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120594/,439

A disruption within any one of these systems or a change in the relationship between systems can result in impairments of ventilation, perfusion, or gas exchange. These disruptions can result in debilitating acute and chronic respiratory disorders. This chapter discusses the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, management, and notable public health implications of respiratory system disorders not addressed in prior chapters. Topic areas covered include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary hypertension, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, atelectasis, and pulmonary sarcoidosis.","Howlett, Bethany M.; Coleman, George C.; Hoffman, Richard H.; Lustig, Michael R.; King, John G.; Marsland, David W.",Family Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121868/,439
29191,Behavior of Single Cats and Groups in the Home,2009-05-15,"This paper offers an account of the recent economic slowdown in the growth trajectory formerly enjoyed by South Korea as one of the first “Asian Tigers”. Indicators are provided that, unlike the others, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan that have continued their upward profile, South Korea has stagnated. It is argued that the others and some more recent Asian growth economies have moved upwards to higher value, high skill and high profitability levels and deindustrialising as they did so. This even applies to recent breakthrough economies like China and Vietnam. In each case, “financialization” has been an important element in the growth of the Quaternary economy, even in such relative newcomers as Vietnam, where privatization of services has attracted private equity and other foreign direct investment financiers. Thus manufacturing is less pronounced than it was. Meanwhile, South Korea has a weak international presence of banks and other financial sectors because of the domestic focus in its indigenous growth model. Other weaknesses of closed versus open innovation and “cronyism” at the behest of the Chaebol system can be laid at the door of South Korea’s traditional conglomerates. A different model of “thin globalisation” led by knowledge-intensive high-tech, biotech and cleantech with prodigious financialization is characteristic of the new fast-growth regions and countries elsewhere, notably Israel, Silicon Valley and Cambridge. Here flattened hierarchies, reliable networking, and “crossover” innovation are pronounced and from which South Korean industrialists and policymakers could usefully learn to recover past growth performance.","Cooke, Philip",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149171/,439

30295,Disorders of the Gastrointestinal System,2009-05-18,"Bioterrorism is defined as the deliberate and malicious deployment of microbial agents or their toxins as weapons in a non-combat setting, represents perhaps the most overt example of human behavior impacting epidemic infectious diseases. There is historical precedent for the use of biological agents against both military and civilian populations. The use of biological (and chemical) agents as weapons of war has been well documented. The German biological warfare program during World War I included covert infections of Allied livestock with anthrax and glanders. The Japanese army began conducting experiments on the effects of bacterial agents of biowarfare on Chinese prisoners in occupied Manchuria in 1932 at their infamous Unit 731. The United States began its own offensive biological weapons program in 1942 and, during its 28-year official existence, weaponized and stockpiled lethal biological agents, such as anthrax, as well as incapacitating agents, such as the etiologic agent of Q fever. There are some recent examples of bioterrorism, though not necessarily resulting in attacks causing morbidity or mortality, may serve as harbingers of future events. Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq developed and deployed anthrax and botulinum-laden warheads in the years leading up to the Gulf War. The reasons that these weapons were never used in an actual attack probably had more to do with the implicit threat of overwhelming US retaliation and Iraqi technological deficiencies rather than the regime's reluctance to violate any moral principles. Biological agents have also been used to forward political ideologies: in 1984 a religious cult, intent on influencing voter turnout during a local election, contaminated restaurant salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon.","Artenstein, Andrew W.; Martin, Troy",The Social Ecology of Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155594/,439

In the agriculture and food sector, several hundred thousand restaurant workers have lost their jobs. The rise in unemployment, the closing of restaurants and schools, and social distancing have triggered demand reductions for certain commodities and foods and demand increases for others, bringing along changes in demand for inputs including labour. Canadian employers of temporary foreign workers (TFWs) are facing delays and additional constraints in recruiting, but so have US and European employers of TFWs.

Liver failure is defined as serious damage to the liver cause by a variety of etiologies, leading to liver function disorder or even decompensation, and clinical syndromes with coagulopathy, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, and ascites. 2. Severe hepatitis B can be indicated pathologically by apparent hepatocellular necrosis, including extensive multifocal, confluent, bridging, sub-massive or massive necrosis. 3. Laboratory tests during the course of severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B can reflect pathological changes and liver function in a timely manner, providing objective and informative reference data for evaluation of disease severity and treatment efficacy. Among the most important laboratory tests are those for prothrombin activity, international normalized ratio, and increases in total bilirubin concentration. 4. Severe hepatitis B is associated with interactions between the virus and host factors. Detection of HBV DNA, HBV genotype, quasispecies and HBV mutation can provide important theoretical bases for the prevention, control or mitigation of the progress of severe hepatitis B. 5. Noninvasive imaging modalities can be used to visualize the entire liver and parts of it. Measuring liver volume to evaluate liver size and liver reserve capacity is regarded as important in diagnosis, surgical approach and prognostic evaluation of patients with severe exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B and liver failure. 6. Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is the first quantitative method developed to assess whether a patient with liver failure requires a liver transplant. The predictive value of the MELD model has been improved by the MELD-Na, iMELD, and MESO models. Several other valuable prognostic models have been developed. For example, for patients with HBV-ACLF, the established TPPM scoring system was found to be more predictive than MELD score.","Peng, Liang; Gao, Zhi-Liang; Wang, Yu-Ming; He, Deng-Ming; Zhao, Jing-Ming; Bai, Xue-Fan; Wang, Xiao-Jing",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418529/,439

The virtual lab practical was administered in the course LMS and implemented video, data analysis, and multiple-choice questions. Average student scores and grade distributions were comparable across in-person and virtual lab practical formats. Instructors observed fewer grading concerns for the virtual practical compared to previous in-person offerings. The virtual lab practical may be preferred over in-person lab practical in future offerings due to decreased student stress, lower cost, reduced required instructor time, and limited availability of equipment. Resources developed for the virtual practical, including video tutorials and a hemocytometer simulator to practice calculations, can be used by other educators and as supplements to existing course material.

38886,Incidental whole-body MRI evidence of COVID-19 in an asymptomatic patient in a high prevalence region,2020-09-09,"The centenary of Freud’s Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Freud, 1920a/1955) falls in 2020, a year dominated globally by the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the effects of the pandemic has been to reveal the increasingly fragile interconnectedness of human and non-human life, as well as the ongoing effects of social inequalities, particularly racism, on the valuing of life and its flourishing. Drawing on earlier work, this paper develops the notion of a ‘maternal death drive’ that supplements Freud’s death drive by accounting for repetition that retains a relation to the developmental time of ‘life’ but remains ‘otherwise’ to a life drive. The temporal form of this ‘life in death’ is that of ‘dynamic chronicity’, analogous to late modern narratives that describe the present as ‘thin’ and the time of human futurity as running out. I argue that the urgency to act on the present in the name of the future is simultaneously ‘suspended’ by the repetitions of late capitalism, leading to a temporal hiatus that must be embraced rather than simply lamented. The maternal (death drive) alerts us to a new figure of a child whose task is to carry expectations and anxieties about the future and bind them into a reproductive present. Rather than seeing the child as a figure of normativity, I turn to Greta Thunberg to signal a way to go on in suspended ‘grey’ time.","Baraitser, Lisa",Psychoanal Cult Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7472396/,439

As collections experts, museums are leading the charge to document, collect, and interpret our current circumstances as they unfold in real time, relying more than ever on public participation and crowd-sourcing. A key development in such rapid-response collecting has been the interest in and solicitation of contributions that document the current crisis. Yet, initiatives that target young people remain few and far between, and often reproduce romanticized and reified understandings of children and childhood that reflect a longer history of excluding children’s voices from museum collections and society at large. This paper will explore museums’ collection of children’s culture in various forms with attention to the epistemological and ethical challenges that such initiatives entail. We argue that children are crucial citizens whose knowledge, perspectives, and experiences must be collected and preserved during this historic moment and beyond, in ways that attend to the particular circumstances they face as multiply marginalized museum constituents and members of society.","Patterson, Monica Eileen; Friend, Rebecca",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7736709/,439

METHODS: Time-loss injuries and illnesses, alongside match and training exposure, were collected across 8 seasons (2012–2020) in youth (U15, U16, U17, U18, U19) and senior (U20, U21, U23, senior) English men’s and women’s international teams. Analysis of incidence, burden, and severity of injury and illness was completed. Sex-specific comparisons were made between the senior and youth groups, and across the 8 seasons of data collection. RESULTS: In men’s international football, 535 injuries were recorded (216 senior; 319 youth) during 73,326 h of exposure. Overall, match injury incidence (31.1 ± 10.8 injuries/1000 h) and burden (454.0 ± 195.9 d absent/1000 h) were greater than training injury incidence (4.0 ± 1.0 injuries/1000 h) and burden (51.0 ± 21.8 d absent/1000 h) (both P < 0.001). In women’s international football, 503 injuries were recorded (senior: 177; youth: 326) during 80,766 h of exposure and match injury incidence (27.6 ± 11.3 injuries/1000 h) and burden (506.7 ± 350.2 days absent/1000 h) were greater than training injury incidence (5.1 ± 1.8 injuries/1000 h) and burden (87.6 ± 32.8 days absent/1000 h) (both P < 0.001). In women’s international football, a group × season interaction was observed for training injury incidence (P = 0.021), with the senior group recording a greater training injury incidence during the 2015–2016 season compared to the youth group (14.4 vs 5.7 injuries/1000 h; P = 0.022). There was no difference in injury severity between match and training for men’s (P = 0.965) and women’s (P = 0.064) international football. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a comprehensive examination of injury and illness in English men’s and women’s senior and youth international football.

Beginning with direct democracy, enhancing the direct participation of people as in Switzerland—considered revolutionary in the nineteenth century—may still be regarded a progressive form of democracy. But are increased political rights, offering the people not only a voice in electing their representatives but also a chance to decide major decisions directly, really an efficient way to improve democracy? The second perspective deals with federalism. Traditionally understood as a means for the vertical division of power within states, can it also play a role for the supranational division of power and the participation of minorities? The last section places political power-sharing in a context of conflict resolution, especially in multicultural societies. The chapter ends by stressing that power-sharing is not just an institutional arrangement, but that it also has to be based on the specific culture of a society that intends to practice it.","Linder, Wolf; Mueller, Sean",Swiss Democracy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7816081/,439

The search for the cause can be difficult and necessitates the special attention of an experienced general pediatrician in collaboration with specialists in pediatric infectious diseases, rheumatic diseases and oncology, nursing personnel, radiologists and others. In approximately half of the cases an infectious cause is finally found; other causes are primarily inflammatory, malignant and noninflammatory diseases. Individual causes with the imminent threat of a severe course should be treated immediately. For the other cases the diagnostic evaluation is paramount, which is wisely planned and executed with determination and openness. The patient history, physical examination, laboratory and device-based diagnostics, imaging and histological examinations can contribute to the final diagnosis. The parents must be escorted through a period of uncertainty and the child should be comforted wherever possible. Spontaneous recovery is also possible. The probatory administration of antibiotics rarely leads to an improvement. After extensive exclusion of infections and malignancies and increasing suffering from the fever itself, prescription of glucocorticoids may be justified in cases of high inflammatory activity, under the suspicion of a hyperergic state and after detailed informed consent. The management of fever of unknown origin is one of the greatest challenges in pediatrics.","Huppertz, Hans-Iko",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7950420/,439

However, most of the current methods exhibited high false‐negative rates, resulting in patient misdiagnosis and impeding early treatment. Nanoparticles show promising performance and great potential to serve as a platform for diagnosing viral infection in a short time and with high sensitivity. This review highlighted the potential of nanoparticles as platforms for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Nanoparticles such as gold nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, and graphene (G) were applied to detect SARS-CoV 2. They have been used for molecular-based diagnosis methods and serological methods. Nanoparticles improved specificity and shorten the time required for the diagnosis. They may be implemented into small devices that facilitate the self-diagnosis at home or in places such as airports and shops. Nanoparticles-based methods can be used for the analysis of virus-contaminated samples from a patient, surface, and air. The advantages and challenges were discussed to introduce useful information for designing a sensitive, fast, and low-cost diagnostic method.

52406,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes Among COVID 19 Hospitalized Patients in a Community Hospital in New York City,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: Variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII) is a cornerstone treatment for controlling elevated blood glucose (BG) in inpatients who are missing meals, and/or have a critical illness. VRIII can cause serious harm to patients if used incorrectly. Traditional approaches to improving safety have focused on identifying errors, then finding solutions to prevent future recurrence. Such approaches fail to fully take into account the complex adaptive nature of healthcare systems, which cannot be controlled solely by standards or procedures. The Resilient Health Care (RHC) approach proposes that understanding the variability in healthcare practitioners’ everyday work e.g. a physical and cognitive activity directed toward achieving a specific goal, is key to enhancing patient safety (1). There are a considerable number of studies on using RHC to enhance safety, however, no studies to date have researched resilience in the use of VRIII. AIM: This study sought to comprehensively understand, within a RHC framework, how VRIIIs are used in the clinical environment. METHODS: A qualitative observational study was conducted in a Vascular Surgery Unit. A purposive sample of two inpatients and all healthcare practitioners caring for VRIII aspects for these patients were recruited. The researcher video-recorded healthcare practitioners while prescribing, administering and monitoring VRIII. The video data were then transcribed and inductively coded to construct a deep understanding of the use of VRIII. A hierarchical task analysis (HTA) which is a core human factors approach (2) was used to represent the actual task for the use of VRIII. RESULTS: Twenty-two hours of video recordings of 10 healthcare practitioners were used to develop the final HTA with a top-level goal of controlling elevated BG using VRIII. The HTA clearly illustrated the complexity of using VRIIIs by highlighting more than 100 practical activities to achieve the goal. The observed challenges were mainly related to lack of knowledge e.g. the co-prescription of appropriate concurrent IV fluids, and system and technology problems e.g. the need for frequent BG monitoring. The analysis of the video data identified various strategies that healthcare practitioners used to respond to variability in work including knowledge, standardising practice e.g. the using of ready-to administer insulin infusions, and context-dependent adaptations including asking available colleagues to countersign administration and assigning the monitoring task to other staff when the nurses were busy. Most of the observed adaptations had positive outcomes in terms of patient care delivery. CONCLUSION: This study was the first to have explored how ‘work is done’ in reference to the use of VRIII using HTA. The study was limited by time, the Covid-19 pandemic and number of participants. However, the developed HTA provided detailed tasks and, by highlighting when and how adaptations were used, systematically presented the process as it was actually done. Future work will focus on using the data from this study to model RHC in the use of VRIII in a way that allows the study site to better enhance patient safety. REFERENCES: 1.

While such programs are commonly available to undergraduates, there is a growing need for career support to be offered to graduate students. Making the case for resources can be a challenge in this domain, however. Research on the impact of career services for graduate students and post-doctoral scholars is a growing scholarly concern. However, there remains a need to better understand what level of intervention is most appropriate: What kind of activities, how much time, and what resources would best serve the professional development needs of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars? And to answer these questions, a more foundational one: what activities are drawing the attention of graduate students and post doctoral trainees, and in what activities are they spending their time? In this manuscript, we describe how Our University approached this research question by developing an online data tracking system to capture graduate and post-doctoral trainee participation in one co-curricular professional development program. We demonstrate how this data tracking system can be used to advocate for institutional resources in career development programming, for research, and for practical purposes such as advocating for institutional support and for program design and assessment.","Rojewski, Julie M.

54037,Food Shopping Experiences Among Dollar Store Shoppers in Fresno and Boston During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND: Metacarpal fractures, one of the most prevalent upper limb fractures, account for 10% of all bony injuries. OBJECTIVE: Our systematic review aimed to review, appraise and collate available evidence on hand rehabilitation programmes for the management of second to fifth metacarpal fractures in an adult human population after conservative and surgical management. Since 2008, no review on a similar topic has been performed, thus informing clinical practice for physiotherapists and occupational therapists. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) principles guided the reporting. Experimental, quasi-experimental, cohort and case–control studies between January 2008 and September 2018 were included. Searches were conducted on Medline, Academic Search Ultimate, CINAHL, CAB Abstracts, Health Source – Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, SPORTDiscus, Africa-Wide Information and MasterFILE Premier, Web-of-Science and Scopus. Screening, selection, appraisal and data extraction were independently performed by two reviewers. No meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 1015 sources were identified, 525 duplicates removed and 514 excluded. Three articles were included in the final data extraction: one randomised controlled trial (RCT) and two observational studies. CONCLUSION: Limited evidence is available that a well-designed, well-implemented home-based exercise programme results in statistically significant improved hand function (p ˂ 0.0001) and digital total active motion (TAM) (p = 0.013) compared with traditional physiotherapy (PT) post-surgically. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Our study contributes to the knowledge base of hand rehabilitation after an individual sustained a second to fifth metacarpal fracture. The authors identified a gap where future studies should further investigate the effect of hand rehabilitation after conservative and surgical management.","Keller, Monique M.; Barnes, Roline; Brandt, Corlia; Hepworth, Lauren M.",S Afr J Physiother,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8182452/,439

54943,An outbreak of infective endocarditis during the COVID-19 pandemic? - an observational retrospective single centre study,2021-04-26,"Ending hunger and alleviating poverty are key goals for a sustainable future. Food security is a constant challenge for agrarian communities in low-income countries, especially in Madagascar. We investigated agricultural practices, household characteristics, and food security in northeast Madagascar. We tested whether agricultural practices, demographics, and socioeconomics in rural populations were related to food security. Over 70% of respondents reported times during the last three years during which food for the household was insufficient, and the most frequently reported cause was small land size (57%). The probability of food insecurity decreased with increasing vanilla yield, rice yield, and land size. There was an interaction effect between land size and household size; larger families with smaller land holdings had higher food insecurity, while larger families with larger land had lower food insecurity. Other socioeconomic and agricultural variables were not significantly related to food insecurity, including material wealth, education, crop diversity, and livestock ownership. Our results highlight the high levels of food insecurity in these communities and point to interventions that would alleviate food stress. In particular, because current crop and livestock diversity were low, agricultural diversification could improve outputs and mitigate food insecurity. Development of sustainable agricultural intensification, including improving rice and vanilla cultivation to raise yields on small land areas, would likely have positive impacts on food security and alleviating poverty. Increasing market access and off-farm income, as well as improving policies related to land tenure could also play valuable roles in mitigating challenges in food security.

We determined the analyte concentrations (1) immediately after blood collection (baseline); (2) after storage of citrated whole blood (agitated) at room temperature and citrated plasma at room temperature and at 4 °C for 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively; and (3) after storage of citrated plasma at -20 °C for 30, 60, and 90 days. According to the concept of acceptable change limits (ACL), analytes were considered stable if the mean relative analyte recovery at a given time was >78%. The mean baseline values (range) of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban were 115 ng/mL (62-217), 129 ng/mL (31-215), 156 ng/mL (49-362), and 101 ng/mL (33-283), respectively. After applying the analyte stability limit, all four DOACs were stable for 24 h at room temperature and at 4 °C. The mean recovery after 24 h was 102-111% for dabigatran, 88-97% for rivaroxaban, 95-98% for apixaban, and 90-96% for edoxaban. When plasma samples were stored at -20 °C, the mean percentage deviation after 90 days for all four DOACs was ≤10%, even after three freeze-thaw cycles. Thus, for the correct determination of DOAC plasma concentrations, blood samples do not have to be analyzed immediately and can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 h before analysis. In clinical practice, blood sample transport and storage for DOAC measurements appear to be unproblematic.","Thuile, Katharina; Giacomuzzi, Katia; Jani, Erika; Marschang, Peter; Mueller, Thomas",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,https://doi.org/10.1080/00365513.2021.1946844; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34278897/,439
60441,Body Mass Index as a Risk Factor for Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York.,2020-10-31,"BACKGROUND Endotheliopathy is a key element in COVID-19 pathophysiology, contributing to both morbidity and mortality. Biomarkers distinguishing different COVID-19 phenotypes from sepsis syndrome remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To characterize circulating biomarkers of endothelial damage in different COVID-19 clinical disease stages compared with sepsis syndrome and normal volunteers. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 49) were classified into moderate, severe, or critical (life-threatening) disease. Plasma samples were collected within 48 to 72 h of hospitalization to analyze endothelial activation markers, including sVCAM-1, von Willebrand Factor (VWF), ADAMTS-13 activity, thrombomodulin (TM), and soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI); heparan sulfate (HS) for endothelial glycocalyx degradation; C5b9 deposits on endothelial cells in culture and soluble C5b9 for complement activation; circulating dsDNA for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) presence, and α2-antiplasmin and PAI-1 as parameters of fibrinolysis. We compared the level of each biomarker in all three COVID-19 groups and healthy donors as controls (n = 45). Results in critically ill COVID-19 patients were compared with other intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock (SS, n = 14), sepsis (S, n = 7), and noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS, n = 7). RESULTS All analyzed biomarkers were increased in COVID-19 patients versus controls (P < 0.001), except for ADAMTS-13 activity that was normal in both groups. The increased expression of sVCAM-1, VWF, sTNFRI, and HS was related to COVID-19 disease severity (P < 0.05). Several differences in these parameters were found between ICU groups: SS patients showed significantly higher levels of VWF, TM, sTNFRI, and NETS compared with critical COVID-19 patients and ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lover in SS, S, and NI-SIRS versus critical COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, α2-antiplasmin activity was higher in critical COVID-19 versus NI-SIRS (P < 0.01) and SS (P < 0.001), whereas PAI-1 levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with NI-SIRS, S, and SS patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients present with increased circulating endothelial stress products, complement activation, and fibrinolytic dysregulation, associated with disease severity. COVID-19 endotheliopathy differs from SS, in which endothelial damage is also a critical feature of pathobiology. These biomarkers could help to stratify the severity of COVID-19 disease and may also provide information to guide specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate endotheliopathy progression.","Fernández, Sara; Moreno-Castaño, Ana B; Palomo, Marta; Martinez-Sanchez, Julia; Torramadé-Moix, Sergi; Téllez, Adrián; Ventosa, Helena; Seguí, Ferran; Escolar, Ginés; Carreras, Enric; Nicolás, Josep M; Richardson, Edward; García-Bernal, David; Carlo-Stella, Carmelo; Moraleda, José M; Richardson, Paul G; Díaz-Ricart, Maribel; Castro, Pedro",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000001823; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34172614/,439

Authors' reply.,2021-02-26,"Background Epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFR+) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients failing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) can benefit from next-line targeted therapies, but implementation is challenging. Methods EGFR+ NSCLC patients treated with first/second-generation (1G/2G) TKI at our institution with a last follow-up after osimertinib approval (February 2016), were analyzed retrospectively, and the results compared with published data under osimertinib. Results A total of 207 patients received erlotinib (37%), gefitinib (16%) or afatinib (47%). The median age was 66 years, with a predominance of female (70%), never/light-smokers (69%). T790M testing was performed in 174/202 progressive cases (86%), positive in 93/174 (53%), and followed by osimertinib in 87/93 (94%). Among the 135 deceased patients, 94 (70%) received subsequent systemic treatment (43% chemotherapy, 39% osimertinib), while 30% died without, either before (4%) or after progression, due to rapid clinical deterioration (22%), patient refusal of further therapy (2%), or severe competing illness (2%). Lack of subsequent treatment was significantly (4.5x, p < 0.001) associated with lack of T790M testing, whose most frequent cause (in approximately 50% of cases) was also rapid clinical decline. Among the 127 consecutive patients with failure of 1G/2G TKI started after November 2015, 47 (37%) received osimertinib, with a median overall survival of 36 months versus 24 and 21 months for patients with alternative and no subsequent therapies (p = 0.003). Conclusion Osimertinib after 1G/2G TKI failure prolongs survival, but approximately 15% and 30% of patients forego molecular retesting and subsequent treatment, respectively, mainly due to rapid clinical deterioration. This is an important remediable obstacle to sequential TKI treatment for EGFR+ NSCLC. It pertains also to other actionable resistance mechanisms emerging under 1G/2G inhibitors or osimertinib, whose rate for lack of next-line therapy is similar (approximately 35% in the FLAURA/AURA3 trials), and highlights the need for closer monitoring alongside broader profiling of TKI-treated EGFR+ NSCLC in the future.","Magios, Nikolaus; Bozorgmehr, Farastuk; Volckmar, Anna-Lena; Kazdal, Daniel; Kirchner, Martina; Herth, Felix J; Heussel, Claus-Peter; Eichhorn, Florian; Meister, Michael; Muley, Thomas; Elshafie, Rami A; Fischer, Jürgen R; Faehling, Martin; Kriegsmann, Mark; Schirmacher, Peter; Bischoff, Helge; Stenzinger, Albrecht; Thomas, Michael; Christopoulos, Petros",Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1758835921996509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34408792/,439
61174,"Sepsis, a 2020 review for the internist.",2020-05-11,"Benzophenone synthase (BPS) catalyzes the production of 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone via the condensation of benzoyl-CoA and three units of malonyl-CoA. The biosynthetic pathway proceeds with the formation of the prenylated xanthone α-mangostin from 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone. Structural elucidation was performed to gain a better understanding of the structural basis of the function of Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) BPS (GmBPS). The structure reveals the common core consisting of a five-layer αβαβα fold as found in other type III polyketide synthase enzymes. The three residues Met264, Tyr266 and Gly339 are proposed to have a significant impact on the substrate-binding specificity of the active site. Crystallographic and docking studies indicate why benzoyl-CoA is preferred over 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the substrate for GmBPS. Met264 and Tyr266 in GmBPS are properly oriented for accommodation of the 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzophenone product but not of naringenin. Gly339 offers a minimal steric hindrance to accommodate the extended substrate. Moreover, the structural arrangement of Thr133 provides the elongation activity and consequently facilitates extension of the polyketide chain. In addition to its impact on the substrate selectivity, Ala257 expands the horizontal cavity and might serve to facilitate the initiation/cyclization reaction. The detailed structure of GmBPS explains its catalytic function, facilitating further structure-based engineering to alter its substrate specificity and obtain the desired products.","Songsiriritthigul, Chomphunuch; Nualkaew, Natsajee; Ketudat-Cairns, James; Chen, Chun Jung","Acta crystallographica.

Using data from the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE; N = 2,694; 26% African American), multiple-group, parallel-process latent growth curve models were used to explore relationships between subjective and objective memory over 10 years and assess racial differences in these associations. Across African Americans and whites, we found bidirectional associations between subjective and objective memory such that greater self-reported forgetting at baseline predicted faster subsequent verbal episodic memory declines, and higher baseline objective memory scores predicted less increase in self-reported forgetting over time. However, rates of change in self-reported frequency of forgetting were correlated with rates of change in verbal episodic memory in whites, but not in African Americans. Subjective memory complaints may be a harbinger of future memory declines across African Americans and whites but may not track with objective memory in the same way across these racial groups.

Causes for this decline fall into three broad categories: habitat loss, illegal hunting, and disease. Contributing factors to all of these causes are linked to pressure from the expanding human population competing for forest resources. We have moved beyond the time of debating the pros and cons of including human engagement activities in conservation. If humans are part of the problem, they must also be part of the solution. To move our understanding of which human engagement activities are effective, what methodologies are being used and best practices for setting up a successful framework, we interviewed practitioners representing 53 projects working in great ape habitat in Africa. The interviewees represented almost 900 years of experience with African great ape conservation. We found that all practitioners agreed that for conservation to succeed, projects must engage with humans utilizing resources from great ape habitats. However, evaluation of such work was elusive. Projects that employed at least one person designated as an educator were more likely to have structured programs, regular engagement activities, and to evaluate their work. To date, little information on the success or failure of the activities has been published, thus perpetuating the problem of relying on personal experience rather than evidence when developing new engagement programs. Additionally, linking human engagement activities to biological impact remains a challenge. The results presented in this paper demonstrate the importance placed on human engagement activities to effectively conserve great apes in Africa while at the same time identifies gaps in our understanding on the link between such activities and project success.","Bettinger, Tammie; Cox, Debby; Kuhar, Chris; Leighty, Katherine",American journal of primatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.23216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33170515/,439

DESIGN Prospective experimental pilot study. SETTING University research facility. ANIMALS Seven adult random-source male dogs. INTERVENTION Thromboelastography (TEG) and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex formation were used to assess coagulation status in healthy dogs. Seven adult research dogs received 200-300 IU/kg subcutaneous UFH every 8 hours for 4 days. A final IV bolus of 100 IU/kg was given on day 4 and the peak measured heparin concentration 1 hour later is defined as the start of heparin withdrawal (time 0). Citrated whole blood samples were collected at baseline (prior to heparin administration) and 3, 6, 12, 30, and 48 hours after UFH withdrawal. At all time points, a kaolin-activated TEG was performed and citrated plasma for measurement of TAT concentration was collected for batch analysis. Fibrinogen concentration, PCV, total plasma proteins, and platelet count were measured at baseline and 48 hours after heparin withdrawal. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Compared to baseline, TAT was increased 12 hours after heparin withdrawal and returned to baseline by 30 hours. TEG clot formation time (K) was decreased 30 and 48 hours after heparin withdrawal. CONCLUSION TAT results suggest that a transient increase in thrombin generation developed 12 hours after withdrawal of UFH therapy. Though clot kinetics were rapid compared to baseline beginning 30 hours after heparin withdrawal, a return to baseline was not documented. Future studies are warranted to determine the clinical relevance of these results and to evaluate the effect of UFH withdrawal in critically ill animals.","Mays, Erin M; Dorman, David C; McKendry, Colleen; Hanel, Rita M",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,https://doi.org/10.1111/vec.12778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30303616/,439

66792,Author reply.,2018,"Since January 1, 2019, the Russian Federation has entered the global medical tourism market thanks to the approved federal project ""Development of the export of medical services"". The level of attractiveness of a country as a global destination for medical tourists is determined by a number of factors: the level of medical technology, transport accessibility, proximity to donor countries of foreign patients; the level of realization of export potential, international reputation, medical marketing; the level of healthcare organization, international staff training, etc. Among the factors determining the success of the country as the destination of medical tourism, a special place is held by the recreational complex, spa treatment. The level of development of the recreational complex within the framework of medical tourism performs several tasks at once: it provides a full cycle of medical assistance to foreign medical tourists - from outpatient admissions and in-patient treatment to rehabilitation and recovery; sanatorium-resort treatment and rehabilitation are considered not only as an integral part of the complex of medical services, but also as an independent promising direction for the export of medical services by domestic health resorts. Also, the fight against the consequences of COVID-19, when hundreds of thousands of neighboring states citizens need qualified rehabilitation, can become a driver for the development of the sanatorium-resort complex of Russia. The purpose of the study is to identify bottlenecks in the development strategy of the recreational potential of the regions of the Russian Federation and make suggestions for its improvement. The number of foreign patients who received medical care from January to May 2020 in the federal districts is 729,000. This indicator was achieved during the pandemic, and therefore does not reflect the true potential of rehabilitation as an element of the full cycle of medical care for foreign patients. The target audience for rehabilitation programs is up to 100,000 foreign patients.","Aksenova, E I; Petrova, G D; Chernyshev, E V; Yudina, N N","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",https://doi.org/10.32687/0869-866x-2020-28-s2-1180-1185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33219777/,439
66938,Higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding events: a meta-analysis.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Trans-right axillary aortic valve replacement (TAX-AVR) remains uncommon. We developed a special method to pull the heart closer to the right chest wall to make the surgery as easy and safe as aortic valve replacement via median sternotomy. Because the retraction sutures lifting the ascending aorta and aortic root are arranged circularly around the wound, we named this technique ""Stonehenge technique"". METHODS We examined 47 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement through a small right infra-axillary thoracotomy as the initial surgical therapy. These patients were divided into two groups: the conventional TAX-AVR group that underwent AVR via the conventional small right axillary incision approach (n = 20) and the TAX-AVR with SH group that underwent AVR with the Stonehenge technique (n = 27). RESULTS The aortic cross-clamp and the extracorporeal circulation time were significantly shorter in the TAX-AVR with SH group than in the conventional TAX-AVR group (conventional TAX-AVR group: 125.5 ± 47.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 96.0 ± 14.0, p = 0.004, and conventional TAX-AVR group: 163.8 ± 55.9; TAX-AVR with SH group: 140.0 ± 16.8, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION The outcomes of this technique depend on the site of the retraction sutures in the opened pericardium, direction of pull, amount of force applied, and precautions taken. If performed correctly, the ascending aorta and the root can be pulled from the wound to within the surgeon's fingers' reach, thereby reducing aortic cross-clamp and extracorporeal circulation times in group of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via right infra-axillary thoracotomy.","Yamazaki, Masataka; Yoshitake, Akihiro; Takahashi, Tatsuo; Ito, Tsutomu; Kimura, Naritaka; Hirano, Akinori; Iida, Yasunori; Takanashi, Shuichiro; Shimizu, Hideyuki",General thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11748-018-0987-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117124/,439
67215,A systematic review of the biomechanical research methods used in strongman studies.,2019,"Epidermal adult stem cells (EpiASCs) have the potential for unlimited proliferation and differentiation, however, the ability of these stem cells to activate corneal genetic programs in response to corneal stroma stimulation needs to be further validated. Herein, a feasible strategy was developed to reconstruct the damaged corneal surface in a goat model with total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) by transplanting EpiASCs, which had been explanted and cultured from the skin of an adult ram goat and were then purified by selecting single cell-derived clones and cultivating them on a denuded human amniotic membrane (HAM). These artificial tissues were then successfully transplanted into ewe goats with total LSCD. Binding of EpiASCs to the base membrane of an EpiASCs-HAM-Sheet (EHS) indicated their proliferating status. After transplantation, the EpiASCs could survive in the host tissue and they reconstructed the damaged ocular surface of total LSCD. The crystal reconstructed corneal epithelium expressed CK3 and Pax-6 similar to normal corneal epithelium and expressed the Sry gene after transplantation. These results demonstrated that EpiASCs could be induced to differentiate into corneal epithelial cell types in a corneal microenvironment and had the ability to activate corneal genetic programs. This work offer a foundation for promoting tissue-engineered cornea into clinical application.","Zhang, Pei; Ma, Xi-Ya; Huang, Dian-Tong; Yang, Xue-Yi",Journal of molecular histology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10735-020-09879-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388840/,439

METHODS Primary research published in English between January 2003 and April 2019 was identified in bibliographic databases including Medline, Embase and Proquest (Prospero: CRD42018088681). An integrated mixed-method approach included studies describing a CST intervention and its effect, for cancer or palliative care HPs, delivered online or blended with an online component. Included studies' outcomes were categorised then findings were stratified by an evaluation framework and synthesised in an effect direction plot. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute's tools. RESULTS Nineteen included studies (five randomised controlled trials, 11 pre-post, two post-test and one qualitative study) evaluated a CST intervention (median duration = 3.75 h; range 0.66-96 h) involving 1116 HPs, 422 students and 732 patients. Most interventions taught communication skills for specific scenarios and approximately half were delivered solely online and did not involve role plays. Online CST improved HPs' self-assessed communication skills (three studies, 215 participants), confidence (four studies, 533 participants), and objective knowledge (five studies, 753 participants). While few studies evaluated patient outcomes, CST may benefit observed communication skills in care settings (two studies, 595 participants). CONCLUSIONS Online CST benefits oncology HPs' subjectively-reported communication skills and confidence, and objective knowledge. Translation to patient outcomes requires further investigation. The quality of research varied and few studies had a control group. We recommend improvements to study design, evaluation and implementation.","Berg, Melissa N; Ngune, Irene; Schofield, Penelope; Grech, Lisa; Juraskova, Ilona; Strasser, Michelle; Butt, Zoe; Halkett, Georgia K B",Psycho-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33909328/,439

We carried out an update of a previous systematic review of all published clinical trials in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) from 1980 to 2019 to document any reported serious adverse events (SAEs). METHODS For this updated systematic review, we searched the following databases from 1st Jan 2016 through 2nd of May 2019: PUBMED, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, clinicaltrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and the Global Index Medicus. We included randomised and non-randomised interventional studies aimed at assessing therapeutic efficacy and extracted the number of SAEs reported within the first 30 days of treatment initiation. The incidence rate of death (IRD) from individual treatment arms were combined in a meta-analysis using random effects Poisson regression. RESULTS We identified 157 published studies enrolling 35,376 patients in 347 treatment arms. Pentavalent antimony was administered in 74 (21.3%), multiple-dose liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in 52 (15.0%), amphotericin b deoxycholate in 51 (14.7%), miltefosine in 33 (9.5%), amphotericin b fat/lipid/colloid/cholesterol in 31 (8.9%), and single-dose L-AmB in 17 (4.9%) arms. There was a total of 804 SAEs reported of which 793 (including 428 deaths) were extracted at study arm level (11 SAEs were reported at study level only). During the first 30 days, there were 285 (66.6%) deaths with the overall IRD estimated at 0.068 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.041-0.114; I2 = 81.4%; 95% prediction interval (PI): 0.001-2.779] per 1,000 person-days at risk; the rate was 0.628 [95% CI: 0.368-1.021; I2 = 82.5%] in Eastern Africa, and 0.041 [95% CI: 0.021-0.081; I2 = 68.1%] in the Indian Subcontinent. In 21 study arms which clearly indicated allowing the inclusion of patients with HIV co-infections the IRD was 0.575 [95% CI: 0.244-1.355; I2 = 91.9%] compared to 0.043 [95% CI: 0.020-0.090; I2 = 62.5%] in 160 arms which excluded HIV co-infections. CONCLUSION Mortality within the first 30 days of VL treatment initiation was a rarely reported event in clinical trials with an overall estimated rate of 0.068 deaths per 1,000 person-days at risk, though it varied across regions and patient populations. These estimates may serve as a benchmark for future trials against which mortality data from prospective and pharmacovigilance studies can be compared. The methodological limitations exposed by our review support the need to assemble individual patient data (IPD) to conduct robust IPD meta-analyses and generate stronger evidence from existing trials to support treatment guidelines and guide future research.","Singh-Phulgenda, Sauman; Dahal, Prabin; Ngu, Roland; Maguire, Brittany J; Hawryszkiewycz, Alice; Rashan, Sumayyah; Brack, Matthew; Halleux, Christine M; Alves, Fabiana; Stepniewska, Kasia; Olliaro, Piero L; Guerin, Philippe J",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780461/,439

METHODS Sixteen consecutively hospitalized third-trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease were selected as the study subjects for the simulation of COVID-19 pneumonia. Two physicians (imaging and internal medicine) without ultrasonic experience performed lung examinations on pregnant women after six days of lung ultrasound training, and their consistency with examinations by the expert was assessed. In addition, 54 healthy third-trimester pregnant women and 54 healthy nonpregnant women of the same age who were continuously treated in the outpatient clinic of this hospital were selected for comparisons of abnormalities on lung ultrasound. RESULTS (1) Third trimester pregnant women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis or connective tissue disease had the same lung ultrasound patterns as those associated with COVID-19 pneumonia. (2) There was no statistically significant difference between the scores of the two trained doctors and the expert when the modified ultrasound scoring system was used (p > .05). (3) The evaluations of the two trained doctors and the expert showed good consistency (kappa value = 0.833-0.957). (4) The incidence of abnormal ultrasound manifestations of the pleura and lung parenchyma was higher among healthy third-trimester pregnant women than among healthy women of the same age (p < .001).

69872,"Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of 43 COVID-19 patients in Weifang, China.",2020-08-14,"UNLABELLED Rabies, one of the oldest infectious diseases, still presents a public health threat in most parts of the world today. Its pathogen, rabies virus (RABV), can utilize its viral proteins, such as the nucleoprotein and phosphorylation protein, to subvert the host innate immune system. For a long time, the large (L) protein was believed to be essential for RABV transcription and replication, but its role in viral pathogenicity and immune evasion was not known. Recent studies have found that the conserved K-D-K-E tetrad motif in the L protein is related to the methyltransferase (MTase) activity in the viral mRNA process. In the present study, a series of RABV mutations in this motif was constructed with the recombinant CVS-B2c (rB2c) virus. Two of these mutants, rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A, were found to be stable and displayed an attenuated phenotype in both in vitro growth and in vivo pathogenicity in adult and suckling mice. Further studies demonstrated that these two mutants were more sensitive to the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene product IFIT2 than the parent virus. Taken together, our results suggest that K1685 and K1829 in the L protein play important roles in pathogenicity and immune evasion during RABV infection. IMPORTANCE Rabies continues to present a public health threat in most areas of the world, especially in the developing countries of Asia and Africa. The pathogenic mechanisms for rabies are not well understood. In the present study, it was found that the recombinant rabies viruses rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A, carrying mutations at the predicted MTase catalytic sites in the L protein, were highly attenuated both in vitro and in vivo. Further studies showed that these mutants were more sensitive to the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene product IFIT2 than the parent virus. These findings improve our understanding of rabies pathogenesis, which may help in developing potential therapeutics and an avirulent rabies vaccine.","Tian, Dayong; Luo, Zhaochen; Zhou, Ming; Li, Mingming; Yu, Lan; Wang, Chong; Yuan, Jiaolong; Li, Fang; Tian, Bin; Sui, Baokun; Chen, Huanchun; Fu, Zhen F; Zhao, Ling",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02050-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468538/,439

Accurate up-to-date PSA test incidence rates are, however, lacking. OBJECTIVE To investigate the PSA test incidence rates in general practices over the past 10 years and to study which factors are associated with more frequent test use. METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study using the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners Network from 2002 to 2011, of which data were available from more than 65 000 male patients. We calculated the annual incidence of PSA testing rates per 1000 person-years. Co-morbidities were analysed by means of International Classification of Primary Care codes. Relative risks (RRs) of having a PSA test were estimated as the ratio of observed rates of co-morbidities in men who underwent the test compared with a control group, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS From 2002 to 2011, the overall incidence rate of PSA testing in men ≥45 years increased almost 4-fold, from 15.5 to 54.3 per 1000 person-years. As from 2005, the incidence rates appear to increase more than those before 2005. Men with cardiovascular diseases, joint disorders, psychiatric diseases, respiratory diseases, overweight and diabetes mellitus were predisposed to undergo a PSA test, but men with urinary problems had the highest relative risk (RR 1.77, 95% CI 1.72-1.82). CONCLUSIONS From 2002 to 2011, PSA incidence testing rates increased, particularly in men with urinary symptoms and cardiovascular disease, despite several international guidelines that suggest a judicious use of PSA tests.","Hamoen, Esther Hj; Reukers, Daphne Fm; Numans, Mattijs E; Barentsz, Jelle O; Witjes, J Alfred; Rovers, Maroeska M",Family practice,https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmt045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24107269/,439

MATERIALS AND METHODS This observational case-control study was performed on patients with suspected BD. Patients with diagnosis of BD confirmed by the brain death committee were enrolled as the BD group and other patients as the non-BD group. CO monitoring was performed at least 6 h, and cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (ScO2) parameters were compared. RESULTS Mean ScO2 level in the BD group was lower than non-brain-dead patients: mean difference for right lobe = 6.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-12.88) and for left lobe = 6.09 (95% CI -0.22-12.41). Maximum ScO2 values in the BD group were significantly lower than the non-BD group: mean difference for right lobe = 8.20 (95% CI 1.64-14.77) and for left lobe = 9.54 (95% CI 3.06-16.03). The area under the curve for right lobe maximum ScO2 was 0.69 (95% CI 0.55-0.81) and for left lobe was 0.72 (95% CI 0.58-0.84). CONCLUSION Maximum ScO2 in brain-dead patients at CO monitoring is significantly low. However, this cannot be used to differentiate brain-dead and non-brain-dead patients.

75942,COVID-19 and ICU admission associated predictive factors in Iranian patients.,2020,"BACKGROUND Bidi use remains an intractable public health problem for India. This is partly due to the informal nature of the bidi supply chain, including tax exemptions for small producers. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of making all bidis subject to duty and Goods and Services Tax. Although this may require legislative changes and incur some extra administrative costs, the net benefits would include greater oversight of the supply chain as well as increased tax revenues and reduced consumption. METHODS We use a form of gap analysis (the difference between duty paid and total bidi consumption) to estimate the number of tax-exempt bidis. We then use local evidence on the price elasticity of demand for bidis to assess the impact of eliminating these exemptions on the price and consumption of presently tax-exempt bidis. FINDINGS Total bidi consumption is estimated at 400 billion sticks per annum, including 275 billion duty paid sticks and 125 billion duty exempt sticks. Removing the small producer exemptions would increase the price of currently exempt bidis by INR4.6/pack. Total bidi consumption would decrease by 6% and the number of smokers would decrease by 2.2 million adults. This would bring the rate of bidi smoking down from 7.7% to 7.5%, while generating INR14.8 billion in tax revenues. CONCLUSIONS Eliminating India's tax exemptions for small bidis producers would make a significant contribution to tobacco control, both directly by reducing the number of smokers and indirectly by plugging a loophole in the supply chain.","Goodchild, Mark; Munish, Vineet Gill; Sinha, Praveen; Tullu, Fikru Tesfaye; Paul, Jeremias",Tobacco control,https://doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-056056; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33328265/,439
76004,Endoscopic endonasal approach for resection of ventral skull base keratinaceous cysts.,2012,"OBJECTIVES The role of topical anti-infectives in acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis is controversial. Povidone-iodine is an anti-bacterial and anti-viral that is affordable and available over-the-counter and may demonstrate advantages over mupirocin as a sinus irrigation therapy. The objective was to compare povidone-iodine or mupirocin versus saline sinus irrigations for sinusitis exacerbations in post-surgery subjects as well as to assess tolerability of povidone-iodine sinus irrigations. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a prospective single-blinded (clinician only) randomized controlled trial. Subjects were post-surgery with acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis and gram-positive bacteria on culture. They received povidone-iodine, mupirocin, or saline sinus irrigations, twice daily for 30 days. Outcomes were post-treatment culture negativity (primary) and Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 and Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score change (secondary). RESULTS Of the 62 subjects analyzed, post-treatment culture negativity rate was higher in the MUP (14/20, 70%) group compared to the PI (9/21, 43%) and SAL (9/19, 47%) groups, although this was not significant (p = 0.29). Povidone-iodine sinus irrigations at the 1% concentration were very well-tolerated, similar to saline irrigations. There were no significant differences in Sinonasal Outcome Test-20 score (povidone-iodine -0.3 [-0.6, 0.05] vs. mupirocin -0.3 [-0.7, 0.05] vs. saline -0.4 [-0.8, 0.05]; p = 0.86) or Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score (povidone-iodine -3.5 [-7, -0.5] vs. mupirocin -2 [-4, 2] vs. saline -3 [-5, 0]; p = 0.45) change. No serious adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS In patients who have had prior sinus surgery with acute exacerbations of CRS and gram-positive bacteria on culture, mupirocin sinus irrigations achieved a better post-treatment culture ""control"" rate compared to saline and povidone-iodine. In addition, 1% povidone-iodine solution was well-tolerated as a sinus irrigation and may represent a feasible method for temporarily disinfecting the sinonasal cavity of bacteria and viruses such as COVID-19.","Lee, Victoria S; Pottinger, Paul S; Davis, Greg E",American journal of otolaryngology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102604; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563787/,439
76278,Suggestions for Combatting COVID-19 by Natural Means in the Absence of Standard Medical Regimens.,2020-07-02,"AIM The aim of the present study was to determine the favoritism of suture materials among a group of clinicians at a teaching institution. METHODS The surveys included 11 absorbable and nine non-absorbable sutures. The surveyor was asked to select his or her suture preferences when it comes to using it in 13 different, commonly-performed surgical procedures. RESULTS The surveys showed overall preferences for non-absorbable versus absorbable sutures. Chromic Gut with a 4-0 diameter thread reverse cutting FS2 needle was the most favored suture. For periodontal bone grafts and hard tissue ridge augmentation, polytetrafluoroethylene with a 4-0 thread and FS2 needle was preferred. For autogenous gingival grafts, gingival allografts, connective tissue grafts, frenectomy and frenoplasty, Chromic Gut with 5-0 diameter thread reverse cutting P3 needle was favored. For extraction socket preservation, soft tissue canine exposure, ridge augmentation, and dental implants, Chromic Gut with 4-0 diameter thread reverse cutting FS2 needle was preferred, and for sinus augmentation, Vicryl with a 4-0 diameter thread reverse cutting FS2 needle was favored. CONCLUSION Absorbable sutures were preferred in the majority of periodontal procedures; however, non-absorbable sutures were favored in procedures that required longer healing or better stability of the flap edges in cases of periodontal and ridge augmentation.","Maksoud, Mohamed; Koo, Samuel; Barouch, Kasumi; Karimbux, Nadeem",Journal of investigative and clinical dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1111/jicd.12032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23595981/,439

The IR spectra were assigned and the electronic ground-state properties in different solvents were analyzed. Dynamic conversion of [Fe2S2(NO)4]2- was analyzed quantitatively using the time-resolved IR spectra in different solvents. Photo irradiation and polarity of solvent obviously affect the reaction rates, which are faster in CH3CN and CH3OH than those in DMSO and water. The calculated orbital energies of HOMOs are higher and those of LUMO-HOMO gap are smaller in CH3CN and CH3OH than those in DMSO and water, which is consistent with the reaction rate and explains the experimental observation. Moreover, the photo-induced nitric oxide (NO) release and cluster conversion was identified using EPR spectra. The photocleavage of pBR322 DNA was observed, both NO and oxygen related free radicals play key roles in the process. The study provides an effective method to monitor the photodynamic reactions for better understanding of the physiological activity of nitrosyl iron-sulfur clusters.","Jing, Qi; Liu, Lifang; Zhang, Yu; Xie, Leilei; Song, Luna; Wang, Wenming; Liu, Yanhong; Zhao, Xuan; Wang, Hongfei","Spectrochimica acta.

76763,Association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status with COVID-19 30-day mortality at a Philadelphia medical center using a retrospective cohort study.,2021-09-29,"BACKGROUND Over a few months in the spring of 2011, a cluster of patients with severe respiratory distress were admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU). Household clustering was also observed. Extensive laboratory investigations failed to detect an infectious cause. METHODS Clinical, radiological and pathological investigations were conducted and the Korean Center for Disease Control performed epidemiological studies. RESULTS The case series consisted of 17 patients. Their median age was 35 (range 28-49) years. Six were pregnant at presentation and four had given birth 2 weeks previously. All presented with cough and dyspnoea. In the majority of patients (14/17), multifocal areas of patchy consolidation were identified in the lower lung zones on the initial CT. As the condition progressed, the patchy consolidation disappeared (10/13) and diffuse centrilobular ground-glass opacity nodules started to predominate and persist. Pathological specimens (11/17) showed a bronchiolocentric, temporally homogenous, acute lung injury pattern with sparing of the subpleural and peripheral alveolar areas. Ten patients required mechanical ventilation, eight of whom subsequently received extracorporeal life support. Four of the latter underwent lung transplantation. Five of the six patients in the ICU who did not receive lung transplantation died. An epidemiological investigation revealed that all patients had used humidifier disinfectants in their homes. CONCLUSIONS This case series report showed that lung injury and respiratory failure can occur as a result of inhaling humidifier disinfectants. This emphasises the need for more stringent safety regulations for potentially toxic inhalants that might be encountered in the home.","Hong, Sang-Bum; Kim, Hwa Jung; Huh, Jin Won; Do, Kyung-Hyun; Jang, Se Jin; Song, Joon Seon; Choi, Seong-Jin; Heo, Yongju; Kim, Yong-Bum; Lim, Chae-Man; Chae, Eun Jin; Lee, Hanyi; Jung, Miran; Lee, Kyuhong; Lee, Moo-Song; Koh, Younsuck",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24473332/,439

We aimed to determine whether self- or caregiver-collection has adequate diagnostic performance for detection of viral and bacterial upper airways pathogens.Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing diagnostic accuracy of self- or caregiver-collected upper airway swabs collected by patients or caregivers compared to HCW. All study types except case reports and series were included if sufficient data were presented to calculate sensitivity, specificity and Cohen's kappa. Studies published from 1946 to 17th August 2020 were included in the search. We did a meta-analysis to assess pooled sensitivity and specificity. Results Twenty studies were included in the systematic review and 15 in the meta-analysis. Overall sensitivity of swabs collected by patients or caregivers compared to HCW was 91% (95% CI: 87-94) and specificity was 98% (95% CI: 96-99). Sensitivity ranged from 65% to 100% and specificity from 73% to 100% across the studies.

Pregnancy may lead to deterioration of the disease and negatively affect maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, the impact of peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) on reproductive outcomes has been understudied. Methods: A retrospective study on prospectively maintained database, including women aged 18-45 who underwent POEM during 2012-2017 at a university hospital. Results: During the study period, POEM was performed in 86 patients. Of them, 23 were women of childbearing age (median age 31.9 [26.0-40.7] years). Follow-up data were available for a median of 24 [16-41] months. Treatment success (Eckardt score <3) was achieved in 22 (95.7%) women. Six (26.1%) women reported attempting to conceive after POEM. Overall, 7 post-POEM pregnancies among 5 women were encountered. All 7 pregnancies were naturally conceived with a median surgery-to-conception interval of 16 [10-21] months. The median gestational weight gain was 10 kg, and was insufficient in all pregnancies. None of the women was hospitalized during the index gestation. All pregnancies resulted in term live-birth vaginal delivery. The median neonatal birthweight was 2940 g, with only one case of a small-for-gestational age infant. Achalasia-related symptoms recurred during 2 pregnancies, with resolution following delivery. Conclusions: Pregnancy after POEM for the treatment of achalasia was associated with favorable maternal and perinatal outcomes. This data should reassure women who wish to conceive following peroral myotomy.","Rottenstreich, Amihai; Brodie, Ronit; Marom, Gad; Jacob, Harold; Benson, Ariel; Mintz, Yoav",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

79787,The Lure of the Lüer Connector Non-Lüer Connectors in Regional Anaesthesia.,2021-05-08,"BACKGROUND Heparin, a lifesaving blood thinner used in over 100 million surgical procedures worldwide annually, is currently isolated from over 700 million pigs and ~ 200 million cattle in slaughterhouses worldwide. Though animal-derived heparin has been in use over eight decades, it is a complex mixture that poses a risk for chemical adulteration, and its availability is highly vulnerable. Therefore, there is an urgent need in devising bioengineering approaches for the production of heparin polymers, especially low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and thus, relying less on animal sources. One of the main challenges, however, is the rapid, cost-effective production of low molecular weight heparosan, a precursor of LMWH and size-defined heparosan oligosaccharides. Another challenge is N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan oligosaccharides efficiently, an essential modification required for subsequent enzymatic modifications, though chemical and enzymatic N-sulfation is effectively performed at the polymer level. METHODS To devise a strategy to produce low molecular weight heparosan and heparosan oligosaccharides, several non-pathogenic E. coli strains are engineered by transforming the essential heparosan biosynthetic genes with or without the eliminase gene (elmA) from pathogenic E. coli K5. RESULTS The metabolically engineered non-pathogenic strains are shown to produce ~5 kDa heparosan, a precursor for low molecular weight heparin, for the first time. Additionally, heparosan oligosaccharides of specific sizes ranging from tetrasaccharides to dodecasaccharides are directly generated, in a single step, from the recombinant bacterial strains that carry both heparosan biosynthetic genes and an eliminase gene. Various modifications, such as chemical N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan hexasaccharide following the selective protection reducing end GlcNAc residue, enzymatic C5-epimerization of N-sulfo heparosan tetrasaccharide and complete 6-O sulfation of N-sulfo heparosan hexasaccharide, are shown to be feasible. CONCLUSIONS We engineered non-pathogenic E. coli strains to produce low molecular weight heparosan and a range of size-specific heparosan oligosaccharides in a controlled manner through modulating culture conditions. We have also shown various chemical and enzymatic modifications of heparosan oligosaccharides. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE Heparosan is a precursor of heparin and the methods to produce low molecular weight heparosan is widely awaited. The methods described herein are promising and will pave the way for potential large scale production of low molecular weight heparin anticoagulants in the coming decade.","Roy, Anindita; Miyai, Yuma; Rossi, Alessandro; Paraswar, Krishna; Desai, Umesh; Saijoh, Yukio; Kuberan, Balagurunathan",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2020-09-28,"BACKGROUND Rural Australian oncology patients are known to have inferior mortality rates compared to metropolitan patients, possibly related to access to appropriate healthcare services and treatments. Electronic systems improve the safety of chemotherapy administration and allow easily accessible patient information and data collection. AIM To integrate the electronic healthcare delivery systems at a metropolitan hospital and a rural outreach haematology clinic to facilitate streamlined and safe outpatient care. METHOD The MOSAIQ v2.64(Elekta) system utilized at St Vincent's Hospital was introduced at a linked rural outreach haematology clinic. The two separate comprehensive practice management systems incorporating all patient information were consolidated into one, becoming accessible from both sites. RESULTS The electronic systems were successfully integrated between the two sites in October 2017. Electronic chemotherapy prescribing at the Griffith site is now guided by inbuilt, pharmacist-reviewed protocols thereby improving the safety and flexibility of remote prescribing. The centralised EHR has improved streamlined care during patient transitions between the two hospitals with enhanced continuity of documentation and management. Increases in total clinic patients and appointment numbers are demonstrable since implementation, and sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION Our study provides a novel example of the successful implementation of a centralised electronic healthcare record and chemotherapy prescribing system in a haematology setting shared between a metropolitan service and a rural outreach hospital clinic. This has positive implications for the safety and efficiency of healthcare delivery at the rural site applicable to all linked rural Australian clinics, as well as allowing data collection to assist future planning of the service.

The thin PAN nanofibers form a dense membrane, with a strong capturing ability on the ultra-fine particles, while the thick PVDF nanofibers play a 3D supporting effect on the thin PAN nanofibers. In this case, this combination results in a fluffy membrane with higher porosity, which could achieve the airflow passing through the membrane without the air pressure drop. The effects of composite manner of thick nanofibers and thin nanofibers are investigated, in order to optimize the air filtration performance of 3D composite nanofibrous membrane. As a result, the maximum quality factor for air filtration could reach up to 0.398 Pa-1. The particle-fiber interaction model was used to simulate the air filtration process as well, and the simulation results were in fairly consistent with the experimental results, providing a guidance method for the optimization of composite nanofibrous membrane for high-efficiency air filtration. More interestingly, a cationic poly[2-(N,N-dimethyl amino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA) was added in the PVDF solution to obtain a composite air filtration membrane with excellent antibiosis performance, which achieved the highest inhibition rate of approximately 90%. In short, this work provides an effective way to promote antibiosis air filtration performance by using electrospun nanofibrous membrane, while might effectively accelerate the biological protection application of current air filtration membrane.","Jiang, Jiaxin; Shao, Zungui; Wang, Xiang; Zhu, Ping; Deng, Shiqing; Li, Wenwang; Zheng, Gaofeng",Nanotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6528/abeb9a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657545/,439

85027,Cardiac Rehabilitation for Women: A Systematic Review of Barriers and Solutions.,2017,"Since the first fiberoptic instruments, gastrointestinal endoscopy has shaped the field of gastroenterology and is now a key diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Compared with the initial fiberoptic endoscopes state-of-the-art optical chips (or charge-coupled device technology) allowed a quantum leap in image quality. Despite these advances, gastrointestinal endoscopy is far from being perfect. The diagnostic yield (eg, for adenoma detection rates) is highly operator dependent and there is still the need for sedation or even anesthesia to address discomfort during the procedure. Despite highly standardized cleaning and high-level disinfection the reuse of contemporary (and difficult to clean) endoscopes with multiple channels exposes patients to the risk of transmission of infections. Artificial intelligence and pattern recognition should eliminate interindividual variability including polyp detection rates, self-propelled, and (potentially remotely controlled) scopes with a soft shaft could reduce the discomfort during procedures and abolish the need for sedation and anesthesia altogether and single-use designs should eliminate the risk of patient-to-patient transmission of infections. While these innovations are feasible and could be implemented rapidly utilizing available technology, they require a paradigm shift affecting all levels of the value chain from the supplier of the instruments to the end-users. Some may negate the need for a paradigm shift, but it is evident that a major redesign of the endoscopic equipment is overdue to fully utilize novel technologies and most importantly ensure the best possible outcomes for patients.","Holtmann, Gerald J; Huelsen, Alexander; Shah, Ayesha; Hourigan, Luke F; Morrison, Mark",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcg.0000000000001430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33021560/,439

87088,"Understanding COVID-19 ARDS: New Pathogen, Same Heterogeneous Syndrome.",2021-06-17,"Sophorolipids (SLs) constitute a group of unique biosurfactants (BS) in the light of their outstanding properties, among which their antimicrobial activities stand out. SLs can exist mainly in an acidic and a lactonic form, both of which display inhibitory activity. Given the amphipathic nature of SLs it is feasible that these antimicrobial actions are the result of the perturbation of the physicochemical properties of targeted membranes. Thus, in this work we have carried out a biophysical study to unveil the molecular details of the interaction of an acidic SL with a model phospholipid membrane made of 1,2-dipalmitoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC). Using differential scanning calorimetry it was found that SL altered the phase behaviour of DPPC at low molar fractions, producing fluid phase immiscibility with the result of formation of biosurfactant-enriched domains within the phospholipid bilayer. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that SL interacted with DPPC increasing ordering of the phospholipid acyl chain palisade and hydration of the lipid/water interface. Small angle X-ray scattering showed that SL did not modify bilayer thickness in the biologically relevant Lα fluid phase. SL was found to induce contents leakage in 1-palmitoy-2-oleoy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) unilamellar liposomes, at sublytic concentrations below the cmc. This SL-induced membrane permeabilization at concentrations below the onset for membrane solubilization can be the result of the formation of laterally segregated domains, which might contribute to provide a molecular basis for the reported antimicrobial actions of SLs.","Franco Marcelino, Paulo Ricardo; Ortiz, Julia; da Silva, Silvio Silvério; Ortiz, Antonio","Colloids and surfaces.

This scoping review sought to address this gap. METHODS Databases were searched for papers reporting on the use of e-health services by older adults, defined as being aged 60 years or older, with specific reference to barriers and facilitators to e-health use. RESULT 14 papers were included and synthesised into five thematic categories and related subthemes. Results are discussed with reference to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology2. The most prevalent barriers to e-health engagement were a lack of self-efficacy, knowledge, support, functionality, and information provision about the benefits of e-health for older adults. Key facilitators were active engagement of the target end users in the design and delivery of e-health programs, support for overcoming concerns privacy and enhancing self-efficacy in the use of technology, and integration of e-health programs across health services to accommodate the multi-morbidity with which older adults typically present. CONCLUSION E-health offers a potential solution to overcome the barriers faced by older adults to access timely, effective, and acceptable health care for physical and mental health.

Antiviral treatment may be considered for any previously healthy, symptomatic outpatient not at high risk for influenza complications in whom an influenza diagnosis is confirmed or suspected, if treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of illness onset, and for children whose siblings or household contacts either are younger than 6 months or have a high-risk condition that predisposes them to complications of influenza.",,Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-024588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900875/,439

The extent of its clinical picture is actively evolving and has yet to be fully elucidated. While neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are well-described in the adult population, reports of neurologic complications in pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are limited. We present a pediatric patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection with development of multisystem inflammatory syndrome and acute encephalopathy causing delirium who was found to have a cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum on neuroimaging. Cytotoxic lesions of the corpus callosum are a well-known, typically reversible entity that can occur in a wide range of conditions, including infection, seizure, toxins, nutritional deficiencies, and Kawasaki disease. We hypothesized that the cytotoxic lesion of the corpus callosum, in the index case, was secondary to the systemic inflammation from SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children.","Lin, J; Lawson, E C; Verma, S; Peterson, R B; Sidhu, R",AJNR.

90895,N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,2019,"OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) treatment prior to endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is associated with better outcomes in patients with anterior circulation large artery occlusion (LAO) stroke, we examined a large real-world database, the SITS-International Stroke Thrombectomy Register (SITS-ISTR). METHODS We identified centers recording ≥10 consecutive patients in the SITS-ISTR, with at least 70% available modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 3 months during 2014-19. We defined LAO as intracranial internal carotid artery, first and second segment of middle cerebral artery and first segment of anterior cerebral artery. Main outcomes were functional independence (mRS 0-2) and death at 3 months and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) per modified SITS-MOST. We performed propensity score matched (PSM) and multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Of 6350 patients from 42 centers, 3944 (62.1%) received IVT. IVT+EVT treated patients had less frequent atrial fibrillation, ongoing anticoagulation, previous stroke, heart failure and pre-stroke disability. PSM analysis showed that IVT+EVT patients had a higher rate of functional independence than EVT alone patients (46.4% vs. 40.3%, p<0.001) and a lower rate of death at 3 months (20.3% vs. 23.3%, p=0.035). SICH rates (3.5% vs. 3.0%, p= 0.42) were similar in both groups. Multivariate adjustment yielded results consistent with PSM. INTERPRETATION Pretreatment with IVT was associated with favorable outcomes in EVT-treated LAO stroke in the SITS Thrombectomy Registry. These findings, while indicative of international routine clinical practice, are limited by observational design, unmeasured confounding and possible residual confounding by indication. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE This study provides Class II evidence that IVT prior to EVT increases the probability of functional independence at 3 months compared to EVT alone.","Ahmed, Niaz; Mazya, Michael; Nunes, Ana Paiva; Moreira, Tiago; Ollikainen, Jyrki P; Escudero-Martinez, Irene; Bigliardi, Guido; Dorado, Laura; Dávalos, Antoni; Egido, Jose A; Tassi, Rossana; Strbian, Daniel; Zini, Andrea; Nichelli, Paolo; Herzig, Roman; Jurák, Lubomír; Hurtikova, Eva; Tsivgoulis, Georgios; Peeters, Andre; Nevšímalová, Miroslava; Brozman, Miroslav; Cavallo, Roberto; Lees, Kennedy R; Mikulik, Robert; Toni, Danilo; Holmin, Staffan",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012327; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34088873/,439
91650,The Need for Chemo-Thromboprophylaxis Protocols in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients.,2020-12-05,"BACKGROUND Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expressed on tumor and immune cells are both associated with the response to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway blockade therapy. Here, we examine the role of CD8+PD-L1+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (Tils) in the tumor microenvironment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Tumor tissue samples of a total of 378 patients from two NSCLC cohorts were collected retrospectively. Tumor genetic variations were measured by targeted next-generation sequencing of 543 oncogenes. Tils were assessed by multiplex immunohistochemistry assay. Correlations among Tils, tumor genetic variations, and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS The levels of CD8+PD-L1+ Tils varied in NSCLC tumor tissues. Tumor samples with high CD8+PD-L1+ Tils had higher levels of CD8+ Tils, CD68+ macrophages, PD-L1+ tumor cells, PD-1+ Tils, and CD163+ M2-type macrophages, and also had a higher tumor mutation burden, all of which collectively constituted a typically hot but immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in a non-immunotherapy cohort, we observed that the higher the CD8+PD-L1+ Tils level in the tumor tissue, the worse the prognosis (progression-free survival; cohort A, stage I-II tumor; p=0.005). Contrarily, in an immunotherapy cohort, where the immune suppression was blocked by anti-PD-1 treatment, the higher the CD8+PD-L1+ Tils level, the better the response to the anti-PD-1 treatment (complete response/partial response vs stable disease/progressive disease; cohort B; p=0.0337). CONCLUSIONS CD8+PD-L1+ Tils may be an indicator of the hot but immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment which is related to a high tumor mutation burden. PD-1 pathway blockade therapy can help to mitigate this immunosuppression and obtain better curative effects.","Zhang, Libin; Chen, Yanhui; Wang, Han; Xu, Zheyuan; Wang, Yang; Li, Sixing; Liu, Jun; Chen, Yun; Luo, Hongli; Wu, Lijia; Yang, Ying; Zhang, Henghui; Peng, Hao",Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140315/,439

In the telencephalic neuroepithelium, this is controlled in part by cell adhesion molecules and regulators of progenitor cell lineage, but the specific orchestration of these processes remains unknown. Here, we studied the role of microRNAs in the embryonic telencephalon as key regulators of gene expression. By using the early recombiner Rx-Cre mouse, we identify novel and critical roles of miRNAs in early brain development, demonstrating they are essential to preserve the cellular homeostasis and structural integrity of the telencephalic neuroepithelium. We show that Rx-Cre;DicerF/F mouse embryos have a severe disruption of the telencephalic apical junction belt, followed by invagination of the ventricular surface and formation of hyperproliferative rosettes. Transcriptome analyses and functional experiments in vivo show that these defects result from upregulation of Irs2 upon loss of let-7 miRNAs in an apoptosis-independent manner. Our results reveal an unprecedented relevance of miRNAs in early forebrain development, with potential mechanistic implications in pediatric brain cancer.","Fernández, Virginia; Martínez-Martínez, Maria Ángeles; Prieto-Colomina, Anna; Cárdenas, Adrián; Soler, Rafael; Dori, Martina; Tomasello, Ugo; Nomura, Yuki; López-Atalaya, José P; Calegari, Federico; Borrell, Víctor",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020105479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985705/,439

One of the least understood components of the autophagy machinery is the transmembrane protein ATG9. Here, we report a cryoelectron microscopy structure of the human ATG9A isoform at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure reveals a fold with a homotrimeric domain-swapped architecture, multiple membrane spans, and a network of branched cavities, consistent with ATG9A being a membrane transporter. Mutational analyses support a role for the cavities in the function of ATG9A. In addition, structure-guided molecular simulations predict that ATG9A causes membrane bending, explaining the localization of this protein to small vesicles and highly curved edges of growing autophagosomes.","Guardia, Carlos M; Tan, Xiao-Feng; Lian, Tengfei; Rana, Mitra S; Zhou, Wenchang; Christenson, Eric T; Lowry, Augustus J; Faraldo-Gómez, José D; Bonifacino, Juan S; Jiang, Jiansen; Banerjee, Anirban",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32610138/,439

93169,Knowledge is coming so fast that a meta-analysis of COVID-19 treatment is always too late.,2020-09-30,"The induction of Smad signaling by the extracellular ligand TGF-β promotes tissue plasticity and cell migration in developmental and pathological contexts. Here we show that vaccinia virus (VACV) stimulates activity of Smad transcription factors and expression of TGF-β/Smad-responsive genes at the transcript and protein levels. Accordingly, infected cells share characteristics to those undergoing TGF-β/Smad-mediated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Depletion of the Smad4 protein, a common mediator of TGF-β signaling, results in an attenuation of viral cell-to-cell spread and reduced motility of infected cells. VACV induction of TGF-β/Smad-responsive gene expression does not require the TGF-β ligand or type I and type II TGF-β receptors, suggesting a novel, non-canonical Smad signaling pathway. Additionally, the spread of ectromelia virus, a related orthopoxvirus that does not activate a TGF-β/Smad-response, is enhanced by the addition of exogenous TGF-β. Together, our results indicate that VACV orchestrates a TGF-β-like response via a unique activation mechanism to enhance cell migration and promote virus spread.

93749,Methods for a Seamless Transition from Tracheostomy to Spontaneous Breathing in COVID-19 Patients.,2020-08-05,"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are implicated in host defense and inflammatory disease, but these potential functional roles need more precise definition, particularly using advanced technologies to better target ILC2s and engaging experimental models that better manifest both acute infection and chronic, even lifelong, disease. In this study, we use a mouse model that applies an improved genetic definition of ILC2s via IL-7r-conditional Rora gene targeting and takes advantage of a distinct progression from acute illness to chronic disease, based on a persistent type 2 immune response to respiratory infection with a natural pathogen (Sendai virus). We first show that ILC2s are activated but are not required to handle acute illness after respiratory viral infection. In contrast, we find that this type of infection also activates ILC2s chronically for IL-13 production and consequent asthma-like disease traits that peak and last long after active viral infection is cleared. However, to manifest this type of disease, the Csf1-dependent myeloid-macrophage lineage is also active at two levels: first, at a downstream level, this lineage provides lung tissue macrophages (interstitial macrophages and tissue monocytes) that represent a major site of Il13 gene expression in the diseased lung; and second, at an upstream level, this same lineage is required for Il33 gene induction that is necessary to activate ILC2s for participation in disease at all, including IL-13 production. Together, these findings provide a revised scheme for understanding and controlling the innate immune response leading to long-term postviral lung diseases with features of asthma and related progressive conditions.","Wu, Kangyun; Wang, Xinyu; Keeler, Shamus P; Gerovac, Benjamin J; Agapov, Eugene V; Byers, Derek E; Gilfillan, Susan; Colonna, Marco; Zhang, Yong; Holtzman, Michael J",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641386/,439
94249,A region-specific clustering approach to investigate risk-factors in mortality rate during COVID-19: comprehensive statistical analysis from 208 countries.,2021-03-22,"PURPOSE G protein-coupled receptor agonists are being used as radiolabeled vectors for in vivo localization and therapy of tumors. Recently, somatostatin-based antagonists were shown to be superior to agonists. Here, we compare the new [111In/68Ga]-labeled bombesin-based antagonist RM1 with the agonist [111In]-AMBA for targeting the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN IC50, Kd values, and antagonist potency were determined using PC-3 and HEK-GRPR cells. Biodistribution and imaging studies were done in nude mice transplanted with the PC-3 tumor. The antagonist potency was assessed by evaluating the effects on calcium release and on receptor internalization monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS The IC50 value of [(nat)In]-RM1 was 14 +/- 3.4 nmol/L. [(nat/111)In]-RM1 was found to bind to the GRPR with a Kd of 8.5 +/- 2.7 nmol/L compared with a Kd of 0.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/L of [111In]-AMBA. A higher maximum number of binding site value was observed for [111In]-RM1 (2.4 +/- 0.2 nmol/L) compared with [111In]-AMBA (0.7 +/- 0.1 nmol/L). [(nat)Lu]-AMBA is a potent agonist in the immunofluorescence-based internalization assay, whereas [(nat)In]-RM1 is inactive alone but efficiently antagonizes the bombesin effect. These data are confirmed by the calcium release assay. The pharmacokinetics showed a superiority of the radioantagonist with regard to the high tumor uptake (13.4 +/- 0.8% IA/g versus 3.69 +/- 0.75% IA/g at 4 hours after injection. as well as to all tumor-to-normal tissue ratios. CONCLUSION Despite their relatively low GRPR affinity, the antagonists [111In/68Ga]-RM1 showed superior targeting properties compared with [111In]-AMBA. As found for somatostatin receptor-targeting radiopeptides, GRP-based radioantagonists seem to be superior to radioagonists for in vivo imaging and potentially also for targeted radiotherapy of GRPR-positive tumors.","Mansi, Rosalba; Wang, Xuejuan; Forrer, Flavio; Kneifel, Stefan; Tamma, Maria-Luisa; Waser, Beatrice; Cescato, Renzo; Reubi, Jean Claude; Maecke, Helmut R",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.ccr-08-3145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19671861/,439

A total of 316 IVC filter retrievals were attempted. In 25 cases, the standard technique had failed and our modified loop snare technique was subsequently attempted in 21 of these patients.The retrievals were successful in 20 cases (mean dwell time, 42.6 days, range, 14-102 days). The dwell time of the one failure was 46 days. The retrieval rate increased from 92.1% with the standard technique to 98.4% with the combination of the standard and modified loop snare technique. Unsuccessful retrieval was due to migration and endothelialization of the filter. This technique can also be used to remove migrated coils which cannot be captured by standard techniques. There were no complications from the retrievals.Tilt and endothelialization of filters are the main factors resulting in unsuccessful retrievals with the standard technique. In the present study, we describe an alternative technique for difficult IVC filter retrievals, which can also be used to capture migrated coils and occluders in the aorta and heart.","Su, Qingbo; Ding, Xiangjiu; Dong, Zhaoru; Liu, Yang; Li, Guangzhen; Jiang, Jianjun",International heart journal,https://doi.org/10.1536/ihj.18-075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30518716/,439

In on-ground, classroom-based education, these programs are commonly used on University-owned devices with software preinstalled. Remote education typically involves the use of student-owned devices, which complicates the use of such software, owing to the fact that (a) student devices have differing configurations (e.g., Windows vs MacOS) and processing power, and (b) not all student devices are suitable for use with such software. Smartphones are near-ubiquitous devices, with smartphone ownership exceeding personal computer ownership, according to a recent survey.

Our institution routinely performs TEP procedures for patients with primary or recurrent inguinal hernias. The aim of this study was to show that supervised senior residents can safely perform TEP repairs in a teaching setting. METHODS All consecutive patients treated for inguinal hernias by laparoscopic approach from October 2008 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed from a prospective database. RESULTS A total of 219 TEP repairs were performed on 171 patients: 123 unilateral and 48 bilateral. The mean patient age was 51.6 years with a standard deviation (SD) of ± 15.9. Supervised senior residents performed 171 (78 %) and staff surgeons 48 (22 %) TEP repairs, respectively. Thirty-day morbidity included cases of inguinal paresthesias (0.4 %, n = 1), umbilical hematomas (0.9 %, n = 2), superficial wound infections (0.9 %, n = 2), scrotal hematomas (2.7 %, n = 6), postoperative urinary retentions (2.7 %, n = 6), chronic pain syndromes (5 %, n = 11) and postoperative seromas (6.7 %, n = 14). Overall, complication rates were 18.7 % for staff surgeons and 19.3 % for residents (p = 0.83).

A Systematic Review of Controlled Trials.,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND It has been hypothesized that patients who are super-super morbidly obese, defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 60 kg/m(2) or higher, have an increased rate of postoperative complications. As surgical techniques and operator experience with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass improved with time, the selection criteria have expanded to include the super-super morbidly obese. We hypothesize that a higher BMI does not predict a higher postoperative complication rate. METHODS The prospectively collected database for our Accredited Bariatric Program was queried for all laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures performed between January 2004 and July 2006. All cases were performed by a single surgeon at a tertiary-care center. Average postoperative follow-up time was 1 year. Patients were stratified into two groups: BMI < 60 kg/m(2) and BMI >or= 60 kg/m(2). The number of postoperative complications was compared between the two groups using a chi-square method with Yates correction. RESULTS One hundred and sixty-nine patients with adequate follow-up data were identified during the study period. Of these, 148 patients had BMI < 60 kg/m(2) (group 1) and 21 had BMI >or= 60 kg/m(2) (group 2). There were 28 (19%) total complications in group 1, and 4 (19%) total complications in group 2. There was no statistical difference between the two groups (p = 0.98). Stricture rate was 10% in group 1 and 5% in group 2. CONCLUSION Patients with BMI >or= 60 kg/m(2) do not have a higher postoperative morbidity compared with other patients undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The stricture rate is less in patients with BMI >or= 60 kg/m(2) compared with other patients. Longer follow-up is required to detect complications that occur after 1 year.

Twelve healthy young male participants underwent four 90-min trials comprising 70 min walking and 20 min resting periods. Cooling strategies adopted in this work were CON (control), PCM-control (PCMs were removed at the end of exercise), Fan-control (fans were switched OFF during the initial 20 min) and PCM&Fan-control (fans were turned ON after 20 min exercising and PCMs were removed after the 70-min exercise). Results demonstrated that the control of electric fans could suppress the mean skin temperature rise to 34.0 °C by over 15 min and also cut down the energy consumption of the HPCS from 15.6 W h to 12.1 W h over the entire 90-min trials. Thus, it is recommended that fans should be turned off at the beginning of hot exposure and switched on once participants felt warm. Our findings also showed that the removal of fully melted PCM packs from the HPCS could enhance the evaporative cooling effect brought about by air circulation. The removal of melted PCMs significantly reduced the physical load by 37.3% and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were decreased by 3.5-4.2 RPE units. This could also help quickly restore the PCM energy for future usage. In summary, cooling strategies demonstrated in this work could improve HPCS's overall cooling performance on workers while working in the studied hot environment.","Wang, Faming; Ke, Ying; Udayraj,; Yang, Bin; Xu, Pengjun; Noor, Nuruzzaman",Journal of thermal biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.102655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888559/,439
99408,COVID-19 pandemic: preventing hospital myocardial infarction admissions or preventing acute myocardial infarction altogether?,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND There is no consensus and a limited evidence base for choice of contrast agents (CA) in angiography. This study evaluated the impact of iohexol and iodixanol CA on fibrinolytic factors (tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA] and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [PAI-1]), as well as platelet-monocyte conjugates in cardiac patients undergoing elective angiography in a double-blind, randomised parallel group study. METHODS Patients (men, 50-70 years old; n = 12) were randomised to receive either iohexol (Omnipaque; n = 6) or iodixanol (Visipaque; n = 6) during elective angiography at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness, UK. Arterial and venous blood samples were drawn prior to CA delivery and following angiography. Assessment of platelet-monocyte conjugation, t-PA and PAI-1 antigen and activity was conducted in samples pre- and post-angiography. OUTCOME Plasma t-PA antigen was depressed equally in the study groups after angiography, but there was a greater reduction in PAI-1 antigen in the group receiving iodixanol. These findings corresponded to a substantial reduction in t-PA activity in patients receiving iohexol, with no change in those receiving iodixanol (P = 0.023 between the CA groups). Both CAs caused a reduction in platelet-monocyte conjugation, with no difference between the groups. No adverse events were reported during the trial. CONCLUSION Avoiding reduced plasma t-PA activity might be an important consideration in choosing iodixanol over iohexol in patients at risk of thrombosis following angiography.

99492,Construction and validation of checklist for disinfecting ambulances to transport Covid-19 patients.,2021,"Most people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries are treated with generic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs produced by manufacturers in India - the ""pharmacy of the developing world"". India's nationwide lockdown in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic therefore prompted concerns about disruption to this essential supply. A preliminary assessment of ARV drug manufacturers in India in March 2020 indicated a range of concerns. This prompted a rapid questionnaire-based survey in May 2020 of eight manufacturers that account for most of India's ARV drug exports. The greatest challenges reported were in international shipping, including delays, increased lead times and rising costs. Contrary to expectations, lack of access to the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) required for ARV drug manufacture was not a major hindrance, as manufacturers reported that their reliance on China for API supplies had reduced in recent years. However, their reliance on overseas markets for the raw materials required for local API synthesis was a major challenge. The findings from this survey have implications for addressing some of the immediate and medium-term concerns about the production and supply of generic ARV drugs. Long-term orders to support multi-month dispensing and buffer stocks need to be in place, together with computerized inventory management systems with real-time information from the lowest-level dispensation unit. Manufacturers and industry associations should have regular, formal interaction with the key ministries of the Government of India regarding these issues. Measures to improve the resilience of the generic ARV drug supply system are essential to minimize ongoing supply shocks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and to prepare for future emergencies.","Rewari, Bharat Bhushan; Mangadan-Konath, Nabeel; Sharma, Mukta",WHO South-East Asia journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.4103/2224-3151.294306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32978345/,439

Two testing methods are currently used for MERS-CoV diagnostics: nucleic acid detection (the gold standard) and serological analysis. In this study, we evaluated the detection of MERS-CoV-IgG in suspected and proven cases of MERS-CoV infection. We enrolled 174 patients: 113 had respiratory symptoms/suspected MERS-CoV infection, 31 had confirmed influenza A or B infection, 23 had a recent confirmed MERS-CoV infection, and 7 had confirmed MERS-CoV infection 1 year before. All underwent MERS-CoV RNA and MERS-CoV-IgG testing. Thirty patients were found to be MERS-CoV RNA positive; however, during serological analysis, only 6 (3.4%) patients were positive for MERS-CoV-IgG, 1 (0.6%) patient was equivocal, and 167 (96%) patients were negative. Among the serological positives, four were recently MERS-CoV RNA positive and two were MERS-CoV RNA negative. No cross-reactivity to influenza A or B was detected. Based on the lack of correlation between nucleic acid and serological analysis, we conclude that MERS-CoV-IgG testing may not be suitable for diagnosing acute infection or estimating its prevalence during an outbreak. In addition, our findings show that MERS-CoV-IgG may not have significant value in determining disease severity or prognosis.","Alhetheel, Abdulkarim; Altalhi, Haifa; Albarrag, Ahmed; Shakoor, Zahid; Mohamed, Deqa; El-Hazmi, Malak; Somily, Ali; Barry, Mazin; Bakhrebah, Muhammed; Nassar, Majed",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2017.0091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28873020/,439
101867,The predictive value of universal preschool developmental assessment in identifying children with later educational difficulties: A systematic review.,2021,"BACKGROUND Whether inflammatory responses to surgery are comparably activated during total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and during volatile anesthesia remains unclear. We thus compared the perioperative effects of TIVA and isoflurane anesthesia on plasma concentrations of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory interleukins and cell adhesion molecules. METHODS Patients having laparoscopic cholecystectomies were randomly allocated to two groups: 44 were assigned to TIVA and 44 to isoflurane anesthesia. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and the cellular adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were determined preoperatively, before incision, and at 2 and 24 hours postoperatively. Our primary outcomes were area-under-the-curve cytokine and adhesion molecule concentrations over 24 postoperative hours. RESULTS The only statistically significant difference in area-under-the-curve concentrations was for IL-6, which was greater in patients given isoflurane:78 (95% confidence interval (CI): 52 to 109) pg/ml versus 33 (22 to 50) pg/ml, P= 0.006. Two hours after surgery, IL-6 was significantly greater than baseline in patients assigned to isoflurane: 47 (95% CI: 4 to 216, P<0.001) pg/ml versus 18 (95%CI: 4 to 374, P<0.001) pg/ml in the TIVA group. In contrast, IL-10 was significantly greater in patients assigned to TIVA: 20 (95% CI: 2 to 140, P<0.001) pg/ml versus 12 (95% CI: 3 to 126, P<0.001) pg/ml. By 24 hours after surgery, concentrations were generally similar between study groups and similar to baseline values. CONCLUSION The only biomarker whose postoperative area-under-the-curve concentrations differed significantly as a function of anesthetic management was IL-6. Two hours after surgery, IL-6 concentrations were significantly greater in patients given isoflurane than TIVA. However, the differences were modest and seem unlikely to prove clinically important. Further studies are needed.","Ionescu, Daniela C; Margarit, Simona Claudia D; Hadade, Adina Norica I; Mocan, Teodora N; Miron, Nicolae A; Sessler, Daniel I",Perioperative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/2047-0525-2-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24472144/,439
101911,Global Access to OpenWHO's Online Learning Resources for COVID-19.,2020-06-26,"Synovitis is considered as one of the factors associated with the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA). There is currently a significant amount of research linking estrogen deficiencies with the development of OA in estrogen-deficient women, including postmenopausal women; however, the exact etiology remains unclear. Various neuropeptides, such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), have been shown to contribute to synovitis in OA joints, and the influence of estrogen on the expressions of SP and CGRP in the synovium of OA joints has been noted. After ovariectomy (OVX) followed by estradiol (E2) replacement, 24 female rats were divided into three groups: OVX group, OVX + E2 replacement group (E2 group), and a sham group. All rats underwent transection of the anterior cruciate ligament at the same time. After 30 days, the histological findings of knee joints by hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunofluorescence staining of protein gene product 9.5 (pan-neuronal marker), SP, and CGRP were compared among experimental groups. The degree of synovitis in the OVX group was higher than in the E2 and sham groups. No significant differences in the density of protein gene product 9.5-immunoreactive nerve fibers were observed among the three experimental groups, but the density of SP- or CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the OVX group was significantly higher than in the E2 and sham groups. These findings suggest that estrogen partly regulates intraarticular neurogenic inflammation in OA joints by modulating the expressions of neuropeptides in the synovium.","Yoshida, Atsuhiko; Morihara, Toru; Matsuda, Ken-ichi; Sakamoto, Hirotaka; Arai, Yuji; Kida, Yoshikazu; Kawata, Mitsuhiro; Kubo, Toshikazu",Connective tissue research,https://doi.org/10.3109/03008207.2011.628059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22141435/,439

However, it soon became evident that the effectiveness of adalimumab in daily practice was highly variable. A significant unmet medical need of HS patients remained, and the search for novel therapeutic targets was intensified. During the 10th European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation (EHSF) e.V. Conference, reknown international HS investigators virtually presented and discussed the published data on these potential target molecules for future HS treatment. This article addresses the most promising molecules currently under investigation from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view. With phase III trials ongoing, the anti- interleukin (IL)-17 biologics bimekizumab and secukinumab are in the most advanced stage of clinical development showing promising results. In addition, targeting IL-1α with bermekimab has shown encouraging results in two clinical trials. Directing treatment at neutrophil recruitment and activation by targeting IL-36 with spesolimab fits well in the pathogenic concept of HS and clinical phase II trial results are pending. In contrast to in situ evidence, Complement 5a (C5a) and C5a receptor blockade have only shown greater clinical benefit in patients with severe HS. Inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 signalling in HS showed clinical efficacy only in the highest dosage, highlighting that careful surveillance of the balance between safety and efficacy of JAK inhibition is warranted. Overall, clinical efficacies of all novel treatments reported so far are modest. To guide drug development, more and better-defined translational data on the pathogenesis of this severe and enigmatic inflammatory skin disease are required.","Zouboulis, Christos C; Frew, John W; Giamarellos-Bourboulis, Evangelos J; Jemec, Gregor B E; Del Marmol, Veronique; Marzano, Angelo V; Nikolakis, Georgios; Sayed, Christopher J; Tzellos, Thrasyvoulos; Wolk, Kerstin; Prens, Errol P",Experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34085329/,439

This study focusses on three different treatment processes by characterizing all arising fractions in detail. Thereby the factors influencing the composition of these fractions are identified and their recycling potential in Switzerland is investigated. However, high legislative requirements on total contents of heavy metals represent a high barrier for bottom ash recycling in Switzerland. Therefore, the recycling potential is further evaluated based on the waste legislation applied in the Netherlands, where recycling of bottom ash has a long tradition. There, threshold values for bottom ash recycling are based on leachate concentrations and not on total contents as in Switzerland. However, Swiss Waste Legislation also knows threshold values based on leachate concentrations for certain waste materials. The leaching tests applied in these two countries, however, are different. The comparison of both leaching tests reveals that the setup and conditions, especially the considered pH range, significantly influence the leaching of heavy metals. With emphasis on problematic pollutants, the possibilities for new applications of these fractions are evaluated based on Swiss and Dutch legal threshold values. The comparison within the legal frameworks of these two countries allows recognizing opportunities and risks related to bottom ash recycling.","Glauser, Andreas; Weibel, Gisela; Eggenberger, Urs","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x211038149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407717/,439

Several fibrosis inhibitors have been used in the past in an endeavor for better functional outcome. PURPOSE The goal of this study was to evaluate DuraSeal Xact Adhesion Barrier and Sealant System (DSX), a polyethylene glycol-based synthetic fibrosis inhibitor, for its ability to reduce postoperative pain after lumbar microdiscectomy. STUDY DESIGN This is a prospective randomized controlled study. PATIENT SAMPLE Twenty patients between 19 and 71 years of age about to undergo elective lumbar single-level discectomy were randomized into two groups of 10. OUTCOME MEASURES Assessments included the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the short form (SF)-36 questionnaire, and the Oswestry low back pain scale, preoperatively and at discharge, and 30, 90, and 180 days after surgery. METHODS One group was treated with DSX, and the control group received the local standard of care. DSX was applied as a thin layer on the nerve root and surrounding area after microdiscectomy. RESULTS The VAS pain scale was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 43.9% versus 35.6%, 64.3% versus 44.8%, and 75.4% versus 59.6%. The SF-36 scores in the DSX treatment group showed more improvement than in the control group as soon as 30 days for physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, mental health, and emotional patterns, and by 90 days for bodily pain and general health. The Oswestry pain score was lower at all time points in the DSX treatment group than in the control group. The reductions at 30, 90, and 180 days for DSX and control groups, respectively, were 41.5% versus 34.3%, 68.2% versus 42.4%, and 73.3% versus 55.4%. Wound healing was normal in the DSX treatment group, there were no complications related to DSX use, and no patient in either group required reoperation. CONCLUSIONS Although this study is too small to have conclusions of efficacy and will need confirmation by larger trials, treatment of a microdiscectomy site with DSX for fibrosis prevention shows promising results in terms of safety, reduction of postoperative pain and functional results when compared to control with the additional advantage of being suitable for use in the presence of a dural tear.","Fransen, Patrick",The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spinee.2010.05.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20542472/,439

Reply to Br J Anaesth 2021; 126: e101-2.,2021-04-27,"Background: Approximately 55-87% of the patients undergoing craniotomy experience moderate to severe pain during the first 48 hrs after surgery, which negatively influences patients' postoperative rehabilitation. Recently, local infiltration of analgesia (LIA) has been widely performed clinically as a promising analgesic method that could avoid the side effects of analgesics but only has a short pain-free duration; researchers have clarified that the addition of dexamethasone to LIA could provide significant analgesic effects and significantly prolong the duration of analgesic effects without obvious complications for various types of surgeries. To date, no studies have evaluated the addition of dexamethasone to LIA for patients receiving craniotomy. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that pre-emptive scalp infiltration with a steroid (dexamethasone) plus a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) could achieve superior postoperative analgesic effects to a local anesthetic (ropivacaine) alone in adult patients undergoing a craniotomy. Study design and methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial that will include one intervention and one control group involving a total of 140 adults scheduled for elective craniotomy for resection of supratentorial tumors under general anesthesia and with an anticipated full recovery within 2 hrs postoperatively. The intervention will involve pre-emptive scalp infiltration with ropivacaine plus dexamethasone (the dexamethasone group) or ropivacaine alone (the control group), and the participants in both groups will complete a 6-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be the cumulative sufentanil consumption within 48 hrs postoperatively. Discussion: The intervention, if effective, this study will provide clinically important information on the role of dexamethasone in scalp infiltration for post-craniotomy pain management.","Jia, Yitong; Zhao, Chunmei; Ren, Hao; Wang, Tao; Luo, Fang",Journal of pain research,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s190679; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31213883/,439

Hernias with an upper margin above the arcuate line encounter technical difficulties, and the differences in repair methods forced us to define them as large suprapubic hernias. AIM To present our experience with laparoscopic repair of large suprapubic hernias that allows adequate mesh overlap. MATERIAL AND METHODS Nineteen patients with suprapubic incisional hernias who underwent laparoscopic repair between May 2013 and January 2015 were included in the study. Patients with laparoscopic extraperitoneal repair who had a suprapubic hernia with an upper margin below the arcuate line were excluded. RESULTS Two men and 17 women, with a mean age of 58.2, underwent laparoscopic repair. Most of the incisions were midline vertical (13/68.4%). Twelve (63.1%) of the patients had previous incisional hernia repair (PIHR group); the mean number of previous incisional hernia repair was 1.4. Mean defect size of the PIHR group was higher than in patients without previous repair - 107.3 cm2 vs. 50.9 cm2 (p < 0.05). Mean operating time of the PIHR group was higher than in patients without repair - 126 min vs. 77.9 min (p < 0.05). Although all complications occurred in the PIHR group, there was no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic repair of large suprapubic hernias can be considered as the first option in treatment. The low recurrence rates reported in the literature and the lack of recurrence, as observed in our study, support this view.","Sikar, Hasan Ediz; Çetin, Kenan; Eyvaz, Kemal; Kaptanoglu, Levent; Küçük, Hasan Fehmi",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2017.68794; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29062444/,439

Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens.

METHODS Pre-operative computed tomography images from 194 patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA and 118 non-arthritic controls were utilized. All patients had varus knee alignment (mean age: 57 ± 11 years; 45% female). The hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA), medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and non-weight-bearing joint line convergence angle (nwJLCA) were compared between ""control group"" and ""HTO group"". Femoral and tibial phenotypes were also assessed and compared between groups. Variables found on univariate analysis to be different between the groups were entered into a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS The mean age was lower (Δ = 4 ± 6 years, p = 0.024), body mass index (BMI) was higher (Δ = 1.1 ± 2.8 kg/m2, p = 0.032) and there were more females (Δ = 14%, p = 0.020) in the HTO group. The HTO group had more overall varus (7° ± 4.7° vs 4.8° ± 1.3°, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference in the mean mLDFA between the two groups with the HTO group having more femoral varus (88.7 ± 3.2° vs 87.3 ± 1.8°, p < 0.001). MPTA was similar between the groups (p = 0.881). Age was found to be a strong determinant for femoral varus (p = 0.03). CONCLUSION Patients undergoing HTO for medial knee OA have more femoral varus compared to non-arthritic controls while tibial morphology was similar. This will be an important consideration in pre-operating planning for realignment osteotomy in patients presenting with medial knee OA and warrants further investigation.

108360,Duodenal Metastasis from a Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasm.,2020-08-22,"While mutation is the driving force behind evolution, most mutations are detrimental; therefore, elevating the mutation rate of a virus should diminish fitness. Because riboviruses and retroviruses have high mutation rates, a small increase in their mutation rates could exceed their threshold of viability. This approach, elevation of the viral mutation rate beyond the threshold of viability, extinction catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis, was proposed over a decade ago as a novel chemotherapeutic strategy. Extinction catastrophe induced by promutagenic nucleosides has been demonstrated in cell culture models, but most mutagens are carcinogenic and are poorly tolerated. Thus, clinical translation of viral mutagens has been difficult, casting doubt on the clinical viability of this strategy. This Perspective covers recent advances in the use of promutagenic nucleosides and the Vif-APOBEC interaction as chemotherapeutic strategies for targeting viral mutation rates.","Bonnac, Laurent F; Mansky, Louis M; Patterson, Steven E",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jm400653j; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23914828/,439

110170,Addressing multiple gastroenterological aspects of COVID-19.,2020-05-01,"Mental health clinicians worldwide have been expressing concerns regarding the broad psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.","Tzur Bitan, Dana; Grossman-Giron, Ariella; Bloch, Yuval; Mayer, Yael; Shiffman, Noga; Mendlovic, Shlomo",Psychiatry research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32540750/,439

METHODS A cross-sectional study was conducted, with self-reported data of students from 14 Cuban universities of medical sciences (n=200), through an online survey. The EEP-10-C was used as an instrument to identify stress. Its validity was determined through a confirmatory factor analysis and its internal consistency and reliability was measured by the Cronbach's alpha. A cluster analysis was performed to establish as the cut-off point the centre of the cluster with the highest values of stress perceived by the scale. RESULTS The average age of the sample was 23.30± 1.91 years, with observed scores of the EEP-10-C between 0 and 29 points (13.25±5.404). When applying the cut-off point ≥25, only two students had high rates of perceived stress. The confirmatory factor analysis supported the validity of the instrument (α=0.755). The cut-off point ≥20 was proposed as a reference of high stress perceived for the study population, when applying this one, 14% of students presented high rates of stress. CONCLUSIONS In Cuba, students of the medical sciences have participated in research and healthcare support, despite which they have presented low levels of stress. The main contribution of the research was the validation of the EEP-10-C for its use in assessing levels of stress in Cuban medical students, proposing the cut-off point ≥20 as a reference of high stress perceived.","Hernández-García, Frank; Góngora Gómez, Onelis; González-Velázquez, Victor Ernesto; Pedraza-Rodríguez, Elys María; Zamora-Fung, Rolando; Lazo Herrera, Luis Alberto",Revista colombiana de psiquiatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcp.2021.02.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33985764/,439

Failure-to-rescue, the rate of death following complications, is an important quality measure for perioperative care but has not been investigated across multiple health care systems. Methods We analysed data collected during the International Surgical Outcomes Study, an international 7-day cohort study of adults undergoing elective inpatient surgery. Hospitals were ranked by quintiles according to surgical procedural volume (Q1 lowest to Q5 highest). For each quintile we assessed in-hospital complications rates, mortality, and failure-to-rescue. We repeated this analysis ranking hospitals by risk-adjusted complication rates (Q1 lowest to Q5 highest). Results A total of 44 814 patients from 474 hospitals in 27 low-, middle-, and high-income countries were available for analysis. Of these, 7508 (17%) developed one or more postoperative complication, with 207 deaths in hospital (0.5%), giving an overall failure-to-rescue rate of 2.8%. When hospitals were ranked in quintiles by procedural volume, we identified a three-fold variation in mortality (Q1: 0.6% vs Q5: 0.2%) and a two-fold variation in failure-to-rescue (Q1: 3.6% vs Q5: 1.7%). Ranking hospitals in quintiles by risk-adjusted complication rate further confirmed the presence of important variations in failure-to-rescue, indicating differences between hospitals in the risk of death among patients after they develop complications. Conclusions Comparison of failure-to-rescue rates across health care systems suggests the presence of preventable postoperative deaths. Using such metrics, developing nations could benefit from a data-driven approach to quality improvement, which has proved effective in high-income countries.","Ahmad, T; Bouwman, R A; Grigoras, I; Aldecoa, C; Hofer, C; Hoeft, A; Holt, P; Fleisher, L A; Buhre, W; Pearse, R M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aex185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28854536/,439

Despite many examples of socially beneficial collaborations between academia and industry, it has become increasingly difficult to find an arrangement where neither clinicians/researchers working with industry nor industry itself is demonized. Regardless, we must incentivize innovation. Preclinical research is primarily funded by the government, whereas 70% of clinical research is supported by industry. Due to external political pressure and industry's concern about lack of control over content, industry's support of continuing medical education (CME) has shrunk to 10% from 40% and has led to diversion of funding to non-CME events. Despite scrutiny of clinical faculty members' interactions with industry, corporate philanthropy is much sought after by academic institutions. Developing new therapeutics requires both academia and industry to transparently and ethically partner with creation of innovative start-ups, sharing of non-proprietary clinical trial data, and in postmarketing surveillance.

By international definition, COVID-19 falls in the scope of septic syndromes (organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to an infection) in which immunosuppression is a significant driver of mortality. Sepsis-induced immunosuppression is mostly defined and monitored by the measurement of decreased expression of HLA-DR molecules on circulating monocytes (mHLA-DR). In this interim review, we summarise the first mHLA-DR results in COVID-19 patients. In critically ill patients, results homogenously indicate a decreased mHLA-DR expression, which, along with profound lymphopenia and other functional alterations, is indicative of a status of immunosuppression.","Benlyamani, Ihsane; Venet, Fabienne; Coudereau, Rémy; Gossez, Morgane; Monneret, Guillaume",Cytometry.

METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies including trial cohorts. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and trial registries up to March 2019. Eligible studies assessed potential predictors of clinically important GI bleeding (CIB; primary outcome) or overt GI bleeding (secondary outcome), had > 20 events, and presented adjusted effect estimates. Two reviewers assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and certainty of evidence using GRADE. We meta-analysed adjusted effect estimates if data from ≥ 2 studies were available. RESULTS We included 8 studies (116,497 patients). 4 studies (including 74,456 patients) assessed potential predictors of CIB, and we meta-analysed 12 potential predictors from these. Acute kidney injury (relative effect [RE] 2.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-5.28, moderate certainty) and male gender (RE 1.24, 95% CI 1.03-1.50, low certainty) were associated with increased incidence of CIB. After excluding high risk of bias studies, coagulopathy (RE 4.76, 95% CI 2.62-8.63, moderate certainty), shock (RE 2.60, 95% CI 1.25-5.42, low certainty), and chronic liver disease (RE 7.64, 95% CI 3.32-17.58, moderate certainty) were associated with increased incidence of CIB. The effect of mechanical ventilation on CIB was unclear (RE 1.93, 0.57-6.50, very low certainty). CONCLUSIONS We identified predictors of CIB and overt GI bleeding in adult ICU patients. These findings may be used to identify ICU patients at higher risk of GI bleeding who are most likely to benefit from stress ulcer prophylaxis.","Granholm, Anders; Zeng, Linan; Dionne, Joanna Colleen; Perner, Anders; Marker, Søren; Krag, Mette; MacLaren, Robert; Ye, Zhikang; Møller, Morten Hylander; Alhazzani, Waleed",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-019-05751-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31489445/,439

STUDY DESIGN Pilot study. POPULATION Veterinary students (n = 10) from years 1 to 4. METHODS Bipolar skin surface electrodes were fixed bilaterally to the forearm flexor, forearm extensor, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and upper trapezius muscles. Electromyography data were recorded during one repetition of 2 simulated surgical exercises via open surgery, MLS, and SLS. Participants completed a validated workload survey after each simulated surgical technique. Muscle activity and perceived workload were compared between surgical techniques with 1-way ANOVAs and Fisher's LSD post hoc tests. RESULTS Muscle activity during peg transfer was higher with MLS and SLS compared to simulated open surgery in the right and left forearm extensors (both P < .0001), right (P < .0001) and left biceps (P = .0005), right triceps (P = .0004), and right upper trapezius muscles (P = .0211). Similar results were found for the right and left forearm extensors (both P < .0001), right (P = .0381) and left (P = .0147) forearm flexors, right biceps (P < .0001), and right triceps (P = .0004) during a simulated suture task. Participants found laparoscopic techniques more mentally demanding, physically demanding, complex, and stressful compared to a simulated open surgical technique. CONCLUSION In veterinary students, average muscle activity and perceived workload were highest using MLS and SLS compared to an open surgical technique when performing simulated surgical exercises in a laparoscopic box trainer.","Kilkenny, Jessica; Larson, Dennis J; MacCormick, Mathew; Brown, Stephen H M; Singh, Ameet",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28557023/,439

Ex vivo uterine environment therapy is an experimental neonatal intensive care strategy that provides gas exchange using parallel membranous oxygenators connected to the umbilical vessels, sparing the extremely preterm cardiopulmonary system from ventilation-derived injury. OBJECTIVE In this study, we aimed to refine our ex vivo uterine environment therapy platform to eliminate fetal infection and inflammation, while simultaneously extending the duration of hemodynamically stable ex vivo uterine environment therapy to 1 week. STUDY DESIGN Merino-cross ewes with timed, singleton pregnancies were surgically delivered at 112-115 days of gestation (term is ∼150 days) and adapted to ex vivo uterine environment therapy (treatment group; n = 6). Physiological variables were continuously monitored; humerus and femur length, ductus arteriosus directional flow, and patency were estimated with ultrasound; serial blood samples were collected for hematology and microbiology studies; weight was recorded at the end of the experiment. Control group animals (n = 7) were euthanized at 122 days of gestation and analyzed accordingly. Bacteremia was defined by positive blood culture. Infection and fetal inflammation was assessed with white blood cell counts (including differential leukocyte counts), plasma and lung proinflammatory cytokine measurements, and lung histopathology. RESULTS Five of 6 fetuses in the treatment group completed the 1-week study period with key physiological parameters, blood counts remaining within normal ranges, and no bacteremia detected. There were no significant differences (P > .05) in arterial blood oxygen content or lactate levels between ex vivo uterine environment therapy and control groups at delivery. There was no significant difference (P > .05) in birthweight between control and ex vivo uterine environment groups. In the ex vivo uterine environment group, we observed growth of fetal humerus (P < .05) and femur (P < .001) over the course of the 7-day experimental period. There was no difference in airway or airspace morphology or consolidation between control and ex vivo uterine environment animals, and there was no increase in the number of lung cells staining positive for T-cell marker CD3+. CONCLUSION Five preterm lambs were maintained in a physiologically stable condition for 1 week with significant growth and without clinically significant bacteremia or systemic inflammation. Although substantial further refinement is required, a life support platform based around ex vivo uterine environment therapy may provide an avenue to improve outcomes for extremely preterm infants.","Usuda, Haruo; Watanabe, Shimpei; Miura, Yuichiro; Saito, Masatoshi; Musk, Gabrielle C; Rittenschober-Böhm, Judith; Ikeda, Hideyuki; Sato, Shinichi; Hanita, Takushi; Matsuda, Tadashi; Jobe, Alan H; Newnham, John P; Stock, Sarah J; Kemp, Matthew W",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2017.05.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28646647/,439
118599,Introduction.,2020-11-01,"PURPOSE Idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is a relatively common complex deformity of the foot that can be successfully managed by the Ponseti method. The purpose of this study was to see if the latter can be effectively administered by non-medical specialists outside a specialist or teaching hospital setting. METHOD Retrospective review of 24 children (39 feet) with idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus managed by a physiotherapist-led service in a district general hospital. RESULTS The median Pirani score at presentation was 4.5 (mean 4.2, range 1.5-6). The median Pirani score for feet requiring tenotomy was 6 (4.5-6), whereas feet not requiring tenotomy had a median Pirani score of 2.5 (1.5-5). A total of 18 feet (46%) underwent an Achilles tenotomy. Foot correction was achieved with an average of 3.4 (2-6) cast changes in the non-tenotomy group, and an average of 7.5 (5-13) in the tenotomy group. Successful initial correction of the deformity was achieved in 37 (95%) of the feet studied. One patient (2 feet, 5%) failed local conservative management, requiring tertiary referral. Two children (2 feet) have relapsed, requiring further serial casting. No children required open surgical release. Follow-up was for a mean of 31 months (17-50). CONCLUSIONS Early results suggest that a combined consultant/physiotherapist-delivered Ponseti service can be effectively and successfully administered in a district general hospital.","Kampa, Rebecca; Binks, Katherine; Dunkley, Mia; Coates, Christopher",Journal of children's orthopaedics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11832-008-0134-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19308543/,439

The mechanochemical cycle of kinesins is well described, but how they establish cargo specificity is not fully understood. Transport of oskar mRNA to the posterior pole of the Drosophila oocyte is mediated by Drosophila kinesin-1, also called kinesin heavy chain (Khc), and a putative cargo adaptor, the atypical tropomyosin, aTm1. How the proteins cooperate in mRNA transport is unknown. Here, we present the high-resolution crystal structure of a Khc-aTm1 complex. The proteins form a tripartite coiled coil comprising two in-register Khc chains and one aTm1 chain, in antiparallel orientation. We show that aTm1 binds to an evolutionarily conserved cargo binding site on Khc, and mutational analysis confirms the importance of this interaction for mRNA transport in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Khc binds RNA directly and that it does so via its alternative cargo binding domain, which forms a positively charged joint surface with aTm1, as well as through its adjacent auxiliary microtubule binding domain. Finally, we show that aTm1 plays a stabilizing role in the interaction of Khc with RNA, which distinguishes aTm1 from classical motor adaptors.","Dimitrova-Paternoga, Lyudmila; Jagtap, Pravin Kumar Ankush; Cyrklaff, Anna; Vaishali,; Lapouge, Karine; Sehr, Peter; Perez, Kathryn; Heber, Simone; Löw, Christian; Hennig, Janosch; Ephrussi, Anne",Genes & development,https://doi.org/10.1101/gad.348443.121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140355/,439

To address this, we collated diabetes outcomes more than a decade after laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery. METHOD Clinical and biochemical measures from 113 obese T2D patients who underwent LAGB surgery in 2003 and 2004 were analyzed. Diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c < 6.2% (44 mmol/mol) and fasting glucose < 7.0 mmol/L. RESULTS Seventy-nine patients had weight data at 10 years and attained a median [Q1, Q3] weight loss of 16 [10, 21] percent. Sixty patients attended a follow-up assessment. Their baseline HbA1c of 7.8 [7.1, 9.3] percentage units (62 [54, 78] mmol/mol) had decreased to 6.6 [6.1, 8.4] (49 [43, 68] mmol/mol) despite no significant change in glucose-lowering therapy. Eleven patients (18%) were in diabetes remission and another 18 had HbA1c ≤ 6.5%. Significant improvements in physical measures of quality of life, blood pressure, and lipid profile were also observed but there was no change in the proportion of patients with albuminuria and a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate. Twelve patients in the follow-up cohort (20%) required anti-reflux medication after surgery and 26 (43%) underwent gastric band revision surgery. CONCLUSION Weight loss for over 10 years after LAGB surgery delivers clinically meaningful improvements in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and quality of life at the cost of a high rate of revision surgery and increased use of anti-reflux medication. These findings support the use of bariatric surgery as a long-term treatment for weight loss and wellbeing in patients with T2D.

With adults, humidification and actual FIO2 are known to vary according to inspiratory and HFNC gas flow, tidal volume (VT), and ambient temperature. There have been few studies focused on humidification and FIO2 in HFNC settings for neonates/infants, so we performed a bench study to investigate the influence of gas flow, ambient temperature, and respiratory parameters on humidification and actual FIO2 in a neonate/infant simulation. METHODS HFNC gas flow was set at 3, 5, and 7 L/min, and FIO2 was set at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7. Spontaneous breathing was simulated using a 2-bellows-in-a-box model of a neonate lung. Tests were conducted with VT settings of 20, 30, and 40 mL and breathing frequencies of 20 and 30 breaths/min. Inspiratory time was 0.8 s with decelerating flow waveform. The HFNC tube was placed in an incubator, which was either set at 37°C or turned off. Absolute humidity (AH) and actual FIO2 were measured for 1 min using a hygrometer and an oxygen analyzer, and data for the final 3 breaths were extracted. RESULTS At all settings, when the incubator was turned on, AH was greater than when it was turned off (P < .001). When the incubator was turned off, as gas flow increased, AH increased (P < .001); however, VT did not affect AH (P = .16). As gas flow increased, actual FIO2 more closely corresponded to set FIO2 .

120929,[Visceral leishmaniasis: a challenging diagnosis in internal medicine].,2020-12-26,"OBJECTIVE Flow diverter stents were originally designed for the endovascular management of certain types of cerebral aneurysms; however, these devices present characteristics that make them more suitable that regular carotid stents or neurostents for the management of selected ischemic cerebrovascular conditions. METHODS Eight patients with steno-occlusive disease of the internal carotid (ICA) or vertebral (VA) arteries underwent endovascular reconstruction by means of flow diverter stent implant at our center. Five patients presented with ICA steno-occlusive lesions that involved tortuous segments not amenable to regular carotid stent placement and three patients presented with severe and complex proximal VA dissections. RESULTS In all cases the procedures were considered technically successful. Flow diverter stent implant allowed recanalization of the treated vessels (stenosis of 89±10.5% was improved to 26±13%) without procedure related complications. At the 3 month clinical and radiological follow-up, patients either improved or remained stable, and showed stent patency. One patient presented with asymptomatic occlusion of the revascularized artery at 13 months, emphasizing the need for prolonged antiplatelet therapy. CONCLUSIONS This preliminary series of patients with high risk steno-occlusive lesions affecting tortuous arterial segments or presenting with heavy thrombotic load managed by the implant of flow diverter stents shows that this approach is feasible, safe, and effective in achieving arterial recanalization. Further studies will elucidate the role of this technique in ischemic cerebrovascular settings.","Cohen, José E; Gomori, J Moshe; Rajz, Gustavo; Itshayek, Eyal; Eichel, Roni; Leker, Ronen R",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24951286/,439
122481,"Pre-Sleep Casein Supplementation, Metabolism, and Appetite: A Systematic Review.",2021-05-30,"Host-pathogen interactions play a major role in evolutionary selection and shape natural genetic variation. The genetically distinct Caenorhabditis elegans strains, Bristol N2 and Hawaiian CB4856, are differentially susceptible to the Orsay virus (OrV). Here we report the dissection of the genetic architecture of susceptibility to OrV infection. We compare OrV infection in the relatively resistant wild-type CB4856 strain to the more susceptible canonical N2 strain. To gain insight into the genetic architecture of viral susceptibility, 52 fully sequenced recombinant inbred lines (CB4856 x N2 RILs) were exposed to OrV. This led to the identification of two loci on chromosome IV associated with OrV resistance. To verify the two loci and gain additional insight into the genetic architecture controlling virus infection, introgression lines (ILs) that together cover chromosome IV, were exposed to OrV. Of the 27 ILs used, 17 had an CB4856 introgression in an N2 background and 10 had an N2 introgression in a CB4856 background. Infection of the ILs confirmed and fine-mapped the locus underlying variation in OrV susceptibility and we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in cul-6 may contribute to the difference in OrV susceptibility between N2 and CB4856. An allele swap experiment showed the strain CB4856 became as susceptible as the N2 strain by having an N2 cul-6 allele, although having the CB4856 cul-6 allele did not increase resistance in N2. Additionally, we found that multiple strains with non-overlapping introgressions showed a distinct infection phenotype from the parental strain, indicating that there are punctuated locations on chromosome IV determining OrV susceptibility. Thus, our findings reveal the genetic complexity of OrV susceptibility in C. elegans and suggest that viral susceptibility is governed by multiple genes.ImportanceGenetic variation determines the viral susceptibility of hosts. Yet, pinpointing which genetic variants determine viral susceptibility remains challenging. Here, we have exploited the genetic tractability of the model organism C. elegans to dissect the genetic architecture of Orsay virus infection. Our results provide novel insight into natural determinants of Orsay virus infection.","Sterken, Mark G; van Sluijs, Lisa; Wang, Yiru A; Ritmahan, Wannisa; Gultom, Mitra L; Riksen, Joost A G; Volkers, Rita J M; Snoek, L Basten; Pijlman, Gorben P; Kammenga, Jan E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02430-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827942/,439
123267,"Stop using body mass index as measure of health, say MPs.",2021-04-09,"This study presents a general model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing wastewater aeration in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRF) under different management objectives. The flexibility of the MPC is demonstrated by controlling a WRRF under four management objectives, aiming at minimizing: (A) effluent concentrations, (B) electricity consumption, (C) total operations costs (sum electricity costs and discharge effluent tax) or (D) global warming potential (direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions, and indirect from electricity production) . The MPC is tested with data from the alternating WRRF in Nørre Snede (Denmark) and from the Danish electricity grid. Results showed how the four control objectives resulted in important differences in aeration patterns and in the concentration dynamics over a day. Controls B and C showed similarities when looking at total costs, while similarities in global warming potential for controls A and D suggest that improving effluent quality also reduced greenhouse gasses emissions. The MPC flexibility in handling different objectives is shown by using a combined objective function, optimizing both cost and greenhouse emissions. This shows the trade-off between the two objectives, enabling the calculation of marginal costs and thus allowing WRRF operators to carefully evaluate prioritization of management objectives. The long-term MPC performance is evaluated over 51 days covering seasonal and inter-weekly variations. On a daily basis, control A was 9-30% cheaper on average compared to controls A, D and to the current rule-based control. Similarly, control D resulted on average in 35-43% lower greenhouse gasses daily emission compared to the other controls. Difference between control performance increased for days with greater inter-diurnal variations in electricity price or greenhouse emissions from electricity production, i.e. when MPC has greater possibilities for exploiting input variations. The flexibility of the proposed MPC can easily accommodate for additional control objectives, allowing WRRF operators to quickly adapt the plant operation to new management objectives and to face new performance requirements.","Stentoft, P A; Munk-Nielsen, T; Møller, J K; Madsen, H; Valverde-Pérez, B; Mikkelsen, P S; Vezzaro, L",Water research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.116960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33740729/,439

The morbidity and mortality of global community due to this disease is dramatically increasing from time to time. OBJECTIVE This situational analysis is aimed to analysis prevalence, and incidence of COVID-19 and to provide clear information about this disease for the scientific community, stakeholders and healthcare practitioners and decision-makers. METHODS The literatures were identified by searching the key relevant and officially known online databases: medRxiv, Google scholar and PubMed. The online databases contain archives of most English biomedical journals and scientific papers published online from 31 December to 3 April 2020 were included. After the literature search, articles were screened independently by two reviewers for eligibility. RESULTS The world continents have confirmed a total of 1,202,320 confirmed COVID-19 cases: (51.2%) in Europe, (27.7%) in North America, (17.9%) in Asia, (1.96%) in South America and at less number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa and Australia which was accounted 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.

124209,Impact of temporary traffic bans on the risk of acute coronary syndromes in a large metropolitan area.,2020-10-06,"To use single-leg cycling training for varying populations, it is important to understand whether a counterweight attached to the contralateral crank during single-leg cycling drills replicates the effects of the opposite leg in the ipsilateral leg. Therefore, we compared single-leg assisted cycling using a counterweight on the contralateral crank for joint kinetics, kinematics, and lower-limb muscle activation. Fourteen healthy nonathletes performed 2 bilateral cycling trials (240 ± 23 W and 90 ± 2 rpm) and 2 single-leg trials (120 ± 11 W and 90 ± 2 rpm) for measurements of pedal force, joint kinematics, and muscle activation of their right lower limb. For 1 single-leg trial, a custom-made adaptor was used to attach 10 kg of weight to the contralateral leg. Total force applied on the pedal, pedal force effectiveness, the mean joint angles and range of motion, mechanical work at the crank, hip, knee, and ankle joints, electromyography, pedaling cadence, and right crank mechanical work were assessed. Biceps femoris (87%), vastus lateralis (15%), rectus femoris (57%), tibialis anterior (57%), and gastrocnemius medialis (12%) activations were larger in the single-leg assisted trial compared with the bilateral trial. Lower total pedal force (17%) and increased index of effectiveness (16%) also indicate mechanical differences in single-leg cycling using a counterweight on the contralateral crank than conventional bilateral cycling. Single-leg assisted training should be used with caution because of potential differences in muscle recruitment and pedaling kinetics compared with bilateral cycling.","Bini, Rodrigo R; Jacques, Tiago C; Lanferdini, Fábio J; Vaz, Marco A",Journal of strength and conditioning research,https://doi.org/10.1519/jsc.0000000000000905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25872025/,439

METHODS This study consists of 17 head and neck cancer patient's treatment plans. Nine types of verification plans are created for all 17 clinically approved treatment plans by consecutively deleting different segments (up to eight) one by one from each field of the plan. Decrement factor (χ) is introduced in our study which illustrated the degree of decay of gamma passing rate when intentional errors are introduced. We analyzed the data by two different methods-one without selecting the region of interest (ROI) in dose distributions and the other by selecting the region of interest. RESULTS By linear regression, the absolute value of slopes is 0.025, 0.024 and 0.015 without ROI and 0.030, 0.027 and 0.015 with ROI for 2%/2 mm, 3%/3 mm and 5%/5 mm criteria, respectively. The higher absolute value of the fitted slope indicates the higher sensitivity of this method to identify erroneous plan in treatment unit. The threshold value for 2%/2 mm equivalent to 95% passing criteria in 3%/3 mm used in clinical practice is obtained as 83.44%. CONCLUSIONS The 2D detector array with dosimetric tool gamma is less sensitive in detecting errors when unprecedented errors of segment deletion occur within the treatment plans.","Krishnan, M P Arun; Bhagyalakshmi, A T; Holla, Raghavendra; Puzakkal, Niyas; Ranjith, C P; Vysakh, R; Irfad, M P; Ramasubramanian, V; Hu, Jianping; Momeen, M Ummal",La Radiologia medica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01259-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803540/,439

125408,Palliative care for patients with severe covid-19.,2020-07-14,"BACKGROUND Positive shunt response (SR) remains the gold standard for diagnosing idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). However, multiple pathologies mimic iNPH symptoms, making it difficult to select patients who will respond to shunt surgery. Although presenting features, extended lumbar drainage (ELD), infusion test (IT), intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM), and tap test (TT) have been used to predict SR, uncertainty remains over which diagnostic test to choose. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify clinical predictors of shunt responsiveness, evaluate their diagnostic effectiveness, and recommend the most effective diagnostic tests. METHODS Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and JSTOR were searched for original studies investigating clinical predictors of SR in iNPH patients. Included studies were assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and eligible studies were evaluated using univariate and bivariate meta-analyses. RESULTS Thirty-five studies were included. Nine studies discussed the diagnostic use of presenting clinical features, 8 studies ELD, 8 studies IT, 11 studies ICPM, and 6 studies TT. A meta-analysis of 21 eligible studies was conducted for TT, ELD, IT, and ICPM. ICPM yielded the highest diagnostic effectiveness, with diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) = 50.9 and area under curve (AUC) = 0.836. ELD yielded DOR = 27.70 and AUC = 0.753, IT had DOR = 5.70 and AUC = 0.729, and TT scored DOR = 3.86 and AUC = 0.711. CONCLUSION Intraparenchymal ICPM is statistically the most effective diagnostic test, followed by ELD, IT, and lastly TT. Due to the higher accessibility of TT and IT, they are recommended to be used first line, using a timed-up-and-go improvement ≥ 5.6 s or a Rout cut-off range between 13 and 16 mmHg, respectively. Patients who test negative should ideally be followed up with ICPM, using mean ICP wave amplitude [Formula: see text] 4 mmHg, or 1- to 4-day ELD with an MMSE cut-off improvement [Formula: see text] 3. Future research must use standardized methodologies for each diagnostic test and uniform criteria for SR to allow better comparison.","Thavarajasingam, Santhosh G; El-Khatib, Mahmoud; Rea, Mark; Russo, Salvatore; Lemcke, Johannes; Al-Nusair, Lana; Vajkoczy, Peter",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-021-04922-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235589/,439

Triage guidelines, however, differ on whether limited resources should focus on maximizing lives or life-years. Choosing between these two approaches has implications for neonatology. Neonatal units have ventilators, some adaptable for adults. This raises the question of whether, in crisis conditions, guidelines for treating extremely premature babies should be altered to free-up ventilators. Some adults who need ventilators will have a survival rate higher than some extremely premature babies. But surviving babies will likely live longer, maximizing life-years. Empiric evidence demonstrates that these babies can derive significant survival benefits from ventilation when compared to adults. When ""triaging"" or choosing between patients, justice demands fair guidelines. Premature babies do not deserve special consideration; they deserve equal consideration. Solidarity is crucial but must consider needs specific to patient populations and avoid biases against people with disabilities and extremely premature babies.","Haward, Marlyse F; Janvier, Annie; Moore, Gregory P; Laventhal, Naomi; Fry, Jessica T; Lantos, John",The American journal of bioethics : AJOB,https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1764134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32400291/,439

The downside of this technique may be an increased risk of bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity from the external milieu. The aim of this study was to prospectively analyze the peritoneal bacterial contamination in NOSE and non-NOSE laparoscopic colorectal procedures. METHODS Consecutive patients operated for sigmoid diverticulitis with laparoscopic approach and transanal extraction of the specimen from January to December 2010 at our university hospital were enrolled. Patients who underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy in the same study period with conventional specimen extraction were used as reference. Peritoneal fluid samples were collected under sterile conditions at the end of the procedure and sent for gram stain as well as anaerobic, aerobic, and fungal cultures. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis with transanal NOSE, while 9 patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with conventional specimen extraction during the same period. The two groups were successfully matched 1:2 (17 NOSE and 9 non-NOSE) according age, sex, ASA, and Charlson comorbidity score. The contamination rate of peritoneal fluid was 100% vs. 88.9% in NOSE and non-NOSE procedures, respectively (P = 0.23). Overall and major complications rates were 27.6% vs. 11.10% (P = 0.41) and 5.08% vs. 11.1% (P = 1) in NOSE vs. non-NOSE procedures, respectively. In the NOSE group there was a statistically significant lower consumption of oral paracetamol (P = 0.007) and of oral tramadol (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS Although a higher peritoneal contamination was found in the NOSE procedures, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes relative to standard approach. Avoiding a minilaparotomy to extract the specimen resulted in a significantly lower postoperative analgesic requirement in the NOSE group.","Costantino, Federico A; Diana, Michele; Wall, James; Leroy, Joel; Mutter, Didier; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-011-2066-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22179455/,439

This study investigated patterns in Canadians' vegetable and fruit consumption in 2015 and compared these with 2004 data. DATA AND METHODS The 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Nutrition and the 2004 CCHS - Nutrition (Cycle 2.2) provided nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data on Canadians' vegetable and fruit intakes. The frequency of consumption and the average quantity of daily intake for total vegetables, fruits and subgroups were calculated overall and by age and sex group for each survey year. The National Cancer Institute's methodology was used to assess the distribution of usual total vegetable and fruit intake and how it relates to recommendations in the 2007 Canada's Food Guide. RESULTS Overall, Canadians reported consuming fewer total servings of vegetables and fruits in 2015 (4.5 average daily servings) than in 2004 (5.3 average daily servings). Lower total fruit intakes were explained by significantly lower intakes of fruit juice across nearly all age and sex groups, resulting in a decline of 0.3 average total daily fruit servings in the overall population. Lower vegetable consumption was largely driven by lower intakes of potatoes and, to a lesser extent, lettuce. Intakes of whole fruits and other vegetables remained largely unchanged. In both years, the majority of Canadians did not usually consume the number of total vegetable and fruit servings recommended for their age and sex group in the 2007 Canada's Food Guide. DISCUSSION Canadians reported consuming fewer vegetables and fruits in 2015 compared with 2004. This was largely driven by substantially lower consumption of fruit juice and, to a lesser extent, potatoes.

129544,A new palatable oral rehydration solution. A randomised controlled crossover study in patients with a high output stoma.,2021-07-29,"Objective: We aimed to review data about delaying strategies for the management of hepatobiliary cancers requiring surgery during the covid-19 pandemic. Background: Given the covid-19 pandemic, many jurisdictions, to spare resources, have limited access to operating rooms for elective surgical activity, including cancer, thus forcing deferral or cancellation of cancer surgeries. Surgery for hepatobiliary cancer is high-risk and particularly resource-intensive. Surgeons must critically appraise which patients will benefit most from surgery and which ones have other therapeutic options to delay surgery. Little guidance is currently available about potential delaying strategies for hepatobiliary cancers when surgery is not possible. Methods: An international multidisciplinary panel reviewed the available literature to summarize data relating to standard-of-care surgical management and possible mitigating strategies to be used as a bridge to surgery for colorectal liver metastases, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Results: Outcomes of surgery during the covid-19 pandemic are reviewed. Resource requirements are summarized, including logistics and adverse effects profiles for hepatectomy and delaying strategies using systemic, percutaneous and radiation ablative, and liver embolic therapies. For each cancer type, the long-term oncologic outcomes of hepatectomy and the clinical tools that can be used to prognosticate for individual patients are detailed. Conclusions: There are a variety of delaying strategies to consider if availability of operating rooms decreases. This review summarizes available data to provide guidance about possible delaying strategies depending on patient, resource, institution, and systems factors. Multidisciplinary team discussions should be leveraged to consider patient- and tumour-specific information for each individual case.","Bennett, S; Søreide, K; Gholami, S; Pessaux, P; Teh, C; Segelov, E; Kennecke, H; Prenen, H; Myrehaug, S; Callegaro, D; Hallet, J",Current oncology,https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.6785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33704138/,439

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to determine the association. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane database were searched from January 1, 1975 to January 7, 2020. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. In all, 16 studies (11 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) involving a total of 391,071 HCV patients and 38,333,839 non-HCV controls were included. The overall analysis showed a 47% higher risk to develop kidney cancer among the patients with HCV infection (pooled OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%); The multivariable meta-regression showed that study design, age, sample size, and HIV coinfection were significant sources of variance, and totally accounted for 82% of the I2 . The risk of KC in HCV patients was further increased in studies without HCV/HBV- and HCV/HIV- co-infection (pooled OR 1.66; 95%CI 1.23-2.24). Multiple sensitivity analyses did not change the significant association. The present meta-analysis indicated that HCV infected patients have a significantly higher risk of developing kidney cancer. Our results highlighted the rationale for improved renal surveillance in HCV patients for the early diagnosis of kidney cancer. Further investigations for the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced kidney cancer are warranted.","Wu, Di; Hu, Shiping; Chen, Guozi; Jiao, Chenlong; Liu, Jian; Chen, Wenlin; Lv, Youwen; Chen, Xiaoni; Lin, Shan; Wu, Fenfang",Journal of viral hepatitis,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvh.13434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141502/,439

In addition, 75 samples from neonatal calves were tested for rotavirus by EIA. All samples were analyzed for Cryptosporidium spp. using PCR and sequencing techniques. Of the initial 18 samples from sick calves, ten were positive for C. parvum, five for rotavirus, and one for coronavirus. The overall prevalence of rotavirus in neonatal calves was 20.0% (15/75), with no significant differences during and after the outbreak. In contrast, Cryptosporidium parvum infections were significantly higher during the outbreak (60.0%, 24/40) than after the outbreak (30.4%, 17/56; P = 0.004). Cryptosporidium parvum infection was associated with the presence of watery diarrhea in neonatal calves (OR = 11.19), while no association was observed between C. bovis infection and diarrhea. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA20G1. This is one of the few reports of outbreaks of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IId subtypes in calves. More attention should be directed toward the dissemination of C. parvum in China.","Zhang, Zhenjie; Su, Dongle; Meng, Xinan; Liang, Ruobing; Wang, Weijian; Li, Na; Guo, Yaqiong; Guo, Aizhen; Li, Shujing; Zhao, Zengyuan; Xiao, Lihua; Feng, Yaoyu",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406306/,439
130174,Topical analgesics in the management of acute and chronic pain.,2013,"Introduction: Recent trials have demonstrated the superior efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy over other medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke; however, not every large vessel occlusion (LVO) can be recanalized using a single thrombectomy device. Rescue devices were proved to increase the reperfusion rate, but the efficacy is unclear. Objective: In this retrospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of rescue therapy in different locations of LVO. Methods: We analyzed the outcomes of mechanical thrombectomy from a prospective registry of consecutive 82 patients in Taipei Medical University Hospital. The reperfusion rate and the functional outcome were compared in patients who received first-line therapy only and patients who need rescue therapy. Results: An 84.1% reperfusion rate was achieved in our cohort. We applied first-line stent retriever (SR) treatment in 6 patients, among which 4 (66.6%) achieved successful reperfusion. We applied a direct-aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT) as the first-line treatment in 76 patients, among which 46 (60.5%) achieved successful reperfusion. Successful reperfusion could not be achieved in 30 cases (39.5%); therefore, we applied a second-line rescue SR for 28 patients, and reperfusion was established in 18 (64.3%) of them. These results revealed that the LVO in anterior circulation has a higher chance to respond to SR rescue therapy than posterior circulation lesions (68 vs. 33.3%, P < 0.001). Patients who received only first-line therapy exhibited significantly better functional outcomes than those who were also treated with rescue SR therapy (41.2 vs. 16.7%, P = 0.001). In addition, patients with LVO in the anterior circulation were found to have a higher probability of achieving functional independence than patients with posterior circulation lesions (10.7 vs. 0.0%, P < 0.001). The adjusted multivariate analysis revealed that successful reperfusion and treatment type (first-line or rescue therapy) were significantly related to a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days. Conclusion: This study reveals that rescue SR therapy improves the reperfusion rate. Patients who require rescue SR therapy have a lower likelihood of functional independence. LVO in the anterior circulation responds better to rescue SR therapy and results in better functional outcomes than posterior circulation lesions.","Ni, Cheng-Fu; Cheng, Sho-Jen; Chen, Cheng-Yu; Yeh, Tu-Hsueh; Hsieh, Kevin Li-Chun",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2021.689606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34421793/,439
130570,Clinical and genetic risk factors for new-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) in major transplant centres in Malaysia.,2020-09-07,"ABSTRACT Social distancing protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a rapid expansion of telemedicine. It has allowed patients to save time and money on clinic visits, and physicians to communicate with patients who live remotely. Telemedicine has also been valuable in plastic surgery during initial consultations, transfers, and follow up visits. However, given the often-sensitive nature of plastic surgery, the professionalism and expectations of telemedicine have to be reviewed. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through October 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine and its use in plastic surgery. Data on the effectiveness, challenges, and professionalism of telemedicine were collected. Our review suggests that telemedicine can be an effective mode of communication in many realms of plastic surgery, including cleft care and craniofacial deformities. However, many plastic surgeons are unfamiliar with the existing platforms, and there are no clear guidelines on the most optimal platforms. Physicians have to recognize that patients might have low digital health literacy or may not even possess digital device for telemedicine. There also needs to be an overall improvement in patient education. Given that telemedicine use will continue to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and specific guidelines on telemedicine visits, such as undressing, chaperones, privacy matters, need to be established while maintaining a professional relationship between the patient and the physician.","Tam, Anson K; Kim, Minji; Mathew, Prakash J; Thaller, Seth R",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0000000000007577; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710049/,439

The oral contraceptives could not be discontinued because of her pelvic symptoms, necessitating treatment of the liver lesion for symptomatic relief. Computed tomography and percutaneous biopsy demonstrated the mass to be focal nodular hyperplasia. The patient opted for radiofrequency ablation rather than surgical enucleation for symptomatic relief. The ablation proved to be a safe and effective alternative to surgery to treat the benign tumor, and permitted more aggressive therapy of the dysmenorrhea.","Hedayati, Pejman; VanSonnenberg, Eric; Shamos, Raymond; Gillespie, Thomas; McMullen, William",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvir.2009.12.385; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20138547/,439

A systematic review.,2018,"PURPOSE This retrospective, single-center study evaluated radiofrequency (RF) ablation for pulmonary metastases of sarcoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-six patients with sarcoma (144 pulmonary metastases) underwent 88 RF ablation sessions. Data regarding local tumor progression, efficacy, procedural adverse events (AEs; National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0), overall survival (OS), and OS-associated prognostic factors were retrospectively evaluated using univariate analyses. RESULTS Local progression occurred in 22 of 144 tumors (15.3%). Primary and secondary efficacy rates were 83.5 and 90.0% at 1 year and 76.3 and 81.4% at 2 years, respectively. Seventy-three grade 1 AEs, 33 grade 2 AEs, and no grade ≥ 3 AEs were observed. Twenty-eight patients (60.9%) remained alive and 18 died, yielding 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates of 80.6, 70.1, and 47.1% (median survival time, 31.7 months). Univariate analysis revealed extrapulmonary metastasis (P = 0.005), noncurative RF ablation (P = 0.009), and a post-RF ablation disease-free interval of ≤12 months (P = 0.015) as significant negative prognostic factors. CONCLUSION RF ablation is safe, offers good local control, and may be a viable treatment option for pulmonary metastasis of sarcoma.","Sato, Takuya; Iguchi, Toshihiro; Hiraki, Takao; Gobara, Hideo; Fujiwara, Hiroyasu; Sakurai, Jun; Matsui, Yusuke; Mitsuhashi, Toshiharu; Soh, Junichi; Toyooka, Shinichi; Kanazawa, Susumu",Japanese journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-016-0601-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27864664/,439
132022,Neurologic manifestations of COVID-19.,2021-02-26,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for gallbladder removal and the most common laparoscopic procedure worldwide. Single-incision laparoscopic surgery has recently emerged as a less invasive potential alternative to conventional three- or four-port laparoscopy. However, the feasibility of single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) remains unclear, and there are no rigorous criteria in the literature. Identifying patients at risk of failure of this new technique is essential. The aim of our study was to determine risk factors that may predict failure of the procedure. METHODS From May 2010 to March 2012, 110 consecutive patients underwent SILC and were reviewed retrospectively. The main feasibility criterion was the procedure failure rate, defined as addition of supplementary port(s) and prolonged (>60 min) operative time. The factors evaluated were age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, previous abdominal surgery, indication for surgery and gallbladder suspension. RESULTS There was conversion in 16 patients (14.5%), and the operative time exceeded 60 min for 20 patients (30.9%). Univariate analysis showed a significant independent association between additional port requirement and each of weight as a continuous value, weight ≥80 kg, BMI >26.5 kg/m(2) and height >172 cm. Univariate analysis also showed a significant independent association between prolonged operative duration (>60 min) and each of height and weight as continuous values, height >172 cm and previous abdominal surgery. In the multivariate analysis, only weight remained independently associated with additional port requirement, and height remained independently associated with prolonged operative duration. CONCLUSION Preoperative identification of the factors increasing the risk of conversion may assist surgeons in making decisions concerning the management of patients, including appropriate use of SILC.","Meillat, Hélène; Birnbaum, David Jérémie; Fara, Régis; Mancini, Julien; Berdah, Stéphane; Bège, Thierry",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4115-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759236/,439

Transvenous embolization (TVE) with coils has been performed for most ACC-DAVFs with a high clinical cure rate. However, some reports call attention to hypoglossal nerve palsy associated with TVE due to coil mass compression of the hypoglossal nerve caused by coil deviation from the ACC to the anterior condylar vein (ACV). Herein, we report a case of ACC-DAVF in which an intraoperative cone-beam computed tomography (CT) contributed to avoiding hypoglossal nerve palsy. CASE PRESENTATION A 74-year-old man presented with left pulse-synchronous tinnitus. An angiography detected left ACC-DAVF mainly supplied by the left ascending pharyngeal artery and mainly drained through the ACV. The two fistulous points were medial side of the ACC and the venous pouch just cranial of the ACC. We performed TVE detecting the fistulous points by contralateral external carotid angiography (ECAG). The diseased venous pouch and ACC were packed with seven coils but a slight remnant of the DAVF was recognized. Because a cone-beam CT revealed that the coil mass was localized in the lateral lower clivus osseous without deviation to the hypoglossal canal, we finished TVE to avoid hypoglossal nerve palsy. Postoperatively, no complication was observed. No recurrence of symptoms or imaging findings were detected during a five-month follow-up period. CONCLUSION An intraoperative cone-beam CT contributed to avoiding hypoglossal nerve palsy by estimating the relationship between the coil mass and the hypoglossal canal during TVE of ACC-DAVF.","Okamura, Akitake; Nakaoka, Mitsuo; Ohbayashi, Naohiko; Yahara, Kaita; Nabika, Shinya","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019916654141; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27288404/,439
132538,Integration of strength training into UK Defence Rehabilitation practice: current trends and future challenges.,2020-10-21,"BACKGROUND Despite the increase in the number of people accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART), there is limited data regarding treatment failure and its related factors among HIV-positive individuals enrolled in HIV care in resource-poor settings. This review aimed to identify factors associated with antiretroviral treatment failure among individuals living with HIV on ART in resource-poor settings. METHODS We conducted a comprehensive search on MEDLINE (PubMed), Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), World Health Organization's (WHO's) library database, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS). We included observational studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies) where adolescents and adults living with HIV were on antiretroviral treatment regardless of the ART regimen. The primary outcomes of interest were immunological, virological, and clinical failure. Some of the secondary outcomes were mm3 opportunistic infections, WHO clinical stage, and socio-demographic factors. We screened titles, abstracts, and the full texts of relevant articles in duplicate. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. We analyzed the data by doing a meta-analysis to pool the results for each outcome of interest. RESULTS Antiretroviral failure was nearly 6 times higher among patients who had poor adherence to treatment as compared to patients with a good treatment adherence (OR = 5.90, 95% CI 3.50, 9.94, moderate strength of evidence). The likelihood of the treatment failure was almost 5 times higher among patients with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 compared to those with CD4 ≥ 200 CD4 cells/mm3 (OR = 4.82, 95% CI 2.44, 9.52, low strength of evidence). This result shows that poor adherence and CD4 count below < 200 cells/mm3 are significantly associated with treatment failure among HIV-positive patients on ART in a resource-limited setting. CONCLUSION This review highlights that low CD4 counts and poor adherence to ART were associated to ART treatment failure. There is a need for healthcare workers and HIV program implementers to focus on patients who have these characteristics in order to prevent ART treatment failure.

Our aim was to study the influence of sex on outcome and on the effect of EVT for ischemic stroke in recent randomized trials on EVT. Methods- We used data from 7 randomized controlled trials on EVT within the HERMES collaboration. The primary outcome was 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale). We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes between men and women. With ordinal logistic regression, we evaluated the association between EVT and 90-day functional outcome for men and women separately, adjusted for potential confounders. We tested for interaction between sex and EVT. Results- We included 1762 patients in the analyses, of whom 833 (47%) were women. Women were older (median, 70 versus 66 years; P<0.001), were smoking less often (30% versus 44%; P<0.001), and had higher collateral grades (grade 3: 46% versus 35%; P<0.001) than men. Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) at 90 days was reached by 318 women (39%) and 364 men (39%). The effect of EVT on the ordinal modified Rankin Scale was similar in women (adjusted common odds ratio [acOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.47-3.07) and men (acOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.59-2.96), with a P for interaction of 0.926. Conclusions- Sex does not influence clinical outcome after EVT and does not modify treatment effect of EVT. Therefore, sex should not be a consideration in the selection of patients for EVT.","Chalos, Vicky; de Ridder, Inger R; Lingsma, Hester F; Brown, Scott; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Goyal, Mayank; Campbell, Bruce C V; Muir, Keith W; Guillemin, Francis; Bracard, Serge; White, Philip; Dávalos, Antoni; Jovin, Tudor G; Hill, Michael D; Mitchell, Peter J; Demchuk, Andrew M; Saver, Jeffrey L; van Zwam, Wim H; Dippel, Diederik W J",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.023743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31412753/,439

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the prevalence of patients who have frequent attendance to emergency departments. A systematic review was performed in line with PRISMA guidelines. A database search was conducted, and studies were included in the final review if they analysed a population of frequent attendance. Meta-analysis was performed only on population-based studies to estimate prevalence. The search yielded 2922 nonduplicate publications, of which 27 were included in the meta-analysis. The most common definition used for frequent attendance was greater than three presentations a year. The proportion of people who frequently attended as a percentage of the total study population ranged from 0.01 to 20.9%, with emergency department presentations from frequent attenders ranging from 0.2 to 34%. When limiting the definition of frequent attendance to greater than three visits in a 12-month period, people who frequently attended contributed between 3 and 10% [pooled estimate 6%; CI 4-7%] of emergency department presentations and between 12 and 34% [pooled estimate 21%; CI 15-27%] of total emergency department presentations. Meta-analysis found substantial heterogeneity between estimates [I2 > 50%]. The prevalence of frequent attendance compared to the total population of patients seeking emergency care was small, but the impact on emergency department utilisation is significant.

Elderly patients with OA are at heightened risk for developing serious gastrointestional and cardiovascular adverse events, including gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Prescribing NSAIDs, especially in an elderly population, continues to be discouraged because of these significant risks. A dilemma exists for individuals who need the established efficacy associated with oral NSAIDs but who are at increased risk for serious adverse events associated with these agents. The goal of this clinical review was to evaluate the risks versus benefits of current options in the treatment of OA. This review found that topical NSAIDs seem to be the safest choice among all options to mitigate gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks and should be considered prior to the initiation of oral nonselective or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-selective NSAIDs for individuals presenting with a localized expression of OA. Further research is needed to evaluate and compare these therapies in treating both pain and inflammation effectively while mitigating safety risks in high-risk populations.","Roth, Sanford H; Anderson, Shane",The Physician and sportsmedicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/psm.2011.09.1922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22030942/,439
134384,In vitro evaluation of heat and moisture exchangers designed for spontaneously breathing tracheostomized patients.,2013,"Griffithsin, which binds N-linked glycans on gp120 to prevent HIV entry, has the most potent HIV-1 inhibitory activity described for any antiviral lectin and is being developed for topical preexposure prophylaxis. The current studies were designed to further assess its potential by exploring its activity against herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), a cofactor for HIV acquisition, in vitro and in a murine model. Safety was evaluated by examining its impact on epithelial barrier integrity in polarized cultures and testing whether repeated intravaginal dosing potentiates the susceptibility of mice to genital herpes. Griffithsin displayed modest inhibitory activity against HSV-2 if present during viral entry but completely blocked plaque formation if present postentry, reduced plaque size, and prevented cell-to-cell spread. These in vitro findings translated to significant protection against genital herpes in mice treated with 0.1% griffithsin gel. Griffithsin, but not placebo gel, prevented viral spread (visualized with a luciferase-expressing virus), significantly reduced disease scores, and resulted in greater survival (P < 0.05, log rank test). Protection persisted when HSV-2 was introduced in seminal plasma. Although griffithsin triggered a small decline in transepithelial electrical resistance in polarized cultures, this did not translate to any significant increase in the ability of HIV to migrate from the apical to the basolateral chamber nor to an increase in susceptibility to HSV-2 in mice treated with griffithsin gel for 7 days. These findings demonstrate that griffithsin inhibits HSV-2 by a unique mechanism of blocking cell-to-cell spread and support its further development for HIV and HSV-2 prevention.","Nixon, Briana; Stefanidou, Martha; Mesquita, Pedro M M; Fakioglu, Esra; Segarra, Theodore; Rohan, Lisa; Halford, William; Palmer, Kenneth E; Herold, Betsy C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00012-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23536670/,439

We aimed to evaluate the tasks handed over from hospital clinicians to general practitioners (GPs). STUDY DESIGN A retrospective observation of all tasks in a random sample of electronic discharge summaries at a university teaching hospital over a 1 month period was conducted. A single-best-answer questionnaire was circulated among hospital clinicians over 3 months to gain an understanding of their follow-up and referral practices. RESULTS The total number of tasks found on discharge summaries (n=178) were 227, of which 39% were directed at GPs and 61% at the hospital team. Of 89 tasks delegated to GPs, 33% were inappropriate. Some tasks on discharge summaries were delegated more frequently to GPs such as blood tests (73%) and endoscopy requests (67%). While others were undertaken more often by hospitals clinicians including imaging requests (88%), follow-up appointments (87%) and onward referrals (71%). Surveyed doctors (n=72) admitted to asking GPs to follow up blood tests (52%), imaging and endoscopy (16%) and make onward referrals for related conditions (14%) and unrelated conditions (70%). CONCLUSION The majority of outstanding tasks in the hospital setting were followed up by hospital clinicians. A considerable volume of tasks were delegated to GPs, of which a significant proportion were inappropriate.

137633,Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Rheumatoid Arthritis.,2018,"BACKGROUND The multiport technique is the gold standard for laparoscopic appendectomy, but the use of single-incision laparoscopy is on the increase. The aim of the present study was to compare case-matched cohorts of patients who had undergone single-incision laparoscopic appendectomy (SILA) with those who had undergone conventional multiport laparoscopic appendectomy (MLA). METHODS In a case-matched analysis, all single-incision laparoscopic appendectomies performed between July 2009 and December 2013 at one institution were reviewed and compared to multiport laparoscopic appendectomies performed during the same period. Patients who had undergone SILA were matched in terms of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores with the same number of patients who had undergone MLA. Statistical evaluation included the description and comparison of demographic factors, details of surgery, and histological data. A univariate analysis was performed to assess potential risk factors for morbidity after SILA. RESULTS One hundred and fifty-six patients who had undergone SILA were reviewed, matched, and compared to the same number of patients who had undergone MLA. No significant difference was noted in mean operating times (50.83 vs. 50.61 min for SILA and MLA, respectively; p = 0.924) and the length of hospital stay (3.60 vs. 3.66 days; p = 0.704). No patient in either group required conversion to the open procedure while 6 (3.8 %) SILA patients were converted to multiport laparoscopy. SILA was not associated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity compared to MLA (9.6 % vs. 5.8 %; p = 0.288). Postoperative wound infection rates were higher after SILA (3.2 % vs. 0.6 %), but did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.214). Statistical analysis revealed no risk factors for developing postoperative complications after the single-incision procedure. CONCLUSION SILA is a technically feasible and safe alternative to conventional MLA.

139642,Rocuronium priming for tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients.,2020,"BACKGROUND Ongoing gastroesophageal reflux may impair healing and re-epithelialization after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Because prior fundoplication may improve reflux control, our aim was to assess the relationship between prior fundoplication and the safety/efficacy of RFA. METHODS We assessed the U.S. RFA Registry, a nationwide registry of BE patients receiving RFA at 148 institutions, to compare the safety and efficacy of ablation between those with prior fundoplication and those with medical management (proton pump inhibition). RESULTS Among 5,537 patients receiving RFA, 301 (5.4 %) had prior fundoplication. Of fundoplication subjects, 1.0 % developed stricture and 1.0 % were hospitalized after RFA. Rates of stricture, bleeding, and hospitalization were not statistically different (p = ns) between patients with and without prior fundoplication. Complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia and complete eradication of dysplasia were achieved in 71 % and 87 % of fundoplication patients, and 73 % and 87 % of patients without fundoplication, respectively (p = ns for both). Patients with prior fundoplication needed similar numbers of RFA sessions for eradication compared with those without fundoplication. CONCLUSIONS Radiofrequency ablation, with or without prior fundoplication, is safe and effective in eradicating BE. Prior fundoplication was associated with similar adverse event and efficacy rates when compared with medical management.","Shaheen, Nicholas J; Kim, Hannah P; Bulsiewicz, William J; Lyday, William D; Triadafilopoulos, George; Wolfsen, Herbert C; Komanduri, Srinadh; Chmielewski, Gary W; Ertan, Atilla; Corbett, F Scott; Camara, Daniel S; Rothstein, Richard I; Overholt, Bergein F",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-012-2001-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22965650/,439

It is, however, unknown whether the BAB angle also influences the incidence of angiographically negative perimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (PMSAH). OBJECTIVE We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study comparing the BAB angle in a series of patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm at the top of the basilar artery (BSAH) with the BAB angle in a series of patients who presented with PMSAH. METHODS Consecutive patients who presented to our institution with PMSAH or BSAH between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010 were studied. Patients with PMSAH were further subdivided into patients with classic PMSAH (CPMSAH) and those with nonclassic PMSAH (NCPMSAH) based on initial head computed tomography examinations. In each patient, the BAB angle was measured on the standard cranial anteroposterior projections after vertebral artery injections. RESULTS A total of 21 patients with CPMSAH, 30 patients with NCPMSAH, and 31 patients with BSAH were studied. The BAB angle was significantly smaller in patients with CPMSAH (87.7 ± 17.1 degrees) and NCPMSAH (98.4 ± 21.1 degrees) compared with patients with BSAH (135.0 ± 30.8 degrees) (P < .001). CONCLUSION The significantly lower BAB angle in PMSAH patients compared with BSAH patients suggests that bleeding in PMSAH is either nonarterial in nature or is secondary to variations in hemodynamic arterial stress at the top of the basilar artery that need to be studied further with computational models.","Jagadeesan, Bharathi D; Kadkhodayan, Yasha; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Wallace, Adam; Cross, Dewitte T; Derdeyn, Colin P; Zipfel, Gregory J; Dacey, Ralph G; Moran, Christopher J",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/01.neu.0000429837.45820.9c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23615096/,439

This study presents the first investigation on the dynamics of bacterial and fungal necromass of municipal sludge in non-aeration versus alternating aeration landfill bioreactors by using amino sugar biomarkers. Results showed that under non-aeration treatment, the decomposition rate of muramic acid derived from bacteria is higher than that of fungal-derived glucosamine. The relative change in glucosamine and muramic acid in the early period of landfills under the alternating aeration treatment is consistent with that under non-aeration treatment. However, with the increase in alternating aeration cycles, bacterial necromass muramic acid exerts a lower decomposition rate than fungal necromass glucosamine. Throughout the entire landfill period, galactosamine is the amino sugar with the slowest decomposition rate under non-aeration mode but the amino sugar with the fastest decomposition rate under alternating aeration mode. The present work fills the knowledge gap of microbial necromass dynamics of municipal solid waste in landfills.","Tan, Wenbing; Wang, Shuhan; Liu, Niankai; Xi, Beidou",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140513; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887002/,439

STUDY DESIGN In a two-year cohort study of 1,700 publicly insured women who delivered at eight hospitals in Texas, we identified those who had an unmet demand for tubal ligation prior to discharge from the hospital. We classified unmet demand as explicit or prompted based on survey questions that included a prompt regarding whether the respondent would like to have had a tubal ligation at the time of delivery. We assessed persistence of demand for permanent contraception, contraceptive use, and repeat pregnancies among all study participants who wanted but did not get a postpartum procedure. RESULTS Some 426 women desired a postpartum tubal ligation; 219 (51%) obtained one prior to discharge. Among the 207 participants with unmet demand, 62 (30%) expressed an explicit preference for the procedure, while 145 (70%) were identified from the prompt. Most with unmet demand still wanted permanent contraception three months after delivery (156/184), but only 23 had obtained interval procedures. By 18 months, the probability of a woman with unmet demand conceiving a pregnancy that she would likely carry to term was 12.5% (95% C.I.: 8.3% - 18.5%). CONCLUSION The majority of unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation among publicly insured women in Texas was uncovered via a prompt and would not have been evident in clinical records or from consent forms. Women unable to obtain a desired procedure had a substantial chance of pregnancy within 18 months after delivery. IMPLICATIONS Estimates of unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation based on clinical records and consent forms likely underestimate desire for permanent contraception. Among low-income women in Texas, those with unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation require improved access to effective contraception.","Potter, Joseph E; Burke, Kristen L; Broussard, Kathleen; Hopkins, Kristine; Grossman, Daniel; White, Kari",Contraception,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.05.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34048752/,439

141726,Pathways to longevity - but is it successful?,2020-12-19,"PURPOSE While many tests and indices are available to identify glaucoma progression, using them in combinations may decrease overall specificity. The aim of this study was to develop a framework for assessing glaucoma progression using structural and functional indices jointly for a fixed specificity. METHODS The study included 337 eyes of 207 patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma selected from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study or the African Descent and Glaucoma Evaluation Study. All patients had at least 9 visits. Each visit had retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and mean sensitivity from static automated perimetry (SAP MS) measured within a one-month window. Simple linear regression was applied to assess deterioration in each index for series of 5 to 9 visits. To identify progression using the two indices jointly, marginal significance levels set at a specificity of 95% were derived for two criteria: ANY (worsening on either RNFLT or SAP MS) and ALL (worsening on both RNFLT and SAP MS). Positive rate (percentage of eyes flagged as progressing) was determined individually for each index, as well as for the ANY and ALL criteria. RESULTS Compared to SAP MS, RNFLT had higher positive rates (15% to 45%) for all series lengths. For the joint analyses, the positive rate was on average 12% higher for the ANY criterion compared to the ALL criterion. While RNFLT-alone had comparable positive rates and time-to-detection as the ANY criterion, each uniquely identified a subset of eyes (Kappa = 0.55 to 0.75). CONCLUSIONS This study provides a simple framework for assessing glaucoma progression with data from two tests jointly, without compromising specificity. This framework can be extended to include two or more parameters, can accommodate global or regional indices, and can eventually be used with novel parameters identified as predictive of glaucoma progression.","Abu, Sampson Listowell; Marín-Franch, Iván; Racette, Lyne",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235255; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609734/,439

142188,Medical adherence to topical corticosteroid preparations prescribed for psoriasis: A systematic review.,2017,"During 1999-2019, a total of 81,947 unintentional drowning deaths occurred in the United States (1). Drowning is one of the three leading causes of unintentional injury death among persons aged ≤29 years and results in more deaths among children aged 1-4 years than any other cause except birth defects (2). Drowning death rates have decreased since 1990 (declining by 57% worldwide and by 32% in the United States) (3). However, because of racial/ethnic disparities in drowning risk, rates remain high among certain racial/ethnic groups, particularly American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons and Black or African-American (Black) persons (4). To assess whether decreasing drowning death rates have been accompanied by reductions in racial/ethnic disparities, and to further describe these disparities by age group and setting, CDC analyzed U.S. mortality data during 1999-2019. The drowning death rate among persons aged ≤29 years was 1.3 per 100,000 population. The rate per 100,000 among AI/AN persons (2.5) and Black persons (1.8) was higher than among all other racial/ethnic groups and was 2.0 and 1.5 times higher than among White persons (1.2). Racial/ethnic disparities in drowning death rates did not significantly decline for most groups, and the disparity in rates among Black persons compared with White persons increased significantly from 2005-2019. Drowning death rates are associated with persistent and concerning racial/ethnic disparities. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to drowning disparities is needed. Implementing and evaluating community-based interventions, including those promoting basic swimming and water safety skills, among disproportionately affected racial/ethnic groups could help reduce drowning disparities.","Clemens, Tessa; Moreland, Briana; Lee, Robin",MMWR.

OAS produces a unique oligonucleotide second messenger, 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A), that binds and activates RNase-L. This pathway is down-regulated by virus- and host-encoded enzymes that degrade 2-5A. Phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12) was the first cellular 2-5A- degrading enzyme to be purified and described at a molecular level. Inhibition of PDE12 may up-regulate the OAS/RNase-L pathway in response to viral infection resulting in increased resistance to a variety of viral pathogens. We generated a PDE12-null cell line, HeLaΔPDE12, using transcription activator-like effector nuclease-mediated gene inactivation. This cell line has increased 2-5A levels in response to IFN and poly(I-C), a double-stranded RNA mimic compared with the parental cell line. Moreover, HeLaΔPDE12 cells were resistant to viral pathogens, including encephalomyocarditis virus, human rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Based on these results, we used DNA-encoded chemical library screening to identify starting points for inhibitor lead optimization. Compounds derived from this effort raise 2-5A levels and exhibit antiviral activity comparable with the effects observed with PDE12 gene inactivation. The crystal structure of PDE12 complexed with an inhibitor was solved providing insights into the structure-activity relationships of inhibitor potency and selectivity.","Wood, Edgar R; Bledsoe, Randy; Chai, Jing; Daka, Philias; Deng, Hongfeng; Ding, Yun; Harris-Gurley, Sarah; Kryn, Luz Helena; Nartey, Eldridge; Nichols, James; Nolte, Robert T; Prabhu, Ninad; Rise, Cecil; Sheahan, Timothy; Shotwell, J Brad; Smith, Danielle; Tai, Vince; Taylor, J David; Tomberlin, Ginger; Wang, Liping; Wisely, Bruce; You, Shihyun; Xia, Bing; Dickson, Hamilton",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m115.653113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26055709/,439

Here we build on recent achievements in the accuracy of image-based AI for skin cancer diagnosis to address the effects of varied representations of AI-based support across different levels of clinical expertise and multiple clinical workflows. We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis.

Airway inflammation is a critical event in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. This study aimed to examine the role of oxidative stress and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in PM2.5-induced pro-inflammatory response in a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B. METHODS BEAS-2B cells were exposed to 0, 20, 50, 100 and 150 μg/ml of PM2.5. Secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-1β was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using flow cytometry. Phosphorylation of the EGFR was examined with immunoblotting. RESULTS PM2.5 exposure increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β in a concentration-dependent fashion. Moreover, exposure to PM2.5 elevated intracellular levels of ROS, and phosphorylation of the EGFR (Y1068). Pretreatment of BEAS-2B cells with either an antioxidant or a specific EGFR inhibitor significantly reduced PM2.5-induced IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β secretion, implying that both oxidative stress and EGFR activation were involved in PM2.5-induced pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, pre-treatment of BEAS-2B cells with an antioxidant significantly blunted PM2.5-induced EGFR activation, suggesting that oxidative stress was required for PM2.5-induced EGFR activation. CONCLUSION PM2.5 exposure induces pro-inflammatory response in human bronchial epithelial cells through oxidative stress-mediated EGFR activation.","Wang, Gui; Zhang, Guofu; Gao, Xia; Zhang, Yange; Fan, Wei; Jiang, Jing; An, Zhen; Li, Juan; Song, Jie; Wu, Weidong",Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Surveillance EMBs in patients with and without complications were evaluated from the 2004 to 2014 National Inpatient Sample. Over the study period, there was no significant change in the number of EMB procedures performed (P = 0.44). Of 37,955 EMBs, 2283 (6%) were in the setting of graft complications, while 35,672 EMBs were not related to graft complications. EMBs in graft complications did not show a significant increase in length of stay over time (P = 0.06), but had a significant increase in cost over time (P = 0.001). However, those with graft complications had an average of a 5-day longer length of stay (P < 0.001) and costs that were $88,816 (P < 0.001) more expensive compared with those without graft complications. In conclusion, the vast majority of in-hospital EMBs were not related to heart transplantation complications. Nevertheless, EMB hospitalizations with graft complications showed significantly greater length of stay and cost.

Challenges to treatment include gastrointestinal side effects and non compliance to oral iron therapy. Newer parenteral formulations need to be explored as alternatives. Methods Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published between years 2011 and 2018 comparing anaemic pregnant and post-partum women treated with intravenous iron sucrose versus oral iron was performed. The primary outcomes were mean maternal haemoglobin, serum ferritin and haematocrit at the end of 1st, 2nd, 4th and 6th weeks and comparison of adverse effects. Results Eighteen studies including 1633 antenatal women were randomly assigned to intravenous iron sucrose (n = 821) or oral iron [ferrous sulphate, ferrous ascorbate or fumarate] group (n = 812) in ten trials . Another eight studies compared iron sucrose infusion with oral iron in 713 post-partum women who were randomly assigned to intravenous iron sucrose group (n = 351) or oral iron group (n = 362). Cumulative analysis of all the time points indicates that the estimated mean values of Hb in the intravenous iron sucrose and oral iron groups were 10.11 g/dl and 9.33 g/dl, respectively, in antenatal group, while it was 10.57 g/dl and 9.74 g/dl in post-partum. The estimated mean ferritin level from first week to six weeks was 63.1 μg/l and 28.6 μg/l, respectively, in intravenous and oral iron groups. Cumulative estimate of haematocrit in the intravenous sucrose and oral iron over 6 weeks showed that the mean values in the respective groups were 30.5% and 29.5% in antenatal and 33.8% and 31.6%, respectively, in post-partum groups. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the reliability and consistency of the results. Oral iron was associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects. There was no significant difference in birthweight between the groups. Conclusion This meta-analysis demonstrates that intravenous iron sucrose is more effective than oral iron therapy for pregnant and post-partum women with iron deficiency anaemia. It is an effective and safe alternative to address the problem of iron deficiency especially in those who require rapid replacement of iron stores though medical personnel for intravenous administration of drug is required.Trial registration CRD42015024343.","Radhika, A G; Sharma, Aparna Kandala; Perumal, Vanamail; Sinha, Anju; Sriganesh, Vasumathi; Kulshreshtha, Vidushi; Kriplani, Alka",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology of India,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13224-018-1191-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814805/,439

Researchers reported that foods rich in carbohydrates could generate high amounts of acrylamide at high temperatures. In recent years, hydrocolloids are applied to reduce acrylamide in thermally processed foods and the effect has been well proved. The present work was to investigate the effect of sodium alginate as the coating agent on acrylamide formation in fried potato chips by a Box-Behnken design. The optimized processing conditions were: sodium alginate at the concentration of 1.34%, frying time at 4.38 min, and frying temperature at 179 °C. The corresponding inhibition rate of acrylamide was 76.59%. Compared to the control group, the oil absorption of coating chips decreased significantly, whereas the addition of sodium alginate did not affect the quality of potato chips. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that coating with sodium alginate could effectively prevent oil uptake, which might contribute to acrylamide mitigation. Overall, sodium alginate significantly mitigated acrylamide formation in fried potato chips. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Sodium alginate could significantly reduce acrylamide formation in fried potato chips systems. Sodium alginate may therefore be a new mitigation strategy for acrylamide formation in commercial fried foods without prejudice to main quality properties valued by consumers.","Liu, Hui; Li, Xuenan; Yuan, Yuan",Journal of food science,https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691421/,439

In this review, we evaluate the role of fit checking and fit testing of respirators, in addition to airborne protection provided by respirators. Filtering facepiece respirators are made of material with sufficient high filter capacity to protect against airborne respiratory viruses. Adequate viral protection can only be provided by respirators that properly fit the wearer's facial characteristics. Initial fit pass rates vary between 40% and 90% and are especially low in female and in Asian healthcare workers. Fit testing is recommended to ensure a proper fit of respirators for the individual healthcare worker so that alternative respirators can be selected if required. Although fit testing is required to comply with respirator standards, it is not performed consistently within all healthcare settings. Fit checking (a self-test) is recommended every time a healthcare worker dons a respirator, but is unreliable in detecting proper fit or leak. Additionally, fit testing has a high educational value and as such is best performed as part of a hospital respiratory protection programme. Whether fit checking alone, as opposed to fit tested and fit checked respirators, provides adequate airborne protection against aerosols containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other respiratory viruses remains unknown. While fit testing undoubtedly incurs additional costs, it is still recommended, not only to protect healthcare workers but also as it may reduce overall healthcare cost when considering the potential costs of sickness leave and the associated legal costs of compensation.","Regli, A; Sommerfield, A; von Ungern-Sternberg, B S",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932556/,439

METHODS Five patients with massive rotator cuff tear for which it was not possible to restore the anatomical footprint underwent mini-open suture bridge repair using a porcine dermal patch. The patients' average age was 53.4 years (range, 45 to 57 years), and the average duration of follow-up was 20.6 months (range, 14 to 26 months). Patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative outcome measures, including a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) score, and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score. The structural integrity of repaired rotator cuffs was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS The average VAS pain score, UCLA score, and ASES score improved from 6.8, 15.4, and 39.4 preoperatively to 0.8, 31.2, and 86.4 postoperatively (p = 0.041, 0.042, and 0.043, respectively). Magnetic resonance images obtained at an average of 8 months after surgery showed that four patients had intact repair integrity with graft incorporation. One patient had a re-tear with partial healing but still had a satisfactory clinical outcome. There was no intraoperative or postoperative complication in any patient. CONCLUSIONS Mini-open suture bridge repair with porcine dermal patch augmentation can be an option in young patients with high physical demands and massive rotator cuff tears for which it is not possible to restore the anatomical footprint.","Cho, Chul-Hyun; Lee, Sung-Moon; Lee, Young-Kuk; Shin, Hong-Kwan",Clinics in orthopedic surgery,https://doi.org/10.4055/cios.2014.6.3.329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177460/,439
149756,Physical rehabilitation in intensive care unit in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with COVID-19.,2021-01-15,"INTRODUCTION AND AIM Internationally, women are underrepresented as leaders in major scientific organizations and conferences. We aimed to determine gender differences in leadership roles and annual scientific conferences of the Stroke Society of Australasia (SSA). METHODS In a retrospective review of SSA data (2014-2019), committee members were obtained through the SSA Web site, and moderators, speakers, and award recipients were identified from SSA annual scientific conference programs. Gender was determined by name inspection and Web search. Absolute numbers and proportions of women and men were recorded for all roles examined, overall and per year. Associations between representation of women in conferences and percentage of women in speaking roles were tested using multinomial regression. RESULTS Presidential leadership of the SSA was held by men in 2014-2016 and 2019 and women in 2017-2018. SSA committee membership was predominantly women (55%), being lowest (47%) in 2014 and 2019 and highest (65%) in 2017. There was a wide gender variation at scientific conferences, with 41% of keynote speakers being women overall, from 20% in 2016 to 75% in 2015. From 2014 to 2019, 55% of all speakers were women, ranging from 32% (in 2016) to 71% (in 2015). A higher percentage of women as speakers or moderators was associated with a program committee with over a third of its members composed of women (p ≤ 0.044). CONCLUSIONS Representation of women varied from 2014 to 2019 in the SSA organization and its conferences, although men are more often elected president in the organization and women are less often keynote speakers. When more women were included in the program committee, the representation of women as speakers increased.","Carcel, Cheryl; Woodward, Mark; Anderson, Craig S; Delcourt, Candice; Bernhardt, Julie; Gall, Seana",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000517453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265764/,439

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine the risk of mesh and nonmesh morbidity after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy and to compare the safety of synthetic meshes with biological grafts. DESIGN This was a retrospective review. SETTINGS The study used data collated from prospective pelvic floor databases in 5 centers (3 in the United Kingdom, 1 in Australia, and 1 in Italy). PATIENTS All of the patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral rectopexy over a 14-year period (1999-2013) at these centers were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was mesh morbidity, classified as vaginal erosion, rectal erosion, rectovaginal fistula, or perineal erosion. Secondary outcomes were nonmesh morbidity. RESULTS A total of 2203 patients underwent surgery; 1764 (80.1%) used synthetic mesh and 439 (19.9%) used biological grafts. There were 2 postoperative deaths (0.1%). Forty-five patients (2.0%) had mesh erosion, including 20 vaginal, 17 rectal, 7 rectovaginal fistula, and 1 perineal. Twenty-three patients (51.1%) required treatment for minor erosion morbidity (local excision of stitch/exposed mesh), and 18 patients (40.0%) were treated for major erosion morbidity (12 laparoscopic mesh removal, 3 mesh removal plus colostomy, and 3 anterior resection). Erosion occurred in 2.4% of synthetic meshes and 0.7% of biological meshes. The median time to erosion was 23 months. Nonmesh complications occurred in 11.1% of patients. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective study including patients with minimal follow-up. The study was unable to determine whether patients will develop future erosions, currently have asymptomatic erosions, or have been treated in other institutions for erosions. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic ventral rectopexy is a safe operation. Mesh erosion rates are 2% and occasionally require resectional surgery that might be reduced by the use of biological graft. An international ventral mesh registry is recommended to monitor mesh problems and to assess whether type of mesh has any impact on functional outcomes or the need for revisional surgery for nonerosion problems.","Evans, Charles; Stevenson, Andrew R L; Sileri, Pierpaolo; Mercer-Jones, Mark A; Dixon, Anthony R; Cunningham, Chris; Jones, Oliver M; Lindsey, Ian",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1097/dcr.0000000000000402; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163960/,439

For six months, the mifepristone Risk Evaluation and Mitigation strategy (REMS) was temporarily blocked, allowing for remote provision of medication abortion. Remote medication abortion may become a dominant model of care in the future, either through the formal health system or through self-sourced, self-managed abortion. Clinics already face pressure from falling abortion rates and excessive regulation, and, with a transition to remote abortion, may not be able to sustain services. Although remote medication abortion improves access for many, those who need or want in-clinic care, such as people later in pregnancy, people for whom abortion at home is not safe or feasible, or people who are not eligible for medication abortion, will need comprehensive support to access safe and appropriate care.

152429,Author reply.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND Genomics-based noninvasive prenatal tests (NIPT) allow screening for chromosomal anomalies such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21). The technique uses cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) that circulates in the maternal blood and is detectable from 5 weeks of gestation onwards. Parents who choose to undergo this relatively new test (introduced in 2011) might be aware of its positive features (i.e. clinical safety and ease of use); however, they might be less aware of the required decisions and accompanying internal conflicts following a potential positive test result. To show the evidence on psychological and social consequences of the use of NIPT, we conducted a scoping review. METHODS We systematically searched four electronic databases (MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsychINFO (EBSCO)) for studies that investigated the psychological or social consequences of the use of NIPT by pregnant women or expecting parents. The search was limited to studies published between 2011 and August 8, 2018. We identified 2488 studies and, after removal of duplicates, screened 2007 titles and abstracts, and then assessed 99 articles in full text (both screenings were done independently in duplicate). We included 7 studies in our analysis. RESULTS Five studies assessed anxiety, psychological distress and/or decisional regret among women with validated psychological tests like the Spielberger State Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire-Revised (PRAQ-R), the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) or the Decisional Regret Scale (DRS). Two studies assessed women's experiences with and feelings after NIPT in interviews or focus groups. The included studies were heterogeneous in location, study setting, inclusion criteria, outcome assessment, and other characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Only few studies on psychological consequences of NIPT have been identified. The studies assessed only short-term psychological consequences of NIPT at baseline and/or after receiving the results or after giving birth. Studies show that short term anxiety decreased when women received negative NIPT results and that decisional regret was generally low. We could not identify studies on long term consequences of NIPT, as well as studies on women's partners' short and long term outcomes, nor on social consequences of NIPT.","Labonté, Valérie; Alsaid, Dima; Lang, Britta; Meerpohl, Joerg J",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2518-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660889/,439

It is commonly thought that biological invasions have accelerated continuously over the last centuries, following increasing global trade. However, the world experienced two distinct waves of globalisation (~1820-1914, 1960-present), and it remains unclear whether these two waves have influenced invasion dynamics of many species. To test this, we built a statistical model that accounted for temporal variations in sampling effort. We found that insect and plant invasion rates did not continuously increase over the past centuries but greatly fluctuated following the two globalisation waves. Our findings challenge the idea of a continuous acceleration of alien species introductions and highlight the association between temporal variations in trade openness and biological invasion dynamics. More generally, this emphasises the urgency of better understanding the subtleties of socio-economic drivers to improve predictions of future invasions.","Bonnamour, Aymeric; Gippet, Jérôme M W; Bertelsmeier, Cleo",Ecology letters,https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.13863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420251/,439

Cytokine expression at the time that treatment is started may assist in identifying patients not requiring antibiotics. We determined plasma cytokine patterns in patients retrospectively categorized as strict viral, pneumococcal or combined viral-bacterial CAP. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether cytokine-based prediction models can be used to differentiate strict viral CAP from other aetiologies at admission. METHODS From 344 hospitalized CAP patients 104 patients were categorized as viral CAP (n=17), pneumococcal CAP (n=48) and combined bacterial-viral CAP (n=39). IL-6, IL-10, IL-27, IFN-γ and CRP were determined on admission in plasma. Prediction of strict viral aetiology was explored with two multivariate regression models and ROC curves. RESULTS Viral pneumonia was predicted by logistic regression using multiple cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-27 and CRP) with an AUC of 0.911 (95% CI: 0.852 - 0.971, p<0.001). For the same patients the AUC of CRP was 0.813 (95%-CI: 0.728 - 0.898, p<0.001).

These structures allow the intercellular exchange of material, such as ions, soluble proteins, receptors, vesicles and organelles, therefore exerting critical roles in normal cell function. Indeed, TNTs participate in a number of physiological processes, including embryogenesis, immune response and osteoclastogenesis. TNTs have been also shown to contribute to the transmission of retroviruses (e.g. HIV-1) and coronaviruses. As with other membrane protrusions, the involvement of Rho GTPases in the formation of these elongated structures is undisputable, although the mechanisms involved are not yet fully elucidated. The tight control of Rho GTPase function by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) strongly suggests that localized control of these Rho regulators may contribute to TNT assembly and disassembly. Deciphering the intricacies of the complex signaling mechanisms leading to actin reorganization and TNT development would reveal important information about their involvement in normal cellular physiology as well as unveil potential targets for disease management.","Zhang, Suli; Kazanietz, Marcelo G; Cooke, Mariana",American journal of physiology.

A convenience sample of patients with one or more chronic conditions was selected from the existing VNA census (n = 22). A series of topics were outlined for discussion at each weekly visit for the pilot length of up to 6 months, scripted by evidence-based guidelines from the ENABLE II: Charting Your Course booklet (). A pretest/posttest survey method was conducted by utilizing results of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer. The effectiveness of the program was assessed using Spearman correlation to compare the difference in scores to the number of weeks in the program. The average number of hospital admission days during the pilot period was compared with admission days 6 months before enrollment in the pilot using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. A significant relationship was found between the number of weeks in the program and reduction in the total ESAS symptom scores (rho = -0.484, p = .022), indicating that a reduction in symptoms was significantly more likely the longer a patient was in the program.

METHODS Two-arm cluster RCT within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). We recruited patients with metastatic solid malignancies or hematological cancers and their informal caregivers. Intervention-group participants chose to use either a commercially available mindfulness app (10-20 minutes/day) or a webinar-based mindfulness course for 6 weeks. The waitlist control group received usual care. We assessed feasibility measures and obtained participant-reported data on quality-of-life (primary outcome) and distress outcomes (secondary) pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS 103 patients (median age 67 years; 70% female; 81% White) and 39 caregivers (median age 66 years; 79% female; 69% White) were enrolled. Nearly all participants chose the mindfulness app over the webinar-based program. Among the participants in the intervention arm who chose the mobile-app program and completed the postintervention (6-week) survey, 21 (68%) patients and 7 (47%) caregivers practiced mindfulness at least 50% of the days during the 6-week study period. Seventy-four percent of intervention participants were ""very"" or ""extremely"" satisfied with the mindfulness program.

Compared to baseline values, aortic PWV was initially decreased at week 16 (p = 0.010) and remained lower than baseline at week 28 (p = 0.002) and week 40 (p < 0.001), with no association with results of TAB and 18F-FDG PET/CT. Aortic PWV was significantly associated with age, male gender, left systolic and diastolic blood pressure, right diastolic blood pressure, and CRP. Total bone mineral content (BMC) was decreased in both genders (p < 0.001), while fat mass (FM) was significantly increased (p < 0.001). However, lean body mass did not significantly change during the study. Changes in FM were correlated with cumulative prednisolone dose (rho: 0.26, p = 0.031). Glucocorticoid treatment of patients with PMR/GCA had several prognostic impacts. Arterial stiffness was decreased due either to the treatment or a reduction in the inflammatory load. Additionally, treatment led to changes in body composition, including a decrease in BMC and FM excess.","Emamifar, Amir; Ellingsen, Torkell; Hermann, Anne Pernille; Hess, Søren; Gerke, Oke; Ahangarani Farahani, Ziba; Syrak Hansen, Per; Jensen Hansen, Inger Marie; Thye-Rønn, Peter",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85857-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737697/,439

However, the best evidence regarding emergency ultrasound education in residency training is not known. We performed a scoping review to determine the (1) characteristics and (2) outcomes of published structured training methods, (3) the quality of publications, and (4) the implications for research and training. Methods We searched broadly on multiple electronic databases and screened studies from the United States and Canada describing structured emergency ultrasound training methods for emergency medicine residents. We evaluated methodological quality with the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument (MERSQI), and qualitatively summarized study and intervention characteristics. Results A total of 109 studies were selected from 6712 identified publications. Publications mainly reported 1 group pretest-posttest interventions (38%) conducted at a single institution (83%), training in image acquisition (82%) and interpretation (94%) domains with assessment of knowledge (44%) and skill (77%) outcomes, and training in cardiac (18%) or vascular access (15%) applications. Innovative strategies, such as gamification, cadaver models, and hand motion assessment are described. The MERSQI scores of 48 articles ranged from 0 to 15.5 (median, 11.5; interquartile range, 9.6-13.0) out of 18. Low scores reflected the absence of reported valid assessment tools (73%) and higher level outcomes (90%). Conclusions Although innovative strategies are illustrated, the overall quality of research could be improved. The use of standardized planning and assessment tools, intentionally mapped to targeted domains and outcomes, might provide valuable formative and summative information to optimize emergency ultrasound research and training.","PoSaw, Leila L; Wubben, Brandon M; Bertucci, Nicholas; Bell, Gregory A; Healy, Heather; Lee, Sangil",Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34142104/,439

Although human B cell lines expressing DC-SIGN efficiently capture and transmit HIV-1 to susceptible target cells, cells expressing the related molecule liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (L-SIGN) do not. To understand the differences between DC-SIGN and L-SIGN that affect HIV-1 interactions, we developed Raji B cell lines expressing different DC-SIGN/L-SIGN chimeras. Testing of the chimeras demonstrated that replacement of the DC-SIGN carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) with that of L-SIGN was sufficient to impair virus binding and prevent transmission. Conversely, the ability to bind and transmit HIV-1 was conferred to L-SIGN chimeras containing the DC-SIGN CRD. We identified Trp-258 in the DC-SIGN CRD to be essential for HIV-1 transmission. Although introduction of a K270W mutation at the same position in L-SIGN was insufficient for HIV-1 binding, an L-SIGN mutant molecule with K270W and a C-terminal DC-SIGN CRD subdomain transmitted HIV-1. These data suggest that DC-SIGN structural elements distinct from the oligosaccharide-binding site are required for HIV-1 glycoprotein selectivity.","Chung, Nancy P Y; Breun, Sabine K J; Bashirova, Arman; Baumann, Joerg G; Martin, Thomas D; Karamchandani, Jaideep M; Rausch, Jason W; Le Grice, Stuart F J; Wu, Li; Carrington, Mary; Kewalramani, Vineet N",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.030619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833723/,439

To protect national health, government agencies have regulations on hospital chaperoning and visiting. This article presents the development and implementation of a monitoring system for hospital visiting and chaperoning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study aimed to create a hospital visiting and chaperoning monitor system that uses nation-wide data sources to more accurately screen hospital visitors and chaperones, assist contract tracing, and prevent transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. METHODS This project was implemented in 57 ward units of an academic medical center. The system was connected to the National Health Insurance (NHI) system and Hospital Information System (HIS), and built on the data of everyone who accessed either the hospital or ward using an NHI smart card or national identification card. To shorten the time for manual identification, we also developed a new system of ""app for appointment visits and chaperones"" to make appointments online. RESULTS After the implementation of the system, data from visitors and chaperones in the nursing information system could be accessed. Given that all data were registered in the HIS visiting/chaperoning monitor system, an epidemic investigation could be performed whenever there was a confirmed case. CONCLUSION Through the establishment of this system, people entering the ward can be accurately controlled, and all the contacts of potential cases can be traced.","Hsu, Suh-Meei; Cheng, Tsung-Kuei; Chang, Po-Jen; Chen, Teng-Yu; Lu, Ming-Huei; Yeh, Hui-Tzu",Applied clinical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1726348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827141/,439

Commonly, these hypotheses rely on the influence that behavioral and ecological variables have on brain size in extant primates, such as diet quality, social group size, or home range (HR) area. However, HR area does not reflect the time spent moving. As such, it has not been properly addressed whether the effort involved in movement could have affected brain size evolution in primates. This study aimed to test the influence of daily movement on primates' brain sizes, controlling for these other behavioral and ecological factors. We used a large comparative dataset of extant primate species and phylogenetic comparative methods. Our results show a significant correlation between daily movement and brain mass, which is not explained by the influence of diet, social group size, HR, or body mass. Hence, from an evolutionary timescale, a longer daily movement distance is not a constraining factor for the energetic investment in a larger brain. On the contrary, increased mobility could have contributed to brain mass incrementations through evolution.","Vidal-Cordasco, Marco; Rodríguez-González, Lucía; Prado-Nóvoa, Olalla; Zorrilla-Revilla, Guillermo; Modesto-Mata, Mario",Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33108783/,439

163218,Electrocardiographic findings of COVID-19 patients and their correlation with outcome;a prospective cohort study,2021,"PurposeAs the democratic world debates and in some cases replaces physical voting with postal ballots and on-line voting, it is important to refrain from advocating a generic approach to the issue and in particular to distinguish between consolidated and unconsolidated democracies.Design/methodology/approachThe paper argues that unconsolidated democracies are not fit for the introduction of non-physical (postal ballot and on-line) voting methods, which rather than broadening the scope of democracy may in actual fact be derailing it. The key reason for this distinction is the lack of political consensus for constitutional rules, the weakness of the rule of law and persistence of parochial and subject-based political cultures in many countries of the region, including Poland.FindingsReplacing physical voting with postal ballot, attempted during Presidential elections in the summer 2020 in Poland, eventually failed and was replaced with conventional physical vote. However, the Polish case demonstrates that in the system with weak checks and balances, postal ballot could be used to consolidate illiberalism not democracy.Research limitations/implicationsThe paper demonstrates that further research on defining consolidated and unconsolidated democracy is needed. In particular there is a need to factor in the research on political culture into the definitions of democratic consolidation.Practical implicationsEU membership for Poland and some other Central European states – such as Hungary – failed to prompt the process of democratic consolidation. In fact the opposite happened as the impact of EU conditionality lost relevance. It is important that any change of electoral law in Poland and other rule of law violators in the region is viewed with great care and scrutiny.Originality/valueThe paper’s conceptual approach rests on the definition of consolidated democracy as put forward by Przeworski (1991) and developed by Linz and Stepan (1996). According to these definitions, Poland is not yet a consolidated democracy and as argued in the paper, it has actually experienced an expansion of illiberalism in recent years. The paper also posits that the concept of “consolidated democracy” should be augmented to include the existence of civic political culture as a necessary condition for the maintenance of a healthy democracy.","Zaborowski, Marcin","Transforming Government: People, Process and Policy",https://doi.org/10.1108/tg-09-2020-0278,439

The aim of our study was to analyze if prior clinical characteristics among DM patients affected the risk of in hospital mortality compared with nondiabetic patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Material and Methods: The study was based on a retrospective, observational design and was conducted at two hospitals located in Albacete (Spain). All patients hospitalized with COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic until 7 July 2020 were included. Results: During the study period, 1468 patients were hospitalized due to COVID-19;402 of them had DM prior to hospitalization. DM was associated with higher in hospital mortality (28.6% versus 17.5%) in the univariate analysis. But, in a multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for age, presence of hypertension, smoking, presence of COPD, ACEI, ARB, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant therapy, DM was not a significant risk factor for death. Patients with DM2 receiving insulin treatment had a higher risk of in hospital death than nondiabetic patients (OR 1.78 [1.13-2.81], p=0.0126) after age was considered. The age-associated relative risk was 1.06 (1.05-1.07, p<0.001) per year, whereas the relative risk associated with DM2 treated with insulin compared with no DM was 1.57 (1.11-2.23, p=0.0111) suggesting that DM2 treated with insulin entails a risk of in hospital COVID-19 death equivalent to being 9 years older. When previous logistic regression models included other variables related to personal history and prior nondiabetic treatments, the risks described showed no change. Conclusion: This study confirms that pre-admission need for insulin therapy before hospitalization in patients with DM2 are associated with higher in hospital mortality due to COVID-19 in a large sample of DM inpatients with COVID-19.","Pinés-Corrales, Pedro J.; Molina, Maria García-Blasco Lourdes Toboso Rosa Quilez Alcaraz Marina Gutiérrez Luis Vicente Mellinas Gema Paterna Mayo Juan Maria Calbo Alfaro-Martínez José-Joaquín",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-172-lb,439

The high strength of these alloys causes increased force, friction, and temperature rise during forging operations, resulting in residual stresses and creating issues with distortion and springback in subsequent machining operations. Electrically-assisted manufacturing (EAM) has been studied for reduction or elimination of these issues in magnesium, aluminum, and titanium alloys as well as A2 tool steel and 304 stainless steel. This research determined the threshold current densities for EAM of Pyrowear P675, M50, and M50 NiL steels. Threshold current densities were determined for each material at 33, 48, and 37 A/mm2 respectively. Once the test reached this threshold a significant reduction in yield stress occurred and the samples had an increase in hardness near the exterior, the authors assess the probability of a phase change due to resistive heating during this forming operation.","Lang, Christopher D.; Hasbrouck, C.

A widely used tool for quality improvement in hospitals is an audit. In hospitals, external, internal, and clinical audits are led. Although there are differences between them, in terms of scope and approach, they all serve one purpose: Improving the quality of medical services in hospital care. Examples of the recovery role of audits led in inpatient healthcare facilities were presented in the article. Barriers against introducing recovery programs, which often derive from necessity of introducing audit recommendations and optimization of internal processes, were also pointed out. Changing circumstances of leading audits in the reality of crisis caused by COVID-19 pandemic were taken into consideration. Changes happening in health care are creating the need to introduce recovery plans going outside the health facilities and involving the whole health care system. There is a lack of deeper research on the effectiveness of internal audits in inpatient facilities. There is a need to create a platform for exchanging experiences from different hospitals and tested out, developed recommendations on introducing recovery plans have to go outside particular facilities and should include the whole healthcare system. It would be reasonable if, prior to creating regulations on the operation of hospitals, national audits of these institutions were carried out to assess to what extent the new legal requirements could be met. Otherwise, many facilities assess the demands made by the Ministry of Health as unrealistic to meet, which creates unfavorable conditions for the implementation of recovery plans. Works dedicated to clinical audits functioning involve a wide range of topics, however, scientific evidence does not indicate the realistic and clear effectiveness of such audits. It is, therefore, necessary to validate clinical audits in different operational contexts. © Farm Pol, 2021.","Królak, A.; Kurowska, P.",Farmacja Polska,https://doi.org/10.32383/farmpol/134637,439

It is postulated that, under the influence of a servant leader, as well as a supportive workplace and supervisor, teleworkers and non-teleworkers will demonstrate reduced symptoms of job burnout and maintain a better balance between their professional and personal lives. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was developed based on well-established scales. Primary data were collected from individuals working in 22 industrial sectors operating in Greece. In total, 211 individuals participated in this study, of whom 64 were teleworkers and 147 were non-teleworkers. Statistical analyses include Pearson's correlations, exploratory factor analyses and mediation analyses using SPSS Process Version 3. Findings: The findings established that POS is the full mediator in the relationship between servant leadership and (1) job burnout and (2) work–life balance for both teleworkers and non-teleworkers, whereas PSS was not found to act as a mediator in the aforementioned associations. Originality/value: This article offers robust evidence for servant leadership and organisational support scholarship by establishing that POS mediates the relationship between servant leadership and (1) job burnout and (2) work–life balance amidst COVID-19 for both teleworkers and non-teleworkers.

Their replication and gene expression are driven by RNA dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). Detecting active RNA synthesis by RdRp is critical for assessing the infectivity and pathogenicity of (+)ssRNA viruses. Current approaches rely on viral RNA detection, which cannot distinguish viral titer from RdRp activity. Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) is a nuclear run-on based nascent RNA sequencing method, widely used to map eukaryotic RNA polymerases by using labeled nucleotide analogues. Here we provide evidence that PRO-seq also detects RdRp activity and can serve as a highly sensitive RdRp mapping method. Coupled to PRO-seq in human blood samples, we propose to use PRO-seq as a single package method to detect (+)ssRNA virus RdRp activity and its interaction with host immune response through transcriptome-wide profiling of leukocyte gene expressions at once.","Mahajan, Lakshmi S.; Kim, Grace Eunyoo; Kwak, Hojoong",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.15.151738,439

Here, we investigated Spike-specific memory B cells and humoral responses in 145 subjects, up to six months after the BNT162b2 vaccine (Comirnaty) administration. Spike-specific antibody titers peaked 7 days after the second dose and significant titers and neutralizing activity were still observed after six months, despite a progressive decline over time. Concomitant to antibody reduction, Spike-specific memory B cells, mostly IgG class-switched, increased in blood of vaccinees and persisted six months after vaccination. Following in vitro restimulation, circulating memory B cells reactivated and produced Spike-specific antibodies. A high frequency of Spike-specific IgG+ plasmablasts, identified by computational analysis 7 days after boost, positively correlated with the generation of IgG+ memory B cells at six months.

Our study highlights the major role of socioeconomic status (SES) in AI algorithm bias and (in)completeness of electronic health records (EHRs) data, which is commonly used for algorithm development. Understanding the extent to which SES impacts algorithmic bias and its pathways through which SES operates its impact on algorithmic bias such as differential (in)completeness of EHRs will be important for assessing and mitigating algorithmic bias. Despite its importance, the role of SES in the AI fairness science literature is currently under-recognized and under-studied, largely because objective and scalable individual-level SES measures are frequently unavailable in commonly used data sources such as EHRs. We addressed this challenge by applying a validated individual-level socioeconomic measure that we call the HOUSES index. This tool allows AI researchers to assess algorithmic bias due to SES. Although our study used a cohort with a relatively small sample size, these study results highlight a novel conceptual strategy for quantifying AI bias by SES.","Juhn, Y.

175530,The impact of objective nutritional indexes on in-hospital mortality in Covid-19 infection,2021,"Computational modeling of 3D chromatin plays an important role in understanding the principles of genome organization. We discuss methods for modeling 3D chromatin structures, with focus on a minimalistic polymer model which inverts population Hi-C into high-resolution, high-coverage single-cell chromatin conformations. Utilizing only basic physical properties such as nuclear volume and no adjustable parameters, this model uncovers a few specific Hi-C interactions (15-35 for enhancerrich loci in human cells) that can fold chromatin into individual conformations consistent with single-cell imaging, Dip-C, and FISH-measured genomic distance distributions. Aggregating an ensemble of conformations also reproduces population Hi-C interaction frequencies. Furthermore, this single-cell modeling approach allows quantification of structural heterogeneity and discovery of specific many-body units of chromatin interactions. This minimalistic 3D chromatin polymer model has revealed a number of insights: 1) chromatin scaling rules are a result of volume-confined polymers; 2) TADs form as a byproduct of 3D chromatin folding driven by specific interactions; 3) chromatin folding at many loci is driven by a small number of specific interactions; 4) cell subpopulations equipped with different chromatin structural scaffolds are developmental stage-dependent; and 5) characterization of the functional landscape and epigenetic marks of many-body units which are simultaneously spatially co-interacting within enhancer-rich, euchromatic regions. The implications of these findings in understanding the genome structure-function relationship are also discussed.","Liang, Jie; Perez-Rathke, Alan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.06.455444,439

We found green spaces at the county level have a significant negative association with infection rates. Among all types of green spaces, forest yields the most consistent and strongest negative association. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the negative association of forest across five urbanicity levels, and the strength of the association increases as disease incidence increases across five time periods. Although forest located in moderately urbanized counties yields the strongest association, the negative pattern of significant associations holds across all five urbanicity levels. A population-weighted analysis revealed that proximity to forest within a moderate walking distance ([≤] 1.0-1.4 km) may provide the greatest protection against the risk of infection.","Jiang, B.; Yang, Y.; Chen, L.; Liu, X.; Wu, X.; Chen, B.; Webster, C.; Sullivan, W.

177647,Dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 cases and household contacts: A prospective cohort study,2021,"Introduction: The correlation between echocardiographic findings and the outcome of COVID-19 patients is still under debate. Objective: In the present study it has been endeavored to evaluate the cardiovascular condition of COVID-19 patients using echocardiography and to assess the association of these findings with in-hospital mortality. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, hospitalized COVID-19 patients from February to July 2020 with at least one echocardiogram were included. Data were extracted from patients’ medical records and the association between echocardiographic findings and in-hospital mortality was assessed using a multivariate model. The findings were reported as relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Data from 102 COVID-19 hospitalized patients were encompassed in the present study (63.7±15.7 mean age;60.8% male). Thirty patients (29.4%) died during hospitalization. Tricuspid regurgitation (89.2%), mitral valve regurgitation (89.2%), left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (67.6%), pulmonary valve insufficiency (PI) (45.1%) and LV systolic dysfunction (41.2%) were the most common findings on patients’ echocardiogram. The analyses of data showed that LV systolic (p=0.242) and diastolic (p=0.085) dysfunction was not associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients, while the presence of PI (RR=1.85;95% CI: 1.02 to 3.33;p=0.042) and patients’ age (RR=1.03;95% CI: 1.01 to 1.08;p=0.009) were the two independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: It seems that LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction was not associated with in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients. However, presence and PI and old age are possible prognostic factors of COVID-19 in-hospital mortality. Therefore, using echocardiography might be useful in management of COVID-19. © 2021 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.","Sadeghi, R.; Toloui, A.; Pourhoseingholi, A.; Taherpour, N.; Sistanizad, M.; Omidi, F.; Aghajani, M.

Genomic RNA from cell-cultured PRCV (French isolate RM4) was used to produce cDNA clones covering the genomic 3' end to the start of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene (7519 nucleotides). Six open reading frames (ORFs) were identified that allowed the translation of three coronavirus structural proteins and three putative non-structural (NS) polypeptides, homologous to TGEV ORFs designated NS3-1, NS4 and NS7. Pairwise alignment of PRCV nucleotide and amino acid sequences with sequence data available for three TGEV strains revealed a 96% overall homology. However, the genome of PRCV exhibited two important distinctive features. The first was that the S gene lacked 672 nucleotides in the 5' region and encoded a truncated form of the S polypeptide, and secondly, the first NS ORF downstream of the S gene was predicted to be non-functional as a consequence of a double deletion.

The current ADMs available for breast reconstruction are offered as aseptic or sterile. No published studies have compared aseptic and sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. The authors performed a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of aseptic versus sterile ADM in implant-based immediate breast reconstruction. METHODS Implant-based immediate breast reconstructions with ADM conducted between April 2013 and January 2016 were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups: the aseptic ADM (AlloDerm) group and the sterile ADM (MegaDerm) group. Archived records were reviewed for demographic data and postoperative complication types and frequencies. The complications included were infection, flap necrosis, capsular contracture, seroma, hematoma, and explantation for any cause. RESULTS Twenty patients were reconstructed with aseptic ADM, and 68 patients with sterile ADM. Rates of infection (15.0% vs. 10.3%), flap necrosis (5.0% vs. 7.4%), capsular contracture (20.0% vs. 14.7%), seroma (10.0% vs. 14.7%), hematoma (0% vs. 1.5%), and explantation (10.0% vs. 8.8%) were not significantly different in the 2 groups.

188192,Antiviral Therapy during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: Is It Appropriate to Treat Patients in the Absence of Significant Evidence?,2020,"INTRODUCTION Paragangliomas originate from chromaffin tissue primarily found in the Zuckerkandl body. A 53 years old man, was investigated with abdominal MRI for chronic backache, that had lasted for 2 years. CASE REPORT MRI revealed an incidental mass in para-aortic region, at the adrenal lodge, with characteristics of a solid nodular mass, which did not seem to arise from the adrenal gland. An abdominal CT showed a mass localized prior to left adrenal gland; the radiologist reported this mass as a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (Schwannoma). During his stay in hospital, tumoral markers chromogranin and neuron-specific enolase were dosed, with a concentration of 187.00 ng/mL and 7.7 ng/mL. Patient's back pain was treated first with ketorolac, without any resolution of the problem, then with ketorolac plus tramadol in elastomeric pump, again with no relief, and finally with a continuous infusion of morphine. Since the exact nature of the neoplasm was not known and a CT guided biopsy was not technically feasible to do, a laparoscopic excision of the mass, with transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach, as well as for the left adrenalectomy, was planned. After surgery, the patient no longer needed morphine. The postoperative course was uneventful. RESULTS Histopathological findings consisted of periadrenal paraganglioma. Extra-adrenal paragangliomas are rarely recognized during preoperative study. This is often due to its capacity of mimicking other type of tumors. CONCLUSIONS Paragangliomas could be successfully resected by laparoscopy, they are difficult to distinguish from other tumor and they should be investigated even if preoperative findings argue for something else.","Picchetto, Andrea; Paganini, Alessandro M; Balla, Andrea; Quaresima, Silvia; Cantisani, Vito; D'Ambrosio, Giancarlo; Lezoche, Emanuele",Annali italiani di chirurgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25285725/,439

With limited resources in manpower, technology and evidence it has been a difficult battle. But with time and more understanding of the virus new technology to detect the virus are coming up. It is a major breakthrough in the diagnostic field as this helps us in not only detecting the virus but also helps us to mobilize our human resources. This comes in a time where the cases are increasing at an alarming rate. Although numbers of Polymerase Chain Reaction testing have increased but due to the time consuming and the cost wise, we need a faster and equally reliable alternative. Antigen test approved by different countries can be used for point of care, screening and surveillance depending upon the requirements after calculating its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Objective To find out sensitivity and specificity of the Antigen test kit for COVID-19. Method Antigen tests were compared with Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction as a reference standard in calculated sample size of 113 subjects in a high risk population. Both Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction and antigen test were performed in a same subject with in maximum of 2 days' interval. Convenience sampling technique was used to select the subjects. Ethical approval was taken from Nepal Health Research Council before data collection. Study was done from August to September 2020 from Quarantine center of Province 3. Result There were total of 113 test carried out, among those 47 were positive and 66 were negative in Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction. After preparing two by two table, Sensitivity and specificity of the tested was calculated which came out to be 85% and 100% respectively, with accuracy of 93.80%. Conclusion Even though the sensitivity and specificity came to be higher, this test should be interpreted cautiously depending upon the prevalence of Corona Virus Disease 19 in that particular community and the clinical and epidemiological context of the person who has been tested.

The prevalence of allergic sensitization is often higher than 50% of the population. The ""hygiene hypothesis"" proposed that reduced immune-stimulation by infections may have resulted in the more widespread clinical expression of atopic disease. However, it alone does not provide an adequate explanation for the observed increase of allergic diseases. Human rhinovirus infections are the major infections with a worldwide distribution. Viral infections of the respiratory tract are the most common triggers of acute asthma exacerbations. These exacerbations are poorly responsive to current asthma therapies and new approaches to therapy are needed. The aim of this review is to present the current knowledge and clinical implications of human rhinovirus infection in allergy and asthma development and needs for further research. Recent evidence has shown that the immune responses to human rhinoviruses differ between asthmatic and nonasthmatic subjects. Novel insights into the mechanisms of virus-induced asthma exacerbations support the possibility that viral infections may be involved in the epithelial cells damage, inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness as well as in profibrotic response and induction of airway remodeling. The data of original investigations support the concept that the immune stimulation by rhinovirus infections contributes to the development of asthma, when an atopic host is infected with human rhinoviruses. Early rhinoviral wheezing is the predictor of subsequent asthma development in high-risk children. Synergistic effect of allergic sensitization, allergen exposure, and viral infection was suggested in the increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in both children and adults. Timing of allergen exposure may be important in a synergistic outcome. The increased susceptibility to rhinovirus infections was identified in atopic asthma. This review also presents the current options on the treatment and prevention of virus-induced asthma. Further studies are needed in order to differentiate between the response to viruses of healthy and atopic or nonatopic asthmatic children and adults. New research data may lead to novel strategies in treatment and prevention of asthma exacerbations as well as prevention of asthma induction.","Emuzyte, Regina; Firantiene, Regina; Petraityte, Rasa; Sasnauskas, Kestutis",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20051716/,439

The objective of this study was to determine whether nosocomial acquisition of MRSA decreased in these hospitals during an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) when barrier precautions were routinely used for all patients. DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. SETTING Three tertiary-care hospitals (a 1100-bed hospital; a 500-bed hospital; and an 823-bed hospital) and a 430-bed community hospital, each located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. PATIENTS All admitted patients were included. RESULTS The nosocomial rate of MRSA in all four hospitals combined during the SARS outbreak (3.7 per 10,000 patient-days) was not significantly different from that before (4.7 per 10,000 patient-days) or after (3.4 per 10,000 patient-days) the outbreak (P = .30 and P = .76, respectively). The nosocomial rate of MRSA after the outbreak was significantly lower than that before the outbreak (P = .003). Inappropriate reuse of gloves and gowns and failure to wash hands between patients on non-SARS wards were observed during the outbreak. Increased attention was paid to infection control education following the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS Inappropriate reuse of gloves and gowns and failure to wash hands between patients may have contributed to transmission of MRSA during the SARS outbreak.

Which lobe was frequently involved, the imaging manifestations, clinical features and outcomes were also analyzed. RESULT From January 1, 2020, to March 14, 2020, a total of 367 inpatients were diagnosed with COVID-19, in which 50 (13.6%) patients were confirmed with only one single pulmonary lobe lesion. The most frequently involved lobe was the right lower lobe (18 patients, 36%, highest). Lesions in the lower lobe easily spread to all lobes of the bilateral lungs (P<0.001, χ2=10.264), especially the left lower lobe, and were less frequent in the right upper lobe. During hospitalization, 2 (4%) patients were admitted to the ICU, 2 (4%) patients died, and 28 (56%) patients developed lesions in other lobes within 6.32±3.71 days. CONCLUSIONS The general pattern of COVID-19 imaging with localized nodules may also cause severe respiratory symptoms of bilateral lung disease, serious complications, or even death in patients with multiple lobe lesions or bilateral lung lesions, which should not be underestimated.","Zhu, Jian; Huang, Wen-Cai; Huang, Bin; Zhu, Yu; Jiang, Xiao-Jing; Zou, Jia-Ni; Yang, Gang; Wang, Zheng; Ji, Tao; Gu, Ming-Ming; Zhou, Xiang; Gao, Xu-Hui",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33312385/,439

Seropositive kittens developed antiviral immunofluorescence and lesions more rapidly after challenge exposure than did seronegative kittens. In seropositive kittens, FIPV antigen was present in macrophages and large mononuclear cells in tracheobronchial lymph nodes, lungs, and trachea on postchallenge-exposure day (PCD) 2; in liver and spleen on PCD 3; in kidneys and omentum on PCD 4; and subsequently in nasal turbinates, thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, parotid salivary gland, eyes, and brain. Initial antiviral immunofluorescence on PCD 2 coincided with the onset of viremia and vascular lesions. Systemic lesions characterized by perivascular necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation, phlebitis and thrombosis, fibrinous serositis, and generalized lymphoid necrosis developed on PCD 3 and 4. Coronavirus-like particles were observed by electron microscopy in cytoplasmic vacuoles or smooth endoplasmic reticulum of degenerating macrophages in inflammatory lesions. In seronegative kittens, antiviral immunofluorescence in tracheobronchial lymph nodes was first detected on PCD 5, and viremia occurred on PCD 6. Systemic necrotizing lesions, comparable with those observed in seropositive kittens on PCD 3 or 4, did not occur in seronegative kittens until PCD 13 or 16. In both groups of kittens, initial viral infection in regional lymphoreticular tissue was followed by viremia and infection of macrophages in reticuloendothelial organs (liver, spleen, lymph nodes) and perivascular locations. The accelerated onset of infection and lesions indicative of an Arthus-type reaction in challenge-exposed seropositive vs seronegative kittens further supports the immune-mediated pathogenesis of FIP.","Weiss, R C; Scott, F W",American journal of veterinary research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6280518/,439

The six diseases covered by the survey were bovine coronavirus infection, bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhea, brucellosis, parainfluenza-3 infection, and respiratory syncytial virus infection. The results indicated relatively low prevalences of these diseases compared to the prevalences found in most developed countries. The reasons for this are uncertain, but the finding suggests that the cattle population in Suriname could lack extensive exposure to these diseases and so could be highly susceptible to them. In addition, the evident need for more thoroughgoing survey data points up the need to establish a continuous animal data health monitoring system in Suriname--as well as in other developing countries where there is a need to objectively assess the livestock disease picture.","Corbett, W T; Guy, J; Lieuw-A-Joe, R; Hunter, L; Grindem, C; Levy, M; Cullen, J; Vaz, V",Bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2558753/,439

Immunoassay detection of specific antigens and host-produced antibodies directed against such antigens consitutes one of the most widely used and successful methods for diagnosing infectious diseases (IDs). The number and variety of new assay systems that are continually being developed reflect the increasing demand for immunoassays possessing greater sensitivity, speed, and ease of use. This trend has been driven, in part, by the need for improved immunodiagnostic systems to perform rapid testing and counter emerging IDs and biothreat (BT) agents. Another factor driving this trend is the need to integrate immunoassays with more sensitive nucleic acid-based methods for a comprehensive approach. Here we examine the development of immunoassays, some of the key formats used for the detection and identification of BT/ID agents, and the application of these technologies under different scenarios.","Andreotti, Peter E; Ludwig, George V; Peruski, Anne Harwood; Tuite, James J; Morse, Stephen S; Peruski, Leonard F",BioTechniques,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14579751/,439

In this report we summarized the results from an epidemiological investigation of a SARS outbreak in a hospital in Tianjin, between April and May 2003. We collected epidemiological and clinical data on 111 suspect and probable cases of SARS associated with the outbreak. Transmission chain and outbreak clusters were investigated. The outbreak was single sourced and had eight clusters. All SARS cases in the hospital were traced to a single patient who directly infected 33 people. The patients ranged from 16 to 82 years of age (mean age 38.5 years); 38.7% were men. The overall case fatality in the SARS outbreak was 11.7% (13/111). The outbreak lasted around 4 weeks after the index case was identified. SARS is a highly contagious condition associated with substantial case fatality; an outbreak can result from one patient in a relatively short period.

198340,Conus Myelitis Associated with COVID-19 Infection- Report of a Case.,2021-06-01,"In order to obtain attenuated live vaccine candidates of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a series of deletions was introduced at the 3' end of the viral genome using an infectious cDNA clone of the Lelystad virus isolate. RNA transcripts from the full-length cDNA clones were transfected into BHK-21 cells. The culture supernatant of these cells was subsequently used to infect porcine alveolar macrophages to detect the production of progeny virus. It is shown that C-terminal truncation of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORF7, was tolerated for up to six amino acids without blocking the production of infectious virus. Mutants containing larger deletions produced neither virus nor virus-like particles containing viral RNA. Deletion analysis of the 3' UTR immediately downstream of ORF7 showed that infectious virus was still produced after removal of seven nucleotides behind the stop codon of ORF7. Deletion of 32 nucleotides in this region abolished RNA replication and, consequently, no infectious virus was formed. Serial passage on porcine alveolar macrophages demonstrated that the viable deletion mutants were genetically stable at the site of mutation. In addition, the deletions did not affect the growth properties of the recombinant viruses in vitro, while their antigenic profiles were similar to that of wild-type virus. Immunoprecipitation experiments with the six-residue N protein-deletion mutant confirmed that the truncated protein was indeed smaller than the wild-type N protein. The deletion mutants produced in this study are interesting candidate vaccines to prevent PRRS disease in pigs.","Verheije, M H; Kroese, M V; Rottier, P J; Meulenberg, J J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11602771/,439

However, for emerging infections (defined as those for which the incidence has risen in the past two decades or threatens to rise in the near future), the prenatal effects are often unknown, raising concern among women and their health care providers. Investigation of these effects is essential to ensure that pregnant women are appropriately assessed, advised, and treated, but such investigation is often challenging. The impact of emerging infections on the embryo or fetus is difficult to predict and varies depending on the agent and gestational timing of infection. Some women might be asymptomatic or have only mild or nonspecific symptoms, and thus, not be identified as infected, even when the embryo or fetus is severely affected. In addition, diagnosing congenital infection is often complicated. This article will discuss challenges to studying the teratogenicity of emerging infections, advantages, and disadvantages of different study designs, and examples of previous studies of the effects of emerging infections on the embryo or fetus.","Rasmussen, Sonja A; Hayes, Edward B; Jamieson, Denise J; O'Leary, Daniel R",American journal of medical genetics.

200758,"Evaluating the Association of Clinical Characteristics With Neutralizing Antibody Levels in Patients Who Have Recovered From Mild COVID-19 in Shanghai, China",2020,"An epidemic of parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) infection occurred in a hospital ward housing patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. Twenty-three infected patients exhibited persistent high fever for 4-16 days and decreased lymphocyte counts. One-half of the symptomatic patients had increased blood monocyte counts and the other half progressed to bronchitis or pneumonia. We also compared levels of 27 cytokines in the sera of 21 patients during the acute and normal phases of infection. Cytokine levels were measured with a bead immunoassay performed using the Luminex Multiplex System. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1Ra, C-C-motif chemokine (CCL) 2, and C-X-C-motif chemokine (CXCL) 10 significantly increased during the acute phase. In contrast, the serum level of CXCL8 decreased slightly. These results suggest the involvement of monocytes/macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells in the initial stage of PIV1 infection. A previous report using nasal wash samples also found a significant increase in levels of CXCL10 during the acute phase. Hence, CXCL10 may be a useful marker of a cytokine storm produced upon viral infection. However, alterations in levels of IL-1Ra, CCL2, and other cytokines differed between the 2 studies, suggesting that the cytokine profile produced systemically at viral infection is different from that produced at mucosal sites. Further analysis is required to clarify the mechanisms underlying cytokine production during PIV1 infections.","Matsuda, Shunji; Kiyota, Naoko; Yoshizumi, Masakazu; Noda, Masahiro",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25241693/,439
202518,BMI as a Risk Factor for Clinical Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York,2020,"In the pathogenesis of the infectious process in the respiratory tract by SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 coronaviruses, two stages can be distinguished: early (etiotropic) and late (pathogenetic) ones. In the first stage, when the virus multiplication and accumulation are prevalent under insufficient host immune response, the use of chemotherapeutic agents blocking the reproduction of the virus is reasonable to suppress the development of the disease. This article considers six major chemotherapeutic classes aimed at certain viral targets: inhibitors of viral RNA polymerase, inhibitors of viral protease Mpro, inhibitors of proteolytic activation of viral protein S allowing virus entry into the target cell, inhibitors of virus uncoating in cellular endosomes, compounds of exogenous interferons, and compounds of natural and recombinant virus-neutralizing antibodies. In the second stage, when the multiplication of the virus decreases and threatening pathological processes of excessive inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and secondary bacterial pneumonia and sepsis events develop, a pathogenetic therapeutic approach including extracorporeal blood oxygenation, detoxification, and anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial therapy seems to be the most effective way for the patient's recovery.","Zhirnov, O P",Biochemistry (Mosc),,439

BACKGROUND: Tracheostomy is often performed for prolonged endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. However, in the context of COVID-19, tracheostomy placement pathways have been altered due to the poor prognosis of intubated patients as well as the risk of transmission to providers through this highly aerosolizing procedure. METHODS: A prospective single-system multi-center observational cohort study was performed on patients who underwent tracheostomy following acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the 53 patients who underwent tracheostomy, the average time from endotracheal intubation to tracheostomy was 19.7 daysâ±â6.9 days. The most common indication for tracheostomy was ARDS, followed by failure to wean ventilation and post-ECMO decannulation. 30 patients (56.6%) were liberated from the ventilator, 16 (30.2%) have been discharged alive, 7 (13.2%) have been decannulated, and 6 (11.3%) died. The average time from tracheostomy to ventilator liberation was 11.8 daysâ±â6.9 days (range 2 - 32 days). Both open surgical and percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques were performed utilizing methods to mitigate aerosols. No healthcare worker transmissions resulted from performing the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations to tracheostomy practices and processes were successfully instituted. Following these steps, tracheostomy in COVID-19 intubated patients appears safe for both patients and healthcare workers performing the procedure.","Chao, Tiffany N; Harbison, Sean P; Braslow, Benjamin M; Hutchinson, Christoph T; Rajasekaran, Karthik; Go, Beatrice C; Paul, Ellen A; Lambe, Leah D; Kearney, James J; Chalian, Ara A; Cereda, Maurizio F; Martin, Niels D; Haas, Andrew R; Atkins, Joshua H; Rassekh, Christopher H",Ann. surg,,439

The data of several studies suggest that various electrolyte imbalances seem to be having impact on disease prognosis. However, no study in literature primarily focused on baseline electrolyte abnormalities' effect on disease outcome. In this study, we assessed the validity of the hypothesis: ""The baseline electrolyte imbalances may be related to unfavourable outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients"". Material-Methods: Design of the study was retrospective and observational. We included 408 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old. Baseline levels of sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride were assessed. We evaluated the effect of those electrolytes' abnormalities on intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation requirement, hospitalization duration and treatment outcome. Also, we clustered the patients based upon electrolyte levels. Thereafter, we compared the clusters according to outcome variables and then, we compared the frequency of other severe disease indices between the clusters. Lastly, we evaluated the independent factors related to COVID -19 associated deaths with multivariate analyse. Results: 228 (55.8%) of the patients had at least one electrolyte imbalances at baseline. Hyponatremia was the most frequent electrolyte abnormality. Patients with hyponatremia, hypochloride or hypocalcemia respectively would have more frequent requirement of intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation; higher mortality rate and longer hospitalization. Moreover, the cluster associated with electrolyte abnormalities had unfavourable outcome. Also, clinical and laboratory features associated with severe disease were detected more often in those cluster. Furthermore, hyponatremia was found as one of the independent factors related to death from COVID-19 (OR 10.33; CI %95 1.62-65.62; p=0.01). Conclusion: Baseline electrolyte imbalances, primarily hyponatremia would be related to poor prognosis in COVID-19 and baseline electrolyte assessment would be beneficial for evaluating the risk of severe COVID-19.","Tezcan, Mehmet Engin; Dogan Gokce, Gizem; Sen, Nesrin; Zorlutuna Kaymak, Nilufer; Ozer, Rasit Serdar",New Microbes New Infect,,439

FINDINGS: A total of 313 patients were admitted during the study period; 259 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the confirmed cases, the male group aged 40 to 49 years (13.9%) was predominant. Disease severity ranged from mild (26.2%; n = 68) to moderate (59%; n = 153) to severe (14.7%; n = 38); the case fatality rate was 1% (n = 4). Dysgusia (46%; n = 119) and hyposmia/anosmia (37.8%; n = 98) were common features of COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had comorbidities (29%; n = 53), of which hypertension was the most common (18.9%; n = 49). Participation in mass gatherings (Odds Ratio (OR) = 2.37; P = 0.03) and dysgusia (OR = 2.09, P = 0.02) were predictive of diagnosis of COVID-19. Age groups 60 to 69 (OR = 7.41; P = 0.0001), 50 to 59 (OR = 4.09; P = 0.03), 40 to 49 (OR = 4.54; P = 0.01), male gender (OR = 2.53; P = 0.04), diabetes (OR = 4.05; P = 0.01), HIV infection (OR = 5.57; P = 0.03), lung disease (OR = 6.29; P = 0.01), dyspnoea (OR = 3.70; P = 0.008) and fatigue (OR = 3.35; P = 0.02) significantly predicted COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Most COVID-19 cases in this study were benign with low fatality. Age (40-70), male gender, HIV infection, lung disease, dyspnoea and fatigue are associated with severe COVID-19. Such findings may guide public health decision-making.","Fouda Mbarga, Nicole; Epee, Emilienne; Mbarga, Marcel; Ouamba, Patrick; Nanda, Herwin; Nkengni, Aristide; Guekeme, Joseph; Eyong, Justin; Tossoukpe, Sylvie; Noumedem Sosso, Sauvia; Ngono Ngono, Engelbert; Ntsama, Lazare Mbala; Bonyomo, Landry; Tchatchoua, Patrick; Vogue, Noel; Metomb, Steve; Ale, Franck; Ousman, Moussa; Job, Dorian; Moussi, Charlotte; Tamakloe, Modeste; Haberer, Jessica E; Ndeso Atanga, Sylvester; Halle-Ekane, Gregory; Boum, Yap",PLoS One,,439

Amongst the many challenges posed by the disease, increased risk of thromboembolism has presented a distinct new front for increased mortality and morbidity. While there are multiple documented evidences for the same, the exact mechanism, knowledge of groups at-risk, and mitigation strategies are evolving. We present a case of a young individual who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), was started on appropriate chemotherapy, and subsequently developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia. He was treated for COVID-19 pneumonia and recovered from the illness. However, his recovery from COVID-19 was further complicated by cortical venous sinus thrombosis (CVT). Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) brain and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) revealed the diagnosis of CVT with hemorrhagic parenchymal changes. He was managed with therapeutic anticoagulation and cerebral decongestants and was subsequently shifted to oral anticoagulant therapy. While the case was managed at a tertiary care setting, it opened up the question of identifying the high-risk groups and to formulate guidelines for extended thromboprophylaxis in these patients.","Manral, Ishita; Duddu, Nihar; Nayan, Neelabh; Kapoor, Rajan; Gupta, Preeti; Gupta, Anirban",SN Compr Clin Med,,439

Covalent, targeted labeling, such as with a SNAP-tag, uses synthetic dyes to label specific proteins in vivo for studying processes such as endocytosis or to use super-resolution microscopy. Despite the potential, such chemical tagging has not been used effectively in plants. A major drawback has been the limited knowledge regarding cell wall and membrane permeability of the available synthetic dyes. Out of 31 synthetic dyes tested here, 26 were taken up into BY-2 cells, while eight were not. This creates sets that can serve to measure endocytosis. Three of the dyes that were able to enter the cells, SNAP-tag ligands of diethylaminocoumarin, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and silicon-rhodamine (SiR) 647 were used to SNAP-tag &#945;-tubulin. Successful tagging was verified by live cell imaging and visualization of microtubule arrays in interphase and during mitosis in Arabidopsis seedling. Fluorescence activation-coupled protein labeling (FAPL) with DRBG-488 was used to observe PIN2 endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole as well as preferential delivery of newly synthesized PIN2 to the actively forming cell plate during mitosis. Together the data demonstrate that specific self-labeling of proteins can be used effectively in plants to study a wide variety of cellular and biological processes.","Iwatate, Ryu; Yoshinari, Akira; Yagi, Noriyoshi; Grzybowski, Marek; Ogasawara, Hiroaki; Kamiya, Mako; Komatsu, Toru; Taki, Masayasu; Yamaguschi, Shieghiro; Frommer, Wolf B; Nakamura, Masayoshi",Plant cell,,439

211021,Neurological symptoms in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and their association with in-hospital mortality,2021,"Objectives. The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted healthcare systems worldwide. This study aimed to document the effect of COVID-19 on osteosarcoma treatment pathways in the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and determine if there were any delays. Method. A retrospective review of osteosarcoma patients treated at the PGH from January 1, 2019 – January 1, 2020 (pre-COVID-19) was compared to those treated during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 1, 2020 – September 1, 2020. Rates of diagnosed osteosarcoma, admission for chemotherapy, admission for surgery, treatment abandonment, metastatic disease on presentation, 1-year mortality, and amputation were calculated and compared between the two groups. Results. From March to September 2020, 11 newly diagnosed osteosarcoma patients sought consult at the PGH. Only one patient sought consult during the initial 3-4 months of the study, suggesting that patients delayed seeking healthcare during the period of enhanced community quarantine. Patients seen during the pandemic had a higher rate of metastatic disease on presentation, reflecting the delay in diagnosis. Due to COVID-19 restrictions early in the pandemic, osteosarcoma patients were coordinated and referred to outside hospitals for intravenous chemotherapy and surgery. Normalization of services (hospital admissions, limb salvage surgeries) were seen at the later stages of the study, corresponding to the loosening of the quarantine. Conclusions. Osteosarcoma patients experienced delays in seeking consult, diagnosis, and treatment at the PGH due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Early indicators suggest worse outcomes for these patients due to the delays. Strategies employed during the pandemic, such as networking of care and telemedicine, may help in future outbreaks. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila. All rights reserved.","Gaston, C.

213064,"Kidney Dysfunctions of COVID-19 Patients: A Multi-Centered, Retrospective, Observational Study",2020,"Severe COVID-19 can manifest as multiorgan dysfunction with pulmonary involvement being the most common and prominent. As more reports emerge in the literature, it appears that an exaggerated immune response in the form of unfettered complement activation and a cytokine storm may be a key driver of the widespread organ injury seen in this disease. In addition, these patients are also known to be hypercoagulable with a high rate of thrombosis and a higher-than-expected failure rate of anticoagulation. While macrovascular thrombosis is common in these individuals, the frequent finding of extensive microvascular thromboses in several series and case reports, raises the possibility of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as being a contributing factor in the thrombotic and multi-organ complications of the disease. If this is correct, rapidly identifying a TMA and treating the underlying pathophysiology may allow for better outcomes in these critically ill patients. To further explore this, we reviewed the published literature on COVID-19, looking for reports describing TMA-like presentations. We summarize our findings here along with a discussion about presentation, pathophysiology, and a suggested treatment algorithm.","Tiwari, Nishant R; Phatak, Sanat; Sharma, Vivek R; Agarwal, Sanjay K",Thromb Res,,439

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a complementary and alternative therapy used to reduce pain related to PD. The purpose of this meta-analysis study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TENS in the treatment of pain in women with PD. METHODS: A search of the English literature in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (EBSCO), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), CINAHL (EBSCO), PUBMED, OVID, Science Direct, Scopus, Academic Search Complete databases was conducted using combinations of the following search terms: 'primary dysmenorrhea', 'pain', 'transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation', 'TENS', and 'electrical stimulation'. All content from database inception through April 2020 was included in the search. RESULTS: The initial search strategy based on date range and language yielded 571 relevant records and 4 of them were about both TENS and PD. A total of 260 patients were enrolled in the included studies. In all of the included studies, the comparison intervention consisted of sham TENS. The primary outcome of interest was pain intensity. Our analysis indicated that TENS was statistically more effective than sham TENS in reducing PD-related pain (SMD=1.384; 95% CI=0.505, 2.262; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: TENS is a safe and well-tolerated electrophysical therapy that may be effective for relieving pain in PD.","Arik, Meltem Isintas; Kiloatar, Humeyra; Aslan, Burak; Icelli, Muge",Explore (NY),,439
214177,30-day mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 during the first wave of the Italian epidemic: A prospective cohort study,2020,"Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a stressful and overwhelming situation for health care professionals (HCP), especially, who are caring for patients in the resource-limited health care settings of low-income countries. Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia, HCPs are at risk for COVID-19-related anxiety and associated inadequate nutrition. However, the magnitude of COVID-19-related anxiety and its association with dietary diversity among HCPs is not well studied. Objective: To assess the magnitude of COVID-19-related anxiety and its association with dietary diversity score among health care professionals in Ethiopia. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCPs working in university hospitals, primary hospitals, and health centers in south and southwest Ethiopia. A structured online survey questionnaire was designed on Google forms and carried out from May 15 to June 14, 2020. COVID-19-related anxiety was assessed using the coronavirus anxiety scale. Dietary diversity was measured using 9 items individual dietary diversity score. Data analysis was done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 24. Multiple logistic regression was computed to identify independent factors associated with COVID-19-related anxiety. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Results: The prevalence of COVID-19-related anxiety among health care professionals was found to be 20.2%. COVID-19-related anxiety is significantly associated with a low dietary diversity score [AOR=5.93 (1.67, 21.07)]. The other factors which are independently associated with COVID-19-related anxiety are the presence of depression [AOR=6.98 (2.91-16.73)] and diploma educational status [AOR=0.16 (0.04-0.55)]. Conclusion: One-fifth of the study participants were found to have probable COVID-19-related anxiety. Designing a screening and intervention strategy for COVID-19-related anxiety among HCPs, particularly to those with low dietary diversity scores and depression, is recommended.","Alenko, A.; Agenagnew, L.; Beressa, G.; Tesfaye, Y.; Woldesenbet, Y.

214274,Pulmonary artery trunk enlargement on admission as a predictor of mortality in in-hospital patients with COVID-19,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has presented new challenges to food manufacturers. During the early phase of the pandemic, several large outbreaks of Covid-19 occurred in food manufacturing plants resulting in deaths and economic loss, with approximately 15% of personnel diagnosed as asymptomatic for Covid-19. Disease spread by asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals have been implicated for large outbreaks of Covid-19. In March of 2020, we assisted in implementation of environmental monitoring programs for SARS-CoV-2 in zones three and four of 116 food production facilities. All participating facilities had already implemented measures to prevent symptomatic personnel from coming to work. During the study period, from March 17, 2020 to September 3, 2020, 1.23% of the 22,643 environmental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that infected individuals were actively shedding virus. Virus contamination was commonly found on frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, handles, table surfaces and sanitizer dispensers. Most plants managed to control their environmental contamination when they became aware of the positive findings. Comparisons of positive test results of plant personnel and environmental surfaces in one plant showed a good correlation between the two. Our work illustrates that environmental monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 can be used as a surrogate for identifying the presence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic personnel in workplaces and may aid in controlling infection spread.","Ming, Ziwen; Han, Sukkyun; Deng, Kai; Reyes, Enrique; Ha, Youngsil; Kim, SungSoo; Zhao, Yu; Dobritsa, Anatoly; Wu, Meiting; Zhang, Dandan; Cox, David P; Joyner, Emma; Kulasekara, Hemantha; Kim, Seong Hong; Jang, Yong Seog; Fowler, Curtis; Fei, Xing; Akasaki, Hikari; Themeli, Eni; Agapov, Alexander; Bruneau, Dylan; Tran, Thao; Szczesny, Cameron; Kienzle, Casey; Tenney, Kristina; Geng, Hao; Myoda, Samuel; Samadpour, Mansour",J. foof prot,,439

We aimed at identifying baseline characteristics predisposing COVID-19 patients to in-hospital death. METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective observational study on 3894 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized from February 19th to May 23rd, 2020 and recruited in 30 clinical centres distributed throughout Italy. Machine learning (random forest)-based and Cox survival analysis. 61.7% of participants were men (median age 67 years), followed up for a median of 13 days. In-hospital mortality exhibited a geographical gradient, Northern Italian regions featuring more than twofold higher death rates as compared to Central/Southern areas (15.6% vs 6.4%, respectively). Machine learning analysis revealed that the most important features in death classification were impaired renal function, elevated C reactive protein and advanced age. These findings were confirmed by multivariable Cox survival analysis (hazard ratio (HR): 8.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6-14.7 for age &#8805;85 vs 18-44 y); HR = 4.7; 2.9-7.7 for estimated glomerular filtration rate levels <15 vs &#8805; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2; HR = 2.3; 1.5-3.6 for C-reactive protein levels &#8805;10 vs &#8804; 3 mg/L). No relation was found with obesity, tobacco use, cardiovascular disease and related-comorbidities. The associations between these variables and mortality were substantially homogenous across all sub-groups analyses.

Their inherent ease of use and familiarity is continuously abused by attackers to evade defences and deceive end-users. Seemingly dissimilar URLs are being used in an organized way to perform phishing attacks and distribute malware. We refer to such behaviours as campaigns, with the hypothesis being that attacks are often coordinated to maximize success rates and develop evasion tactics. The aim is to gain better insights into campaigns, bolster our grasp of their characteristics, and thus aid the community devise more robust solutions. To this end, we performed extensive research and analysis into 311M records containing 77M unique real-world URLs that were submitted to VirusTotal from Dec 2019 to Jan 2020. From this dataset, 2.6M suspicious campaigns were identified based on their attached metadata, of which 77,810 were doubly verified as malicious. Using the 38.1M records and 9.9M URLs within these malicious campaigns, we provide varied insights such as their targeted victim brands as well as URL sizes and heterogeneity. Some surprising findings were observed, such as detection rates falling to just 13.27% for campaigns that employ more than 100 unique URLs.

220162,A review of Ciclesonide in COVID-19. Still a long way to go,2021,"All animal life on earth is thought to have a common origin and have common genetic mechanisms. Evolution has enabled differentiation of species. Pathogens likewise have evolved within various species and mostly come to a settled dynamic equilibrium such that co-existence results (pathogens ideally should not kill their hosts). Problems arise when pathogens jump species because the new host had not developed any resistance. These infections from related species are known as zoonoses. COVID-19 is the latest example of a virus entering another species but HIV (and various strains of influenza) were previous examples. HIV entered the human population from monkeys in Africa. These two papers outline the underlying principle of HIV and the differing epidemiologies in Africa, the USA and in Edinburgh. The underlying immunosuppression of HIV in Africa was initially hidden behind common infections and HIV first came to world awareness in focal areas of the USA as a disease seemingly limited to gay males. The epidemic of intravenous drug abuse in Edinburgh was associated with overlapping epidemics of bloodborne viruses like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.","Welsby, Philip D",Postgrad Med J,,439

Some case studies regarding the characteristics and outcome of patients with COVID-19 have been published recently. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the risk factors of COVID-19. METHODS: Medline, SinoMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: The incidence of fever, cough, fatigue, and dyspnea symptoms were 85.6 % (95CI 81.3-89.9 %), 65.7 % (95CI 60.1-71.4 %), 42.4 % (95CI 32.2-52.6 %) and 21.4 % (95CI 15.3-27.5 %). The prevalence of diabetes was 7.7 % (95CI 6.1-9.3 %), hypertension was 15.6 % (95CI 12.6-18.6 %), cardiovascular disease was 4.7 % (95CI 3.1-6.2 %), and malignancy was 1.2 % (95CI 0.5-1.8 %). The complications, including ARDS risk, ranged from 5.6-13.2 %, with the pooled estimate of ARDS risk at 9.4 %, ACI at 5.8 % (95CI 0.7-10.8 %), AKI at 2.1 % (95CI 0.6-3.7 %), and shock at 4.7 % (95CI 0.9-8.6 %). The risks of severity and mortality ranged from 12.6 to 23.5% and from 2.0 to 4.4 %, with pooled estimates at 18.0 and 3.2 %, respectively. The percentage of critical cases in diabetes and hypertension was 44.5 % (95CI 27.0-61.9 %) and 41.7 % (95CI 26.4-56.9 %), respectively. CONCLUSION: Fever is the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19. The most prevalent comorbidities are hypertension and diabetes which are associated with the severity of COVID-19. ARDS and ACI may be the main obstacles for patients to treatment recovery. The case severe rate and mortality is lower than that of SARS and MERS.","Hu, Yong; Sun, Jiazhong; Dai, Zhe; Deng, Haohua; Li, Xin; Huang, Qi; Wu, Yuwen; Sun, Li; Xu, Yancheng",J Clin Virol,,439

We included patients from West Virginia with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 April to 30 December 2020. Descriptive analysis was performed to summarize the characteristics of patients. Regression analyses were performed to assess the association between baseline characteristics and outcomes. Of 1742 patients, the mean age was 47.5 years (±22.7) and 54% of patients were female. Only 459 patients (26.3%) reported at least one baseline symptom, of which shortness of breath was most common. More than half had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension being the most common. There were 131 severe cases (7.5%), and 84 patients (4.8%) died despite treatment. The mean overall length of hospital stay was 2.6 days (±6.9). Age, male sex, and comorbidities were independent predictors of outcomes. In this study of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection from West Virginia, older patients with underlying co-morbidities had poor outcomes, and the in-hospital mortality was similar to the national average.","Wen, Sijin; Prasad, Apoorv; Freeland, Kerri; Podury, Sanjiti; Patel, Jenil; Subedi, Roshan; Khan, Erum; Tandon, Medha; Kataria, Saurabh; Kimble, Wesley; Sriwastava, Shitiz",Viruses,,439

Our study aimed to evaluate the robustness of neutrophil to CD4+ lymphocyte ratio (NCD4LR) in predicting the negative conversion time (NCT) of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to evaluate the independency of NCD4LR in predicting NCT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS: Compared with low NCD4LR patients, patients with high NCD4LR had an older age; higher incidence of fever, fatigue, chest distress/breath shortness, severer disease assessment on admission; higher levels of inflammatory indicators; low levels of lymphocyte subsets, and a longer NCT. Multivariate analysis also identified NCD4LR as an independent risk factor for delayed NCT. ROC analysis showed that NCD4LR had a better performance than neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in predicting the virus negative conversion within 2 weeks (AUC = 0.772), 3 weeks (AUC = 0.710), 4 weeks (AUC = 0.728), or 5 weeks (AUC = 0.815). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that NCD4LR is a potential and useful biomarker for predicting the virus negative conversion time in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, due to the NCDLR value is easily calculated, it can be widely used as a clinical biomarker for disease progression and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Haizhou; Zhang, Yongxi; Mo, Pingzheng; Liu, Jing; Wang, Hongling; Wang, Fan; Zhao, Qiu",Int Immunopharmacol,,439

In this work we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed quantum repeater node in a laser-cooled cloud of ^{87}Rb atoms. We employ the Duan-Lukin-Cirac-Zoller protocol where pairs of photons and single collective spin excitations (so-called spin waves) are created in several temporal modes using a train of write pulses. To make the spin waves created in different temporal modes distinguishable and enable selective readout, we control the dephasing and rephasing of the spin waves by a magnetic field gradient, which induces a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening of the involved atomic hyperfine levels. We demonstrate that by embedding the atomic ensemble inside a low finesse optical cavity, the additional noise generated in multimode operation is strongly suppressed. By employing feed forward readout, we demonstrate distinguishable retrieval of up to 10 temporal modes. For each mode, we prove nonclassical correlations between the first and second photon. Furthermore, an enhancement in rates of correlated photon pairs is observed as we increase the number of temporal modes stored in the memory. The reported capability is a key element of a quantum repeater architecture based on multiplexed quantum memories.","Heller, Lukas; Farrera, Pau; Heinze, Georg; de Riedmatten, Hugues",Phys Rev Lett,,439
223892,Comparison of clinical outcomes in pregnant women with and without COVID-19 based on disease severity,2021,"Direct comparisons between historical and contemporary populations allow for detecting changes in genetic diversity through time and assessment of the impact of habitat fragmentation. Here, we determined the genetic architecture of both historical and modern lions to document changes in genetic diversity over the last century. We surveyed microsatellite and mitochondrial genome variation from 143 high-quality museum specimens of known provenance, allowing us to directly compare this information with data from several recently published nuclear and mitochondrial studies. Our results provide evidence for male-mediated gene flow and recent isolation of local subpopulations, likely due to habitat fragmentation. Nuclear markers showed a significant decrease in genetic diversity from the historical (HE=0.833) to the modern (HE=0.796) populations, while mitochondrial genetic diversity was maintained (Hd = 0.98 for both). While the historical population appears to have been panmictic based on nDNA data, hierarchical structure analysis identified four tiers of genetic structure in modern populations and was able to detect most sampling locations. Mitogenome analyses identified 4 clusters: Southern, Mixed, Eastern, and Western; and were consistent between modern and historically sampled haplotypes. Within the last century, habitat fragmentation caused lion subpopulations to become more geographically isolated as human expansion changed the African landscape. This resulted in an increase in fine-scale nuclear genetic structure and loss of genetic diversity as lion subpopulations became more differentiated, while mitochondrial structure and diversity were maintained over time.","Curry, Caitlin J; Davis, Brian W; Bertola, Laura D; White, Paula A; Murphy, William J; Derr, James N",Mol. biol. evol,,439

224305,Higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding events: a meta-analysis,2021,"Representation learning of static and more recently dynamically evolving graphs has gained noticeable attention. Existing approaches for modelling graph dynamics focus extensively on the evolution of individual nodes independently of the evolution of mesoscale community structures. As a result, current methods do not provide useful tools to study and cannot explicitly capture temporal community dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose GRADE - a probabilistic model that learns to generate evolving node and community representations by imposing a random walk prior over their trajectories. Our model also learns node community membership which is updated between time steps via a transition matrix. At each time step link generation is performed by first assigning node membership from a distribution over the communities, and then sampling a neighbor from a distribution over the nodes for the assigned community. We parametrize the node and community distributions with neural networks and learn their parameters via variational inference. Experiments demonstrate GRADE outperforms baselines in dynamic link prediction, shows favourable performance on dynamic community detection, and identifies coherent and interpretable evolving communities.","Spasov, Simeon; Stefano, Alessandro Di; Lio, Pietro; Tang, Jian",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08060v3.pdf,439
224306,Higher risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding events: a meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronaviruses (CoVs) called the attention of the world for causing outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), in Asia in 2002-03, and respiratory disease in the Middle East (MERS-CoV), in 2012. In December 2019, yet again a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first identified in Wuhan, China, was associated with a severe respiratory infection, known today as COVID-19. This new virus quickly spread throughout China and 30 additional countries. As result, the World Health Organization (WHO) elevated the status of the COVID-19 outbreak from emergency of international concern to pandemic on March 11, 2020. The impact of COVID-19 on public health and economy fueled a worldwide race to approve therapeutic and prophylactic agents, but so far, there are no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines available. In current scenario, the development of in vitro systems for viral mass production and for testing antiviral and vaccine candidates proves to be an urgent matter. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells at the ultrastructural level. METHODS: In this study, we documented, by transmission electron microscopy and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the infection of Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 samples isolated from Brazilian patients. FINDINGS: The infected cells presented cytopathic effects and SARS-CoV-2 particles were observed attached to the cell surface and inside cytoplasmic vesicles. The entry of the virus into cells occurred through the endocytic pathway or by fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. Assembled nucleocapsids were verified inside rough endoplasmic reticulum cisterns (RER). Viral maturation seemed to occur by budding of viral particles from the RER into smooth membrane vesicles. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the susceptibility of Vero-E6 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the viral pathway inside the cells were demonstrated by ultrastructural analysis.","Barreto-Vieira, Debora Ferreira; da Silva, Marcos Alexandre Nunes; Garcia, Cristiana Couto; Miranda, Milene Dias; Matos, Aline da Rocha; Caetano, Braulia Costa; Resende, Paola Cristina; Motta, Fernando Couto; Siqueira, Marilda Mendonça; Girard-Dias, Wendell; Archanjo, Bráulio Soares; Barth, Ortrud Monika",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,,439

227720,Anticipating the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Chemosensory dysfunction (CD) has proven valuable in prediction of COVID-19, as it is a frequent and specific symptom of the disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the duration of CD in patients with sudden subjective olfactory and/or gustatory loss during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The secondary aim was to identify possible prognostic factors for the duration of CD. METHODS: An online baseline questionnaire was designed to assess subjective CD. Three rounds of follow-up questionnaires were sent out to any participants with persistent CD in 6-week intervals, prospectively assessing subjective chemosensory function and extending the follow-up time of this cohort significantly. RESULTS: In total, 467 participants completed the baseline questionnaire. The most significant improvement and recovery of chemosensory function was observed within the first month after the initial loss. Rates became stagnant after about 2 months, and only little improvement and recovery was seen after 2-4 months. After a mean follow-up of 95.9 days (olfactory dysfunction) and 94.0 days (gustatory dysfunction), 86.7% of participants reported gustatory improvement and 82.6% reported olfactory improvement, while 55.0% reported full gustatory recovery and 43.8% reported full olfactory recovery. Female gender was associated with better improvement of gustatory function. High subjective severity of chemosensory loss was associated with lower rates of olfactory and gustatory recovery as well as improvement of olfactory function. Young age was not associated with a better prognosis. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Rates of improvement and recovery of chemosensory function decreased after 2-4 months after initial chemosensory loss, possibly indicating that prolonged and perhaps permanent chemosensory loss may be a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infections. High subjective severity of CD may worsen the prognosis for improvement and recovery of chemosensory function.","Schwab, Janne; Jensen, Caroline Damsgaard; Fjaeldstad, Alexander Wieck",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,,439
227824,"962 Miami mother-baby COVID collaborative: a prospective study linking circulating factors, placental findings and pregnancy complications",2021,"A national control program against bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV) was launched in Norway in 2016. A key strategy in the program is to test for presence of antibodies and protect test-negative herds from infection. Because these viruses are endemic, the rate of re-introduction can be high, and a disease-free status will become more uncertain as time from testing elapses. The aim of this study was to estimate the probability of freedom (PostPFree) from BRSV and BCV antibodies over time by use of bulk tank milk (BTM) antibody-testing, geographic information and animal movement data, and to validate the herd-level estimates against subsequent BTM testing. BTM samples were collected from 1148 study herds in West Norway in 2013 and 2016, and these were analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. PostPFree was calculated for herds that were negative in 2013/2014, and updated periodically with new probabilities every three months. Input variables were test sensitivity, the probability of introduction through animal purchase and local transmission. Probability of introduction through animal purchase was calculated by using real animal movement data and herd prevalence in the region of the source herd. The PostPFree from the final three months in 2015 was compared to BTM test results from March 2016 using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The probability of freedom was generally high for test-negative herds immediately after testing, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests. It did however, decrease with time since testing, and was greatly affected by purchase of livestock. When comparing the median PostPFree for the final three months to the test results in 2016, it was significantly lower (p < 0.01) for test positive herds. Furthermore, there was a large difference in the proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree. The results show that PostPFree provides a better estimate of herd-level BTM status for both BRSV and BCV than what can be achieved by relying solely on the previous test-result.","Toftaker, Ingrid; Ågren, Estelle; Stokstad, Maria; Nødtvedt, Ane; Frössling, Jenny",Prev Vet Med,,439

We propose to migrate developers gradually to PACT programming by lifting familiar code into our more declarative level of abstraction. We then propose a multi-stage compiler that emits human-readable code at each stage that can be hand-tuned by developers seeking more control.

230675,Clinical Characteristics and Predictors of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Infection Outside Intensive Care,2020,"BACKGROUND: General practices in England have been encouraged by national policy to work together on a larger scale by creating primary care networks (PCNs). Policy guidance recommended that they should serve populations of 30 000-50 000 people to perform effectively. AIM: To describe variation in the size and characteristics of PCNs and their populations. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional analysis in England. METHOD: Using published information from January 2020, PCNs were identified that contained <30 000, between 30 000-50 000, and >50 000 people. Percentiles were calculated to describe variation in size and population characteristics. PCN composition within each commissioning region was also examined. RESULTS: In total, 6758 practices had formed 1250 PCNs. Seven hundred and twenty-six (58%) PCNs had the recommended population of 30 000-50 000 people. Eighty-four (7%) PCNs contained <30 000 people. Four hundred and forty (35%) PCNs contained >50 000 people. Thirty-four (3%) PCNs comprised just one practice and 77 (6%) PCNs contained >10 practices. Some PCNs contained more than double the proportions of older people and people with chronic conditions compared to other PCNs. More than half of the population were from very socioeconomically deprived areas in 172 (14%) PCNs. Only six (4%) of the 135 commissioning regions ensured all PCNs were in the recommended population range. All practices had joined a single PCN in three (2%) commissioning regions. CONCLUSION: More than 40% of the PCNs were not of the recommended size, and there was substantial variation in their composition and characteristics. This high variability between PCNs is a risk to their future performance.","Morciano, Marcello; Checkland, Katherine; Hammond, Jonathan; Lau, Yiu-Shing; Sutton, Matt",Br.j.gen.pract,,439

As a result, tweets tend to contain valuable information. With the advancements of deep learning in the domain of natural language processing, extracting meaningful information from tweets has become a growing interest among natural language researchers. Applying existing language representation models to extract information from Twitter does not often produce good results. Moreover, there is no existing language representation models for text analysis specific to the social media domain. Hence, in this article, we introduce two TweetBERT models, which are domain specific language presentation models, pre-trained on millions of tweets. We show that the TweetBERT models significantly outperform the traditional BERT models in Twitter text mining tasks by more than 7% on each Twitter dataset.

234119,The Palliative Performance Scale predicts mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"The global pandemic lockdown created a risk factor for increased alcohol consumption in people with alcohol use disorder and relapse for those who were previously abstinent, with evidence suggesting that pre-lockdown abstinence status is not protective against lockdown-related relapse. We report a unique case of a middle-aged male with alcohol use disorder who experienced alcohol cravings and a fear of relapse due to exposure to disinfectants. A 54-year-old public transportation company worker, previously treated for an alcohol use disorder three times, and abstinent since his last treatment in 2017, reported anxiety, irritability, and constant fear of relapse due to increased exposure to sanitizers during the pandemic. He explained that while the diluted disinfectant made him think of alcohol, the now ever-present undiluted disinfectant makes him constantly crave alcohol and it makes it harder for him to work. Although he started group therapy treatment and had several follow-up visits, his poor performance at work and the fear of relapse resulted in him requesting a position change to work in open spaces and avoid the smell of disinfectant, which helped him remain abstinent. Disinfectants are a part of the ""new normal,"" and their increased use is likely to be continued in the years to come, even after the pandemic resolves. Introducing a new behavioral pattern, such as the daily use of disinfectants in the general population, should prompt us to explore all possible consequences regarding its propagation.","Zaja, Nikola; Vukojevic, Jaksa; Puljic, Antonia",J Addict Dis,,439

It is proved that a proper normalization of the NU-INARCH process endowed with a Skorohod topology weakly converges to a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross diffusion. The asymptotic distribution of the conditional least squares estimator of the correlation parameter is established as a functional of certain stochastic integrals. Numerical experiments based on Monte Carlo simulations are provided to verify the behavior of the asymptotic distribution under finite samples. These simulations reveal that the nearly unstable approach provides satisfactory and better results than those based on the stationarity assumption even when the true process is not that close to non-stationarity. A unit root test is proposed and its Type-I error and power are examined via Monte Carlo simulations. As an illustration, the proposed methodology is applied to the daily number of deaths due to COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.","Barreto-Souza, Wagner; Chan, Ngai Hang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07963v1.pdf,439

This study analyzed the impact of vaccination on discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients and the determinants of discrimination among intended vaccinated people. (2) Methods: A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect data on COVID-19 associated discrimination from nine provinces in China. Pearson chi-square tests and a multivariate ordered logistic regression analyzed the determinants of COVID-19-related discrimination. (3) Results: People who intended to be COVID-19 vaccinated displayed a high level of discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients, with only 37.74% of the intended vaccinated without any prejudice and 34.11% displaying severe discrimination. However, vaccinations reduced COVID-19-related discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients from 79.76% to 62.26%. Sex, age, education level, occupation, geographical region, respondents’ awareness of vaccine effectiveness and infection risk, and COVID-19 knowledge score had a significant influence on the COVID-19 related discrimination (p &lt;0.05). (4) Conclusions: Vaccination significantly reduced COVID-19 associated discrimination, but discrimination rates remained high. Among the intended vaccinated respondents, females, the older aged, people with high school and above education level, retirees, migrant workers, and residents in central China were identified as key targets for information campaigns to reduce COVID-19 related discrimination.","Li, Lu Wang Jian Leng Anli Nicholas Stephen Maitland Elizabeth Liu Rugang",Vaccines,,439
236584,Human important outcomes and EBM during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Vaccination against coronavirus is essential to minimize COVID-19 pandemic. Rare cases of anaphylaxis associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are being described, and the mechanisms involved in these reactions are poorly understood. A potential culprit agent of these vaccine-induced anaphylaxis is the polyethylene glycol, which has been reported as a cause of anaphylaxis. However, a cause-effect association has not been demonstrated and the cases of anaphylaxis to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should be further investigated. In this scenario, the recommendations are inaccurate and can lead to misinterpretation. At the moment, a more accurate recommendation would be the contraindication of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines in patients with immediate hypersensitivity reaction to polyethylene glycol or polysorbate. Patients with history of anaphylaxis to other or unknown causes should be referral to an allergist-immunologist to further orientation.","Giavina-Bianchi, Pedro; Kalil, Jorge",World Allergy Organ J,,439
236789,Clinical features and outcomes of adults with COVID-19: A systematic review and pooled analysis of the literature,2020,"The long-standing ambiguity of the molecular planarity when an alkyl group is attached to a system with conjugated double bonds is a great challenge for both experiments and theory. This also holds true for the case of 2-propionylthiophene (2PT) where a propionyl group is attached at the second position of the planar, aromatic thiophene ring. Results from quantum chemistry at the MP2 level of theory, showing that in the two conformers syn- and anti-2PT the ethyl group of the propionyl moiety is slightly tilted out of the thiophene ring plane, conflict with those from the other methods, stating that the ethyl group is in-plane with the thiophene ring. In the microwave spectrum, both syn- and anti-2PT were observed, and their geometry parameters such as the rotational and quartic centrifugal distortion constants were precisely determined. The experimental heavy atom skeleton obtained by isotopic substitutions revealed a tiny, but non-zero tilt angle of the ethyl group out of the thiophene plane, thereby convincingly confirming the non-planarity of 2-propionylthiophene. This conclusion was further supported by the inertial defects calculated from the experimental rotational constants. Finally, splittings arising from the internal rotation of the terminal methyl group were analysed, yielding torsional barriers of 806.94(54) cm-1 and 864.5(88) cm-1 for the two observed conformers, respectively.","Dindic, Christina; Stahl, Wolfgang; Nguyen, Ha Vinh Lam",,,439

237853,587 Disparities in COVID-19 incidence and outcomes by insurance type,2021,"AIMS: Pre-existing cardiovascular disease in general and related risk factors have been associated with poor coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. However, data on outcomes of COVID-19 among people with pre-existing diagnosis of heart failure (HF) have not been studied in sufficient detail. We aimed to perform detailed characterization of the association of pre-existing HF with COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study based on Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data comparing 30 day mortality and hospital admission rates after COVID-19 diagnosis among Veterans with and without pre-existing diagnosis of HF. Cox-regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) with adjustment for covariates. Among 31 051 veterans (97% male) with COVID-19, 6148 had pre-existing diagnosis of HF. The mean (SD) age of patients with HF was 70 (13) whereas the mean (SD) age of patients without HF was 57 (17). Within the HF group with available data on left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), 1844 patients (63.4%) had an EF of >45%, and 1063 patients (36.6%) had an EF of &#8804;45%. Patients in the HF cohort had higher 30 day mortality (5.4% vs. 1.5%) and admission (18.5% vs. 8.4%) rates after diagnosis of COVID-19. After adjustment for age, sex, and race, HRs (95% CIs) for 30 day mortality and for 30 day hospital admissions were 1.87 (1.61-2.17) and 1.79 (1.66-1.93), respectively. After additional adjustment for medical comorbidities, HRs for 30 day mortality and for 30 day hospital admissions were 1.37 (1.15-1.64) and 1.27 (1.16-1.38), respectively. The findings were similar among HF patients with preserved vs. reduced EF, among those taking vs. not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, and among those taking vs. not taking anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 and pre-existing diagnosis of HF had a higher risk of 30 day mortality and hospital admissions compared to those without history of HF. The findings were similar by EF categories and by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blocker/angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors or anticoagulant use.","Rumery, Kyle; Seo, Angie; Jiang, Lan; Choudhary, Gaurav; Shah, Nishant R; Rudolph, James L; Wu, Wen-Chih; Erqou, Sebhat",ESC Heart Fail,,439

This will provide useful information for planning and resource allocation in the event of any further lockdown. Methods: A prospective analsysis of all patients attending our hand trauma unit throughout the UK COVID-19 lockdown period (24 March to 10 May 2020) was carried out. Prospectively collected departmental data from the same period in 2019 was obtained and reviewed for comparison. The number of patients attending clinic, undergoing surgery, the type of surgical procedure, and rate of surgery was compared. Results: In all, 463 patients attended hand trauma services during the lockdown period compared to 793 in 2019 (32% reduction); 190 surgical procedures were carried out during lockdown compared to 236 in 2019 (20% reduction). Intervention rate was higher during the lockdown period (41% compared to 30%). There was no difference in the type of cases. In the first half of lockdown, 47% fewer procedures were performed than in 2019, but in the second half of lockdown 13% more procedures were carried out than the same period in 2019. Conclusion: Requirements for hand trauma surgery remain high during a pandemic lockdown. Attendances and surgical requirements can be expected to steadily return to normal levels during a prolonged lockdown period. Throughout any future lockdown period adequate surgical provision must be maintained for patients with hand injuries.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-10:639-643.","Atia, Fady; Pocnetz, Sasa; Selby, Anna; Russell, Peter; Bainbridge, Chris; Johnson, Nick",Bone Jt Open,,439

Upon admission, the patient was found to have elevated de novo donor-specific antibodies (DSA) yielding a positive cytotoxicity crossmatch and concurrent elevated plasma donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) level, indicating a possible ongoing rejection despite improvement in his serum creatinine. Because of persistent positive COVID-19 tests and stable serum creatinine, a kidney allograft biopsy was initially deferred and his dd-cfDNA and DSA were monitored closely postdischarge. Three months later, because of persistent elevated dd-cfDNA and positive DSA, a kidney allograft biopsy was performed, which showed chronic active antibody-mediated rejection. Accordingly, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and his maintenance immunosuppressive regimen was increased.","Abuzeineh, Mohammad; Tariq, Anam; Rosenberg, Avi; Brennan, Daniel C",Transplant. proc,,439

Liver transplant (LT) recipients are at risk for lower vaccine immunogenicity and were not included in the registration trials. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and safety in this special population. METHODS: LT recipients followed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center and healthy volunteers were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies directed against the Spike-protein (S) and Nucleocapsid-protein (N) 10-20 days after receiving the second Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose. Information regarding vaccine side effects and clinical data was collected from patients and medical records. RESULTS: Eighty LT recipients were enrolled. Mean age was 60 years and 30% were female. Twenty-five healthy volunteer controls were younger (mean age 52.7 years, p=0.013) and mostly female (68%, p=0.002). All participants were negative for IgG N-protein serology, indicating immunity did not result from prior COVID-19 infection. All controls were positive for IgG S-protein serology. Immunogenicity among LT recipients was significantly lower with positive serology in only 47.5% (p<0.001). Antibody titer was also significantly lower in this group (mean 95.41 AU/mL vs. 200.5 AU/mL in controls, p<0.001). Predictors for negative response among LT recipients were older age, lower eGFR, and treatment with high dose steroids and MMF. No serious adverse events were reported in both groups. CONCLUSION: LT recipients developed substantially lower immunological response to Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccine. Factors influencing serological antibodies response include age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications. The findings require re-evaluation of vaccine regimens in this population. LAY SUMMARY: Liver Transplant recipients had a substantially inferior immunity to the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Less than half of the patients developed sufficient levels of antibodies against the virus, and in those who were positive, average antibody levels were two times less compared to healthy controls. Factors predicting non-response were older age, renal function and immunosuppressive medications.","Rabinowich, Liane; Grupper, Ayelet; Baruch, Roni; Ben-Yehoyada, Merav; Halperin, Tami; Turner, Dan; Katchman, Eugene; Levi, Sharon; Houri, Inbal; Lubezky, Nir; Shibolet, Oren; Katchman, Helena",J. hepatol,,439

However, the relationship is not linear. Human psychology also has an impact on the outbreak. Thus, proper strategies to manage human psychology, especially mental health, is very important to break the vicious cycle. This article aims to discuss ways to manage mental health using cognitive-behavioural approaches, mindfulness and spirituality. Specific cognitive-behavioural and mindfulness strategies are listed and suggestions to return to the foundation of human existence are discussed. By practising the cognitive-behavioural, mindfulness, and spirituality strategies described, we may enhance our acceptance, optimism and commitment to prepare for a ‘new or renewed normal’.","Khaiyom, Jamilah Hanum Abdul",Malays.

A clinical study was carried out with the participation of 60 patients with CGP (group 1) and 22 patients with cancer of OM (group 2) of the T1-2N0M0 stage, as well as 15 healthy individuals with no revealed periodontal pathology. CGP patients, depending on the depth of periodontal pockets (PC), were divided into two subgroups - with a mild degree (PC depth up to 3.5 mm) and an average degree (PC depth from 4 to 6 mm). Group 2 patients were also divided into two subgroups - with exacerbation of CGP (n=12) and patients with no complications (n=10). The content of HIF-1&#945; in the gingival fluid was determined by enzyme immunoassay. The results of the study made it possible to establish that in patients of group 1, the concentration of HIF-1&#945; in inflammatory exudate increased by 2.4 times (p<0.001) compared with the control group. The concentration of HIF-1&#945; in the contents of periodontal pockets in patients with CGP depended on the severity of the disease: with mild CGP, it did not differ from the control group, and with moderate CGP it was 3.15 times higher (p<0.001). In patients with cancer of OM, the concentration of HIF-1&#945; in the gingival fluid did not depend on the presence of inflammatory periodontal lesions and was determined by a multiple increase in the biomarker level (7.5 times) due to the development of a malignant process in the oral cavity. Therefore, monitoring the concentration of HIF-1&#945; in the gingival fluid is informative in patients with CGP in assessing the severity of periodontal conditions, as well as in differential diagnosis with malignant formations of the oral cavity.","Zorina, O A; Amkhadova, M A; Abaev, Z M; Khamukova, A A; Demidova, A A",Stomatologiia (Mosk),,439

Under normal circumstances, gross anatomy classes give students opportunities to touch and observe human bones and cadaveric tissues, thus enhancing their understanding; such morphology is difficult to learn from textbooks alone. As many studies have shown, three-dimensional (3D) technologies used in online lectures can serve as alternatives to real specimens for providing knowledge of anatomy. However, such technologies are often expensive. The goal of this study was to create three-dimensional anatomy models for online lectures using a free cellphone app. METHODS: Free application software (Qlone) was used to create 3D anatomical models. The extracranium and intracranium of adult skull, fetal skull, mandible, temporal bone, second cervical vertebra, and ilium were all scanned and exported to the computer in 3D format. A total of 53 anatomical structures were evaluated by nine observers. RESULTS: Although the 53 structures used in this study did not include all the structures that students need to learn, visibility was good/acceptable for most of the 53. CONCLUSIONS: The free and simple 3D scanning app used in this study could enable anatomy educators to provide better content to students during online lectures.","Iwanaga, Joe; Terada, Satoshi; Kim, Hee-Jin; Tabira, Yoko; Arakawa, Takamitsu; Watanabe, Koichi; Dumont, Aaron S; Tubbs, R Shane",Clin. anat,,439

OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the rapid adoption of telemedicine in spine surgery. This study sought to determine the extent of adoption and global perspectives on telemedicine in spine surgery. METHODS: All members of AO Spine International were emailed an anonymous survey covering the participant's experiences with and perceptions of telemedicine. Descriptive statistics were used to depict responses. Responses were compared among regions. RESULTS: 485 spine surgeons participated in the survey. Telemedicine usage rose from <10.0% to >39.0% of all visits. A majority of providers (60.5%) performed at least one telemedicine visit. The format of ""telemedicine"" varied widely by region: European (50.0%) and African (45.2%) surgeons were more likely to use phone calls, whereas North (66.7%) and South American (77.0%) surgeons more commonly used video (P < 0.001). North American providers used telemedicine the most during COVID-19 (>60.0% of all visits). 81.9% of all providers ""agreed/strongly agreed"" telemedicine was easy to use. Respondents tended to ""agree"" that imaging review, the initial appointment, and postoperative care could be performed using telemedicine. Almost all (95.4%) surgeons preferred at least one in-person visit prior to the day of surgery. CONCLUSION: Our study noted significant geographical differences in the rate of telemedicine adoption and the platform of telemedicine utilized. The results suggest a significant increase in telemedicine utilization, particularly in North America. Spine surgeons found telemedicine feasible for imaging review, initial visits, and follow-up visits although the vast majority still preferred at least one in-person preoperative visit.","Riew, Grant J; Lovecchio, Francis; Samartzis, Dino; Louie, Philip K; Germscheid, Niccole; An, Howard; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Chutkan, Norman; Mallow, Gary Michael; Neva, Marko H; Phillips, Frank M; Sciubba, Daniel; El-Sharkawi, Mohammad; Valacco, Marcelo; McCarthy, Michael H; Makhni, Melvin C; Iyer, Sravisht",Global Spine J,,439

Additionally, it will be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the very ""pointof-care"". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response time, such as in case of molecular tests.

DESIGN: Three cross-sectional online health surveys were conducted during March-May 2020. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine associations between self-reported changes in fruit, vegetable, soft drink and sweet and salted snack consumption or weight as dependent variables and food insecurity indicators as independent variables, adjusted for gender, household composition, educational attainment and household income. SETTING: Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: 8640 adults recruited by convenience sampling. RESULTS: About 10.4% of Belgians often or sometimes feared food shortages, 5.0% were often or sometimes short of food without money to buy more and 10.3% often or sometimes could not afford to eat a healthy diet during confinement. These percentages were highest among single-parent families (26.7%, 14.4% and 23.4% respectively). Adults who often or sometimes feared that food would run out during confinement had significantly higher odds of decreased versus unchanged fruit (3.53; 95%CI=2.06-6.05) and vegetable (5.42; 95%CI=2.90-10.11) consumption and significantly higher odds of increased versus unchanged soft drink consumption (3.79; 95%CI=2.20-6.54). Similar results were found for adults who often or sometimes ran out of food and for adults who often or sometimes were not able to afford a healthy diet. CONCLUSION: Food insecurity during the COVID-19 confinement measures in Belgium was associated with adverse changes in most dietary behaviours. A strong government response is needed to tackle malnutrition and food insecurity to protect public health for ongoing and future pandemics.","Vandevijvere, Stefanie; De Ridder, Karin; Drieskens, Sabine; Charafeddine, Rana; Berete, Finaba; Demarest, Stefaan",Public Health Nutr,,439

Empirical data relying on patients' reports of forgoing health care are scarce. This study investigated Covid-19-related self-reports of forgoing health care in a sample of vulnerable outpatients in Geneva, Switzerland. We collected data from 1167 adult outpatients, including clinically vulnerable patients (with chronic diseases), geriatric patients (involved in a health care network for people aged 60 or older), and socially vulnerable patients (involved in a migrant health program or a mobile outpatient community care center) in June 2020. Data on sociodemographic factors, forgoing health care, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were collected. Of the patients, 38.5% reported forgoing health care. Forgoing health care was more frequent for younger patients, women, patients with a low level of education, and patients with a chronic disease (p < .001). There was no significant association between the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and forgoing health care (p = .983). As the decrease in routine management of patients might have important and unpredictable adverse health consequences, avoiding delayed health care is crucial.","Baggio, Stéphanie; Vernaz, Nathalie; Spechbach, Hervé; Salamun, Julien; Jacquerioz, Frédérique; Stringhini, Silvia; Jackson, Yves; Guessous, Idris; Chappuis, François; Wolff, Hans; Gétaz, Laurent",Prev Med,,439

256495,Factors associated with the presence of headache in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and impact on prognosis: a retrospective cohort study,2020,"To optimize the public health response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we must first understand the antibody response to individual proteins on the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the antibody's cross reactivity to other coronaviruses. Using a panel of 37 convalescent COVID-19 human serum samples, we showed that the magnitude and specificity of responses varied across individuals, independent of their reactivity to seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs). These data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines will elicit primary humoral immune responses in naïve individuals and variable responses in those previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Unlike the limited cross-coronavirus reactivities in humans, serum samples from 96 dogs and 10 cats showed SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific responses focused on non-S1 proteins. The correlation of this response with those to other coronaviruses suggests that the antibodies are cross-reactive and generated to endemic viruses within these hosts, which must be considered in seroepidemiologic studies. We conclude that substantial variation in antibody generation against coronavirus proteins will influence interpretations of serologic data in the clinical and veterinary settings.","Kim, Hyunsuh; Seiler, Patrick; Jones, Jeremy C; Ridout, Granger; Camp, Kristi P; Fabrizio, Thomas P; Jeevan, Trushar; Miller, Lance A; Throm, Robert E; Ferrara, Francesca; Fredrickson, Richard L; Lowe, James F; Wang, Leyi; Odemuyiwa, Solomon O; Wan, Xiu-Feng; Webby, Richard J",,,439

In times of the corona pandemic surgery and rehabilitation appointments were cancelled or delayed leading to a more difficult access to auditory rehabilitation. Newly implemented hygiene modalities due to the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic have changed medical aftercare and the rehabilitation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation. A successful rehabilitation should ensure a fear-free environment by adhering to the necessary hygiene modalities.","Aschendorff, A; Arndt, S; Kröger, S; Wesarg, T; Ketterer, M C; Kirchem, P; Pixner, S; Hassepaß, F; Beck, R",HNO,,439
256951,Videoconferencing Psychotherapy for Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia: Outcome and Treatment Processes From a Non-randomized Non-inferiority Trial,2020,"The pandemic prevalence of COVID-19 has become a very serious global health issue. Scientists all over the world have been seriously attempting in the discovery of a drug to combat SARS-CoV-2. It has been found that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) plays a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and thus could be a potential drug target. Here, comprehensive computational approaches including drug repurposing and molecular docking were employed to predict an effective drug candidate targeting RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. This study revealed that Rifabutin, Rifapentine, Fidaxomicin, 7-methyl-guanosine-5'-triphosphate-5'-guanosine and Ivermectin have a potential inhibitory interaction with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 and could be effective drugs for COVID-19. In addition, virtual screening of the compounds from ZINC database also allowed the prediction of two compounds (ZINC09128258 and ZINC09883305) with pharmacophore features that interact effectively with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, indicating their potentiality as effective inhibitors of the enzyme. Furthermore, ADME analysis along with analysis of toxicity was also undertaken to check the pharmacokinetics and drug-likeness properties of the two compounds. Comparative structural analysis of protein-inhibitor complexes revealed that the amino acids Y32, K47, Y122, Y129, H133, N138, D140, T141, S709 and N781 are crucial for drug surface hotspot in the RdRp of SARS-CoV-2.","Parvez, Md Sorwer Alam; Karim, Md Adnan; Hasan, Mahmudul; Jaman, Jomana; Karim, Ziaul; Tahsin, Tohura; Hasan, Md Nazmul; Hosen, Mohammad Jakir",Int J Biol Macromol,,439
257254,Efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine versus Lopinavir-Ritonavir in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A non-randomized controlled trial,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The novel corona virus (SARS-CoV2) has been demonstrated to cause acute kidney injury due to direct cellular toxicity as well as due to a variety of autoimmune glomerular diseases. The concept of a surge of infected patients resulting in an overwhelming number of critical patients has been a central concern in healthcare planning during the COVID-19 era. RECENT FINDINGS: One crucial question remains as to how to manage patients with end stage renal disease and acute kidney injury in case of a massive surge of critically ill infected patients. Some publications address practical and ingenious solutions for just such a surge of need for renal replacement therapy. We present a plan for using a blood pump, readily available dialysis filter, and a prefilter and postfilter replacement fluid set up. This is in conjunction with multiple intravenous pumps to develop a simple hemofiltration apparatus. SUMMARY: The current set up may be a readily available option for use in critical situations where the need for renal replacement therapy outstrips the capacity of traditional hemodialysis services in a hospital or region.","Hanna, Ramy M; Ferrey, Antoney; Rhee, Connie M; Sam, Ramin; Pearce, David; Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar; Don, Burl R",Curr Opin Nephrol Hypertens,,439

Usually, this virus spreads in humans through aerial precipitation of any fluid secreted from the infected entity's body part. This type of virus is fatal than other unpremeditated viruses. Meanwhile, another class of coronavirus was developed in December 2019, named Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), first seen in Wuhan, China. From January 23, 2020, the number of affected individuals from this virus rapidly increased in Wuhan and other countries. This research proposes a system for classifying and analyzing the predictions obtained from symptoms of this virus. The proposed system aims to determine those attributes that help in the early detection of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). This work computes the accuracy of different machine learning classifiers and selects the best classifier for COVID-19 detection based on comparative analysis. ANFIS is used to model and control ill-defined and uncertain systems to predict this globally spread disease's risk factor. COVID-19 dataset is classified using Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it achieved the highest accuracy of 100% among all classifiers. Furthermore, the ANFIS model is implemented on this classified dataset, which results in an 80% risk prediction for COVID-19.","Iwendi, Celestine; Mahboob, Kainaat; Khalid, Zarnab; Javed, Abdul Rehman; Rizwan, Muhammad; Ghosh, Uttam",Multimed Syst,,439

Use of tracheostomy can facilitate weaning from ventilation and potentially increase the availability of much needed intensive care unit (ICU) beds, however this being a high aerosol generating procedure it does put the health care worker to risk of transmission. Here we present our experience and protocols for performing tracheostomy in COVID-19 positive patients. Eleven tracheostomies were performed in COIVD-19 patients over a period of 2 months (May-June 2020) at this tertiary care hospital dedicated to manage COVID patients. All patients underwent open surgical tracheostomy, the specific indication, preoperative protocols, surgical steps and precautions taken have been discussed. Tracheostomy was done not before 10 days after initiation of mechanical ventilation. Patient's cardiovascular vitals should show recovery with some spontaneous effort. There should be reduction in need for FiO2 and ventilator requirements. Of total 11 tracheostomies performed only one patient had post procedure bleeding which was controlled conservatively. We have summarized our experience in performing tracheostomies in 11 such patients. Our guidelines and recommendations on tracheostomy during the COVID-19 pandemic are presented in this study. We suggest tracheostomies to be done after 10 days of intubation with precautions and given indications with the idea of early weaning off of patient from ventilator and more availability of ICU beds which is already overwhelmed by patient load.","Mishra, Prasun; Jedge, Prashant; Kaushik, Maitri; Artham, Purva; Kumari, Sagun",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,439

The results show positive shocks in COVID-19 cases and deaths improve the air quality of the city. This implies that the pandemic has lowered down environmental pressure in one of the top most polluted cities of the world. Further, the problem of hazardous air pollution in Lahore city is manmade mainly caused by everyday human activities. When these human activities were restricted owing to a rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths, the air pollution in the city resultantly reduces.

Clinical observation has shown a somewhat high prevalence of sick euthyroid syndrome among patients with COVID-19. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of free triiodothyronine (FT3) at the clinical presentation of COVID-19 for disease severity and death. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was based on electronic medical records. The study was conducted at Sheba Medical Centre, a tertiary hospital where several acute and chronic wards have been dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The primary outcome measure was death during hospitalization; secondary outcomes included hospitalization in intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and length of hospitalization. RESULTS: Of a total of 577 polymerase chain reaction-positive patients with COVID-19 hospitalized between February 27 and July 30, 2020, 90 had at least 1 measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, and FT3 within 3 days of presentation. After applying strict exclusion criteria, 54 patients were included in the study. Patients in the lowest tertile of FT3 had significantly higher rates of mortality (40%, 5.9%, and 5.9%, P = .008), mechanical ventilation (45%, 29.4%, and 0.0%; P = .007) and intensive care unit admission (55%, 29.4%, and 5.9%, P = .006). In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, Charlson comorbidity index, creatinine, albumin, and white blood cell count. FT3 remained a significant independent predictor of death. CONCLUSION: FT3 levels can serve as a prognostic tool for disease severity in the early presentation of COVID-19.","Schwarz, Yair; Percik, Ruth; Oberman, Bernice; Yaffe, Dana; Zimlichman, Eyal; Tirosh, Amir",Endocr Pract,,439

In order to control the rapid spread of the virus, the Chinese government implemented a national lockdown policy. It restricted human mobility and non-essential economic activities, which, as a side effect, resulted in the reduction of the emission of pollutants and thus the improvement of the air quality in many cities in China. In this paper, we report on a study on the changes in air quality in the Guanzhong Basin during the COVID-19 lockdown period. We compared the concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO and O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; obtained from ground-based monitoring stations before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis confirmed that the air quality in the Guanzhong Basin was significantly improved after the COVID-19 outbreak. During the emergency response period with the strictest restrictions (Level-1), the concentrations of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO were lower by 37%, 30%, 29%, 52% and 33%, respectively, compared with those before the COVID-19 outbreak. In contrast, O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations increased substantially. The changes in the pollutant concentrations varied between cities during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The highest O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; concentration changes were observed in Xi'an, Weinan and Xianyang city;the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration decreased substantially in Tongchuan city;the air quality had improved the most in Baoji City. Next, to complement the sparsely distributed air quality ground-based monitoring stations, the geographic and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model, combined with satellite observations of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological factors was used to estimate the spatial and temporal distributions of PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations with a resolution of 6 km x 6 km before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. The model was validated by a comparison with ground-based observations from the air quality monitoring network in five cities in the Guanzhong Basin with excellent statistical metrics. For PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt; and PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; the correlation coefficients R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; were 0.86 and 0.80, the root mean squared errors (RMSE) were 11.03 micro g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 14.87 micro g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and the biases were 0.19 micro g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and -0.27 micro g/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which led to the conclusion that the GTWR model could be used to estimate the PM concentrations in locations where monitoring data were not available. Overall, the PM concentrations in the Guanzhong Basin decreased substantially during the lockdown period, with a strong initial decrease and a slower one thereafter, although the spatial distributions remained similar.","Zhang, KaiNan Leeuw G. de Yang ZhiQiang Chen XingFeng Jiao JiaShuang",Remote Sensing,,439

China is facing the risks of importation and local rebound of COVID-19. Under the circumstances, preparations for medical resources are in urgently needed. Methods: Based on current understanding of the disease, we set up five scenarios and use the infectious disease transmission dynamic and pandemic theoretical static models to evaluate the demand for medical resources. Results: Different epidemic strength and strategies of disease control and prevention resulted in different levels of medical resource request, and active control strategy and effective measures could significantly decrease the requirement. During the epidemic rising phase, the cost of prevention and control measures and the requirement of professional response capacities would increase with potential high risk of medical resource demand sharply increasing. Conclusion: Regions with different economic level, population scale, and different prevention and control capabilities should all initiate scientific assessment of medical resource requirement under emergency response and prepare for possible future rebound and epidemic.","Zhang, T; Wu, H T; Wang, L H; Yang, W Z",Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,,439
272856,Expression of Concern: Lung ultrasound score in establishing the timing of intubation in COVID-19 interstitial pneumonia: A preliminary retrospective observational study,2020,"The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has quickly spread to a large number of countries leading to a great number of deaths. Unfortunately, till today there is no specific treatment or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the suggested treatment medications are based on in vitro laboratory investigations, experimental animal models, or previous clinical experience in treating similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 or other retroviral infections. The running of any clinical trial during a pandemic is affected at multiple levels. Reasons for this include patient hesitancy or inability to continue investigative treatments due to self-isolation/quarantine, or limited access to public places (including hospitals). Additional barriers relate to health care professionals being committed to other critical tasks or quarantining themselves due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. The best research approaches are those that adapt to such external unplanned obstacles. Ongoing clinical trials before COVID-19 pandemic have the potential for identifying important therapies in the long-term if they can be completed as planned. However, these clinical trials may require modifications due a pandemic such as this one to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants as well as medical staff involved in the conduction of clinical trials. Clinical trials initiated during the pandemic must be time-efficient and flexible due to high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the significant number of reported deaths, and time constraints needed to perform high quality clinical trials, enrolling adequate sample sizes. Collaboration between different countries as well as implementation of innovative clinical trial designs are essential to successfully complete such initiatives during the current pandemic. Studies looking at the long term sequalae of COVID-19 are also of importance as recent publications describe multi-organ involvement. Long term follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is thus also important to identify possible physical and mental health sequellae.","AlNaamani, Khalid; AlSinani, Siham; Barkun, Alan N",World J. Clin.

273260,Use of the first National Early Warning Score recorded within 24 hours of admission to estimate the risk of in-hospital mortality in unplanned COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: Isolation of COVID-19 patients has been universally implemented to control transmission of the outbreak. Hotels and other facilities have been adapted to help appropriate isolation be achieved. Our study tested the efficacy of isolating patients in a reconditioned hotel versus isolation in their domiciles to reduce infection transmission. METHODS: Observational cohort study based on a survey to COVID-19 patients between April and June 2020. One cohort had been isolated in a hotel and the other in their domiciles. Multivariate regression models analyzed the factors related to the occurrence of COVID-19 infection among the household members. RESULTS: A total of 229 household members of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, 139 of them belonging to the group of hotel-isolated patients and 90 in the group of domicile-isolated ones. More than half of the household members became infected (53.7%). Higher risk of infection was found in the household members of domicile-isolated patients isolated and in those reporting overcrowding at home, (odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-3.12) and (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.81; 2.56), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of COVID-19 patients in community-supervised facilities may protect their household members from transmission of the disease. Overcrowded homes may contribute to the transmission of the infection.","López, Mercé; Gallego, Claudia; Abós-Herrándiz, Rafael; Tobella, Ana; Turmo, Nuria; Monclús, Alba; Martinez, Alba; Rami, Artur; Navas, Elena; Muñoz, Miguel-Angel",J. public health (Oxf),,439

A Meta-Analysis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers have a high risk of cross-infection during the care of Covid-19 cases. Personal protective equipment can reduce the risk. However, healthcare workers must be trained for the proper use of personal protective equipment to decrease exposure risk. This study aimed to investigate whether videos available on YouTube, presenting procedures of donning and doffing personal protective equipment, can be a useful learning resource for healthcare workers. METHODS: A search of YouTube was conducted using the keywords ""Covid-19, personal protective equipment, donning, doffing"". Two investigators reviewed each video and collected the basic video information. Total videos were assessed independently as educationally useful and non-useful categories using a valid tool. The relationship of each video's usefulness with viewers' preferences and the upload source were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 300 videos were assessed; 66 (22%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Total video scores of educationally useful videos were higher than non-useful ones; the differences were significant. Healthcare/government agencies and hospitals mostly created educationally useful videos, e-learning platforms, and individuals mainly created non-useful videos. Significant correlations were observed between the video's usefulness and the total view and views per day. CONCLUSIONS: During a pandemic, YouTube might be a resource for learning donning and doffing of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers if an appropriate selection process applied for determining educationally useful videos.","Kozanhan, Betul; Tutar, Mahmut Sami; Arslan, Derya",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

Thus, as the creation and translation of effective COVID-19 vaccines continues at an unprecedented speed, the development of fast and effective methods to measure neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 will become increasingly important to determine long-term protection against infection for both previously infected and immunized individuals. This paper describes a high-throughput protocol using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to measure the presence of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent serum from patients who have recently recovered from COVID-19. The use of a replicating pseudotyped virus eliminates the necessity for a containment level 3 facility required for SARS-CoV-2 handling, making this protocol accessible to virtually any containment level 2 lab. The use of a 96-well format allows for many samples to be run at the same time with a short turnaround time of 24 h.","Jamieson, Taylor R; Poutou, Joanna; Marius, Ricardo; He, Xiaohong; Rezaei, Reza; Azad, Taha; Ilkow, Carolina S",J. vis. exp,,439

We presented a 29-year-old male patient with COVID-19 who developed new-onset transient attention deficit and memory problems following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Structural neuroimaging was normal. MR-spectroscopy (MRS) of the bilateral DLPFC revealed significant for decreased levels of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate, and glutamate/glutamine ratio. After a follow-up without any medical treatment but with suggestions of memory exercises for three months a control MRS screening of DLPFC showed improved levels of NAA, glutamate, and glutamate/glutamine ratio. This report may suggest that cognitive deficits in SARS-CoV-2 infection can result from glutamatergic dysfunction with decreased NAA and glutamate levels in bilateral DLPFC.","Yesilkaya, Umit Haluk; Sen, Meltem; Balcioglu, Yasin Hasan",J Clin Neurosci,,439

281374,Prevalence and Associated Risk Factors of Mortality Among COVID-19 Patients: A Meta-Analysis,2020,"Digital technologies have been developed for postgraduate students to help them to access data and published research, write their dissertations, and communicate with their supervisors. In South Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has compelled masters students to make greater use of digital technologies to ensure continuity and productivity under government-imposed lockdown at home. In previous studies, students have been observed to use digital technologies to address professionalisation or socialisation experiences at the expense of personalisation experience. This qualitative case study of five master’s students explores their experiences of using digital technologies during the COVID-19 lockdown. The participants were purposively selected from a larger sample of 14 students who participated in the researcher’s doctoral study. Semi-structured interviews, focus group discussion and questionnaire methods were conducted with the participants, and inductive (thematic) analysis, in conjunction with deductive analysis (using the Persona-Tech analytical framework proposed in this study) was used to analyse and interpret the data. The findings revealed that some participants were aware of their personal research needs, and were able to identify digital technologies suitable for their studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the process of knowing and understanding their research needs, the participants became problem-centred and be able to tolerate uncertainty caused by COVID-19. These participants emphasised convenience and continuity. However, other participants experienced the unsystematic introduction of these digital technologies as a barrier to usage. This study suggests that researchers combine their socialisation and professionalisation experiences of using technology to create a personalisation experience that addresses their individual research needs.","Sokhulu, Lerato Hlengiwe",Afr.

The speed of this viral spread together with the high mortality rate has caused an unprecedented public health crisis. With no antivirals or vaccines available for the treatment of COVID-19, the medical community is presently exploring repositioning of clinically approved drugs for COVID-19. Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have emerged as potential candidates for repositioning as anti-COVID-19 therapeutics and have received FDA authorization for compassionate use in COVID-19 patients. On March 28, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19. However, it was later revoked by the FDA on June 15, 2020, after analyzing the emerging scientific data from ongoing clinical trials. Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) also conducted a Solidarity trial of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and ritonavir. However, on May 23, 2020, the executive body of the ""Solidarity trial"" decided to put a temporary hold on the HCQ trial. On June 17, 2020, the WHO abruptly stopped the Solidarity trial of HCQ. The current review strives to examine the basis of compassionate use of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 in terms of literature evidence, establishing the antiviral efficacy of these drugs against corona and related viruses. Furthermore, the review presents a critical analysis of the clinical trial findings and also provides an insight into the dynamically changing decision on the authorization and withdrawal of HCQ as anti-COVID-19 therapy by the U.S. FDA and the WHO. Ultimately, our study necessitates an evidenced-based treatment protocol to confront the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and not the mere observational study that mislead the public healthcare system, which paralyzes the entire world.","Manivannan, E.; Karthikeyan, C.; Moorthy, Nshn Chaturvedi S.

284779,"Conjectures versus Facts: Flow, Doors and Protectors - Oh My?",2020,"Extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are increasingly identified as the cause of both community and healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (UTIs), with CTX-Ms being the most common ESBLs identified. CTX-M-producing GNB are resistant to most ß-lactam antibiotics and are frequently multidrug-resistant, which limits treatment options. Rapid diagnostic tests that can detect ESBL-producing GNB, particularly CTX-M producers, in the urine of patients with UTIs are needed. Results from such a test could direct the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy at the point-of-care (POC). In this study, we show that a chromogenic, dual enzyme-mediated amplification system (termed DETECT [dual-enzyme trigger-enabled cascade technology]) can identify CTX-M-producing GNB from unprocessed urine samples in 30 minutes. We first tested DETECT against a diverse set of recombinant ß-lactamases and ß-lactamase-producing clinical isolates to elucidate its selectivity. We then tested DETECT with 472 prospectively collected clinical urine samples submitted for urine culture to a hospital clinical microbiology laboratory. Of these, 118 (25%) were consistent with UTI, 13 (11%) of which contained ESBL-producing GNB. We compared DETECT results in urine against a standard phenotypic method to detect ESBLs, and polymerase chain reaction and sequencing for CTX-M genes. DETECT demonstrated 90.9% sensitivity and 97.6% specificity (AUC, 0.937; 95% confidence interval, 0.822-1.000), correctly identifying 10 of 11 urine samples containing a clinically significant concentration of CTX-M-producing GNB (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis). Our results demonstrate the clinical potential of DETECT to deliver diagnostic information at the POC, which could improve initial antibiotic selection.","Tarlton, Nicole J; Petrovic, Danka-Florence; Frazee, Bradley W; Borges, Clarissa A; Pham, Emily M; Milton, Aubrianne K; Jackson, Nicole; deBoer, Tara R; Murthy, Niren; Riley, Lee W",Microb. drug resist.

Each of these phases carries distinct risks that need identification and mitigation, forcing laboratory managers to rethink and adapt their procedures in response to the pandemic. The sudden and unprecedented nature of the pandemic forced laboratory managers from around the world to base decisions on opinion and experience when evidence-based response options were unavailable. These perspectives on pandemic response were presented during a virtual international symposium on COVID-19, held on 3 April 2020, and organized by the London Laboratory Managers' Group. Laboratory managers from seven different countries at different stages of the pandemic (China, Italy, Spain, France, UK, Brazil and Australia) presented their personal experiences to a select audience of experienced laboratory managers from 19 different countries. The intention of this paper is to collect the learnings and considerations from this group of laboratory managers who collaborated to share personal experiences to contribute to the debate surrounding what constitutes good IVF laboratory practice in extraordinary circumstances, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hickman, Cristina; Rogers, Shaun; Huang, Guoning; MacArthur, Steven; Meseguer, Marcos; Nogueira, Daniela; Portela, Rafael; Rienzi, Laura; Sharp, Timothy; Ye, Hong",Reprod Biomed Online,,439
289854,Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura and the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine,2021,AIM: Influenza vaccination is the most effective method in prevention of influenza disease and its complications. Our study aimed to investigate the rates of vaccination and the behaviors and attitudes against the vaccine in healthcare workers in Turkey. METHODS: This multicenter national survey is a descriptive study in which 12475 healthcare workers. Healthcare workers were asked to answer the questionnaire consisting of 12 questions via the survey. RESULTS: It was found that 6.7% of the healthcare workers regularly got vaccinated each year and that 55% had never had the influenza vaccine before. The biggest obstacle against getting vaccinated was determined as not believing in the necessity of the vaccine (53.1%). CONCLUSION: The rates of influenza vaccination in healthcare workers in Turkey are quite low. False knowledge and attitudes on the vaccine and disease are seen as the most important reasons to decline vaccination. It is important to detect reasons for anti-vaccination and set a course in order to increase the rates of vaccination.,"Korkmaz, Nesibe; Nazik, Selçuk; Sule Gümüstakim, Raziye; Uzar, Hanife; Kul, Gülnur; Tosun, Selma; Torun, Ayse; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Seremet Keskin, Aysegül; Bahar Kaçmaz, Asiye; Aytaç Erdem, Hüseyin; Uysal, Serhat; Deniz Aliravci, Isil; Yesilyurt Sölen, Emine; Can, Hüseyin; Deniz, Mustafa; Demiray Gürbüz, Ebru; Kostakoglu, Ugur; Bölükbasi, Hilal",Int J Clin Pract,,439

Eat Well Saskatchewan (EWS) implemented a 16-week social media campaign (#eatwellcovid19) led by a dietitian and nutrition student that focused on sharing stories submitted by the Saskatchewan public about how they are eating healthy during COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: Objective: To describe implementation of the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign, and results from the evaluation of the campaign which included campaign performance using social media metrics and experiences and perspectives of campaign followers. METHODS: Methods: Saskatchewan, Canada residents were invited to submit personal stories and experiences to EWS about how they are eating healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic from April-August 2020. Each week, one to three stories were featured on EWS social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter), along with evidence-based nutrition information to help residents become more resilient to challenges related to food and nutrition experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals who submitted stories were entered into a weekly draw for a $100 grocery gift card. Social media metrics and semi-structured qualitative interviews of campaign followers were used to evaluate #eatwellcovid19. RESULTS: Results: In total, n=75 stories were submitted by n=74 individuals on a variety of topics (e.g., grocery shopping, traditional skills, gardening) and n=42 were featured on social media. EWS shared 194 #eatwellcovid19 posts across social media platforms (Facebook: n=100;Instagram: n=55;Twitter: n=39). On Facebook, #eatawellcovid19 reached 100,571, left 128,818 impressions and there were 9,575 engagements. On Instagram, the campaign reached 11,310, made 14,145 impressions, received 823 likes and 15 comments. On Twitter, #eatwellcovid19 made 15,199 impressions and received 424 engagements. Featured story submission posts had the best engagement on Facebook and the most likes and comments on Instagram. The EWS social media pages reported increases in following during the campaign (Instagram: +30%;Twitter: +14%;Facebook: +12%). Results from the interviews reveal that there were two types of campaign followers - those who appreciated hearing the stories submitted by followers as it helped them to feel connected to the community during social isolation, and those that appreciated the evidence-based information. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Numerous stories were submitted to the #eatwellcovid19 social media campaign on various topics. On Instagram and Facebook, posts that featured these stories had the highest engagement. During this campaign, EWS social media following increased by &gt;10% on each platform. The approach used for #eatwellcovid19 could be considered by others looking to develop health promotion campaigns.","Grantham, J.; Verishagen, C.; Whiting, S. J.; Henry, C. J.; Lieffers, J.

293448,Early Detection of Silent Hypoxia in Covid-19 Pneumonia Using Smartphone Pulse Oximetry,2020,"The carbon dioxide emissions from Portland cement production have increased significantly, and Portland cement is the main binder used in self-compacting concrete, so there is an urgent need to find environmentally friendly materials as alternative resources. In most developing countries, the availability of huge amounts of agricultural waste has paved the way for studying how these materials can be processed into self-compacting concrete as binders and aggregate compositions. Therefore, this experimental program was carried out to study the properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) made with local metakaolin and coal bottom ash separately and combined. Total 25 mixes were prepared with four mixes as 5, 10, 15, and 20% replacement of cement with metakaolin; four mixes as 10, 20, 30, and 40% of coal bottom ash as partial replacement of fine aggregates separately; and 16 mixes prepared combined with metakaolin and coal bottom ash. The fresh properties were explored by slump flow, T50 flow, V-funnel, L-box, and J-ring sieve segregation test. Moreover, the hardened properties of concrete were performed for compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strength and permeability of SCC mixtures. Fresh concrete test results show that even if no viscosity modifier is required, satisfactory fresh concrete properties of SCC can be obtained by replacing the fine aggregate with coal bottom ash content. At 15% replacement of cement with local metakaolin is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC. At 30% replacement of fine aggregate is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC. In the combined mix, 10% replacement of cement with metakaolin combined with 30% replacement of fine aggregate with coal bottom ash is optimum and gave better results as compared to control SCC.","Keerio, Manthar Ali; Saand, Abdullah; Kumar, Aneel; Bheel, Naraindas; Ali, Karm",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The effects of feed temperature, feed velocity and permeate velocity on temperature polarization were mainly investigated for a high-concentration NaCl solution. The temperature polarization was increased with the increase of feed temperature and the decrease of feed and permeate velocity. The effects of temperature, inlet velocity and solution concentration on the evaporation efficiency of the membrane module for co- and counter-current operations were investigated in detail. The counter-current operation performed better than co-current operation in most cases, except for the condition where the NaCl concentration was relatively low or the module length was long enough. In addition, the optimal membrane thickness for both PVDF and PTFE was studied. The optimal membrane thickness was found in the range of 10 to 20 µm, which corresponded to the highest permeate flux for the selected materials, pore size distribution, and operation conditions. Membrane material with lower thermal conductivity and larger porosity was prone to get higher permeate flux and had larger optimal membrane thickness. Increasing feed velocity or feed temperature could decrease the optimal membrane thickness.","Ni, Weiming; Li, Yongli; Zhao, Juezhen; Zhang, Gaoyuan; Du, Xiaoze; Dong, Yingchao",,,439

Indeed, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key cytokine driving COVID-19 pathogenesis, downregulates lung CFTR protein expression, providing a strong rationale that acquired CFTR dysfunction arises in the context of COVID-19 infection. In this perspective, we propose that CFTR therapeutics, which are safe and generally well-tolerated, may provide benefit to COVID-19 patients. Although CFTR therapeutics are currently only approved for treating cystic fibrosis, there are efforts to repurpose them for conditions with ""acquired"" CFTR dysfunction, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition to targeting the primary lung pathology, CFTR therapeutics may possess value-added effects: their anti-inflammatory properties may dampen exaggerated immune cell responses and promote cerebrovascular dilation; the latter aspect may offer some protection against COVID-19 related stroke.","Lidington, Darcy; Bolz, Steffen-Sebastian",Front Physiol,,439

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a public dataset from the United Network for Organ Sharing was performed regarding adult lung transplantation (1/19/2020-6/30/2020). Data were stratified into 3 periods: pre-COVID-19 (1/19/2020 - 3/14/2020), 1-COVID-19 era (3/15/2020 - 5/8/2020), and 2-COVID-19 era (5/9/2020 - 6/30/2020). Weekly changes in waitlist inactivations (COVID-19 precautions or not), waitlist additions, transplant volume, and donor recovery were examined across eras and changes across era were correlated. RESULTS: During 1-COVID-19 era, 301 patients were added to the waitlist, representing a 40% decrease when compared to the prior 8-week period. This was followed by a significant increase in listing during the 2-COVID-19 era (t = 2.16, P = .032). Waitlist inactivations decreased in 2-COVID-19 era from the 1-COVID-19 era (t = 3.60, P < .001). There was no difference in waitlist inactivations between the pre-COVID era and the 2-COVID-19 era (P = .10). Weekly volume was not associated with trends in COVID-19 cases across any era but was negatively associated with waitlist inactivations due to COVID-19 precautions entering the 1-COVID-19 era (r = -0.73, P = .04) and 2-COVID-19 eras (r = -0.89, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US experienced a decrease in lung transplant volume. While overall volume has returned to normal, additional studies are needed to identify areas of improvement to better prepare for future pandemics.","Chan, Ernest G; Chan, Patrick G; Harano, Takashi; Ryan, John P; Morrell, Matthew R; Sanchez, Pablo G",Transplantation,,439

In the Czech Republic, the first three cases of infection with the novel coronavirus were confirmed on March 1, 2020. The joint effort of state authorities and researchers gave rise to a unique team, which combines methodical knowledge of real-world processes with the know-how needed for effective processing, analysis, and online visualization of data. OBJECTIVE: Due to an urgent need for a tool that presents important reports based on valid data sources, a team of government experts and researchers focused on the design and development of a web app intended to provide a regularly updated overview of COVID-19 epidemiology in the Czech Republic to the general population. METHODS: The cross-industry standard process for data mining model was chosen for the complex solution of analytical processing and visualization of data that provides validated information on the COVID-19 epidemic across the Czech Republic. Great emphasis was put on the understanding and a correct implementation of all six steps (business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modelling, evaluation, and deployment) needed in the process, including the infrastructure of a nationwide information system; the methodological setting of communication channels between all involved stakeholders; and data collection, processing, analysis, validation, and visualization. RESULTS: The web-based overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic has been developed as an online platform providing a set of outputs in the form of tables, graphs, and maps intended for the general public. On March 12, 2020, the first version of the web portal, containing fourteen overviews divided into five topical sections, was released. The web portal's primary objective is to publish a well-arranged visualization and clear explanation of basic information consisting of the overall numbers of performed tests, confirmed cases of COVID-19, COVID-19-related deaths, the daily and cumulative overviews of people with a positive COVID-19 case, performed tests, location and country of infection of people with a positive COVID-19 case, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, and distribution of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: The online interactive overview of the current spread of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic was launched on March 11, 2020, and has immediately become the primary communication channel employed by the health care sector to present the current situation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. This complex reporting of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic also shows an effective way to interconnect knowledge held by various specialists, such as regional and national methodology experts (who report positive cases of the disease on a daily basis), with knowledge held by developers of central registries, analysts, developers of web apps, and leaders in the health care sector.","Komenda, Martin; Bulhart, Vojtech; Karolyi, Matej; Jarkovský, Jirí; Muzík, Jan; Májek, Ondrej; Snajdrová, Lenka; Ruzicková, Petra; Rázová, Jarmila; Prymula, Roman; Macková, Barbora; Brezovský, Pavel; Marounek, Jan; Cerný, Vladimír; Dusek, Ladislav",J Med Internet Res,,439

During the month of March 2020, teaching activities of the spring semester were proceeding as normal; however, the sudden emergence of COVID-19 disturbed routine activities and compelled authorities to switch all teaching activities from face-to-face to online. Training sessions and workshops for all stakeholders on online delivery methods were arranged. Blackboard and other online facilities were utilized. All teaching materials, including newly made video clips for anatomy and physiology practicals, were uploaded on Blackboard and discussed online with students. Students' anxiety related to the exam was reassured by giving them the option of open book quizzes during summative continuous assessment. All scheduled teaching sessions, lectures, and practicals were conducted proficiently. Revision sessions and assessment quizzes were conducted with students' satisfaction. At the end of the semester, a final exam was conducted online as an open book exam. Students with technical issues while attempting the exam were given an opportunity to make up for it. After a successful final exam, the cumulative block grades showed students secured higher grades in the open book exam. Following that, the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences has managed to conduct on-campus close book exams that abide by self-distancing and standard operating procedure policies.","Memon, Ismail; Feroz, Zeeshan; Alkushi, Abdulmohsen; Qamar, Nabeel; Ismail, Farwa",Adv Physiol Educ,,439

Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations, including P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa, and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10, and 9 changes in the spike, respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site, with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet (E484K, K417N/T, and N501Y), which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine-induced antibody responses than B.1.351, suggesting that changes outside the receptor-binding domain (RBD) impact neutralization. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 222 neutralizes all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2-binding site mutations. We explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.","Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Zhou, Daming; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Mentzer, Alexander J; Ginn, Helen M; Zhao, Yuguang; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Tuekprakhon, Aekkachai; Nutalai, Rungtiwa; Wang, Beibei; López-Camacho, César; Slon-Campos, Jose; Walter, Thomas S; Skelly, Donal; Costa Clemens, Sue Ann; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; Nascimento, Fernanda; Fernandes da Costa, Cristiano; Resende, Paola Cristina; Pauvolid-Correa, Alex; Siqueira, Marilda M; Dold, Christina; Levin, Robert; Dong, Tao; Pollard, Andrew J; Knight, Julian C; Crook, Derrick; Lambe, Teresa; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Bibi, Sagida; Flaxman, Amy; Bittaye, Mustapha; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Gilbert, Sarah C; Carroll, Miles W; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Dunachie, Susanna J; Paterson, Neil G; Williams, Mark A; Hall, David R; Hulswit, Ruben J G; Bowden, Thomas A; Fry, Elizabeth E; Mongkolsapaya, Juthathip; Ren, Jingshan; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin R",Cell,,439

E como objetivos específicos: mapear as deliberações para o ensino profissional nos regimentos, leis e decretos do RN; identificar as ações estaduais referente ao ensino profissional; mapear as escolas profissionais, considerando o contexto social e histórico que foram criadas. Nesse sentido, surgiram as seguintes indagações: Como o ensino profissional é mencionado nas legislações do RN no período de 1908 a 1957? Quais os tipos de ações do RN frente ao ensino profissional no período citado? De que forma as escolas profissionais foram organizadas pelo Estado do RN? Quais interesses do Estado ao implementar as escolas profissionais? Existiram disparidades entre a capital e os demais municípios do RN? Para tanto, utilizou-se a metodologia da análise documental por meio do mapeamento dos decretos, das legislações e mensagens dos governadores do recorte temporal em estudo, na perspectiva da abordagem qualitativa para análise dos dados. O mapeamento realizado considerou ainda os seguintes aspectos: o recorte temporal, a quantidade de documentos e os indícios de criação de Escolas Profissionais ou cursos. Assim, essa dissertação se insere no campo da educação profissional baseada na concepção de Silvia Manfrendi (2002), na dimensão da história política de René Remond (2003), no entendimento de pesquisa histórica de Rüsen (2010), de fontes de José dAssunção Barros (2010) e de análise documental de Arostegui (2006), na abordagem do método indiciário de Ginzburg (1991), com vistas à investigação dos indícios de ensino profissional nos documentos e no domínio da história da educação profissional. Dos 492 (quatrocentos e noventa e dois) documentos analisados evidenciou-se que as estratégias do Estado do RN referente ao ensino profissional foram através de iniciativas como: a criação de escolas, cursos e subvenções. Dentre as ações do Estado do RN foram identificadas as criações de instituições voltadas ao ensino profissional, a saber: Escola Normal de Natal, Escola de Música (através da reorganização), Escola Normal de Mossoró, Escola Profissional do Alecrim, Escola de Farmácia e Odontologia, Escola Operária, Escola de Serviço Social, Faculdade de Direito, Escola Agrícola de Jundiaí, Faculdade de Medicina, Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciência e Letras de Natal, Escola de Engenharia de Natal. Outras iniciativas do Estado do RN referentes ao ensinoprofissional foram as criações dos de cursos de agronomia, zootecnia, agrimensura, belas artes, indústria, comércio, primário elementar (artesanato, aprendizagem industrial-agrícola). Diante disso, pretende-se com o presente estudo contribuir para as pesquisas referentes à temática da história da educação; como também, contribuir para novos debates para a história da educação profissional norte-rio-grandense","SILVA, KARLA KATIELLE OLIVEIRA DA",,,439

Numerous studies have revealed the existence of significant associations between certain HLA alleles and the susceptibility and prognosis of different infectious diseases. In this pilot study we analyse the binding affinity between 66 class I HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 viral peptides, and its association with the severity of the disease. A total of 45 Spanish patients with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection were typed for HLA class I; after that, we analysed if an in silico model of HLA I-viral peptide binding affinity and classical HLA supertypes could be correlated to the severity of the disease. Our results suggest that patients with mild disease present Class I HLA molecules with a higher theoretical capacity for binding SARS-Cov-2 peptides and showed greater heterozygosity when comparing them with moderate and severe groups. In this regard, identifying HLA-SARS-CoV-2 peptides binding differences between individuals would help to clarify the heterogeneity of clinical responses to the disease and will also be useful to guide a personalized treatment according to its particular risk.","Iturrieta-Zuazo, Ignacio; Rita, Claudia Geraldine; García-Soidán, Ana; de Malet Pintos-Fonseca, Ana; Alarcón, Nieves Alonso; Rodríguez, Roberto Pariente; Velarde, Amalia Tejeda; Villar, Sergio Serrano; Alabau, José Luis Castañer; Gañán, Israel Nieto",Clin Immunol,,439

Recent research seems to raise doubts about whether this requirement is generally fulfilled. Often, replicability of results is defined as repeating a statistically significant result. However, since significance may not imply scientific relevance, dual-criterion study designs that take both aspects into account have been proposed and investigated during the last decade. Originally developed for proof-of-concept trials, the design could be appropriate for phase III trials as well. In fact, a dual-criterion design has been requested for COVID-19 vaccine applications by major health authorities. In this article, replicability of dual-criterion designs is investigated. It turns out that the probability to replicate a significant and relevant result can become as low as 0.5. The replication probability increases if the effect estimator exceeds the minimum relevant effect in the original study by an extra amount.","Rosenkranz, Gerd K",Stat. med,,439

Design/methodology/approach: A phone interview was conducted with the parent of a child with ASD. The semi-structured interview focused on how the child’s family was impacted when classes shifted to virtual from face-to-face learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: A total of four themes emerged from the interview. Three of these included adjustments to changes in routines and roles, instruction, and social interactions. A final theme involved the benefits and challenges that emerged following the transition to online learning for students with ASD. While we are in an unprecedented time with the COVID-19 global pandemic presenting understandable challenges, opportunities for and examples of effective virtual learning environments for students with ASD were reported in the parent interview and supported by the literature. Practical implications: This research provides insight regarding the impact of COVID-19 and highlights elements that should be considered involving technology for students with ASD. Increased awareness regarding the benefits and contraindications of technology while teaching students with ASD can minimize the adverse effects and enhance the positive impact of technology in students with ASD.

307514,Adult cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: A tiered patient triage guidance statement,2020,"The current pandemic of COVID-19 has set off an urgent search for an effective vaccine. This search may well benefit from the experiences of the animal health profession in the development and use of coronavirus vaccines in domestic animal species. These animal vaccines will in no way protect humans against COVID-19 but knowledge of the difficulties encountered in vaccinating animals may help avoid or minimize similar problems arising in humans. Diverse coronaviruses can infect the domestic species from dogs and cats, to cattle and pigs to poultry. Many of these infections are controlled by routine vaccination. Thus, canine coronavirus vaccines are protective in puppies but the disease itself is mild and self-limiting. Feline coronavirus infections may be mild or may result in a lethal immune-mediated disease - feline infectious peritonitis. As a result, vaccination of domestic cats must seek to generate- protective immunity without causing immune-mediated disease. Vaccines against bovine coronavirus are widely employed in cattle where they protect against enteric and respiratory disease in young calves. Two major livestock species suffer from economically significant and severe coronavirus diseases. Thus, pigs may be infected with six different coronaviruses, one of which, porcine epidemic diarrhea, has proven difficult to control despite the development of several innovative vaccines. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus undergoes frequent genetic changes. Likewise, infectious bronchitis coronavirus causes an economically devastating disease of chickens. It too undergoes frequent genetic shifts and as a result, can only be controlled by extensive and repeated vaccination. Other issues that have been encountered in developing these animal vaccines include a relatively short duration of protective immunity, and a lack of effectiveness of inactivated vaccines. On the other hand, they have been relatively cheap to make and lend themselves to mass vaccination procedures.","Tizard, Ian R",Vaccine,,439

Within 4 days of the request, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel was established and the first meeting took place (virtually-as did subsequent meetings). The Panel comprises 57 individuals representing 6 governmental agencies, 11 professional societies, and 33 medical centers, plus 2 community members, who have worked together to create and frequently update the guidelines on the basis of evidence from the most recent clinical studies available. The initial version of the guidelines was completed within 2 weeks and posted online on 21 April 2020. Initially, sparse evidence was available to guide COVID-19 treatment recommendations. However, treatment data rapidly accrued based on results from clinical studies that used various study designs and evaluated different therapeutic agents and approaches. Data have continued to evolve at a rapid pace, leading to 24 revisions and updates of the guidelines in the first year. This process has provided important lessons for responding to an unprecedented public health emergency: Providers and stakeholders are eager to access credible, current treatment guidelines; governmental agencies, professional societies, and health care leaders can work together effectively and expeditiously; panelists from various disciplines, including biostatistics, are important for quickly developing well-informed recommendations; well-powered randomized clinical trials continue to provide the most compelling evidence to guide treatment recommendations; treatment recommendations need to be developed in a confidential setting free from external pressures; development of a user-friendly, web-based format for communicating with health care providers requires substantial administrative support; and frequent updates are necessary as clinical evidence rapidly emerges.","Kuriakose, Safia; Singh, Kanal; Pau, Alice K; Daar, Eric; Gandhi, Rajesh; Tebas, Pablo; Evans, Laura; Gulick, Roy M; Lane, H Clifford; Masur, Henry",Ann. intern. med,,439

The underlying mechanisms for the olfactory symptoms are unclear. Using a mouse model, we determined whether cells in the olfactory epithelium express the obligatory receptors for entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by using RNAseq, RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. We show that the cell surface protein ACE2 and the protease TMPRSS2 are expressed in sustentacular cells of the olfactory epithelium but not, or much less, in most olfactory receptor neurons. These data suggest that sustentacular cells are involved in SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and impairment of the sense of smell in COVID-19 patients. We also show that expression of the entry proteins increases in animals of old age. This may explain, if true also in humans, why individuals of older age are more susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bilinska, Katarzyna; Jakubowska, Patrycja; Von Bartheld, Christopher S; Butowt, Rafal",ACS Chem Neurosci,,439

Yet, it is still unclear what contributes to the effectiveness of such online peer production systems: what conditions or social processes help them deliver quality products. Specifically, while co-contribution (i.e. bipartite networks) are often investigated in online collaboration, the role of interpersonal communication in coordination of online peer-production is much less investigated. To address this gap we have reconstructed networks of personal communication (direct messaging) between Wikipedia editors gathered in so called Wikiprojects - teams of contributors who focus on articles within specific topical areas. We found that effective projects exchange larger volume of direct messages and that their communication structure allows for complex coordination: for sharing of information locally through selective ties, and at the same time globally across the whole group. To verify how these network measures relate to the subjective perception of importance of group communication we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of selected projects. Our interviewees used direct communication for providing feedback, for maintaining close relations and for tapping on the social capital of the Wikipedia community. Our results underscore the importance of communication structure in online collaboration: online peer production communities rely on interpersonal communication to coordinate their work and to maintain high levels of engagement. Design of platforms for such communities should allow for ample group level communication as well as for one-on-one interactions.","Rychwalska, Agnieszka; Talaga, Szymon; Ziembowicz, Karolina; Jemielniak, Dariusz",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03506v1.pdf,439

Given that poorer families have a larger number of children than other families, the analysis first establishes the proportion of children living in monetary poor households, as defined by national standards, across developing countries. Then, using historical changes and trends of income distribution per country, the latest projections about economic decline due to the pandemic, and demographic information about the distribution of children by deciles, we estimate the expected increase in the number of children in monetary poor households in developing countries as of end of 2020 to be an additional 122-144 million and, at best, a moderate decline in these numbers by end of 2021.","Fiala, Oliver; Delamónica, Enrique; Escaroz, Gerardo; Martinez, Ismael Cid; Espinoza-Delgado, José; Kielem, Aristide",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,,439

This assay effectively combines magnetic bead encoding technology and the ultrasensitive detection capability of a single molecule array. The detection strategies of S-RBD protein and N-protein exhibited wide response ranges of 0.34-1065 pg/mL and 0.183-338 pg/mL with detection limits of 20.6 fg/mL and 69.8 fg/mL, respectively. It is a highly specific method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein and has minimal interference from other blood proteins. Moreover, the spike assay showed a satisfactory and reproducible recovery rate for the detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein in serum samples. Overall, this work provides a highly sensitive method for the simultaneous detection of S-RBD protein and N-protein, which shows ultrasensitivity and high signal-to-noise ratio and contributes to improve the diagnosis accuracy of COVID-19.","Cai, Qiyong; Mu, Jingjing; Lei, Yang; Ge, Jia; Aryee, Aaron Albert; Zhang, Xiaoge; Li, Zhaohui",Anal. bioanal. chem,,439
316085,"Asymptomatic covid-19 in pregnancy - does ""lockdown"" work?",2021,"Background Current reports show that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do not recover completely, and even asymptomatic COVID-19 patients may experience slight changes in their overall health, which is the basis of the new area of study termed ?Long-Haul COVID?. Our hypothesis is that even in the asymptomatic infection, exposures to the viral spike protein are enough to induce long-lasting changes in baseline genetic expression. Objective This study sought to survey what type of cell biological processes would be affected in human primary bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) post-exposure to spike protein and whether they would persist post-recovery. Methods Herein, we advanced an Air Liquid Interface (ALI) cell culture technique to simulate the physiological conditions in the lung airway in vitro. Briefly, HBECs were grown and differentiated, before treatment with either a low (50 ng/mL) or high (5 ug/mL) concentration of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for 4 hours. After a 48-hour recovery, cells were processed for RNA extractions and qPCR to screen genes using Qiagen RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays;data were analyzed in GeneGlobe.

Its disruption of normal routines also brought opportunities for broader reform. The purpose of this article is to describe how the Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center (CRDAMC), a medium-sized Army hospital, capitalized on opportunities to advance its strategic aims during the pandemic. Specifically, the hospital sequentially adopted virtual video visits, surged on preventative screenings, and made-over its image to appeal to patients seeking urgent care. These campaigns supported COVID-19 efforts and larger strategic goals simultaneously - and they will endure for years to come. Predictably, CRDAMC encountered obstacles in the course of its transformation. These obstacles and their follow-on lessons are provided to assist future medical leaders seeking quantum change in the opportunities made available by health crises.","Malish, Richard G; Meyers, Garrett; Sondgeroth, Charles D; Whiddon, Michael S; Hall, Brian T",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,439

ObjectivesTo explore the lived experiences of care-home staff in implementing ICMs. MethodsMixed-methods study comprising 238 online survey responses and 15 in-depth interviews with care-home staff, November 2020-January 2021 in England. ResultsThree themes were identified: Integrating COVID-19 ICMs with caring, Conveying knowledge and information, Professional and personal impacts of care-work during the pandemic. Reported adherence to ICMs was high but fatalistic attitudes towards COVID-19 infection were present. Challenges of providing care using personal protective equipment (PPE), especially for residents with dementia, were highlighted. Interviewees reported dilemmas between strictly implementing ICMs and conflicts with providing best care to residents and preserving personal space. Nine months into COVID-19, official guidance was reported as confusing, constantly changing and poorly suited to care-homes. Care-home staff appreciated opportunities to work with other care-homes and experts to interpret and implement guidance. ICM training was undertaken using multiple techniques but with little evaluation of these or how to sustain behaviour change. LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to other countries. ImplicationsCOVID-19 has had a profound effect on well-being of care-home staff. Despite challenges, participants reported broadly good morale, potentially a consequence of supportive colleagues and management. Nevertheless, clear, concise and care-home focussed ICM guidance is still needed. This should include evidence-based assessments on implementing and sustaining adherence. Groups of care-home staff and ICM experts working together to co-create, interpret and implement guidance were viewed positively.","Bunn, Diane; Brainard, Julii Suzanne; Lane, Kathleen; Salter, Charlotte; Lake, Iain R",,,439

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study, including elderly COVID-19 patients admitted to Wuhan Huoshenshan Hospital between February 10 and 13, 2020. Demographic data, medical history, signs and symptoms, and laboratory parameters were collected and analysed. RESULTS: We included 131 elderly COVID-19 patients (50 patients with diabetes). COVID-19 diabetes patients experienced more severe pneumonia and abnormal organ functions than non-diabetes patients (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Most function indicators were significantly different between the mild to moderate and severely ill groups in diabetes patients (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). Python analysis confirmed diabetes was the independent risk factor of COVID-19 progression in elderly patients. All blood glucose (BG) indices went into the risk factor equation. The cut-off values of COVID-19 progression were BG value on admission > 8.0 mmol/L or maximum BG value > 12.0 mmol/L in all elderly patients, and BG value on admission > 5.1 mmol/L or maximum BG value > 5.4 mmol/L in non-diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is an independent important risk factor, and glucose levels associate closely with COVID-19 progression in elderly patients.","Zhang, Pei; Wang, Maomao; Wang, Yang; Wang, Yifei; Li, Ting; Zeng, Jing; Wang, Laixing; Li, Chunlin; Gong, Yanping",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,439

Despite transparency in informing the world public about clusters of undiagnosed viral pneumonia, the country's health care at the first stage of the epidemic was not ready to provide adequate and rapid response for a fast increase in the number of patients with COVID-19, infection control measures were not fully implemented, which also led to a large number of nosocomial cases of infection among medical workers and patients. Socially vulnerable groups of the population did not refer for medical assistance in a timely manner due to the lack of the disease danger understanding and also in connection with the high cost for them of medical aid. At the second stage, simultaneously with the restrictive measures introduced by the government, the entire health care system was rebooted: free medical care for patients with COVID-19 was provided and the strictest infection control measures were implemented, multi-level contact tracking system using IT technologies was organized, and the capacity of hospitals was increased many times. Through the joint efforts of ministries, mass media, social networks and volunteer movements, an unprecedented social mobilization of the population was achieved. Strict implementation of the entire set of measures aimed at fighting the epidemic allowed to take it under strict control at the third stage and practically eliminate the epidemic after 2,5 months. China's response to the COVID-19 epidemic can be useful to other countries, in fighting the current pandemic and in preparing for a response to biological threats in the future.","Semenov, A.

Direct household contacts of COVID-19 patients are at highest risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been tried against COVID-19 owing to its in vitro virucidal action against SARS-CoV-2, but the role of HCQ as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) remains inconclusive. In this open-label, controlled clinical trial, asymptomatic individuals who had direct contact with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases or had undertaken international travel in the last 2 weeks were offered HCQ prophylaxis and assigned to PEP (n = 132) or control (n = 185) group. The PEP group received HCQ 800 mg on Day 1 followed by 400 mg once weekly for 3 weeks. Both groups undertook home quarantine for 2 weeks along with social distancing and personal hygiene. Over 4-week follow-up, 50/317 participants (15.8%) had new-onset COVID-19. The incidence of COVID-19 was significantly (P = 0.033) lower in the PEP (14/132; 10.6%) compared to the control (36/185; 19.5%) group (total absolute risk reduction, -8.9% points). The NNT to prevent the occurrence of 1 COVID-19 case was 12. Overall relative risk was 0.59 (95% CI 0.33-1.05). Compliance was good. The most common adverse event was epigastric discomfort with burning sensation (three participants), with no serious adverse events. PEP with HCQ has the potential for the prevention of COVID-19 in at-risk individuals. Until definitive therapy is available, continuing PEP with HCQ may be considered in suitable at-risk individuals. Further randomised clinical trials with larger samples are required for better evaluation of HCQ as PEP for COVID-19 prevention.","Dhibar, Deba Prasad; Arora, Navneet; Kakkar, Arpit; Singla, Neeraj; Mohindra, Ritin; Suri, Vikas; Bhalla, Ashish; Sharma, Navneet; Singh, Mini P; Prakash, Ajay; Pvm, Lakshmi; Medhi, Bikash",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,439

While the robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a company failure: the `airline company network' where two airlines are connected if they share at least one route segment. Using this tool, we observe that the failure of companies well connected with others has the largest impact on the connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction affects airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if its stays low and does not come back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple assumptions about customer's airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand can be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not monopolistic and share their segments with larger companies. Even if the average demand comes back to $60\%$ of the total capacity, we find that between $46\%$ and $59\%$ of the companies could experience a reduction of more than $50\%$ of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that drives customer's airline choice. These results highlight how the complex competitive structure of the WAN weakens its robustness when facing such a large crisis.","Ye, Jiachen; Ji, Peng; Barthelemy, Marc",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02109v1.pdf,439

There has been no attempt at a systematic review on this major health issue. Hence, in this study, a meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the overall risk of liver damage in COVID-19 patients and also find the overall variation in risk outcome. Materials and methods: A meta-analysis was carried out on the findings of four published studies that were related to the albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels of COVID-19 patients. The pooled mean for each of these three measurements was estimated by using a random-effects model. Results: The pooled means for albumin, AST, and ALT in COVID-19 patients were 38.84 g/L [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.83-41.86], 27.28 IU/L (95% CI: 18.30-36.26), and 24.44 IU/L (95% CI: 15.73-33.15) respectively. There was a high degree of divergence among the studies, with the index of heterogeneity being more than 90%. Conclusion: The ALT and albumin pooled means were reported to be within the normal range; however, the pooled mean of the serum AST level was found to be high in COVID-19 patients.

Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis is utilised to perform paternity and kinship analysis, due to the polymorphic nature of STR loci. The cost associated with paternity testing is high, and there is a demand for motherless testing. Objectives: This study aims to determine what the impact of motherless testing would have been by evaluating 6182 paternity trio cases. Methods: The AmpFLSTR&#8482; Identifiler&#8482; PCR Amplification kit was used to profile each of the trio cases. A scenario was created where the mother was eliminated from the test results to determine if the paternity outcome would change. Results: Putative fathers were excluded in 27% of all cases, and in 2.5% of those cases, putative fathers would have been falsely included, had the mother not been tested. These false inclusions are attributed to coincidental STR loci that are shared between the mother and the putative father. The addition of loci to the STR profiling kit may resolve the issue; however, comparable STR data with more loci will have to be evaluated to ensure it overcomes the issue of coincidentally shared loci between unrelated individuals. Conclusion: We would recommend that within our setup and within similar setups, the mother always be included for testing, except in extreme scenarios such as death. False inclusion of putative fathers could have serious legal implications for testing laboratories.","De Kock, André A; Kloppers, Jean Jf",Afr Health Sci,,439

This communication approach has been applauded around the world. How did communities situated amongst the ""margins of the margins"" in Aotearoa New Zealand navigate through the existing structural barriers to health during the pandemic? In this study, we use a culture-centered analysis to foreground the structural context of disenfranchisement amidst the COVID-19 lockdown. Drawing on in-depth interviews with participants in a larger ethnographic project on poverty and health across three communities in Aotearoa New Zealand, we attend to the ways in which health is negotiated amidst the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown response at the ""margins of the margins."" The narratives point out that health communication interventions to prevent COVID-19 in the context of Aotearoa New Zealand furthered the marginalization of communities at the margins, and community voices were largely erased from the enactment of interventions. With the extant structures failing to recognize these aspects of everyday struggles of health at the margins, the health and access challenges were further magnified during COVID-19.

331467,Pericardial Complications in Patients With COVID-19: A Systematic Review of Published Cases,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Nine events have been assessed for potential declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). A PHEIC is defined as an extraordinary event that constitutes a public health risk to other states through international spread and requires a coordinated international response. The WHO Director-General convenes Emergency Committees (ECs) to provide their advice on whether an event constitutes a PHEIC. The EC rationales have been criticised for being non-transparent and contradictory to the International Health Regulations (IHR). This first comprehensive analysis of EC rationale provides recommendations to increase clarity of EC decisions which will strengthen the IHR and WHO's legitimacy in future outbreaks. METHODS: 66 EC statements were reviewed from nine public health outbreaks of influenza A, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, polio, Ebola virus disease, Zika, yellow fever and coronavirus disease-2019. Statements were analysed to determine which of the three IHR criteria were noted as contributing towards the EC's justification on whether to declare a PHEIC and what language was used to explain the decision. RESULTS: Interpretation of the criteria were often vague and applied inconsistently. ECs often failed to describe and justify which criteria had been satisfied. DISCUSSION: Guidelines must be developed for the standardised interpretation of IHR core criteria. The ECs must clearly identify and justify which criteria have contributed to their rationale for or against PHEIC declaration. CONCLUSION: Striving for more consistency and transparency in EC justifications would benefit future deliberations and provide more understanding and support for the process.","Mullen, Lucia; Potter, Christina; Gostin, Lawrence O; Cicero, Anita; Nuzzo, Jennifer B",,,439
331519,Ventilator Options for COVID-19: Quality Trumps Quantity,2021,"Investor awareness about impending regulations requiring firms to reduce their carbon footprint has introduced a carbon transition risk premium in the stocks of firms. On performing a cross-section analysis, a significant premium was estimated among large caps in the US markets. The existence of a risk premium indicates investor awareness about future exposure to low-carbon transition. A new measure, the Single Event Transition Risk (SETR), was developed to model the maximum exposure of a firm to carbon transition risk, and a functional form for the same was determined, in terms of risk premia. Different classes of distributions for arrival processes of transition events were considered and the respective SETRs were determined and studied. The trade-off between higher premia and higher risks was studied for the different processes, and it was observed that, based on the distributions of arrival times, investors could have a lower, equal or higher probability of positive returns (from the premium-risk trade-off), and that despite a fair pricing of the carbon premium, decisions by investors to take long or short positions on a stock could still be biased.","Nag, Suryadeepto; Chakrabarty, Siddhartha P.; Basu, Sankarshan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06518v1.pdf,439

332969,COVID-19 in cardiac arrest and infection risk to rescuers: A systematic review,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity, mortality, and strained healthcare systems worldwide. Thus, a search for modalities that can expedite and improve the diagnosis and management of this entity is underway. Recent data suggested the utility of lung ultrasound (LUS) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting an interstitial pattern (B-pattern). Hence, we aimed to pool the proportion of various reported lung abnormalities detected by LUS in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic review (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE until April 25, 2020) and a proportion meta-analysis. We included seven studies examining the role of LUS in 122 COVID-19 patients. The pooled proportion (PP) of B-pattern detected by lung ultrasound (US) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94-1.00 I 2 0%, Q 4.6). The PP of finding pleural line abnormalities was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.13-1.00 I 2 96%, Q 103.9), of pleural thickening was 0.54 (95% 0.11-0.95 I 2 93%, Q 61.1), of subpleural or pulmonary consolidation was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.21-0.58 I 2 72%, Q 17.8), and of pleural effusion was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.00-0.37 I 2 93%, Q 27.3). Our meta-analysis revealed that almost all SARS-CoV-2-infected patients have abnormal lung US. The most common abnormality is interstitial involvement depicted as B-pattern. The finding from our review highlights the potential role of this modality in the triage, diagnosis, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. A sizable diagnostic accuracy study comparing LUS, computed tomography scan, and COVID-19-specific tests is warranted to further test this finding and to delineate the diagnostic and prognostic yield of each of these modalities.","Mohamed, Mouhand F H; Al-Shokri, Shaikha; Yousaf, Zohaib; Danjuma, Mohammed; Parambil, Jessiya; Mohamed, Samreen; Mubasher, Mahmood; Dauleh, Mujahed M; Hasanain, Bara; AlKahlout, Mohamed Awni; Abubeker, Ibrahim Y",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,439

333841,Prognostic performance of CHA2DS2-VASc scores for predicting mortality among COVID-19 patients: A single pandemic center experience,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic sparked significant anxiety regarding viral rates and means of transmission. Heightened concerns about contamination have prompted new hygienic strategies to vigilantly guard against infection, including hand washing immediately after touching foreign objects or suspected contaminants. This has presented a critical challenge for the delivery of exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy to individuals with contamination fears due to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), as providers must manage not only their clients' attitudes and reactions but their own as well. In this investigation, self-identified anxiety and OCD treatment specialists (N = 139) provided demographic information, including their anxiety and OCD caseloads, and completed measures related to intolerance of uncertainty (IUS-SF; Carlton et al., 2007), beliefs about exposure therapy (TBES; Deacon et al., 2013), and emotional reactions to physical sensations (The Chills; Maruskin et al., 2012). We tested the hypothesis that intolerance of uncertainty and activation of the behavioral immune system (BIS; Schaller & Park, 2011), a mechanism theoretically activated by the prominent emergence of pathogens to protect against illness would predict attitudes toward exposure. The Chills Scale was used to assess BIS activation, a broad assessment of vasoconstriction responses associated with different emotional reactions, and includes a subscale (coldness) that evaluates vasoconstriction associated with defense against pathogens. Both coldness and OCD caseload, but not anxiety caseload or subscales of intolerance of uncertainty, emerged as significant predictors of clinicians' beliefs about exposure; increases in OCD caseload were also related to decreases in negative beliefs about exposure. Findings are useful in determining methods for aiding clinicians in developing effective approaches to contamination fears during and post-pandemic that include addressing their own BIS-related concerns and mapping out means for social behavioral norms associated with engaging in exposure treatment.","McKay, Dean; Minaya, Charlene; Storch, Eric A",J Anxiety Disord,,439

However, to date no study has evaluated whether the changes in the distribution of pulmonary gas and blood volume are associated with the severity of gas-exchange impairment and the type of respiratory support (non-invasive versus invasive) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Northern Italy during the first pandemic wave. Pulmonary gas and blood distribution was assessed using a technique for quantitative analysis of dual-energy computed tomography. Lung aeration loss (reflected by percentage of normally aerated lung tissue) and the extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (percentage of non-aerated, perfused lung tissue-shunt; aerated, non-perfused dead space; and non-aerated/non-perfused regions) were evaluated in critically ill COVID-19 patients with different clinical severity as reflected by the need for non-invasive or invasive respiratory support. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients admitted to the intensive care unit between February 29th and May 30th, 2020 were included. Patients requiring invasive versus non-invasive mechanical ventilation had both a lower percentage of normally aerated lung tissue (median [interquartile range] 33% [24-49%] vs. 63% [44-68%], p < 0.001); and a larger extent of gas:blood volume mismatch (43% [30-49%] vs. 25% [14-28%], p = 0.001), due to higher shunt (23% [15-32%] vs. 5% [2-16%], p = 0.001) and non-aerated/non perfused regions (5% [3-10%] vs. 1% [0-2%], p = 0.001). The PaO2/FiO2 ratio correlated positively with normally aerated tissue (&#961; = 0.730, p < 0.001) and negatively with the extent of gas-blood volume mismatch (&#961; = - 0.633, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and oxygenation impairment were associated with loss of aeration and the extent of gas:blood volume mismatch.","Ball, Lorenzo; Robba, Chiara; Herrmann, Jacob; Gerard, Sarah E; Xin, Yi; Mandelli, Maura; Battaglini, Denise; Brunetti, Iole; Minetti, Giuseppe; Seitun, Sara; Bovio, Giulio; Vena, Antonio; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Bassetti, Matteo; Rocco, Patricia R M; Cereda, Maurizio; Rizi, Rahim R; Castellan, Lucio; Patroniti, Nicolò; Pelosi, Paolo",Crit Care,,439

However, the process of SARS-CoV-2 adsorption to exposed surfaces in high-risk environments remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the interfacial dynamics of single SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses with plasmonic imaging technology. Through the use of this technique, which has high spatial and temporal resolution, we tracked the collision of viruses at a surface and differentiated their stable adsorption and transient adsorption. We determined the effect of the electrostatic force on virus adhesion by correlating the solution and surface chemistry with the interfacial diffusion velocity and equilibrium position. Viral adsorption was found to be enhanced in real scenarios, such as in simulated saliva. This work not only describes a plasmonic imaging method to examine the interfacial dynamics of a single virus but also provides direct measurements of the factors that regulate the interfacial adsorption of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Such information is valuable for understanding virus transport and environmental transmission and even for designing anticontamination surfaces.","Liu, Yi-Nan; Lv, Zhen-Ting; Yang, Si-Yu; Liu, Xian-Wei",Environ Sci Technol,,439
335611,Predicting risk score for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized adult patients suffering from covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) generally spend a large amount of time sitting. This increases their risk of cardiovascular disease, premature mortality, diabetes-related complications and mental health problems. There is a paucity of research that has evaluated interventions aimed at reducing and breaking up sitting in people with T2DM. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM. METHODS: This is a mixed-methods randomised controlled feasibility trial. Participants (n=70) with T2DM aged 18-85 years who sit &#8805;7 h/day and are able to ambulate independently will be randomly allocated to receive the REgulate your SItting Time (RESIT) intervention or usual care (control group) for 24 weeks. RESIT is a person-focused intervention that delivers a standardised set of behaviour change techniques to the participants, but the mode through which they are delivered can vary depending on the tools selected by each participant. The intervention includes an online education programme, health coach support, and a range of self-selected tools (smartphone apps, computer-prompt software, and wearable devices) that deliver behaviour change techniques such as self-monitoring of sitting and providing prompts to break up sitting. Measures will be taken at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks. Eligibility, recruitment, retention and data completion rates will be used to assess trial feasibility. Sitting, standing and stepping will be measured using a thigh-worn activity monitor. Cardiometabolic health, physical function, psychological well-being, sleep and musculoskeletal symptoms will also be assessed. A process evaluation will be conducted including evaluation of intervention acceptability and fidelity. DISCUSSION: This study will identify the feasibility of delivering a tailored intervention to reduce and break up sitting in ambulatory adults with T2DM and evaluating it through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The findings will inform a fully powered RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

336672,Determinants of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19; a prospective cohort study from Pakistan,2021,"An intertwined supply network (ISN) is an entirety of interconnected supply chains (SC) which, in their integrity secure the provision of society and markets with goods and services. The ISNs are open systems with structural dynamics since the firms may exhibit multiple behaviours by changing the buyer-supplier roles in interconnected or even competing SCs. From the positions of resilience, the ISNs as a whole provide services to society (e.g. food service, mobility service or communication service) which are required to ensure a long-term survival. The analysis of survivability at the level of ISN requires a consideration at a large scale as resilience of individual SCs. The recent example of coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak clearly shows the necessity of this new perspective. Our study introduces a new angle in SC resilience research when a resistance to extraordinary disruptions needs to be considered at the scale of viability. We elaborate on the integrity of the ISN and viability. The contribution of our position study lies in a conceptualisation of a novel decision-making environment of ISN viability. We illustrate the viability formation through a dynamic game-theoretic modelling of a biological system that resembles the ISN.

Alternatively, utilization of old drugs or available medicine that can suppress the viral activity or replication may provide an urgent solution to suppress the rapid spread of 2019-nCoV. Andrographolide is a highly abundant natural product of the medicinal plant, Andrographis paniculata, which has been clinically used for inflammatory diseases and anti-viral therapy. We herein demonstrate that both andrographolide and its fluorescent derivative, the nitrobenzoxadiazole-conjugated andrographolide (Andro- NBD), suppressed the main protease (Mpro) activities of 2019-nCoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Moreover, Andro-NBD was shown to covalently link its fluorescence to these proteases. Further mass spectrometry (MS) analysis suggests that andrographolide formed a covalent bond with the active site Cys145 of either 2019-nCoV Mpro or SARS-CoV Mpro. Consistently, molecular modeling analysis supported the docking of andrographolide within the catalytic pockets of both viral Mpros. Considering that andrographolide is used in clinical practice with acceptable safety and its diverse pharmacological activities that could be beneficial for attenuating COVID-19 symptoms, extensive investigation of andrographolide on the suppression of 2019-nCoV as well as its application in COVID-19 therapy is suggested.","Shi, Tzu-Hau; Huang, Yi-Long; Chen, Chiao-Che; Pi, Wen-Chieh; Hsu, Yu-Ling; Lo, Lee-Chiang; Chen, Wei-Yi; Fu, Shu-Ling; Lin, Chao-Hsiung",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,439

341272,Assessment of activities of daily living in patients post COVID-19: a systematic review,2021,"Fast fashion trends have led to an enormous local brand proliferation in India. Brand proliferation has further led to an overchoice effect among the Indian consumers due to which, they are now increasingly less satisfied with their apparel purchases. These factors have created immense stress on the small fashion retailers (SFR) which are currently responsible for about 80% of retailing in India. In the pre-COVID times, SFR’s followed the practice of overstocking many brands for capturing the maximum market and then clearing the inventory at the end of the season through heavy discounting. This strategy became ineffective after the COVID-19 disruption. SFR’s must now optimize their brand portfolio to minimize the overchoice effect and maximize the inventory turnover ratio. To this effect, we propose an efficient fuzzy probability-based brand portfolio optimization model, which relies on primary data analysis to classify brands in groups of substitutes. Brands with maximum market share from each group must be included in the portfolio. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model through a case study on SFR. Our results show that the inventory turnover ratio was increased from 2 to 4. We further show that our grouping strategy can be used to identify competitive brands for a local band.","Sinha, Dr Priyank Sainy Dr Romi",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,,439

The effects of varying degrees of implementation of public health and social measures between countries is evident in terms of widely differing disease burdens and levels of disruption to public health systems. Despite Thailand being the first country outside China to report a positive case of COVID-19, the subsequent number of cases and deaths has been much lower than in many other countries. As of 7 January 2021, the number of confirmed COVID-19-positive cases in Thailand was 9636 (138 per million population) and the number of deaths was 67 (1 per million population). We describe the nature of the health workforce and function that facilitated the capacity to respond to this pandemic. We also describe the public health policies (laboratory testing, test-and-trace system and mandatory 14-day quarantine of cases) and social interventions (daily briefings, restriction of mobility and social gatherings, and wearing of face masks) that allowed the virus to be successfully contained. To enhance the capacity of health-care workers to respond to the pandemic, the government (i) mobilized staff to meet the required surge capacity; (ii) developed and implemented policies to protect occupational safety; and (iii) initiated packages to support morale and well-being. The results of the policies that we describe are evident in the data: of the 66 countries with more than 100 COVID-19-positive cases in health-care workers as at 8 May 2020, Thailand ranked 65th.","Nittayasoot, Natthaprang; Suphanchaimat, Rapeepong; Namwat, Chawetsan; Dejburum, Patcharaporn; Tangcharoensathien, Viroj",Bull World Health Organ,,439
344788,Sex Hormones and Novel Corona Virus Infectious Disease (COVID-19),2020,"It has been noted that as high as 20.3% of patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This has most commonly been attributed to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These patients require prolonged periods of ICU stay, averaging approximately 20 days. As people recover and are discharged, there will be a new pandemic of critical illness survivors. These patients would present with impairments and disabilities arising because of prolonged ICU stay as well as consequences of severe respiratory illness. The longer the duration of ICU stay, the higher is the risk for long-term physical, cognitive, and emotional impairments needing comprehensive and early rehabilitation. This article focuses on the indispensable role of early and interdisciplinary rehabilitation in effective disaster management, restoring functions, and improving quality of life in COVID survivors. It outlines how to practically expand rehabilitation services in a resource-limited country, such as India, and lists the limitations being faced that prevent the uniform application of rehabilitation services in India. This would help to deal with the rapid increase in demand of postacute care facilities, be it in hospital services, in the form of inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation or home care facilities, including telemedicine.","Uppal, Harleen; Rai, Siddharth",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,439

Here we report a case of POS in a patient recovering from severe COVID-19 ARDS. As he was gradually mobilised after his improvement, he had worsening dyspnoea in the sitting position with significant relief on assuming a supine posture. He was diagnosed with POS after ruling out other causes of POS. He was treated with oxygen support in upright posture and chest physiotherapy was continued, to which he showed improvement. POS is a rare manifestation of COVID-19 which needs awareness as it can be diagnosed easily and can respond to continued supportive care.","Aayilliath K, Adarsh; Singh, Komal; Ray, Animesh; Wig, Naveet",BMJ case reports,,439

345604,Diabetes and Covid-19 among hospitalized patients in Saudi Arabia: a single-centre retrospective study,2020,"Background. In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the Italian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the Gov't in charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new Gov't established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties. Objectives and Methods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we aimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on Twitter (ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of Twitter data to estimate vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigate whether the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant tweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable, and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion, enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization topics, should never be used for political consensus. This is especially true given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.","Ajovalasit, Samantha; Dorgali, Veronica; Mazza, Angelo; D'Onofrio, Alberto; Messina, Piero Manfredi University of; Florence, University of; Strathclyde, University of; Pisa, University of",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.00846v5.pdf,439

A total of 20 interviews were conducted with final-year students from six universities who were employed by Catalan Hospitals. Data was analyzed using Colaizzi's method. Analysis identified the meta-category 'feeling the commitment' from the interaction of two categories, 'facing the unknown' and 'being and feeling like a nurse', and five subcategories. Students felt highly committed to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, volunteering to work as nurses despite facing the unknown and not yet having finished their studies. Future Spanish nursing programmes should include 'pandemic and disaster management' content to increase students' preparedness for such scenarios.","Gómez-Ibáñez, Rebeca; Watson, Carolina; Leyva-Moral, Juan Manuel; Aguayo-González, Mariela; Granel, Nina",Nurse Educ Pract,,439

The available interventions are only supportive and palliative in nature. Popular among the emerging explanations for the mortality from COVID-19 is ""cytokine storm"", attributed to the body's aggressive immune response to this novel pathogen. In less than a year the disease has spread to almost all countries, though the mortality rates have varied significantly from country to country based on factors such as the demographical mix of the population, prevalence of comorbidities, as well as prior exposure to viruses from the corona family. This review examines the current literature on mortality rates across the globe, explores the possible reasons, thereby decoding variations. COVID-19 researchers have noted unique characteristics in the structural and host-pathogen interaction and identified several possible target proteins and sites that could exhibit control over the entry of SARS CoV-2 into the host, which this paper reviews in detail. Identification of new targets, both in the virus and the host, may accelerate the search for effective vaccines and curative drugs against COVID-19. Further, the ontological approach of this review is likely to provide insights for researchers to anticipate and be ready for future mutant viruses that may emerge in future.","Jayachandran, Swaminathan K; Anusuyadevi, Muthuswamy; Essa, Mohamed Mustafa; Qoronfleh, M Walid",Inform Med Unlocked,,439
346687,"Scarce Resource Allocation in a Pandemic: A Protocol to Promote Equity, Timeliness, and Transparency",2021,"PURPOSE: To investigate the bacterial growth in the surgical face masks used by patients who received intravitreal injections and study the effect of povidone-iodine on the periocular area (PA) of masks. METHODS: Forty patients who attended for intravitreal injections were divided in those with less (<4h) and more (>4h) than 4 hours of mask use. Each group was divided depending on the application or not of povidone-iodine in the periocular area (PA) of the mask. Bacterial load was studied on PA and mouth area (MA) samples. RESULTS: The bacterial load in the PA was higher in the >4h group compared with the <4h group (13.2 vs 48.75 Colony Forming Units/µL; p=0.03). The contamination in the PA significantly decreased after applying povidone-iodine in the >4h group (p=0.01). The use or not of povidone-iodine was strongly correlated to a positive culture (OR=9.0, p=0.00. CI 1.63-49.44). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical face masks worn for more than 4 hours presents higher contamination in the PA than those with less use. Bacterial load in the PA is reduced with povidone-iodine on masks used for more than 4 hours. This contamination should be considered in the asepsis protocol of intravitreal injections.","Marin-Nieto, Juan; Reino-Perez, Carmen; Santillana-Cernuda, Genoveva; Díaz-Bernal, José Manuel; Luque-Aranda, Rafael; García-Basterra, Ignacio",Retina,,439

We aim to assess the outcomes of patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have COVID-19 infection diagnosed in the early postoperative period. We identified 9 patients who developed COVID-19 infection following cardiac surgery. These patients had a significant length of hospital stay and extremely poor outcomes with mortality of 44%. In conclusion, the outcome of cardiac surgical patients who contracted COVID-19 infection perioperatively is extremely poor. In order to offer cardiac surgery, units must implement rigorous protocols aimed at maintaining a COVID-19 protective environment to minimize additional life-threatening complications related to this virus infection.","Yates, Martin T; Balmforth, Damian; Lopez-Marco, Ana; Uppal, Rakesh; Oo, Aung Y",Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg,,439
347421,Xpert MTB/Ultra assay: Handle with care,2020,"AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly binds to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) to facilitate cellular entry. Compared with the lung or respiratory tract, the human heart exhibits greater ACE2 expression. However, little substantial damage was found in the heart tissue, and no viral particles were observed in the cardiac myocytes. This study aims to analyse ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein proteases at the single-cell level, to explore the cardiac involvement in COVID-19 and improve our understanding of the potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: With meta-analysis, the prevalence of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients varies from 2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0-5%, I2 = 0%] in non-ICU patients to 59% (95% CI 48-71%, I2 = 85%) in non-survivors. With public single-cell sequence data analysis, ACE2 expression in the adult human heart is higher than that in the lung (adjusted P < 0.0001). Inversely, the most important S protein cleavage protease TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine protease-2) in the heart exhibits an extremely lower expression than that in the lung (adjusted P < 0.0001), which may restrict entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cardiac cells. Furthermore, we discovered that other S protein proteases, CTSL (cathepsin L) and FURIN (furin, paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme), were expressed in the adult heart at a similar level to that in the lung, which may compensate for TMPRSS2, mediating cardiac involvement in COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Compared with the lung, ACE2 is relatively more highly expressed in the human heart, while the key S protein priming protease, TMPRSS2, is rarely expressed. The low percentage of ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ cells reduced heart vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 to some degree. CTSL and FURIN may compensate for S protein priming to mediate SARS-CoV-2 infection of the heart.","Liu, Hanning; Gai, Shujie; Wang, Xiaoyi; Zeng, Juntong; Sun, Cheng; Zhao, Yan; Zheng, Zhe",Cardiovasc Res,,439

METHODS: A single center retrospective observational study was performed between Jan 1, 2020 and Mar 11, 2020 at Taizhou Public Health Medical Center, Zhejiang, China. All patients with confirmed Corona Virus Disease 2019 were enrolled, and their clinical data were gathered by reviewing electronic medical records. Outcomes of severely ill patients and non-severely ill patients were compared. RESULTS: Of 145 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the average age was 47.5 years old (standard deviation, 14.6) and 54.5% were men. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (15.2%), followed by diabetes mellitus (9.7%). Common symptoms included dry cough (81.4%), fever (75.2%), anorexia (42.8%), fatigue (40.7%), chest tightness (32.4%), diarrhea (26.9%) and dizziness (20%). According to imaging examination, 79.3% patients showed bilateral pneumonia, 18.6% showed unilateral pneumonia, 61.4% showed ground-glass opacity, and 2.1% showed no abnormal result. Compared with non-severely ill patients, severely ill patients were older (mean, years, 52.8 vs. 45.3, p < 0.01), had a higher proportion of diabetes mellitus (16.3% vs. 6.9%, p = 0.08), had a higher body mass index (mean, 24.78 vs. 23.20, p = 0.02) and were more likely to have fever (90.7% vs. 68.6%, p = 0.01), anorexia (60.5% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.01), chest tightness (60.5% vs.20.6%, p < 0.01) and dyspnea (7.0% vs. 0%, p = 0.03). Of the 43 severely ill patients, 6 (14%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, and 1 (2.3%) received invasive mechanical ventilation.

347863,Severe course of COVID-19 in a middle-aged man without risk factors,2020,"End stage kidney disease increase the risk of COVID-19 related death but how the kidney replacement strategy should be adapted during the pandemic is unknown. Chronic hemodialysis makes social distancing difficult to achieve. Alternatively, kidney transplantation could increase the severity of COVID-19 due to therapeutic immunosuppression and contribute to saturation of intensive care units. For these reasons, kidney transplantation was suspended in France during the first epidemic wave. Here, we retrospectively evaluated this strategy by comparing the overall and COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant recipients and candidates over the last three years. Cross-interrogation of two national registries for the period 1 March and 1 June 2020, identified 275 deaths among the 42812 kidney transplant recipients and 144 deaths among the 16210 candidates. This represents an excess of deaths for both populations, as compared with the same period the two previous years (mean of two previous years: 253 in recipients and 112 in candidates). This difference was integrally explained by COVID-19, which accounted for 44% (122) and 42% (60) of the deaths in recipients and candidates, respectively. Taking into account the size of the two populations and the geographical heterogeneity of virus circulation, we found that the excess of risk of death due to COVID-19 was similar for recipients and candidates in high viral risk area but four-fold higher for candidates in the low viral risk area. Thus, in case of a second epidemic wave, kidney transplantation should be suspended in high viral risk areas but maintained outside those areas, both to reduce the excess of deaths of candidates and avoid wasting precious resources.","Thaunat, Olivier; Legeai, Camille; Anglicheau, Dany; Couzi, Lionel; Blancho, Gilles; Hazzan, Marc; Pastural, Myriam; Savoye, Emilie; Bayer, Florian; Morelon, Emmanuel; Le Meur, Yann; Bastien, Olivier; Caillard, Sophie",Kidney Int,,439

Sixteen adult mongrel dogs were submitted to unilateral nephrectomy. In 13 animals the kidney was then perfused with Euro-Collins solution and preserved during 48-hours in cold solution. After that time auto-transplantation was performed. Reperfusion time was 1 hour. After that, the transplanted kidney was taken out and samples were obtained for mitochondrial evaluation. The animals were divided into 3 groups: group N - control without ischemia (3 animals); group I - hypothermia (6 animals); group II - hypothermia + IV injection of 2 mg/Kg of chlorpromazine 15 minutes before nephrectomy. The results of mitochondrial phosphorilation and swelling showed no statistical differences. However, group II animals showed higher values during the reversion phase of the swelling. Chlorpromazine action on mitochondrial function has been previously described, providing better mitochondria recovering from ischemic lesion. The results obtained in this study may be related to the short reperfusion time, or we can argue that chlorpromazine has no protection after prolonged ischemic time, or chlorpromazine action may be masqueraded by hypothermia.","Netto, JMB; Tucci Jr, S; Cologna, AJ; Suaid, HJ; Martins, ACP; Molina, CAF; Roselino, JES",Acta cir. bras.,,439

Aims to examine whether time from symptoms onset to intensive care unit (ICU) admission affects incidence of extra-pulmonary complications and prognosis in order to provide a new insight for reducing the mortality. A single-centered, retrospective, observational study investigated 45 critically ill patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in ICU of The Third People's Hospital of Yichang from January 17 to March 29, 2020. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to time from symptoms onset to ICU admission (>7 and &#8804;7âdays) and into 2 groups according to prognosis (survivors and non-survivors). Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and treatment data were studied. Compared with patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset &#8804;7âdays (55.6%), patients who admitted to the ICU since symptoms onset >7âdays (44.4%) were more likely to have extra-pulmonary complications (19 [95.0%] vs 16 [64.0%], Pâ=â.034), including acute kidney injury, cardiac injury, acute heart failure, liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hyperamylasemia, and hypernatremia. The incidence rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax, and hospital-acquired pneumonia had no difference between the 2 groups. Except activated partial thromboplastin and Na+ concentration, the laboratory findings were worse in group of time from symptoms onset to ICU admission >7âdays. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups. Of the 45 cases in the ICU, 19 (42.2%) were non-survivors, and 16 (35.6%) were with hospital-acquired pneumonia. Among these non-survivors, hospital-acquired pneumonia was up to 12 (63.2%) besides higher incidence of extra-pulmonary complications. However, hospital-acquired pneumonia occurred in only 4 (15.4%) survivors. Critically ill patients with COVID-19 who admitted to ICU at once might get benefit from intensive care via lower rate of extra-pulmonary complications.","Wang, Peng; Tan, Xiang; Li, Qian; Qian, Min; Cheng, Aiguo; Ma, Baohua; Wan, Peng; Zhang, Xinli; Guo, Changyun; Sheng, Mengting; Yi, Mengqiu; Yu, Min",Medicine (Baltimore),,439

We compared S5 to HPV16/18 and cytology to detect cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and CIN3+ in hrHPV+ women selected from a randomized pragmatic trial of 2661 Colombian women with an earlier-borderline abnormal cytology. We included all hrHPV+ CIN2 and CIN3+ cases (n = 183) age matched to 183 <CIN2 hrHPV+. Baseline specimens were HPV-genotyped and tested by S5-methylation, blinded to cytology, histology and initial HPV results. We evaluated the test performance of predefined S5-classifier (cut-point 0.8) and a post hoc classifier at a different cut-point (3.1). S5 sensitivity for CIN2+ was 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] 76.4-87.5) and for CIN3+ 77.08% (95% CI 65.19-88.97). S5 sensitivity was higher than HPV16/18 sensitivity (48.1%, 95% CI 40.85-55.33) or cytology (31.21%, 95% CI 24.50-37.93) but with lower specificity (35%, 95% CI 28.1-42). At cut-point 3.1, S5 sensitivity for CIN2+ (55.2%, 95% CI 48-62.4) or CIN3+ (64.6%, 95% CI 51.0-78.1) was also superior to HPV16/18 (P < .05) or cytology (P < .0001). At this cut-point S5 specificity (76%, 95% CI 69.8-82.1 for <CIN2) was higher than HPV16/18 (67.21%, 95% CI 60.41-74.01, P = .0062) and similar to cytology (75.57%, 95% CI 69.34-81.79, P = 1). HPV16/18 plus cytology sensitivity was similar to S5 for CIN3+, however, false-positive rate was higher (50.27% vs. 24.04%). High sensitivity is crucial in LMICs, S5-methylation exceeded HPV16/18 or cytology sensitivity with comparable specificity for CIN2+ and CIN3+ in hrHPV-positive Colombian women. Furthermore, S5 triage had comparable sensitivity and significantly fewer false positives than cytology and HPV16/18 combination.","Ramírez, Arianis Tatiana; Sánchez, Gloria Inés; Nedjai, Belinda; Agudelo, María Cecilia; Brentnall, Adam R; Cuschieri, Kate; Castañeda, Kelly Melisa; Cuzick, Jack; Lorincz, Attila T",Int. j. cancer,,439
352607,All-cause mortality among patients treated with repurposed antivirals and antibiotics for COVID-19 in Mexico City: A real-world observational study,2021,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) encoded by IGHV3-53 (VH3-53) targeting the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) have been isolated from different COVID-19 patients. However, the existence and prevalence of shared VH3-53-encoded antibodies in the antibody repertoires is not clear. Using antibody repertoire sequencing, we found that the usage of VH3-53 increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A highly shared VH3-53-J6 clonotype was identified in 9 out of 13 COVID-19 patients. This clonotype was derived from convergent gene rearrangements with few somatic hypermutations and was evolutionary conserved. We synthesized 34 repertoire-deduced novel VH3-53-J6 heavy chains and paired with a common IGKV1-9 light chain to produce recombinant mAbs. Most of these recombinant mAbs (23/34) possess RBD binding and virus neutralizing activities, and recognize ACE2 binding site via the same molecular interface. Our computational analysis, validated by laboratory experiments, revealed that VH3-53 antibodies targeting RBD are commonly present in COVID-19 patients' antibody repertoires, indicating many people have germline-like precursor sequences to rapidly generate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, antigen-specific mAbs can be digitally obtained through antibody repertoire sequencing and computational analysis.","Yan, Qihong; He, Ping; Huang, Xiaohan; Luo, Kun; Zhang, Yudi; Yi, Haisu; Wang, Qian; Li, Feng; Hou, Ruitian; Fan, Xiaodi; Li, Pingchao; Liu, Xinglong; Liang, Huan; Deng, Yijun; Chen, Zhaoming; Chen, Yunfei; Mo, Xiaoneng; Xiong, Xiaoli; Feng, Liqiang; Li, Song; Han, Jian; Qu, Linbing; Niu, Xuefeng; Chen, Ling",Emerg Microbes Infect,,439

352695,A meta-analysis of the association between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms,2020,"Objectives: To describe patterns of multimorbidity among fatal cases of COVID-19, and to propose a classification of patients based on age and multimorbidity patterns to begin the construction of etiological models. Methods: Data of Colombian confirmed deaths of COVID-19 until June 11, 2020, were included in this analysis (n=1488 deaths). Relationships between COVID-19, combinations of health conditions and age were explored using locally weighted polynomial regressions. Results: The most frequent health conditions were high blood pressure, respiratory disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease. Dyads more frequents were high blood pressure with diabetes, cardiovascular disease or respiratory disease. Some multimorbidity patterns increase probability of death among older individuals, whereas other patterns are not age-related, or decrease the probability of death among older people. Not all multimorbidity increases with age, as is commonly thought. Obesity, alone or with other diseases, was associated with a higher risk of severity among young people, while the risk of the high blood pressure/diabetes dyad tends to have an inverted U distribution in relation with age. Conclusions: Classification of individuals according to multimorbidity in the medical management of COVID-19 patients is important to determine the possible etiological models and to define patient triage for hospitalization. Moreover, identification of non-infected individuals with high-risk ages and multimorbidity patterns serves to define possible interventions of selective confinement or special management.","Fernández-Niño, Julián A; Guerra-Gómez, John A; J Idrovo, Avaro",Rev Panam Salud Publica,,439

Methods: This retrospective study examined 61 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, as defined by the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19. All patients were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Union Hospital from Dec 28, 2019 to Feb 22, 2020 and classified into a GGO group or a non-GGO group based on CT results. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the two groups were compared. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis, and using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Forty-five patients were in the GGO group (73.8%, 21 females, 24 males, mean age 54.8±17.8 years) and 16 were in the non-GGO group (26.2%, 11 females, 5 males, mean age 53±14.9 years). The levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-Î³ were greater in the GGO group (all P<0.05). ROC analysis indicated that an elevated level of IL-2 was a good predictor of GGO (area under the curve: 0.716, optimal cutoff: 3.205 pg/mL, 53.8% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that IL-2 level was a significant and independent risk factor for lung GGO (OR: 8.167; 95% CI: 1.63, 40.8; P<0.05). Conclusions: There were correlations between GGO in the lungs of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, and INF-Î³. IL-2 was a significant and independent risk factor for GGO. These findings provide a basis for studying the mechanism of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Zubo; Liu, Xiaoping; Liu, Jie; Zhu, Feng; Liu, Yali; Liu, Yalan; Peng, Hua",Int J Med Sci,,439
353894,Clinical stability and in-hospital mortality prediction in COVID-19 patients presenting to the Emergency Department,2020,"There is an urgent need to identify therapies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Although repurposed drugs with favorable safety profiles could have significant benefit, widely available prevention or treatment options for COVID-19 have yet to be identified. Efforts to identify approved drugs with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 resulted in identification of antiviral sigma-1 receptor ligands, including antihistamines in the histamine-1 receptor binding class. We identified antihistamine candidates for repurposing by mining electronic health records of usage in population of more than 219,000 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2. Usage of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine was associated with reduced incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in subjects greater than age 61. We found diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine to exhibit direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Although mechanisms by which specific antihistamines exert antiviral effects is not clear, hydroxyzine, and possibly azelastine, bind Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) and the sigma-1 receptor as off-targets. Clinical studies are needed to measure the effectiveness of diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine and azelastine for disease prevention, for early intervention, or as adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19.","Reznikov, Leah R; Norris, Michael H; Vashisht, Rohit; Bluhm, Andrew P; Li, Danmeng; Liao, Yan-Shin J; Brown, Ashley; Butte, Atul J; Ostrov, David A",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,439

Notably, many of affected patients of COVID-19 were people with malignancies. Moreover, cancer has been identified as an individual risk factor for COVID-19. In addition, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor of COVID-19, were aberrantly expressed in many tumors. However, a systematic analysis of ACE2 aberration remained to be elucidated in human cancers. Here, we analyzed genetic alteration, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of ACE2 across over 30 tumors. Notably, overexpression of ACE2 have been observed in including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). In addition, hypo DNA methylation of ACE2 has also been identified in most of these ACE2 highly expressed tumors. Conclusively, our study for the first time curated both genetic and epigenetic variations of ACE2 in human malignancies.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly spread worldwide to become a pandemic. Typical manifestations of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, fatigue, and respiratory distress. In addition, both the central and peripheral nervous system can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These neurological changes may be caused by viral neurotropism, by a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulative state, or even by mechanical ventilation-associated impairment. Hypoxia, endothelial cell damage, and the different impacts of different ventilatory strategies may all lead to increased stress and strain, potentially exacerbating the inflammatory response and leading to a complex interaction between the lungs and the brain. To date, no studies have taken into consideration the possible secondary effect of mechanical ventilation on brain recovery and outcomes. The aim of our review is to provide an updated overview of the potential pathogenic mechanisms of neurological manifestations in COVID-19, discuss the physiological issues related to brain-lung interactions, and propose strategies for optimization of respiratory support in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Battaglini, Denise; Brunetti, Iole; Anania, Pasquale; Fiaschi, Pietro; Zona, Gianluigi; Ball, Lorenzo; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Vena, Antonio; Bassetti, Matteo; Patroniti, Nicolò; Schenone, Angelo; Pelosi, Paolo; Rocco, Patricia R.

356358,On the suitability of the distance between the tip of the nose and the middle of the elbow joint for sneezing etiquette as an corona infection prophylaxis,2020,"Importance: Treating older adults with psoriasis can be challenging owing to comorbidities, concomitant medication use, and consequent safety risks. Although many studies focus on the effectiveness and safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in the general population, their effectiveness in older adults with psoriasis has not been systematically assessed. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in patients 65 years or older. Evidence Review: A systematic literature search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on November 11, 2019. No date limit was used. Randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, large case series, and meta-analyses assessing efficacy (or effectiveness) and/or safety of systemic antipsoriatic therapies in patients 65 years or older were included. Findings: The initial search yielded 11 096 results, of which 31 unique articles with 39 561 patients were included in analysis. Overall, limited data were available per systemic agent, and overall quality of the included studies on conventional systemic therapies was low. At the end of the induction phase (12-16 weeks after start of treatment), a reduction of 75% in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index was achieved in 49% of 74 methotrexate sodium users 65 years or older, 46% to 52.6% of 178 older cyclosporin users, 27% to 47.8% of 108 older acitretin users, 15.6% to 64% of 256 etanercept users 65 years or older, 66.7% to 93% of 43 infliximab users 65 years or older, 60.7% to 65% of 100 adalimumab users 65 years or older, 56.5% of 46 ustekinumab users 65 years or older, and 86.4% of 67 secukinumab users 65 years or older. Effectiveness of acitretin, etanercept, adalimumab, and secukinumab appeared not to be associated with age; studies regarding other systemic antipsoriatic therapies did not provide age group comparisons. Older age was significantly associated with renal function deterioration in cyclosporin users and with lymphopenia in fumaric acid esters users (hazard ratio, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.65-3.55; P < .001). Infections were the most frequently reported adverse event in patients 65 years or older using biologics, but no significant association with age was found. Conclusions and Relevance: On the basis of limited available evidence, age alone should not be a limiting factor in psoriasis management. Awareness of comorbidities and concomitant medication use is very important, as well as appropriate dosing and frequent laboratory and clinical monitoring. More real-world evidence and (sub)analyses of prospective cohort studies on the effectiveness and safety of systemic therapies in older adults are critical to optimize personalized, effective, and safe antipsoriatic management in this growing patient group.","van Winden, Marieke E C; van der Schoot, Lara S; L039, van de; Isle Arias, Mariluz; van Vugt, Lieke J; van den Reek, Juul M P A; van de Kerkhof, Peter C M; de Jong, Elke M G J; Lubeek, Satish F K","JAMA dermatol.

361039,Risk Score for Predicting In-Hospital Mortality in COVID-19 (RIM Score),2021,"INTRODUCTION: During the 2018-2019 influenza season, vaccination coverage among U.S. children was 62.6%. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of influenza vaccinations among pediatric patients seen in U.S. health centers, and to explore potential disparities in vaccination coverage among subpopulations. Funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, these health centers provide primary and preventive care to underserved and vulnerable individuals and families in order to reduce health disparities based on economic, geographic, or cultural barriers. METHODS: Cross-sectional data, analyzed in 2019, came from the most recent waves of the Health Center Patient Survey (2009, 2014). The sample consisted of children ages 2-17 years receiving care from HRSA-funded health centers. The outcome of interest was self- or parent-reported receipt of influenza vaccine in the past year. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted prevalence rate ratios for the association between demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty level, urban/rural residence, geographic region), health-related variables (receipt of well-child check-up, asthma diagnosis), and influenza vaccination. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients increased from 46.6% in 2009 to 67.8% in 2014. In the adjusted model for 2014, there were few statistically significant differences in vaccination coverage among subpopulation groups, however American Indian/Alaska Native children had 31% increased vaccination coverage compared with non-Hispanic White children (aPRR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.02-1.60) and children living in the South had 26% decreased vaccination coverage compared with those living in the Northeast (aPRR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.54-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination coverage among pediatric health center patients in 2014 exceeded the national average (as of 2018-2019), and few differences were found among at-risk subpopulations. HRSA-funded health centers are well-positioned to further increase the vaccination rate among children living in underserved communities.","Lebrun-Harris, Lydie A; Mendel Van Alstyne, Judith A; Sripipatana, Alek",Vaccine,,439

Soon it spread to other countries worldwide to become a pandemic. Globally, governments enforced quarantine and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the infection. Mass media and social media platforms played a crucial role in providing information regarding the Coronavirus. Since little is known about COVID-19, various fake news, misinformation and rumours spread across the digital media that panicked people into making panic deci-sions. The rapid spread of misinformation and stories via social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube became a vital concern of the government and public health authorities. Medical misinformation and unver-ifiable content about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading on social media at an unprecedented pace. Mitigating the advent of rumours and misinformation during the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial, since misinformation and fake news creates panic, fear and anxiety among people, predisposing them to various mental health conditions. Instead of considering social media as a secondary medium, it should be utilised to convey important information. Besides, it allows citizens to address their queries directly. Several governments across the world have taken actions to contain the pandemic of misinformation, yet measures are required to prevent such communication complications.","Srivastava, Kumar Chandan; Shrivastava, Deepti; Chhabra, Kumar Gaurav; Naqvi, Waqar; Sahu, Arti",Int.

This personal reflection is a result of an experience as a medical reserve corps nurse volunteer for a local health department in the northeastern United States. Volunteering resulted in positive social and personal benefits for me. It inspired a sense of pride in helping others and knowing that someone's well-being may be enhanced. The individuals whom I spoke with via the phone appreciated the concern for their health, and some individuals seemed to enjoy the interaction with another person, possibly due to their isolation. Descriptions of interactions via phone calls with coronavirus positive individuals are provided that support the benefits of volunteering.

We report on the average narcotic usage in a group of patients treated with an identical multimodal pain protocol following TKA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 49 patients undergoing TKA participated in the survey. Patients with pre-op narcotic use, recent prior total joint arthroplasty or study refusal were excluded. All patients received a spinal anesthetic. No pre-surgery narcotics were given. All received an identical local infiltrative anesthetic combination along with a multimodal pain protocol. Patients were placed into an identical rapid rehab program. Narcotic usage during hospitalization was recorded in morphine equivalent doses (MED). Patients were given a journal to record their daily narcotic utilization. RESULTS: Pre-operative pain scores of the excluded groups had slightly higher but clinically insignificant differences compared to the study group. In the hospital, POD1 study group daily MED averaged 28 (range 0-110). POD2 had an average of 33.6 and POD 3 daily usages averaged 28.6 (range 0-100). By the end of week two, the average daily use was 19.2 and 24% patients were off all narcotics. By the end of week four, the average daily usage was 7.5 and 63% of patients were off all narcotics. By 8â¯weeks, there were no patients still taking narcotics. KSS averaged 76.9 (range 51-97) at the 6â¯week visit, and 94.2 at the 3-month visit (range 72-100). SUMMARY: This study documents the average needs of an average TKA patient treated with modern pain protocols. The majority of these patients were off narcotics by week four.","Costales, Timothy G; Greenwell, Patrick H; Chapman, Danielle M; Volkmann, Mary C; Dalury, David F",Knee,,439

COVID-19 courses range from mild symptoms up to multiple organ failure and death, triggered by excessively high serum cytokine levels (IL 1ß, IL 6, TNF &#945;, IL 8). The vagally driven cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) stops the action of nuclear factor &#954;B (NF-&#954;B), the transcriptional factor of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, well-balanced cytokine release depends on adequate vagal signaling. Coronaviruses replicate using NF-&#954;B transcriptional factor as well. By degrading the cytoplasmatic inhibitor of NF-&#954;B subunits (I&#954;B), coronaviruses induce unrestricted NF-&#954;B expression accelerating both, virus replication and cytokine transcription.We hypothesize that CAP detriment due to depressed vagal tone critically determines the severity of COVID-19.","Leitzke, M; Stefanovic, D; Meyer, J-J; Schimpf, S; Schönknecht, P",Bioelectron Med,,439

373748,Predictors of severity and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Rhode Island,2021,"BACKGROUND: Italy was the second country in the world, after China, to be hit by SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Italy's experience teaches that steps to limit people's movement by imposing 'red zones' need to be put in place early by carefully identifying the cities to be included within these areas of quarantine. The assessment of the relationship between the distance from an established outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection with transmission-linked cases and mortality observed in other sites could provide useful information to identify the optimal radius of red zones. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 cases and the distance of each Italian province from the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy (the city of Lodi placed in the Lombardia region). In 38 provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, we performed a breakpoint analysis to identify the radius of the red zone around Lodi minimizing epidemic spread and mortality in neighboring cities. RESULTS: In all Italian provinces, a non-linear relationship was found between SARS-CoV-2 cases and distance from Lodi. In an analysis including the provinces of Lombardia and neighboring regions, SARS-CoV-2 cases and mortality increased when the distance from Lodi reduced below 92 and 140 km, respectively, and such relationships were amplified by ozone (O3) pollution. CONCLUSIONS: The breakpoint analysis identifies the radius around the outbreak of Lodi minimizing the public health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 in neighboring cities. Such an approach can be useful to identify the red zones in future epidemics due to highly infective pathogens similar to SARS-CoV-2.","Tripepi, Giovanni; Plebani, Mario; Iervasi, Giorgio; Gori, Mercedes; Leonardis, Daniela; D039,; Arrigo, Graziella; Fusaro, Maria",Eur J Public Health,,439

This could help policy makers, public health experts, and clinicians to better plan preventive and management strategies to curb COVID-19 related mortality. MethodThis was a hospital record based, retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study, at a tertiary care hospital in Rishikesh, India. The study included all deceased patients between March 2020 and January 2021 (first wave) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and were hospitalized. The study was done to describe demography, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, treatment given and associated complications of all COVID-19 deaths. ResultOut of 424 mortalities, 298 (70.38%) were males and 126 (29.62%) were females. Mean age of patients was 55.85 {+/-} 16.24 years, out of which 19.5 percent were less than 45 years old, 33.6 percent were 45 to 60 years old and 41.8% were more than 60 years old. Comorbidity in the form of type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 41.4% [95% CI (41.4-51.1)], hypertension in 39.8% [95% CI (35.1-44.6)], and coronary artery disease in 15.2% [95% CI (11.8-18.8)]. At the time of presentation, shortness of breath was present in 73.6% [95% CI (69.1 -77.7)], fever in 64.92% [95% CI (60.1-69.4)], and cough in 46.1%, [95% CI (41.1-50.8)]. Deranged laboratory parameters were lymphopenia in 90.2% [95% CI (86.8-92.7)], transaminitis in 59.7% [95% CI (54.8-64.3)], and hypercreatinemia in 37.7% [95% CI (33.1-42.5)]. Complications manifested were acute respiratory distress syndrome in 78.3% [95% CI (74-82.1)] and shock in 54.7% [95% CI (49.8-59.5)]. Median time duration between onset of symptom and hospital admission was 5 days (IQR = 3 - 5 days) and median length of hospital stay was 9 days (IQR = 4 - 14 days). ConclusionDuring first pandemic wave, COVID-19 related mortality was 2.37 times higher among males, 2.14 times in age group >60 than <45 years. Most common associated comorbidities (>40%) were type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Most common associated symptoms (>60%) were shortness of breath and fever. Lymphopenia was seen in >90% cases while liver involvement in 60% and kidney in 38% cases.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used to estimate the point seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using a rapid immunoglobulin (Ig)M-IgG combined point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay among frontline firefighters/paramedics collected over a 2-day period, 16-17 April 2020. Fire department personnel were emailed a survey link assessing COVID-19 symptoms and work exposures the day prior to the scheduled drive-through antibody testing at a designated fire station. Off-duty and on-duty firefighter/paramedic personnel drove through the fire station/training facility in their personal vehicles or on-duty engine/rescue trucks for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. RESULTS: Among the 203 firefighters/paramedics that make up the fire department workforce, 18 firefighters/paramedics (8.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, of which 8 firefighters/paramedics (3.9%) were IgG positive only, 8 (3.9%) were IgM positive only and 2 (0.1%) were IgG/IgM positive. The positive predictive value (PPV) of the serological test is estimated to be 33.2% and the negative predictive value is 99.3%. The average number of COVID-19 case contacts (ie, within 6 feet of an infected person (laboratory-confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient) for &#8805;15 min) experienced by firefighters/paramedics was higher for those with positive serology compared with those with negative (13.3 cases vs 7.31 cases; p=0.022). None of the antibody positive firefighters/paramedics reported receipt of the annual influenza vaccine compared with firefighters/paramedics who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (0.0% vs 21.0%; p=0.027). CONCLUSION: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 IgM-IgG antibody testing documented early-stage and late-stage infection in a firefighter workforce providing insight to a broader medical surveillance project on return to work for firefighters/paramedics. Given the relatively low PPV of the serological test used in this study back in April 2020, caution should be used in interpreting test results.","Caban-Martinez, Alberto J; Schaefer-Solle, Natasha; Santiago, Katerina; Louzado-Feliciano, Paola; Brotons, Angel; Gonzalez, Marco; Issenberg, S Barry; Kobetz, Erin",Occup Environ Med,,439

Recent advances in natural language understanding driven by deep transformer networks offer new possibilities for mapping science. Because the same surface text can take on multiple and sometimes contradictory specialized senses across distinct research communities, sensitivity to context is critical for infometric applications. Transformer embedding models such as BERT capture shades of association and connotation that vary across the different linguistic contexts of any particular word or span of text. Here we report a procedure for encoding scientific documents with these tools, measuring their improvement over static word embeddings in a nearest-neighbor retrieval task. We find discriminability of contextual representations is strongly influenced by choice of pooling strategy for summarizing the high-dimensional network activations. Importantly, we note that fundamentals such as domain-matched training data are more important than state-of-the-art NLP tools. Yet state-of-the-art models did offer significant gains. The best approach we investigated combined domain-matched pretraining, sound pooling, and state-of-the-art deep transformer network encoders. Finally, with the goal of leveraging contextual representations from deep encoders, we present a range of measurements for understanding and forecasting research communities in science.","Chambers, Brendan; Evans, James",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.05928v1.pdf,439

We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 µM, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) and ~100-fold reductions in Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 100 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.","Stegmann, Kim M; Dickmanns, Antje; Gerber, Sabrina; Nikolova, Vella; Klemke, Luisa; Manzini, Valentina; Schlösser, Denise; Bierwirth, Cathrin; Freund, Julia; Sitte, Maren; Lugert, Raimond; Salinas, Gabriela; Meister, Toni Luise; Pfaender, Stephanie; Görlich, Dirk; Wollnik, Bernd; Groß, Uwe; Dobbelstein, Matthias",Virus Res,,439
383098,"Virtual triage and outcomes of diabetic foot complications during Covid-19 pandemic: A retro-prospective, observational cohort study",2021,"BACKGROUND: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the treatment process through IT/technological supports, useful in the management of chronic patients such as those affected by type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Specific routes for fragile patients such as those with micro-infusers have been created thanks to the application of ""Diabetes Technology,"" which allows patients to monitor blood glucose quickly and easily. The present pilot study aimed to assess the quality of care provided to patients with micro-infusers in a delicate phase such as a pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was used. In the first part, with prior written consent, patients with insulin pumps enrolled voluntarily. In the second part, the focus group discussion (FGD) was carried out with the voluntarily enrolled participants. The FGD data were organized and analyzed by the thematic areas. RESULTS: The number of patients with afferent insulin pumps at the center was 50 individuals. Among them, 20 patients voluntarily joined the first part of the study by completing the PACIC questionnaire, which gave an average result of 3.34 (min. 2.2 and max. 4.2). In the second part, the application of the focus group technique demonstrated that technology is decisive in the management of diabetic pathology, not only in the emergency phase. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of public health crises, alternative strategies such as Tele-Nursing or Telemedicine could be crucial for the management of patients with micro-infuser not only in critical moments, such as lockdown, but also in ordinary health management.","Petrelli, Fabio; Cangelosi, Giovanni; Scuri, Stefania; Pantanetti, Paola; Lavorgna, Francesca; Faldetta, Federica; De Carolis, Cristina; Rocchi, Renato; Debernardi, Giulia; Florescu, Alexandra; Nittari, Giulio; Sagaro, Getu Gamo; Garda, Giulia; Nguyen, Cuc Thi Thu; Grappasonni, Iolanda",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,439

384516,"Reply to: Comments on ""Association of liver abnormalities with in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19""",2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic affected radiology practices in many ways. The aim of this survey was to estimate declines in imaging volumes and financial impact across different practice settings during April 2020. METHODS: The survey, comprising 48 questions, was conducted among members of the ACR and the Radiology Business Management Association during May 2020. Survey questions focused on practice demographics, volumes, financials, personnel and staff adjustments, and anticipation of recovery. RESULTS: During April 2020, nearly all radiology practices reported substantial (56.4%-63.7%) declines in imaging volumes, with outpatient imaging volumes most severely affected. Mean gross charges declined by 50.1% to 54.8% and collections declined by 46.4% to 53.9%. Percentage reductions did not correlate with practice size. The majority of respondents believed that volumes would recover but not entirely (62%-88%) and anticipated a short-term recovery, with a surge likely in the short term due to postponement of elective imaging (52%-64%). About 16% of respondents reported that radiologists in their practices tested positive for COVID-19. More than half (52.3%) reported that availability of personal protective equipment had become an issue or was inadequate. A majority (62.3%) reported that their practices had existing remote reading or teleradiology capabilities in place before the pandemic, and 22.3% developed such capabilities in response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Radiology practices across different settings experienced substantial declines in imaging volumes and collections during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. Most are actively engaged in both short- and long-term operational adjustments.","Malhotra, Ajay; Wu, Xiao; Fleishon, Howard B; Duszak, Richard; Silva, Ezequiel; McGinty, Geraldine B; Bender, Claire; Williams, Beth; Pashley, Neale; Stengel, Casey J B; Naidich, Jason J; Hughes, Danny; Sanelli, Pina C",J Am Coll Radiol,,439

387559,Covid-19: doctors are given new guidelines on when to admit patients to critical care,2020,"Introduction: Many clinical trials have suffered poor enrollment or have been placed on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations on in-person interaction with patients, legally authorized representatives, coordinators, and physician investigators disrupt research processes including screening, consent, randomization, and study interventions. Remote enrollment practices incorporating telemedicine and electronic consent may address these enrollment limitations. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical trial enrollments in two pivotal phase-III acute stroke trials (NCT03735979, NCT03785678) at two high-volume stroke centers that routinely use remote enrollments in clinical research. Individual elements of acute clinical stroke trial enrollment, including: screening, consent, randomization, and intervention were reviewed. For each research phase, we compared the rate of successful completion and research protocol violations for inperson vs remote research via Fisher's exact test. Results: Forty patients were reviewed (median age 72 [IQR 63-84], 50% female, median NIHSS 13 [IQR 7.5-19.5];35 patient were enrolled and 5 were screened and consented, but found ineligible on qualifying imaging. All research phases were completed successfully with the exception of one inperson study intervention. Fisher's exact test revealed no differences in protocol violations between research elements conducted remotely (predominantly via telemedicine) versus in-person (see Table). Conclusion: Our study revealed no difference in successful completion of acute clinical trial research elements when conducted remotely or in-person. Incorporation of remote research, especially telemedicine, may enable stroke clinical trial enrollments both during the COVID 19 pandemic and beyond. (Figure Presented).","Streib, C.

387693,The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: simulation-based assessment of outbreak responses and postpeak strategies,2020,"In January 2020, Chinese health agencies reported an outbreak of a novel coronavirus-2 (CoV-2) which can lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The virus, which belongs to the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-2), was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Full-length genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed 79.6% sequence identity to SARS-CoV, with 96% identity to a bat coronavirus at the whole-genome level. COVID-19 has caused over 133,000 deaths and there are over 2 million total confirmed cases as of April 15th, 2020. Current treatment plans are still under investigation due to a lack of understanding of COVID-19. One potential mechanism to slow disease progression is the use of antiviral drugs to either block the entry of the virus or interfere with viral replication and maturation. Currently, antiviral drugs, including chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir, have shown effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Due to the high dose needed and narrow therapeutic window, many patients are experiencing severe side effects with the above drugs. Hence, repurposing these drugs with a proper formulation is needed to improve the safety and efficacy for COVID-19 treatment. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a family of natural carriers in the human body. They play a critical role in cell-to-cell communications. EVs can be used as unique drug carriers to deliver protease inhibitors to treat COVID-19. EVs may provide targeted delivery of protease inhibitors, with fewer systemic side effects. More importantly, EVs are eligible for major aseptic processing and can be upscaled for mass production. Currently, the FDA is facilitating applications to treat COVID-19, which provides a very good chance to use EVs to contribute in this combat.","Kumar, Santosh; Zhi, Kaining; Mukherji, Ahona; Gerth, Kelli",Viruses,,439

392959,Association Analysis of Hyperlipidemia with the 28-Day All-Cause Mortality of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients,2021,"Insular epilepsy is increasingly recognized in epilepsy surgery centers. Recent studies suggest that resection of an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula as a treatment for drug-resistant seizures is associated with good outcomes in terms of seizure control. However, despite the existing evidence of a role of the insula in emotions and affective information processing, the long-term psychological outcome of patients undergoing these surgeries remain poorly documented. A group of 27 adults (18 women) who underwent an insulo-opercular resection (in combination with a part of the temporal lobe in 10, and of the frontal lobe in 5) as part of epilepsy surgery at our center between 2004 and 2019 completed psychometric questionnaires to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd edition; BDI-II), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Version; STAI-T), and quality of life (Patient Weighted Quality of Life In Epilepsy; QOLIE-10-P). Scores were compared to those of patients who had standard temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery with similar socio-demographic and disease characteristics. Seizure control after insular epilepsy surgery was comparable to that observed after TLE surgery, with a majority of patients reporting being seizure free (insular: 63.0%; temporal: 63.2%) or having rare disabling seizures (insular: 7.4%; temporal: 18.4%) at the time of questionnaire completion. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group difference on scores of depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Hemisphere or extent of insular resection had no significant effect on the studied variables. In the total sample, employment status and seizure control, but not location of surgery, significantly predicted quality of life. Self-reported long-term psychological status after insulo-opercular resection as part of epilepsy surgery thus appears to be similar to that observed after TLE surgery, which is commonly performed in epilepsy surgery centers.","Gravel, Victoria; Boucher, Olivier; Citherlet, Daphné; Hébert-Seropian, Benjamin; Bouthillier, Alain; Nguyen, Dang Khoa",Epilepsy Behav,,439

393443,Neurological outcome and quality of life three months after COVID-19: a prospective observational cohort study,2021,"Podocyte injury has recently been described as unifying feature in idiopathic nephrotic syndromes (INS). Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) infection represents a unique RNA virus-induced renal disease with significant proteinuria. The underlying pathomechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that PUUV infection results in podocyte injury, similar to findings in INS. We therefore analyzed standard markers of glomerular proteinuria (e.g. immunoglobulin G [IgG]), urinary nephrin excretion (podocyte injury) and serum levels of the soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a proposed pathomechanically involved molecule in INS, in PUUV-infected patients. Hantavirus patients showed significantly increased urinary nephrin, IgG and serum suPAR concentrations compared to healthy controls. Nephrin and IgG levels were significantly higher in patients with severe proteinuria than with mild proteinuria, and nephrin correlated strongly with biomarkers of glomerular proteinuria over time. Congruently, electron microcopy analyses showed a focal podocyte foot process effacement. suPAR correlated significantly with urinary nephrin, IgG and albumin levels, suggesting suPAR as a pathophysiological mediator in podocyte dysfunction. In contrast to INS, proteinuria recovered autonomously in hantavirus patients. This study reveals podocyte injury as main cause of proteinuria in hantavirus patients. A better understanding of the regenerative nature of hantavirus-induced glomerulopathy may generate new therapeutic approaches for INS.","Nusshag, Christian; Stütz, Alisa; Hägele, Stefan; Speer, Claudius; Kälble, Florian; Eckert, Christoph; Brenner, Thorsten; Weigand, Markus A; Morath, Christian; Reiser, Jochen; Zeier, Martin; Krautkrämer, Ellen",Sci Rep,,439

Among these, 67 (51.5%) had a relative with COVID-19 while 34 (26.2%) had comorbidities, with the most frequent being respiratory, cardiac, or neuromuscular chronic diseases. Overall, 98 (75.4%) had an asymptomatic or mild disease, 11 (8.5%) had moderate disease, 11 (8.5%) had a severe disease, and 9 (6.9%) had a critical presentation with infants below 6 months having significantly increased risk of critical disease severity (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.3 to 29.1). Seventy-five (57.7%) children were hospitalized, 15 (11.5%) needed some respiratory support, and nine (6.9%) were treated in an intensive care unit. All recovered.Conclusion:This descriptive case series of children with COVID-19, mostly encompassing of cases enrolled at hospital level, suggest that COVID-19 may have a non-negligible rate of severe presentations in selected pediatric populations with a relatively high rates of comorbidities. More studies are needed to further understand the presentation and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in children with special needs. What is Known: â¢ There is limited evidence on the clinical presentation and outcomes of children with COVID-19 in Europe, and almost no evidence on characteristics and risk factors of severe cases. What is New: â¢ Among a case series of 130 children, mostly diagnosed at hospital level, and with a relatively high rate (26.2%) of comorbidities, about three-quarter had an asymptomatic or mild disease. â¢ However, 57.7% were hospitalized, 11.5% needed some respiratory support, and 6.9% were treated in an intensive care unit.","Parri, Niccolò; Magistà, Anna Maria; Marchetti, Federico; Cantoni, Barbara; Arrighini, Alberto; Romanengo, Marta; Felici, Enrico; Urbino, Antonio; Da Dalt, Liviana; Verdoni, Lucio; Armocida, Benedetta; Covi, Benedetta; Mariani, Ilaria; Giacchero, Roberta; Musolino, Anna Maria; Binotti, Marco; Biban, Paolo; Fasoli, Silvia; Pilotto, Chiara; Nicoloso, Flavia; Raggi, Massimiliano; Miorin, Elisabetta; Buonsenso, Danilo; Chiossi, Massimo; Agostiniani, Rino; Plebani, Anna; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Lanari, Marcello; Arrigo, Serena; Zoia, Elena; Lenge, Matteo; Masi, Stefano; Barbi, Egidio; Lazzerini, Marzia",Eur J Pediatr,,439

However, studies evaluating how patients using dental prostheses have been affected by the pandemic are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate how patients using different types of dental prostheses were being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 129 randomly selected individuals from among those who had been examined in the same clinic before the COVID-19 outbreak were included in the study. The study participants were divided into 4 groups according to their type of prosthesis: complete dentures, implant-retained removable dentures, tooth-supported fixed partial dentures, and implant-supported fixed partial dentures. The Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) questionnaire was implemented by telephone interviews with the study participants, who were also asked about their concerns and steps made regarding prosthetic hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis and post hoc Dunn tests, and multivariate logistic regression analysis with forward selection was carried out to identify predictors of the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) status (&#945;=.05). RESULTS: OHIP-14 total scores did not vary significantly among the groups (P>.05). When the domain scores of OHIP-14 were considered separately, the analysis revealed that the implant-retained removable denture group had significantly poorer functional limitations when compared with the tooth-supported fixed partial denture (P=.005) and implant-supported fixed partial denture (P=.031) groups. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated a statistically significant association between OHRQoL during the COVID-19 pandemic and the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning (1 time a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.011; 2-3 times a day versus less than 1 time a day: P=.032). CONCLUSIONS: All prosthesis users exhibited increased interest in dental hygiene and an increase in the frequency of prosthesis cleaning during the pandemic. Furthermore, the study determined that the frequency of tooth or denture cleaning was associated with significantly improved OHRQoL during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the denture groups, those treated with implant-retained removable dentures had the poorest functional limitation in terms of OHRQoL, which can be linked to postponement of routine maintenance appointments. Therefore, providing all patients with scientifically sound information on prosthetic care during a pandemic would be highly beneficial.","Degirmenci, Kubra; Kalaycioglu, Oya",J. prosthet. dent,,439
396762,A Bioweapon or a Hoax? The Link Between Distinct Conspiracy Beliefs About the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak and Pandemic Behavior,2020,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling illness and 1 of the most common mood disorders. It affects the entire body and mind, leading to reductions in quality of life and significant costs to the health care sector and society.1 MDD is associated with a high risk of mortality with a relative risk of 1.81 compared with persons without depression.2 According to Statistics Canada's 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey on Mental Health, it is estimated that 5.4% of the Canadian population aged 15 years and older have reported mood disorders in the previous 12 months, including 4.7% for major depression.1 A recent survey on COVID-19 and mental health during the last 3 months of 2020 found that 1 in 5 Canadians had a positive screening for at least 1 of the 3 mental disorders: MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.3 MDD was the most prevalent mental disorder, with 15% Canadians screening positive with moderate or severe symptoms.3 A variety of antidepressant agents have been used for the treatment of patients with MDD including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), glutamate antagonist, and atypical antidepressants such as bupropion.4 Despite advances in understanding the efficacy and safety of those pharmacological agents, 10% to 15% of patients do not respond to their first course of antidepressant pharmacotherapy, and 30% to 40% achieve only partial remission.5 After proper diagnosis and adequate treatment of MDD with antidepressants, individuals who are still nonresponders or partial responders are considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although there is no universally accepted definition of TRD, approximately half of clinical trials required a minimum of 2 treatment failures to be considered TRD.6 The pharmacological options for treating TRD are not well-established and remain a challenge for physicians.7 Options for treatment of TRD include augmentation and switching of the initial antidepressant.7 Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant which inhibits the reuptake of noradrenaline and dopamine and has been used for treatment of MDD.8 It is generally well-tolerated but can cause weight loss and low rates of sexual dysfunction.8 However, its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in the treatment of TRD is less well understood. The current report aims to review the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bupropion for the treatment of adults with TRD.","Tran, K.; McGill, S.

Here, we examine the interplay between the genetic neuronopathic Gaucher's disease (nGD), and neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI) infection. Infection of nGD mice with SVNI had no influence on nGD severity. However, nGD mice were more resistant to SVNI infection. Significantly different inflammatory responses were seen in nGD brains when compared with SVNI brains: the inflammatory response in the nGD brains consisted of reactive astrocytes and microglia with no infiltrating macrophages, but the inflammatory response in the brains of SVNI-infected mice was characterized by infiltration of macrophages and altered activation of microglia and astrocytes. We suggest that the innate immune response activated in nGD confers resistance against viral infection of the CNS.","Melamed, Sharon; Avraham, Roy; Rothbard, Deborah E; Erez, Noam; Israely, Tomer; Klausner, Ziv; Futerman, Anthony H; Paran, Nir; Vitner, Einat B",Acta Neuropathol Commun,,439

401166,Two novel nomograms for predicting the risk of hospitalization or mortality due to COVID-19 by the naïve Bayesian classifier method,2021,"Introduction: Obstructive jaundice is a frequent cause of access to the Emergency Department (ED) and requires rapid hospitalization in order to perform an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). To reduce overcrowding, Brief Observation Units (BOU) were set up in EDs throughout Italy where patients receive treatment for 48-72 hours, significantly decreasing hospitalizations. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new model for managing obstructive acute jaundice in BOUs and provide indications regarding the possibility of systematic implementation thereof within EDs. Materials and methods: From 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, we evaluated 213 patients (100 M/113F, mean age 65±16.8 years) who presented at the ED with acute obstructive jaundice and were subsequently admitted to the BOU. Each patient underwent blood tests, an ECG, and an ultrasound or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis. In addition, each patient presented with ERCP indications. We analyzed the introduction of the BOU from a clinical, economic and discharge time perspective and made some recommendations regarding the organizational opportunities. Results: Clinical management in BOUs has produced excellent results, but it is not cost-effective. It does, however, produce excellent performance in terms of discharge times. Conclusion: This study shows both good clinical performance in the procedures carried out in the BOU and the opportunity to avoid patient hospitalization, thus optimizing the use of available hospital beds. From an economic perspective, BOUs prove more costly and receive lower reimbursements from the Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) system. However, despite its inefficacy in terms of costs, it may be used with certain objective advantages, especially in view of the need to liberate as many hospital beds as possible and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations during the current pandemic. Furthermore, BOUs may also improve clinical results and patient safety. Management of obstructive jaundice in BOUs may be seen as an alternative care setting to the traditional methods of admission, although with economic limitations. © 2021 A. CARBONE Editore.

STUDY DESIGN: The study associated common SDOH metrics from public data sources (county specific) with health plan enrollment data (including demographics, counties, and zip codes) and medical and pharmaceutical annual claims data. METHODS: Following correlation analyses to reduce variables, the contribution of each SDOH individually and by category to the health outcomes was evaluated. Separate matrices for age populations (under age 19, general population [all ages], and &#8805; 65 years) were created with assigned weights of influence for categories and the factors within each category. RESULTS: The contributions of the categories varied by population, confirming that different SDOH influence populations to varying degrees. This was reflected in each model. The largest contributor to cost for the general population and for the group 65 years and older was factors grouped as health outcomes (such as perceived health), at 43.5% contribution and 37.7% contribution, respectively. Yet for the population younger than 19 years, the largest contributor to cost was socioeconomic factors (such as unemployment rate), at 40.2%. The other performance measures also varied by population and the mix and weight of determinants. CONCLUSIONS: This study and the developed population-based matrices can provide a valuable framework for reporting the impact of SDOH on health care quality. The variation suggests the need for further research on how age groups react to the social environment.","Krause, Trudy Millard; Schaefer, Caroline; Highfield, Linda",Am J Manag Care,,439
403041,A study on c-reactive protein and liver function tests in laboratory rt-pcr positive covid-19 patients in a tertiary care centre – a retrospective study,2021,"The modern food supply faces many challenges. The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie orrapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and this has been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, Volume 12 is March 2021.

ANO1-AS2 (linc02584), as an lncRNA is located near the anoctamin1 (ANO1) gene. ANO1 is an important component of the transmembrane system exhibiting expression modifications in the idiopathic infertile men. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between ANO1-AS2 and ANO1 gene expression with sperm motility and morphology in the patients with asthenozoospermia (AZ) and terato- asthenozoospermia (TAZ). The study population included 32 patients with AZ, 35 patients with TAZ, and 34 people with normozoospermia (NZ, control). The expression levels of ANO1 gene and ANO1-AS2 in the spermatozoa were measured by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Docking analysis was performed to investigate the interactions of the ANO1 gene promoter and intermediate elements with ANO1-AS2. ANO1 gene expression was significantly (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) downregulated in the patients however; ANO1-AS2 expression was significantly upregulated (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). The subsequent analysis confirmed the inverse correlation between ANO1 and ANO1-AS2. ANO1 gene expression level was significantly positively correlated with sperm motility and morphology (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Moreover, ANO1-AS2 expression showed an inverse correlation with sperm motility and morphology (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). Docking analysis confirmed that ANO1-AS2 could stably interact with ANO1 gene promoter. In conclusion, ANO1-AS2 is likely to downregulate the ANO1 gene by interacting with ANO1 gene promoter, which can influence the sperm motility and morphology.","Saberiyan, Mohammadreza; Mirfakhraie, Reza; Gholami, Delnya; Dehdehi, Leila; Teimori, Hossein",Exp Mol Pathol,,439

The extent of spread of these droplets determines the safe distance between a patient and health care worker. Here, we have presented a method to visualize the droplets expelled by a sneeze using light-sheet illumination. This method of visualization provides images that clearly resolve the velocities of droplets with minimal overlapping trajectories, towards understanding their flow dynamics. Furthermore, we present the image processing techniques required to perform accurate Particle Tracking Velocimetry to understand the motion of expelled droplets. Flow fields are presented from applying this methodology over multiple sneezes which reveal that less than 1% of droplets expelled travel at velocities greater than 10 m/s and almost 80% of droplets travel at velocities less than 5 m/s.

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To describe a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service practice model to improve medication safety in a population of rheumatology patients and evaluate its initial impact on guideline compliance. SUMMARY: Optimal pharmacologic care of patients with rheumatologic conditions often revolves around the use of specialty medications such as self-injectable biologics and infused therapies, including biologic response modifiers (BRMs), nearly all of which carry risks of serious adverse events due to their immune-suppressive properties. Possible adverse events include serious infections such as reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) and viral hepatitis B (HBV). This articles describes a pharmacist-managed virtual consult service introduced by a large university-affiliated health system in 2018 to integrate clinical, specialty pharmacy, and therapeutic infusion services for proactive medication and safety management for patients with rheumatologic conditions requiring specialty or infused medications. During a 4-month evaluation period, 157 referrals were sent to the consult service; of 137 consults included in the analysis, 42% were for self-injectable biologic medications, 28% were for intra-articular injections, 26% were for infusions, and 4% were for oral specialty medications. Forty-one percent of the pharmacy benefit consult orders required an intervention prior to submission of prior authorization requests. Most interventions (61%) were clinical in nature and involved the pharmacists ensuring that necessary laboratory work, clinical disease activity scoring, or radiographic imaging were completed prior to submission of the consult results for insurer approval. CONCLUSION: National rates of HBV screening and TB screening for patients prescribed BRMs continue to be suboptimal. The pharmacist-managed virtual consult service is a novel practice model to increase the screening rate to 100% to ensure the safety and appropriate monitoring of patients who are starting or continued on these complex medications.","Sasnovskaya, Veranika; Kumor, Lisa M; Stubbings, JoAnn; Chevalier, Aimee",Am. j. health system pharm,,439

In this article, the psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Own Risk Appraisal Scale (CORAS), including its development and validation in two samples in the United Kingdom, are described. The CORAS is a measure of perceived personal risk of contracting the disease, incorporating primarily intuitive with some analytic risk estimates. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed on data from 470 participants in the United Kingdom who completed the CORAS, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and the COVID-19 Preventive Behaviours Index. Results showed that a unidimensional, six-item model fits the data well, with satisfactory fit indices, internal consistency and high item loadings onto the factor. We found no statistically significant differences by age, gender or ethnicity. The CORAS correlated positively with the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and the COVID-19 Preventive Behaviours Index, suggesting good concurrent validity.","Jaspal, Rusi; Fino, Emanuele; Breakwell, Glynis M",J Health Psychol,,439

A person can easily get COVID-19 from the other people who have the virus. It is a serious disease, which disseminates through tiny water droplets from the nose or mouth, which are thrown out when a COVID-19 infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. This disease was first discovered in China and has since spread throughout the world at breakneck speed. At this pandemic time, the entire world should take an adequate and efficient step to analyze the disease and get rid of the effects of this epidemic. The applications of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques play an important role to detect and predict potential effect of this virus in future by gathering and examining most recent and past data. Furthermore, it can be used in realizing and recommending the enhancement of a vaccine for COVID-19. This paper focuses on reviewing the role of AI and ML approaches used for examining, analyzing, predicting, contact tracking of existing patients and potential patients.","Sowmya, H.

While the overall match winner and result is interesting, it conveys little information about the underlying scoring trends throughout the match. Modeling approaches that accommodate a finer granularity of the score difference throughout the match is needed to evaluate in-game strategies, discuss scoring streaks, teams strengths, and other aspects of the game. We propose a latent Gaussian process to model the score difference between two teams and introduce the Trend Direction Index as an easily interpretable probabilistic measure of the current trend in the match as well as a measure of post-game trend evaluation. In addition we propose the Excitement Trend Index - the expected number of monotonicity changes in the running score difference - as a measure of overall game excitement. Our proposed methodology is applied to all 1143 matches from the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season. We show how the trends can be interpreted in individual games and how the excitement score can be used to cluster teams according to how exciting they are to watch.","Ekstrom, Claus Thorn; Jensen, Andreas Kryger",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11915v1.pdf,439
409547,Isaric 4c Mortality Score As A Predictor Of In-Hospital Mortality In Covid-19 Patients Admitted In Ayub Teaching Hospital During First Wave Of The Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: There is growing support within the therapy professions for using talking therapy in alternative environments, such as outdoor spaces. The aim of the present study was to further understand how the organizational culture in clinical psychology may prevent or enable practitioners to step outside the conventional indoor consulting room. DESIGN: Informed grounded theory methodology was used within a pragmatist philosophy. METHODS: Participants (N = 15; nine male, six female) were identified using theoretical sampling. The sample consisted of experts and leaders within the profession of clinical psychology (e.g., heads of services, training programme directors, chairs of professional bodies, and developers of therapy models; M years in the profession = 34.80, SD = 9.77). One-to-one interviews and analysis ran concurrently over 9 months (April-December 2020). Mason's model of safe uncertainty was drawn upon to illuminate and organize themes. RESULTS: The main themes comprised organizational factors that either support a practitioner in maintaining a position of curiosity and flexibility towards the environment where therapy is located ('environmental safe uncertainty'), or push them towards adopting a more fixed position ('environmental certainty'). Themes included influences from therapy traditions, accessibility of alternative environments, internalized risk, workplace subcultures, business models, biomedical approaches, and the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Whether therapy is located in a consulting room, outdoors, clients' homes, or digitally, practitioners, clients, and services are encouraged to maintain a position of environmental safe uncertainty. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The therapy process and outcomes are influenced by the physical environment in which talking therapy is situated. Practitioners have often remained fixed in their preferred therapy environment, such as the indoor consulting room, without exploring the potential benefits of alternative environments or involving the client in this decision-making (i.e., 'environmental certainty'). Outdoor environments, as well as other alternatives to the consulting room (e.g., digital, home visits, and public places), can support access to therapy, subsequent engagement, and therefore health care equity. Practitioners and clients are encouraged to adopt a position of 'environmental safe uncertainty', which is defined as having openness, critical curiosity, and collaboration regarding the therapy environment and the possibility of other environments being more conducive to therapy.","Cooley, Sam J; Jones, Ceri R; Moss, Duncan; Robertson, Noelle",Br. j. clin. psychol,,439

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We combined data from four countries to produce pooled age-banded case fatality rates, calculated the sex difference in survival and used data from four recent studies to convert case fatality rates into age/sex-stratified infection fatality rates (IFRs). We estimated the additional risk of death in cancer patients and in those receiving chemotherapy. We illustrate the impact of these by considering the impact on a national incident cancer cohort and analyse the risk-benefit in some clinical scenarios. RESULTS: We obtained data based on 412 985 cases and 41 854 deaths. The pooled estimate for IFR was 0.92%. IFRs for patients with cancer ranged from 0 to 29% and were higher in patients receiving chemotherapy (0.01-46%). The risk was significantly higher with age and in men compared with women. 37.5% of patients with a new diagnosis of cancer in 2018 had an IFR &#8805;5%. Survival benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy ranged from 5 to 10% in some common cancers, compared with the increased risk of death from COVID-19 of 0-3%. CONCLUSIONS: Older male patients are at a higher risk of death with COVID-19. Patients with cancer are also at a higher risk, as are those who have recently received chemotherapy. We provide well-founded estimates to allow patients and clinicians to better balance these risks and illustrate the wider impact in a national incident cohort.","Williams, M; Mi, E; Le Calvez, K; Chen, J; Pakzad-Shahabi, L; Dadhania, S; Wang, J; Ho, A; Rabinowicz, S",Clin. oncol,,439

Though mass vaccination will certainly help in reducing number of COVID-19 patients, an effective therapeutic measure must be available too. Intravenous remdesivir (RDV) was the first drug receiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of COVID-19. However, in a pandemic like COVID-19, it is essential that drug formulations are readily available, affordable and convenient to administer to every patient around the globe. In this study, we have developed a Self-injectable extended release subcutaneous injection of Remdesivir (SelfExRem) for the treatment of COVID-19. As opposed to intravenous injection, extended release subcutaneous injection has the benefits of reducing face-to-face contact, minimizing hospitalization, reducing dosing frequency and reducing overall health care cost. SelfExRem was developed using a biodegradable polymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), dissolved in a biocompatible vehicle. Six different batches were formulated using 2 different grades of low molecular weight PLGA and 3 different PLGA concentration. The force of injection of various polymeric solutions through 23-30-gauge needles were analyzed using a TA.XTplus texture analyzer. The time required for injection was evaluated both manually and by using an autoinjector. In vitro release of all the batches were carried out in 1% v/v tween 80 in phosphate buffer saline. The study indicated that SelfExRem developed with15% w/v PLGA(75:25) provided a steady release of drug for 48 h and may be a breakthrough approach for the treatment of COVID-19.","Patki, Manali; Palekar, Siddhant; Reznik, Sandra; Patel, Ketan",Int J Pharm,,439

However, in early childhood education, such programmes are only just beginning to be developed. Before online professional development courses can be made inclusive, accessible and widely available to early childhood educators, they must meet a few basic requirements. The present study provides insights into essential aspects that need to be considered when setting up online professional development programmes, a field which is still in its infancy in Austria. The results of a representative survey (n = 317) demonstrated that early childhood educators' digital competencies are highly variable and cannot be taken for granted. The survey results also stress the need to provide educators with functional digital devices appropriate to their work environment. Early childhood educators' interest in online professional development programmes is very high, in recognition of the advantages afforded by flexible participation options independent of users' time constraints or location. The development of attractive, compelling and accessible online professional development courses can contribute to current professionalisation efforts in the field of early childhood education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Online professional development has already a very long tradition in the field of adult vocational training but not in Early Childhood Education. The possibility of attending online professional development programmes independent of a participant's time constraints or location is viewed as a particularly beneficial advantage.

What this paper adds In the field of early childhood education in German‐speaking regions, online professional development training courses are only beginning to be developed. This paper examines the challenges and barriers for early childhood educators associated with implementing online professional development programmes for early childhood educators. The survey was conducted during the COVID‐19 pandemic and includes current data on the ongoing digitalisation boom. Implications for practise and/or policy Online professional development courses should not be understood as competition for conventional face‐to‐face programmes. Instead, they act as a useful supplement. Media competencies are a fundamental prerequisite for everyday professional life—early childhood educators need functional media devices, stable internet connections, and support structures in IT and computer literacy. Early childhood educators require effective instruction in using online professional development programmes to expand online professional development programmes in their field.

Its N-terminal region harbors the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity, and its C terminus contains a cap assembling line composed of a capping domain and a methyltransferase domain (MTase) followed by a C-terminal domain (CTD) of unknown function. The L protein MTase catalyzes methylation at the 2'-O and N-7 positions of the cap structures. In addition, the MTase of Ebola virus can induce cap-independent internal adenosine 2'-O-methylation. In this work, we investigated the CTD role in the regulation of the cap-dependent and cap-independent MTase activities of the L protein. We found that the CTD, which is enriched in basic amino acids, plays a key role in RNA binding and in turn regulates the different MTase activities. We demonstrated that the mutation of CTD residues modulates specifically the different MTase activities. Altogether, our results highlight the pivotal role of the L protein CTD in the control of viral RNA methylation, which is critical for Ebola virus replication and escape from the innate response in infected cells.IMPORTANCE Ebola virus infects human and nonhuman primates, causing severe infections that are often fatal. The epidemics, in West and Central Africa, emphasize the urgent need to develop antiviral therapies. The Ebola virus large protein (L), which is the central protein for viral RNA replication/transcription, harbors a methyltransferase domain followed by a C-terminal domain of unknown function. We show that the C-terminal domain regulates the L protein methyltransferase activities and consequently participates in viral replication and escape of the host innate immunity.","Valle, Coralie; Martin, Baptiste; Debart, Françoise; Vasseur, Jean-Jacques; Imbert, Isabelle; Canard, Bruno; Coutard, Bruno; Decroly, Etienne",J. virol,,439

Using a transposon-mediated gene-activation screen in human cells, we identify that the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) has antiviral activity against EBOV. CIITA induces resistance by activating expression of the p41 isoform of invariant chain CD74, which inhibits viral entry by blocking cathepsin-mediated processing of the Ebola glycoprotein. We further show that CD74 p41 can block the endosomal entry pathway of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. These data therefore implicate CIITA and CD74 in host defense against a range of viruses, and they identify an additional function of these proteins beyond their canonical roles in antigen presentation.","Bruchez, Anna; Sha, Ky; Johnson, Joshua; Chen, Li; Stefani, Caroline; McConnell, Hannah; Gaucherand, Lea; Prins, Rachel; Matreyek, Kenneth A; Hume, Adam J; Mühlberger, Elke; Schmidt, Emmett V; Olinger, Gene G; Stuart, Lynda M; Lacy-Hulbert, Adam",Science,,439

Other non-pharmaceutical interventions for suppressing transmission include active case finding, contact tracing, quarantine, immunity or health certification, and a wide range of personal protective measures. Here we investigate the potential effectiveness of these alternative approaches to suppression. We introduce a conceptual framework represented by two mathematical models that differ in strategy.

Classrooms and common spaces have to be thought again, for a new ""in-presence"" life, after the recent worldwide emergency following the spring 2020 pandemic diffusion of COVID-19. In this paper, starting from a real case study, and thus the architectural and technological refurbishment of an Italian University building (Campobasso, South Italy, cold climate), with the aims of improving the classrooms' quality and safety, a comprehensive approach for the retrofit design is proposed. By taking into account the necessary come back to classrooms starting, hopefully, from the next months (Autumn 2020), experimental studies (monitoring and investigations of the current energy performances) are followed by the coupling of different numerical methods of investigations, and thus building performance simulations, under transient conditions of heat transfer, and computational fluid dynamics studies, to evidence criticalities and potentialities to designers involved in the re-thinking of indoor spaces hosting multiple persons, with quite high occupancy patterns. Both energy impacts, in terms of monthly and annual increase of energy demands due to higher mechanical ventilation, and indoor distribution of microclimatic parameters (i.e., temperature, airspeed, age of air) are here investigated, by proposing new scenarios and evidencing the usefulness of HVAC systems, equipment (e.g., sensible heat recovery, without flows' contamination) and suitability of some strategies for the air distribution systems (ceiling squared and linear slot diffusers) compared to traditional ones.","Ascione, Fabrizio; De Masi, Rosa Francesca; Mastellone, Margherita; Vanoli, Giuseppe Peter",Energy Build,,439

While all people are susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the nature and severity of the disease vary significantly among individuals and populations. Importantly, reported disease burdens and case fatality rates differ considerably from country to country. There are, however, still uncertainties about the severity of the disease among individuals or the reason behind a more severe disease in some cases. There is a strong possibility that the severity of this disease depends on a complicated interaction between the host, virus, and environment, which leads to different clinical outcomes.

Design: Research Study. Setting: Clinical IVF treatment center. Patients: IVF patients treated at the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. Interventions: Oocytes (GV, MII) and embryos (1 cell (1C); blastocyst (BL)) were donated to research at disposition by IVF patients. Follicular cells (cumulus (CC); granulosa (GC)) were collected from women undergoing egg retrieval after ovarian stimulation without an ovulatory trigger for IVM/IVF treatment cycles. Main Outcome Measures: The presence or absence of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL mRNA using RT-qPCR and protein using capillary Western blotting in human oocytes, embryos and ovarian follicular cells. Result s: RT- q-PCR analysis revealed high abundance of ACE2 gene transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was only present in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL embryos, but other ACE2 protein variants were observed in all the samples. TMPRSS2 protein was present in all samples while mRNA was observed only at the blastocyst stage. All the samples were positive for CD147 and CTSL mRNA expression. However, cumulus and granulosa cells were the only samples that showed co-expression of both CD147 and CTSL proteins in low abundance. Conclusions: Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases combination (ACE2/TMPRSS2 or CD147/CTSL) in high abundance. Co-expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts demonstrate that these gametes and embryos have the cellular machinery required and thus are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection if exposed to the virus. However, we do not yet know if infection occurs in vivo, or in vitro in an ART setting.","Rajput, Sandeep K; Logsdon, Deirdre M; Kile, Becca; Engelhorn, Heidi J; Goheen, Ben; Khan, Shaihla; Swain, Jason; McCormick, Sue; Schoolcraft, William B; Yuan, Ye; Krisher, Rebecca L",,,439

METHODS: This study was conducted in an emergency department and included consecutively enrolled laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients. Lung sonography findings were described in all the included patients and analysed with respect to the clinical severity of the patients. RESULTS: 106 patients were included in the study. Common sonographic findings in COVID-19 patients were pleural line irregularity or shredding (70% of patients), followed by B - profile (59%), pleural line thickening (33%), occasional B - lines (26%), sub-pleural consolidations (35%), deep consolidations (6%), spared areas (13%), confluent B - lines or waterfall sign (14%) and pleural effusion (9%). These findings tended to be present more bilaterally and in lower lung zones. Sonographic characteristics like bilateral lung involvement, B - profile, spared areas and confluent B - lines or waterfall sign were significantly associated (p < 0.01) with clinical severity (more frequent with increasing disease severity). CONCLUSION: The lung sonographic findings of COVID-19 were found more bilaterally and in lower lung zones, and specific findings like B - profile, pleural thickening, spared areas and confluent B - lines or waterfall sign were associated with severe COVID-19.","Sahu, Ankit Kumar; Mathew, Roshan; Bhoi, Sanjeev; Sinha, Tej Prakash; Nayer, Jamshed; Aggarwal, Praveen",Am. j. emerg. med,,439

Grounded on the complex networks approach, and considering that the mobility network serves as a proxy for the SARS-CoV-2 spreading, the nodes and edges represent cities and flows, respectively. Network centrality measures such as strength and degree are ranked and compared to the list of cities, ordered according to the day that they confirmed the first case of COVID-19. The strength measure captures the cities with a higher vulnerability of receiving new cases. Besides, it follows the interiorization process of SARS-CoV-2 in the São Paulo State when the network flows are above specific thresholds. Some countryside cities such as Feira de Santana (Bahia State), Ribeirão Preto (São Paulo State), and Caruaru (Pernambuco State) have strength comparable to states' capitals.

Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals' health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages.

The fear of catching COVID-19 rendered a lot of caregivers reluctant to give their child the obligatory vaccines. AIM: The goal of our research was to assess awareness, commitment and adherence to compulsory immunization schedule during COVID-19 lockdown in Egypt. MATERIALS (SUBJECTS) AND METHODS: An electronic questionnaire (Google form) was designed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on adherence to compulsory vaccinations. Our target candidates were parents of infants in an age group from birth to 2 years old, that is, births from June 2018 to June 2020. RESULTS: In our study, 96.3% of children received Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine on time. About 32.8% did not receive the obligatory booster dose vaccines at 18 months. Among the infants of &gt;1 year, 95.3% received the obligatory vaccination in time at 2, 4, and 6 months of age compared to only 73.3% of those ≤1 year (P = 0.001). About 23% of those who missed the vaccine preferred to postpone until outbreak ended while, 27.2% missed vaccination due to fear of catching COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the adherence to compulsory vaccines in Egypt. Therefore, it is mandatory to organize a plan to catch up the missed vaccines.","Mahfouz, N.

433509,Reality of Life and Environmental Changes after COVID-19 Pandemic in India,2021,"This article aims to review the methods used for the assessment of fracture risk and the use of osteoporosis medications for fracture prevention in the population with CKD, and highlights the difficulties faced by clinicians in the management of these patients and the latest recommendations and guidelines. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and osteoporosis often co-exist in older adults, and they present a major healthcare challenge. CKD mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) occurs as renal function declines and this syndrome affects most patients in CKD stages 4 and 5. The biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD, renal bone disease and risk factors associated with age-related bone loss and osteoporosis lead to a cumulative effect on fracture risk and mortality. There is a need for routine evaluation of fracture risk and fracture prevention in this population. Measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) and the use of the FRAX tool have predictive value for incident fractures in the general population and in CKD. This enables physicians to identify CKD patients most at risk of sustaining a fragility fracture and allows a more targeted approach to fracture prevention. Data analysis from the pivotal trials of therapeutic agents used in osteoporosis show that these drugs can be considered in mild and moderate CKD (stages 1-3 CKD). Off-label drug use in patients with CKD-MBD and more severe renal impairment (CKD stages 4 and 5) could offer significant benefits to sub-groups of patients when carefully tailored to each individual's bone turnover and calcium and phosphate balance. However, this requires a selective approach and treatment decisions based on inference from pathophysiology while we await further trials. Guidelines advocate the correction and/or reduction of the biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD before initiation of treatment with osteoporosis drugs and close monitoring during treatment.","Hampson, Geeta; Elder, Grahame J; Cohen-Solal, Martine; Abrahamsen, Bo",Endocrine,,439
433769,Risk of acquiring perioperative COVID-19 during the initial pandemic peak: a retrospective cohort study,2021,"Gold complexes have a long tradition in medicine and for many examples antirheumatic, anticancer or anti-infective effects have been confirmed. Herein, we evaluated the lead compound Auranofin and five selected gold organometallics as inhibitors of two relevant drug targets of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). The gold metallodrugs were effective inhibitors of the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor and might thus interfere with the viral entry process. The gold metallodrugs were also efficient inhibitors of the papain-like protease (PLpro) of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, which is a key enzyme in the viral replication. Regarding PLpro from SARS-CoV-2, the here reported inhibitors are among the very first experimentally confirmed examples with activity against this target enzyme. Importantly, the activity of the complexes against both PLpro enzymes correlated with the ability of the inhibitors to remove zinc ions from the labile zinc center of the enzyme. Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest further evaluation of gold complexes as SARS-CoV antiviral drugs.","Gil-Moles, Maria; Basu, Uttara; Büssing, Rolf; Hoffmeister, Henrik; Türck, Sebastian; Varchmin, Agnieszka; Ott, Ingo",Chemistry,,439
433924,Critical complications of COVID-19: A descriptive meta-analysis study,2020,"Exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to respiratory disorders, yet knowledge of the molecular mechanism is limited. Here, PM2.5 was monitored and collected in central China, and its cytotoxicity mechanism on human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) was investigated. With the average concentration of 109â¯±â¯69â¯µg/m3, PM2.5 was rich in heavy metals and organic pollutants. After exposure to PM2.5, the viability of BEAS-2B cells decreased, where 510 dysregulated genes were predicted to induce necroptosis via inhibiting ATP synthesis through the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway. Cellular experiments demonstrated that the content of ATP was downregulated, while the expression of RIP3, a necroptosis indicator, was upregulated. Besides, four enzymes in charge of ATP synthesis were downregulated, including ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, while two genes of RELA and CAPN1 responsible for necroptosis were upregulated. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine was applied as an enhancer for ATP synthesis, which reversed the downregulation of ATP5F, NDUF, and COX7A, and consequently alleviated the elevation of RELA, CAPN1, and RIP3. In conclusion, PM2.5 exposure downregulates ATP5F, NDUF, COX7A, and UQCR, and that inhibits ATP synthesis via the oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathway, which subsequently upregulates RELA and CAPN1 and ultimately leads to necroptosis of BEAS-2B cells.","Duan, Shuyin; Zhang, Meihua; Sun, Yaqiong; Fang, Zhenya; Wang, Hefeng; Li, Shuxian; Peng, Yanze; Li, Juan; Li, Junxia; Tian, Jiaqi; Yin, Haoyu; Yao, Sanqiao; Zhang, Lin",J Hazard Mater,,439

The high infection risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in hospitals is particularly problematic for recently delivered mothers and currently pregnant women who require professional antenatal care. Online antenatal care would be a preferable alternative for these women since it can provide pregnancy-related information and remote clinic consultations. In addition, online antenatal care may help to provide relatively economical medical services and diminish health care inequality due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness, especially in developing countries or regions. However, some pregnant women will doubt the reliability of such online information. Therefore, it is important to ensure the quality and safety of online services and establish a stable, mutual trust between the pregnant women, the obstetric care providers and the technology vis-a-vis the online programs.

Anammox bacteria convert ammonium (NH4+) to dinitrogen gas (N2) using intracellular electron acceptors such as nitrite (NO2-) or nitric oxide (NO). However, it is still unknown whether anammox bacteria have extracellular electron transfer (EET) capability with transfer of electrons to insoluble extracellular electron acceptors. Here we show that freshwater and marine anammox bacteria couple the oxidation of NH4+ with transfer of electrons to insoluble extracellular electron acceptors such as graphene oxide or electrodes in microbial electrolysis cells. 15N-labeling experiments revealed that NH4+ was oxidized to N2 via hydroxylamine (NH2OH) as intermediate, and comparative transcriptomics analysis revealed an alternative pathway for NH4+ oxidation with electrode as electron acceptor. Complete NH4+ oxidation to N2 without accumulation of NO2- and NO3- was achieved in EET-dependent anammox. These findings are promising in the context of implementing EET-dependent anammox process for energy-efficient treatment of nitrogen.","Shaw, Dario R; Ali, Muhammad; Katuri, Krishna P; Gralnick, Jeffrey A; Reimann, Joachim; Mesman, Rob; van Niftrik, Laura; Jetten, Mike S M; Saikaly, Pascal E",Nat Commun,,439

PURPOSE: To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram for predicting the fatal outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study consisted of a training dataset (n = 66) and a validation dataset (n = 30) with COVID-19 from January 2020 to March 2020. A radiomics signature was generated using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model. A radiomics score (Rad-score) was developed from the training cohort. The radiomics model, clinical model, and integrated model were built to assess the association between radiomics signature/clinical characteristics and the mortality of COVID-19 cases. The radiomics signature combined with the Rad-score and the independent clinical factors and radiomics nomogram were constructed. RESULTS: Seven stable radiomics features associated with the mortality of COVID-19 were finally selected. A radiomics nomogram was based on a combined model consisting of the radiomics signature and the clinical risk factors indicating optimal predictive performance for the fatal outcome of patients with COVID-19 with a C-index of 0.912 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.867-0.957) in the training dataset and 0.907 (95% CI 0.849-0.966) in the validation dataset. The calibration curves indicated optimal consistency between the prediction and the observation in both training and validation cohorts. CONCLUSION: The CT-based radiomics nomogram indicated favorable predictive efficacy for the overall survival risk of patients with COVID-19, which could help clinicians intensively follow up high-risk patients and make timely diagnoses.","Ke, Zan; Li, Liang; Wang, Li; Liu, Huan; Lu, Xuefang; Zeng, Feifei; Zha, Yunfei",Acta Radiol,,439

We have previously shown that face-mask sampling (FMS) can detect exhaled tubercle bacilli and have adapted its use to quantify exhaled SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients admitted to hospital with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: Between May and December 2020, we took two concomitant FMS and nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) over two days, starting within 24 h of a routine virus positive NPS in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, UK. Participants were asked to wear a modified duckbilled facemask for 30 min, followed by a nasopharyngeal swab. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, as well as International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) mortality and deterioration scores were obtained. Exposed masks were processed by removal, dissolution and analysis of sampling matrix strips fixed within the mask by RT-qPCR. Viral genome copy numbers were determined and results classified as Negative; Low: &#8804;999 copies; Medium: 1000-99,999 copies and High &#8805; 100,000 copies per strip for FMS or per 100â¯µl for NPS. RESULTS: 102 FMS and NPS were collected from 66 routinely positive patients; median age: 61 (IQR 49 - 77), of which FMS was positive in 38% of individuals and concomitant NPS was positive in 50%. Positive FMS viral loads varied over five orders of magnitude (<10-3.3 x 106 genome copies/strip); 21 (32%) patients were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. High FMS viral load was associated with respiratory symptoms at time of sampling and shorter interval between sampling and symptom onset (FMS High: median (IQR) 2 days (2-3) vs FMS Negative: 7 days (7-10), pâ¯=â¯0.002). On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher FMS viral loads were associated with higher ISARIC mortality (Medium FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 15.7, 95% CI 3.7-27.7, pâ¯=â¯0.01) and deterioration scores (High FMS vs Negative FMS gave an adjusted coefficient of 37.6, 95% CI 14.0 to 61.3, pâ¯=â¯0.002), while NPS viral loads showed no significant association. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a simple and effective method for detecting and quantifying exhaled SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Higher FMS viral loads were more likely to be associated with developing severe disease compared to NPS viral loads. Similar to NPS, FMS viral load was highest in early disease and in those with active respiratory symptoms, highlighting the potential role of FMS in understanding infectivity.","Williams, Caroline M; Pan, Daniel; Decker, Jonathan; Wisniewska, Anika; Fletcher, Eve; Sze, Shirley; Assadi, Sara; Haigh, Richard; Abdulwhhab, Mohamad; Bird, Paul; Holmes, Christopher W; Al-Taie, Alaa; Saleem, Baber; Pan, Jingzhe; Garton, Natalie J; Pareek, Manish; Barer, Michael R",J Infect,,439

Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. We introduce a cognitive contagion model that combines a network science approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents, affecting what they believe, and what they pass on. We show that the model, even with a very discrete and simplistic belief function to capture cognitive dissonance, both adds expressive power over existing disease-based contagion models, and qualitatively demonstrates the appropriate belief update phenomena at the individual level. Moreover, we situate our cognitive contagion model in a larger public opinion diffusion model, which attempts to capture the role of institutions or media sources in belief diffusion - something that is often left out. We conduct an analysis of the POD model with our simple cognitive dissonance-sensitive update function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We demonstrate that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID misinformation public opinion polls. The overall model sets up a preliminary framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of misinformation and""alternative facts.""","Rabb, Nicholas; Cowen, Lenore; Ruiter, Jan P. de; Scheutz, Matthias",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02828v1.pdf,439

447229,Assessing the impact of inflammatory markers and CT severity score on disease severity of COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU at a tertiary hospital,2021,"The Coronavirus Diseases-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic leads many researchers around the world to study the SARS-CoV-s2 infection and pathology to find a treatment for it. This generates a massive production of papers including pre-clinical, clinical and revisions but till now no specific treatment were identified. Meanwhile, like other coronavirus infections, COVID-19 leads to the cytokine storm syndrome resulting in hyperinflammation, exacerbated immune response and multiple organ dysfunctions indicating that drugs that modulate this response, as glucocorticoids could be a treatment option. However glucocorticoids have several side effects or usage limitations. In this sense a drug with anti-inflammatory effects and capable to reduce inflammation but with less after-effects could be a powerful tool to combat COVID-19. Thus the Ac2-26 Mimetic Peptide of Annexin A1 emerges as a possible therapy. The peptide has many anti-inflammatory effects described including the reduction of interleukin (IL)-6, one of the main mediators of cytokine storm syndrome. Therefore the hypothesis to use the Ac2-26 peptide to treat severe COVID-19 will be highlighted in this paper.","Bonavita, Andre Gustavo",Med Hypotheses,,439

The study included both a cross-sectional observational study and a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial. 140 people diagnosed with a 35-49 mm diameter AAA, 56 (40%) of whom had concurrent PAD, and 25 healthy controls were prospectively recruited. QOL was assessed with the short form (SF) 36. Findings in participants that were diagnosed with both AAA and PAD were compared separately with those of participants that had a diagnosis of AAA alone or who had neither AAA nor PAD diagnosed (healthy controls). All participants diagnosed with an AAA were then randomly allocated to 145 mg of fenofibrate per day or identical placebo. Outcomes were assessed by changes in the domains of the SF-36 and ankle brachial pressure Index (ABPI) from randomization to 24 weeks. Data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Participants diagnosed with both AAA and PAD had significantly worse QOL than participants diagnosed with AAA alone or healthy controls. Fenofibrate did not significantly alter SF-36 scores or ABPI over 24 weeks. Fenofibrate does not improve QOL of people diagnosed with small AAA, irrespective of whether they have concurrent PAD.Trial registration: ACTN12613001039774 Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.","Golledge, Jonathan; Pinchbeck, Jenna; Rowbotham, Sophie E; Yip, Lisan; Jenkins, Jason S; Quigley, Frank; Moxon, Joseph V",Sci Rep,,439

447879,Each person is a world in COVID-19,2021,"ObjectivesTo investigate how incidence trends of anxiety and depressive disorders have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. DesignPopulation-based cohort study. SettingObservational cohort study from 2018 to 2021 using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database in Catalonia, Spain. Participants4,255,847 individuals aged 18 or older in SIDIAP on 1 March, 2018 with no prior history of anxiety and depressive disorders. Primary and secondary outcomes measuresIncidence of anxiety and depressive disorders prior to COVID-19 (March, 2018 to February, 2020), during the COVID-19 lockdown (March to June, 2020) and post-lockdown periods (from July, 2020 to March, 2021) were calculated. Forecasted rates over COVID-19 periods were estimated using negative binomial regression models based on previous data. The percentage reduction was estimated by comparing forecasted versus observed events, overall and by age, sex and socioeconomic status. ResultsThe incidence rates per 100,000 person-months of anxiety and depressive disorders were 171.0 (95%CI: 170.2-171.8) and 46.6 (46.2-47.0), respectively, during the pre-lockdown period. We observed an increase of 39.7% (95%PI: 26.5 to 53.3) in incident anxiety diagnoses compared to the expected in March, 2020, followed by a reduction of 16.9% (8.6 to 24.5) during the post-lockdown periods. A reduction of incident depressive disorders occurred during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods (46.6% [38.9 to 53.1] and 23.2% [12.0 to 32.7], respectively). Reductions were higher among adults aged 18 to 34 and individuals living in most deprived areas. ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia was associated with an initial increase in anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care, but a reduction in cases as the pandemic continued. Diagnoses of depressive disorders were lower than expected throughout the pandemic. Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABS- While previous self-reported studies have provided evidence of increased mental health burden during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of studies observed that fewer diagnoses were made in primary care settings than would have been expected during the initial stages of the pandemic. - Population data that examine the impact of COVID-19 on temporal trends of incident cases of common mental health disorders are lacking in Catalonia, Spain. What this study adds- This study has quantified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on trends of incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders among adults living in Catalonia. - Reductions in incident cases of anxiety and depressive disorders were higher for young adults and people living in most deprived areas. - Incident diagnoses of anxiety and depressive disorders have not been fully recovered to what would have been expected.","Raventos, Berta; Pistillo, Andrea; Reyes, Carlen; Fernandez-Bertolin, Sergio; Aragon, Maria; Berenguera, Anna; Jacques-Avino, Constanza; Medina-Perucha, Laura; Burn, Edward; Duarte-Salles, Talita",,,439

It assessed the difference in performance between (i) attending one instructor-led training session in donning and doffing PPE one month prior to assessment, and (ii) watching training videos over the month. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial pilot study divided 21 medical students and junior doctors into 2 groups. Control group participants attended one instructor-led training session. Video group participants watched training videos demonstrating the same procedures, which they could freely watch again at home. After one month, a doctor performed a blind evaluation of performance using checklists. RESULTS: 19 participants were assessed after one month. The mean donning score was 84.8/100 for the instructor-led group and 88/100 for the video group; mean effect size 3,2 (95%CI: -7,5 to 9,5). The mean doffing score was 79.1/100 for the instructor group and 73.9/100 for the video group; mean effect size 5,2 (95%CI: -7,6 to 18). CONCLUSION: Our study found no significant difference in donning and doffing score between instructor-led and video lessons.

Little is known about the longitudinal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Blood samples (n=173) were collected from 30 COVID-19 patients over a 3-month period after symptom onset and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs, using the lentiviral pseudotype assay, coincident with the levels of IgG and proinflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-specific NAb titers were low for the first 7-10 d after symptom onset and increased after 2-3 weeks. The median peak time for NAbs was 33 d (IQR 24-59 d) after symptom onset. NAb titers in 93·3% (28/30) of the patients declined gradually over the 3-month study period, with a median decrease of 34·8% (IQR 19·6-42·4%). NAb titers increased over time in parallel with the rise in IgG antibody levels, correlating well at week 3 (r = 0·41, p & 0·05). The NAb titers also demonstrated a significant positive correlation with levels of plasma proinflammatory cytokines, including SCF, TRAIL, and M-CSF. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide useful information regarding dynamic changes in NAbs in COVID-19 patients during the acute and convalescent phases.","Wang, Kai; Long, Quan-Xin; Deng, Hai-Jun; Hu, Jie; Gao, Qing-Zhu; Zhang, Gui-Ji; He, Chang-Long; Huang, Lu-Yi; Hu, Jie-Li; Chen, Juan; Tang, Ni; Huang, Ai-Long",Clin. infect. dis,,439
454542,Clinically applicable approach for predicting mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19,2020,"In Yangtze River Delta white goat, hypermethylation of CMTM3 leads to a decreased expression level in high quality brush hair. However, the regulation of CMTM3 expression and its function in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the regulation of CMTM3 expression, function, and molecular mechanism in HFSCs. The re-expression of CMTM3 significantly suppressed the proliferation of HFSCs by inducing G1 cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, the downregulation of CMTM3 promoted HFSC proliferation. Treatment with sh_CMTM3 and incubation in a DHT culture medium had the most significant growth-promoting effect. It was hypothesized that transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in samples would enable the identification of unique protein-coding and non-coding genes that may help uncover the role of CMTM3. Multiple genes and pathways were involved in this process, including 168 common DEGs, such as CXCL8 and E-selectin, which is reportedly involved in multiple regulatory pathways. These results indicated that CMTM3 can function as HFSCs through the induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest and promoted apoptosis by mediating crosstalk between several pathways and transcription factors.

457376,Use of a Novel Negative-Pressure Tent During Bedside Tracheostomy in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"This paper studies the interplay between social distancing and the spread of the COVID-19 disease-a global pandemic that has affected most of the world's population. Our goals are to (1) to observe the correlation between the strictness of social distancing policies and the spread of disease and (2) to determine the optimal adoption level of social distancing policies. The earliest instances of the virus were found in China, and the virus has reached the United States with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Although it is impossible to stop it, it is possible to slow down its spread to reduce its impact on the society and economy. Governments around the world have deployed various policies to reduce the virus spread in response to the pandemic. To assess the effectiveness of these policies, the system's dynamics of the society needs to be analyzed, which is generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with continuous feedback loops. Because of the challenges with the other methods, we chose agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise in assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis by applying policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, emergency hospitalization, and travel prevention to reduce infection rates. Based on modeling studies conducted in Imperial College, increasing levels of interventions could slow the spread of disease and infection. We ran the model with six different percentages of social distancing while keeping the other parameters constant. The results show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, in turn decreasing the spread of disease and infection rates when implemented at higher levels. We also validated these results by using the behavior space tool with ten experiments with varying social distancing levels. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels leads to a significant reduction in infection spread and the number of deaths. Both experiments show that infection rates are reduced drastically when social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","Daghriri, Talal; Ozmen, Ozlem",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,439

To date, our understanding of the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and host innate immunity is still limited. Previous studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 12 (NSP12) was able to suppress interferon-ß (IFN-ß) activation in IFN-ß promoter luciferase reporter assays, which provided insights into the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In this study, we demonstrated that IFN-ß promoter-mediated luciferase activity was reduced during coexpression of NSP12. However, we could show NSP12 did not affect IRF3 or NF-&#954;B activation. Moreover, IFN-ß production induced by Sendai virus (SeV) infection or other stimulus was not affected by NSP12 at mRNA or protein level. Additionally, the type I IFN signaling pathway was not affected by NSP12, as demonstrated by the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Further experiments revealed that different experiment systems, including protein tags and plasmid backbones, could affect the readouts of IFN-ß promoter luciferase assays. In conclusion, unlike as previously reported, our study showed SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein is not an IFN-ß antagonist. It also rings the alarm on the general usage of luciferase reporter assays in studying SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Previous studies investigated the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and interferon signaling and proposed that several SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, including NSP12, could suppress IFN-ß activation. However, most of these results were generated from IFN-ß promoter luciferase reporter assay and have not been validated functionally. In our study, we found that, although NSP12 could suppress IFN-ß promoter luciferase activity, it showed no inhibitory effect on IFN-ß production or its downstream signaling. Further study revealed that contradictory results could be generated from different experiment systems. On one hand, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 could not suppress IFN-ß signaling. On the other hand, our study suggests that caution needs to be taken with the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2-related luciferase assays.","Li, Aixin; Zhao, Kaitao; Zhang, Bei; Hua, Rong; Fang, Yujie; Jiang, Wuhui; Zhang, Jing; Hui, Lixia; Zheng, Yingcheng; Li, Yan; Zhu, Chengliang; Wang, Pei-Hui; Peng, Ke; Xia, Yuchen",J Virol,,439

Our results suggest interventions started earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve and interventions started later flatten the epidemic curve. We noted that, while social distancing interventions were in place, most new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths were averted, even with modest reductions in contact among adults.

464039,Association between antithrombin and mortality in patients with COVID-19. A possible link with obesity,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has rapidly become epidemic in Italy and other European countries. The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic presentations to acute respiratory failure. At the present time the absolute number of severe cases requiring ventilator support is reaching or even surpassing the intensive care unit bed capacity in the most affected regions and countries. OBJECTIVES: To narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and frontline opinions and to provide balanced answers to pressing clinical questions. SOURCES: Inductive PubMed search for publications relevant to the topic. CONTENT: The available literature and the authors' frontline-based opinion are summarized in brief narrative answers to selected clinical questions, with a conclusive statement provided for each answer. IMPLICATIONS: Many off-label antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs are currently being administered to patients with COVID-19. Physicians must be aware that, as they are not supported by high-level evidence, these treatments may often be ethically justifiable only in those worsening patients unlikely to improve only with supportive care, and who cannot be enrolled onto randomized clinical trials. Access to well-designed randomized controlled trials should be expanded as much as possible because it is the most secure way to change for the better our approach to COVID-19 patients.","Bassetti, M; Giacobbe, D R; Aliberti, S; Barisione, E; Centanni, S; De Rosa, F G; Di Marco, F; Gori, A; Granata, G; Mikulska, M; Petrosillo, N; Richeldi, L; Santus, P; Tascini, C; Vena, A; Viale, P; Blasi, F",Clin Microbiol Infect,,439

464902,Clinical presentation and outcomes of hospitalized adults with COVID-19: A systematic review,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had significant negative economic ramifications on dermatologic care delivery, including curtailing live on-site physician-pharmaceutical-representative interactions (PPRI). OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS: Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%&ndash;23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS: Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION: PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists&rsquo; ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

However, in the case of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscular dystrophy, and other degenerative conditions, the natural repair process is impaired. Repair of injury to the cell membrane is an important aspect of physiology. Inadequate membrane repair function is implicated in the pathophysiology of many human disorders. Recent studies show that Mitsugumin 53 (MG53), a TRIM family protein, plays a key role in repairing cell membrane damage and facilitating tissue regeneration. Clarifying the role of MG53 and its molecular mechanism are important for the application of MG53 in regenerative medicine. In this review, we analyze current research dissecting MG53's function in cell membrane repair and tissue regeneration, and highlight the development of recombinant human MG53 protein as a potential therapeutic agent to repair multiple-organ injuries.","Li, Zhongguang; Wang, Liyang; Yue, Huimin; Whitson, Bryan A; Haggard, Erin; Xu, Xuehong; Ma, Jianjie",,,439

We aimed to identify the risk factors for in-hospital fatal outcome and severe pneumonia of this disease. This is a retrospective, multicentre study, which included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 with definite outcomes (died or discharged) hospitalized between 1 January and 4 March 2020 in Wuhan. Of all 665 patients included, 70 died and 595 discharged (including 333 mild and 262 severe cases). Underlying comorbidity was more commonly observed among deaths (72.9%) than mild (26.4%) and severe (61.5%) survivors, with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular as dominant diseases. Fever and cough were the primary clinical magnifications. Older age (&#8805;65 years) (OR = 3.174, 95% CI = 1.356-7.755), diabetes (OR = 2.540, 95% CI = 0.995-6.377), dyspnoea (OR = 7.478, 95% CI = 3.031-19.528), respiratory failure (OR = 10.528, 95% CI = 4.484-25.829), acute cardiac injury (OR = 25.103, 95% CI = 9.057-76.590) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR = 7.308, 95% CI = 1.501-46.348) were associated with in-hospital fatal outcome. In addition, older age (OR = 2.149, 95% CI = 1.424-3.248), diabetes (OR = 3.951, 95% CI = 2.077-7.788), cardiovascular disease (OR = 3.414, 95% CI = 1.432-8.799), nervous system disease (OR = 4.125, 95% CI = 1.252-18.681), dyspnoea (OR = 31.944, 95% CI = 18.877-92.741), achieving highest in-hospital temperature of >39.0°C (OR = 37.450, 95% CI = 7.402-683.403) and longer onset of illness to diagnosis (&#8805;9 days) were statistically associated with higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. In conclusion, the potential risk factors forolder age, diabetes, dyspnoea, respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.","Liu, Mingyu; Han, Shuolong; Liao, Qiaohong; Chang, Liping; Tan, Yunzhe; Jia, Pingping; Yang, Libo; Cai, Hongbin; Feng, Shaolun; Chen, Can; Zhang, Shi; Jia, Zhenhua; Yi, Jian",Transbound. emerg. dis.

A case is described of a COVID-19 patient presenting with an isolated thrombus in the right ventricle. Case presentation: An 80-years-old Caucasian male was admitted in an intensive care unit (ICU) for COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient showed signs of hemodynamic instability, elevated cardiac troponin I and altered coagulation. On further assessment, a thrombotic mass near the apex of the right ventricle was detected. Moreover, the apex and the anteroseptal wall of the right ventricle appeared akinetic. Following the administration of a therapeutic dose of unfractionated heparin over a forty-eight hour period, re-evaluation of the right chambers showed that the thrombotic mass had resolved entirely. Conclusion: COVID-19 patients could constitute a population at risk of RiHTh. Routine use of echocardiography and a multidisciplinary approach can improve the management of this condition.","Merlo, Enrico; Grutta, Giuseppe; Tiberio, Ivo; Martelli, Gabriele",J Crit Care Med (Targu Mures),,439

469357,"Severe obesity, increasing age and male sex are independently associated with worse in-hospital outcomes, and higher in-hospital mortality, in a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York",2020,"The novel coronavirus infection has substantially increased over the last year causing a global pandemic. The rate of infection is persistently rising which has forced many authorities to promote stay at home orders. Individuals may experience an increase in anxiety due to spending longer durations at home, working from home, lacking direct social interactions with friends and family, monetary losses, and potentially getting infected from the virus. Increased anxiety for prolonged periods is linked to elevated blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes. To evaluate the influence of the pandemic on psychological health, we conducted a study on effects of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and stress management education (SME). To analyze the effects of the pandemic on mental health of our participants, we compared a group which was not affected by the pandemic (NPG) to a group that was affected by the pandemic (PG). The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of 8-weeks active intervention of MBSR and SME in NPG and PG on state-trait anxiety and decentering. 36 adults participated in the study. All the participants were randomly enrolled in either 8-weeks of MBSR or SME training. The NPG had 19 participants with 10 in MBSR and 9 in the SME group. The PG had 17 participants with 8 in MBSR and 9 in SME group. The MBSR group had weekly group sessions of ~2.5h on body scanning, meditation and light yoga while the SME group had concurrent sessions on nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Both the groups also did home practice daily for ~45 minutes. The NPG met in person for each of the 8 weeks, but the PG completed the last 4-weeks of the course online due to a stay-at-home mandate at the time in Michigan. All the participants filled out a questionnaire on state anxiety, trait anxiety and decentering before and after the 8-weeks. A ReANOVA was used to compare the differences across the 8 weeks, with condition (PG vs. NPG) as a between-subjects factor. The results showed that there was a significant increase in decentering in PG after the 8-weeks (treatment x condition and time x condition both p&lt;0.03). The SME participants (?5.6±1.5 a.u., p=0.007) and MBSR participants (?3.5±0.7 a.u., p=0.002) significantly improved their ability to decenter during the pandemic. State anxiety did not change across the 8-weeks of SME or MBSR in either the NPG or PG. Trait anxiety was reduced across the 8-week intervention groups (time p=0.043) with MBSR participants decreasing by (?3.4±2.8 a.u.) and SME participants decreasing by (?0.9±1.7 a.u.). In this small cohort of adults, the 8-week MBSR and SME interventions helped to reduce trait anxiety, and significantly improved the ability to decenter (disconnect from emotions) during the global pandemic. In addition, there was not an increase in state-anxiety during the pandemic, which may be at least partially due to active participation in MBSR and SME. These are encouraging results that indicate MBSR and SME can positively influence psychological health, and to help disconnect from emotions during an unprecedented global health crisis.","Vyas, Aditi Petushek Erich Morin Brigitte Durocher John",The FASEB Journal,,439

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. RESULTS: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.","Fang, Xinyu; Zhang, Jiaying; Teng, Chao; Zhao, Ke; Su, Kuan-Pin; Wang, Zhen; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Chen",J Affect Disord,,439
473129,Decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"Segmentation of pneumonia lesions from CT scans of COVID-19 patients is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up. Deep learning has a potential to automate this task but requires a large set of high-quality annotations that are difficult to collect. Learning from noisy training labels that are easier to obtain has a potential to alleviate this problem. To this end, we propose a novel noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the segmentation task. We first introduce a noise-robust Dice loss that is a generalization of Dice loss for segmentation and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) loss for robustness against noise, then propose a novel COVID-19 Pneumonia Lesion segmentation network (COPLE-Net) to better deal with the lesions with various scales and appearances. The noise-robust Dice loss and COPLE-Net are combined with an adaptive self-ensembling framework for training, where an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of a student model is used as a teacher model that is adaptively updated by suppressing the contribution of the student to EMA when the student has a large training loss. The student model is also adaptive by learning from the teacher only when the teacher outperforms the student. Experimental results showed that: (1) our noise-robust Dice loss outperforms existing noise-robust loss functions, (2) the proposed COPLE-Net achieves higher performance than state-of-the-art image segmentation networks, and (3) our framework with adaptive self-ensembling significantly outperforms a standard training process and surpasses other noise-robust training approaches in the scenario of learning from noisy labels for COVID-19 pneumonia lesion segmentation.","Wang, Guotai; Liu, Xinglong; Li, Chaoping; Xu, Zhiyong; Ruan, Jiugen; Zhu, Haifeng; Meng, Tao; Li, Kang; Huang, Ning; Zhang, Shaoting",IEEE Trans Med Imaging,,439

Children and adults show a different clinical course. The purpose of the current study is to comparatively analyze the clinical characteristics of 2019-nCoV infection in children and adults and to explore the possible causes for the discrepancies present. The medical records of 25 adults and 7 children confirmed cases of 2019-2019-nCoV acute respiratory diseases were reviewed retrospectively. All children were family clusters. The total adult patients were differentiated into the local residents of Wuhan, a history of travel to Wuhan and direct contact with people from Wuhan. The numbers were 14 (56%), 10 (40%), and 1 (4%), respectively. The median incubation period of children and adults was 5 days (ranged, 3-12 days) and 4 days (ranged, 2-12 days), respectively. Diarrhoea and/or vomiting (57.1%) were demic by World Health Organiza more common in children, whereas for adults it was myalgia or fatigue (52%). On admission, the percentage of children having pneumonia (5%, 71.4%) was roughly the same as adults (20%, 80%). A total of 20% of adults had leucopoenia, but leukocytosis was more frequently in children (28.6%, P=.014). A higher number of children had elevated creatine kinase isoenzyme (57.1% vs 4%, P=.004).

Currently, the search for antiviral compounds is relevant in connection with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Medicinal mushrooms contain biologically active compounds (polysaccharides, proteins, terpenes, melanins, etc.) that exhibit an antiviral effect. The authors present the work carried out at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology Vector in Russia, whose mission is to protect the population from biological threats. The research center possesses a collection of numerous pathogenic viruses, which allowed screening of water extracts, polysaccharides, and melanins from fruit bodies and fungal cultures. The results of investigations on different subtypes of influenza virus are presented, and special attention is paid to Inonotus obliquus (chaga mushroom). Compounds produced from this mushroom are characterized by the widest range of antiviral activity. Comparative data are presented on the antiviral activity of melanin from natural I. obliquus and submerged biomass of an effective strain isolated in culture against the pandemic strain of influenza virus A/California/07/09 (H1N1 pdm09).","Teplyakova, Tamara V; Ilyicheva, Tatyana N; Kosogova, Tatiana A; Wasser, Solomon P",Int J Med Mushrooms,,439

Nowadays, it is a great threat that claims uncountable lives worldwide. There is no specific chemotherapeutics developed yet to combat COVID-19. Therefore, scientists have been devoted in the quest of the medicine that can cure COVID- 19. OBJECTIVE: Existing antivirals such as ASC09/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir with or without umifenovir in combination with antimalarial chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been repurposed to fight the current coronavirus epidemic. But exact biochemical mechanisms of these drugs towards COVID-19 have not been discovered to date. METHOD: In-silico molecular docking can predict the mode of binding to sort out the existing chemotherapeutics having a potential affinity towards inhibition of the COVID-19 target. An attempt has been made in the present work to carry out docking analyses of 34 drugs including antivirals and antimalarials to explain explicitly the mode of interactions of these ligands towards the COVID-19protease target. RESULTS: 13 compounds having good binding affinity have been predicted towards protease binding inhibition of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our in silico docking results have been confirmed by current reports from clinical settings through the citation of suitable experimental in vitro data available in the published literature.","Nandi, Sisir; Kumar, Mohit; Saxena, Mridula; Saxena, Anil Kumar",,,439

This study assessed quality aspects of rapid expansion of a virtual urgent care (VUC) telehealth system and the effects of a secondary telephonic screening initiative during the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis was performed in a single health care network of VUC patients from March 1, 2020, through April 20, 2020. Researchers abstracted demographic data, comorbidities, VUC return visits, emergency department (ED) referrals and ED visits, dispositions, intubations, and deaths. The team also reviewed incomplete visits. For comparison, the study evaluated outcomes of non-admission dispositions from the ED: return visits with and without admission and deaths. We separately analyzed the effects of enhanced callback system targeting higher-risk patients with COVID-like illness during the last two weeks of the study period. RESULTS: A total of 18,278 unique adult patients completed 22,413 VUC visits. Separately, 718 patient-scheduled visits were incomplete; the majority were no-shows. The study found that 50.9% of all patients and 74.1% of patients aged 60 years or older had comorbidities. Of VUC visits, 6.8% had a subsequent VUC encounter within 72 hours; 1.8% had a subsequent ED visit. Of patients with enhanced follow-up, 4.3% were referred for ED evaluation. Mortality was 0.20% overall; 0.21% initially and 0.16% with enhanced follow-up (pâ¯=â¯0.59). Males and black patients were significantly overrepresented in decedents. CONCLUSION: Appropriately deployed VUC services can provide a pragmatic strategy to care for large numbers of patients.

The present study was aimed at investigating the experiences of fetishization of transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) people. Participants in the current study represent a sample of 142 TGNB volunteers from the community who answered the prompt: ""If you feel comfortable, could you describe your experience of being fetishized?"" Using thematic analysis, we developed three overarching themes relevant to the experiences of fetishization of TGNB participants: (1) context of fetishization; (2) negative experiences of fetishization; and (3) positive or ambiguous experiences of fetishization. The results demonstrated that, in most cases, fetishization was understood by TGNB people as a negative experience of sexual objectification, although some individuals experienced fetishization as a positive experience, perceiving the sexual desire of the other person or living it as a kink. Consistent with the integrated theory of dehumanization, the results demonstrated that both sexual objectification and minority stress contributed to participants' understanding of fetishization for TGNB individuals.

This study investigated the potential associations of obesity and diabetes with COVID-19 severe outcomes, assessed as ICU admittance. Medical history, demographic and patient characteristics of a retrospective cohort (1158 patients) hospitalized with COVID-19 were analysed at a single centre in Kuwait. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the associations between different variables and ICU admittance. Of 1158 hospitalized patients, 271 had diabetes, 236 had hypertension and 104 required admittance into the ICU. From patients with available measurements, 157 had body mass index (BMI) &#8805;25 kg/m2 . Univariate analysis showed that overweight, obesity class I and morbid obesity were associated with ICU admittance. Patients with diabetes were more likely to be admitted to the ICU. Two models for multivariate regression analysis assessed either BMI or diabetes on ICU outcomes. In the BMI model, class I and morbid obesities were associated with ICU admittance. In the diabetes model, diabetes was associated with increased ICU admittance, whereas hypertension had a protective effect on ICU admittance. In our cohort, overweight, obesity and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were associated with ICU admittance, increasing the risk of poor outcomes.","Al-Sabah, Salman; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Al-Youha, Sarah; Jamal, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman",Clin Obes,,439

483982,Insulin Treatment May Not Be Associated with Increased Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 and Concurrent Diabetes,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has caused global public health and economic crisis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is a critical component of the viral antigen presentation pathway and plays essential roles in conferring differential viral susceptibility and severity of diseases. However, the association between HLA gene polymorphisms and risk for COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated. We hypothesized that HLA genotypes might impact on the differences in morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 across countries. METHODS: We conducted in silico analyses and examined an association of HLA gene polymorphisms with prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 by using publicly available databases. RESULTS: We found that a possible association between HLA-A*02:01 and an increased risk for COVID-19. HLA-A*02:01 had a relatively lower capacity to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens compared with other frequent HLA class I molecules, HLA-A*11:01 or HLA-A*24:02. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that individuals with HLA-A*11:01 or HLA-A*24:02 genotypes may generate efficiently T-cell-mediated antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared with HLA-A*02:01. The differences in HLA genotypes may potentially alter the course of the disease and its transmission.","Tomita, Yusuke; Ikeda, Tokunori; Sato, Ryo; Sakagami, Takuro",Immun Inflamm Dis,,439

However, prior arts mainly follow the traditional recommendation strategies like collaborative filtering, which usually treat individual drugs as mutually independent, while the latent interactions among drugs, e.g., synergistic or antagonistic effect, have been largely ignored. To that end, in this paper, we target at developing a new paradigm for drug package recommendation with considering the interaction effect within drugs, in which the interaction effects could be affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we first design a pre-training method based on neural collaborative filtering to get the initial embedding of patients and drugs. Then, the drug interaction graph will be initialized based on medical records and domain knowledge. Along this line, we propose a new Drug Package Recommendation (DPR) framework with two variants, respectively DPR on Weighted Graph (DPR-WG) and DPR on Attributed Graph (DPR-AG) to solve the problem, in which each the interactions will be described as signed weights or attribute vectors. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are leveraged for the final graph induction task to embed the package. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPR framework compared with several competitive baseline methods, and further support the heuristic study for the drug package generation task with adequate performance.","Zheng, Zhi; Wang, Chao; Xu, Tong; Shen, Dazhong; Qin, Penggang; Huai, Baoxing; Liu, Tongzhu; Chen, Enhong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03577v1.pdf,439

Methods: All laboratory-confirmed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive COVID-19 patients who had been tested at three governmental hospitals in Saudi Arabia (two in Riyadh and one in Makkah) between March 8 and May 18, 2020 were included. Demographics, COVID-19 variables, clinical characteristics and healthcare utilization variables were extracted and combined, and a descriptive analysis was conducted. Symptomatic and asymptomatic (on presentation) patients' data were compared. Results: Eighty percent of the patients were males (81.4% of symptomatic and 73.2% of asymptomatic patients, P = 0.02). Moreover, 47.6% and 38.4% of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were aged 40-64 years, respectively. Fever, cough and breathing difficulties were frequent presenting symptoms. Overall, diabetes (16.4%), hypertension (11.7%), chronic respiratory disease (7.1%) were the most frequent comorbidities, with no differences between the two groups. Symptomatic patients had higher C-reactive protein levels (3.55 vs. 0.30 mg/L;P &lt; 0.0001) and lower total lymphocytes (1.41 vs. 1.70;P = 0.02). ICU admission and mortality were 12.1% and 4.1% in symptomatic, compared to 6.0% and 2.9% in asymptomatic patients, respectively. Conclusion: In the studied COVID-19 cohort, symptomatic patients tended to be older, had higher C-reactive protein and more lymphopenia with worse outcome than asymptomatic patients.

With multiple vaccines having now received regulatory approval, public health efforts to promote widespread vaccine dissemination are currently underway. There has been particular emphasis placed on vaccination of older populations, the age group in which COVID-19 infection has been most lethal. However, such widespread vaccination approaches have necessarily raised important questions related to potential interactions with underlying diseases and concomitant treatments among persons to be vaccinated. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition marked by reduced bone strength and an associated increased risk for fracture that generally requires sustained medical intervention(s). Osteoporosis is neither associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection nor by more pronounced disease severity following infection, such that individuals with osteoporosis need not be more highly prioritized for COVID-19 vaccination. Osteoporosis therapies do not interfere with the efficacy or side effect profiles of COVID-19 vaccines and should not be stopped or indefinitely delayed because of vaccination. Depending on the specific drug profile within an anti-osteoporosis medication category, minor adjustments to the timing of drug administration may be considered with respect to the patient's COVID-19 vaccination schedule.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pathologic changes of organ systems and the clinicopathologic basis for severe and fatal outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective autopsy study. SETTING: Single pathology department. PARTICIPANTS: 11 deceased patients with COVID-19 (10 of whom were selected at random for autopsy). MEASUREMENTS: Systematic macroscopic, histopathologic, and viral analysis (SARS-CoV-2 on real-time polymerase chain reaction assay), with correlation of pathologic and clinical features, including comorbidities, comedication, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 66 to 91 years (mean, 80.5 years; 8 men, 3 women). Ten of the 11 patients received prophylactic anticoagulant therapy; venous thromboembolism was not clinically suspected antemortem in any of the patients. Both lungs showed various stages of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), including edema, hyaline membranes, and proliferation of pneumocytes and fibroblasts. Thrombosis of small and mid-sized pulmonary arteries was found in various degrees in all 11 patients and was associated with infarction in 8 patients and bronchopneumonia in 6 patients. Kupffer cell proliferation was seen in all patients, and chronic hepatic congestion in 8 patients. Other changes in the liver included hepatic steatosis, portal fibrosis, lymphocytic infiltrates and ductular proliferation, lobular cholestasis, and acute liver cell necrosis, together with central vein thrombosis. Additional frequent findings included renal proximal tubular injury, focal pancreatitis, adrenocortical hyperplasia, and lymphocyte depletion of spleen and lymph nodes. Viral RNA was detectable in pharyngeal, bronchial, and colonic mucosa but not bile. LIMITATION: The sample was small. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 predominantly involves the lungs, causing DAD and leading to acute respiratory insufficiency. Death may be caused by the thrombosis observed in segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial vessels despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. Studies are needed to further understand the thrombotic complications of COVID-19, together with the roles for strict thrombosis prophylaxis, laboratory, and imaging studies and early anticoagulant therapy for suspected pulmonary arterial thrombosis or thromboembolism.

Keeping in mind the precautionary measures required to combat COVID-19 infection, the only promising option for training was by adopting an online learning method. This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of video-based training using online platforms for infection prevention and control (IPC) training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A quasi-experimental study, with only one experimental group comprising of HCWs, was undertaken to assess the effect of intervention which included video-assisted teaching-learning regarding IPC measures with a special focus on COVID-19 at a tertiary care Institute in North India. Online sessions were conducted on Do's and Don'ts, Hand Hygiene, donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE), cleaning and disinfection, and bio-medical waste (BMW) management with the help of pre-recorded videos which was pre-validated. The session was followed by online interaction with participants by a single resource person. Pre-test and post-test were conducted through google forms before commencement and at the end of the online session respectively. The data were analyzed in terms of descriptive frequencies and percentages of different domains to describe the pre- and post-test knowledge. Results A total of 576 participants were included in the study. There was a statistically significant gain in scores of all questions related to cleaning and disinfection;and BMW. No significant change was observed in knowledge regarding the sequence of doffing (p-value: 0.94). The result of pairwise comparisons pre-test and post-test scores showed that intervention through video-assisted teaching-learning resulted in improvement of knowledge which was found to be statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Video-assisted teaching-learning through virtual platforms effectively trained health personnel on infection prevention and control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Video-assisted training can successfully be handled by a single resource person to impart the knowledge and skill to the trainee. Virtual teaching and learning is a feasible and efficient method to deliver training to HCWs on infection control practices and this methodology may be adopted in the future for several other training in manpower crunch situations, similar restrictive circumstances as posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, R.; Mohanty, A.; Singh, V.; S, V.

487441,Maternal and Neonatal Outcomes in COVID-19 Infected Pregnancies: A Prospective Cohort Study,2020,"A prospective observational study was conducted for assessing the therapeutic efficacy of interferon (IFN)-&#945;2b in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first month after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak began in Cuba. From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba. Seven hundred sixty-one (93.4%) were treated with a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-&#945;2b (Heberon® Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. Fifty-three patients received the approved COVID protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and nondetectable virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction) was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.01). The case fatality rate (CFR) for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-&#945;2b the CFR was reduced to 0.92. Intensive care was required for 82 patients (10.1%), 42 (5.5%) had been treated with IFN. This report provides preliminary evidence for the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN-&#945;2b for COVID-19 and suggests that the use of Heberon Alpha R may contribute to complete recovery of patients.","Pereda, Ricardo; González, Daniel; Rivero, Hubert Blas; Rivero, Juan Carlos; Pérez, Albadio; López, Lissette Del Rosario; Mezquia, Natacha; Venegas, Rafael; Betancourt, Julio Roberto; Domínguez, Rodolfo Emilio",J Interferon Cytokine Res,,439

This paper attempts to assess the ability to use the potential of health tourism enterprises in counteracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic and to propose a sustainable transformation of the business model of the health tourism enterprise, taking into account the determinants of sustainable tourism and health crises. The author presents the results of research conducted in March 2021 among 19 managers of the largest spa enterprises in Poland. The managers’ experiences from the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic indicate that sanatoriums and other health tourism facilities, during periods of health and humanitarian crises, can successfully play a preventive and relieving role for healthcare facilities by implementing post-COVID treatment, conducting vaccinations, organizing isolators for people in quarantine, and even treating patients who do not have symptoms but require hospitalization. The transformation of the business model of these companies, in the form of a sustainable SusHT-CANVAS+ business model, is proposed and the mentioned critical activities are positioned in the model in the form of sustainable value. © 2021 by the author.

DNA was extracted using the Phenol chloroform organic extraction method and amplified using the PowerPlex® 21 system. Genetic profiles of the individuals were generated using the Genetic Analyzer 3500XL following the recommended protocol.Results: The studied population showed Observed Heterozygosity (Hobs) from 0.583 (TH01) to 0.90 (D6S1043) among all the studied loci. The discrimination power and exclusion power for all the studied loci were found to be 1 and 0.9999999988, respectively, with the maximum power of discrimination being found at Penta E locus.Conclusion: All the studied loci showed a high degree of matching probability and paternity index of 2.83x10-24 and 7.35x108 respectively; these are high levelstatistical values and indicate that these loci might play a very important role in the application of DNA reports in the courts of justice. The studied population showed a relatively closer genetic affinity with Newar, Kathmandu and Han Chinese populations compared with the South and West Indian populations. The outcomes of this study will enrich the STR database of the Indian population and this is the first global report on genetic diversity in the Meitei community of Manipur, India, at 20 autosomal STR genetic markers.","Leishangthem, Surendrajit; Kushwaha, K P S; Chauhan, Tanya; Kumawat, R K; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Shrivastava, Pankaj",Ann Hum Biol,,439
491589,Fasting Glucose Level Is a Predictor of Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 Independent of Diabetes History,2020,"AIMS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence and clinical manifestation of disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER) and isopropanol toxicity (IT) in patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram. Alcohol-based hand rub contains either ethanol or isopropanol or both. COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide scale usage of sanitizers. Patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram, might experience disulfiram ethanol like reactions with alcohol-based sanitizers. METHODS: We telephonically contacted 339 patients, prescribed disulfiram between January 2014 and March 2020. The assessment pertained to the last 3 months (i.e. third week of March to third week of June 2020). RESULT: The sample consisted of middle-aged men with a mean 16 years of alcohol dependence. Among the 82 (24%) patients adherent to disulfiram, 42 (12.3%) were using alcohol-based hand rubs. Out of these, a total of eight patients (19%; 95% CI 9-33) had features suggestive of DER; four of whom also had features indicative of IT. Five patients (62.5%) had mild and self-limiting symptoms. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by three (37.5%). Severe reactions were observed with exposure to sanitizers in greater amounts, on moist skin or through inhalation. CONCLUSION: Patients on disulfiram should be advised to use alternate methods of hand hygiene.","Ghosh, Abhishek; Mahintamani, Tathagata; Balhara, Y P S; Roub, Fazl E; Basu, Debashish; Bn, Subodh; Mattoo, S K; Mishra, Eepsita; Sharma, Babita",Alcohol alcohol,,439
492284,Reply to the Letter to Editor by Lacout and colleagues: Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine for the Treatment of COVID-19: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021,"COVID-19 pandemics has challenged emergency response systems worldwide, with widespread reports of essential services breakdown and collapse of health care structure. A critical element involves essential workforce management since current protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals, including essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several countries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity. This work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data performed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR test results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for handling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential workforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow fine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed models can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in an individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on hemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is significantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed, compared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and other critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from widely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR results used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist strategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel shortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.","Avila, Eduardo; Dorn, Marcio; Alho, Clarice Sampaio; Kahmann, Alessandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10227v1.pdf,439
492661,Quantifying the Backlog of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Cases: Predicting the Impact of COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 had an impact on the whole range of worldwide medical services. Due to the high risk of in-hospital transmission and disproportionate perioperative rates of morbidity and mortality in occult COVID-19 patients surgeons were faced with the challenging triage of surgeries into emergency, urgent and elective. The present study investigates postponed elective surgery and its impact on the medical condition of patients in two high-volume departments of general, visceral, thoracic, transplant and vascular surgery. METHODS: Operations that have been postponed due to COVID-19 were recorded in the Departments of General-, Visceral-, Thoracic- and Vascular Surgery at the University Hospitals of Leipzig and Greifs-wald. Data was analysed descriptively concerning patient outcomes as well as emergency admissions and surgeries. RESULTS: In the Leipzig and Greifswald University Hospitals 89 and 92 elective surgeries were postponed, respectively. No patient needed an extension of surgical procedure when eventually operated. One patient with extensive obesity died early during the suspension period due to cardiac complications. Four patients needed emergency admission to hospital one of whom required urgent surgery. In neither of the two surgical departments did a patient acquire a nosocomial infection with COVID-19. DISCUSSION: While medical consequences of COVID-19 seem multidimensional and severe, our data indicate that the short-term postponement of elective surgery did not cause an unproportional increase of morbidity and mortality. Although the restrictions may have been fear-driven, given no confirmed cases and thus no concrete risk of infection, the early and well-coordinated action may have provided protection from uncontrolled interruption of medical services by loss of medical workforce or capacity. CONCLUSION: Well-organized and early suspension of elective surgery had no disproportionate impact on patient outcomes while averting nosocomial transmission of COVID-19.","Metelmann, Isabella B; Busemann, Alexandra",Z Evid Fortbild Qual Gesundhwes,,439

We are presenting three patients who came to the ED with abdominal pain; and the CT of the abdomen showed findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. A 65-year-old male patient presented with symptoms of urinary tract infection and left renal angle tenderness. A 42-year-old male patient presented with right flank pain post- extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. A 71-year-old male known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and who had had whipple surgery for a neoplasm of the head of the pancreas presented with a painful epigasteric swelling. The three patients had positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests and mild to moderate illness, and were discharged home after two weeks with a good recovery. The first patient had a false negative early PCR test, which turned positive on two repetitions of the test. A systematic review of CT abdomen, including inspection of the lung bases using the lung window in all CT abdomen, is essential to detect findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients requiring a CT abdomen study. As proven in the literature, CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia have a higher sensitivity than the PCR test.","Abolyazid, Sherif; Alshareef, Shireen; Abdullah, Nouf; Khalil, Abdalla; Hamza, Nashaat; Salem, Ahmed",,,439

We convened a committee of specialists to formulate a screening and management strategy for latent infections in our setting. Dexamethasone, used in severe COVID-19, is associated with reactivation of latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and dissemination/hyperinfection of Strongyloides species and should prompt screening and/ or empiric treatment in appropriate epidemiologic contexts. Other immunomodulators used in COVID-19 may also increase risk, including interleukin-6 receptor antagonist (e.g., tocilizumab) and kinase inhibitors. People with specific risk factors should also be screened for HIV, Chagas disease, and endemic mycoses.

498501,Immunosuppression as a risk factor for COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is the leading cause of child mortality globally, with many survivors experiencing long-term adverse consequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that numbers of preterm births greatly reduced following implementation of policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to study the impact of the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in the Netherlands in a stepwise fashion on March 9, March 15, and March 23, 2020, on the incidence of preterm birth. METHODS: We used a national quasi-experimental difference-in-regression-discontinuity approach. We used data from the neonatal dried blood spot screening programme (2010-20) cross-validated against national perinatal registry data. Stratified analyses were done according to gestational age subgroups, and sensitivity analyses were done to assess robustness of the findings. We explored potential effect modification by neighbourhood socioeconomic status, sex, and small-for-gestational-age status. FINDINGS: Data on 1â599â547 singleton neonates were available, including 56â720 births that occurred after implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures on March 9, 2020. Consistent reductions in the incidence of preterm birth were seen across various time windows surrounding March 9 (±â2 months [n=531â823] odds ratio [OR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·66-0·91, p=0·0026; ±â3 months [n=796â531] OR 0·85, 0·73-0·98, p=0·028; ±â4 months [n=1â066â872] OR 0·84, 0·73-0·97, p=0·023). Decreases in incidence observed following the March 15 measures were of smaller magnitude, but not statistically significant. No changes were observed after March 23. Reductions in the incidence of preterm births after March 9 were consistent across gestational age strata and robust in sensitivity analyses. They appeared confined to neighbourhoods of high socioeconomic status, but effect modification was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: In this national quasi-experimental study, initial implementation of COVID-19 mitigation measures was associated with a substantial reduction in the incidence of preterm births in the following months, in agreement with preliminary observations elsewhere. Integration of comparable data from across the globe is needed to further substantiate these findings and start exploring underlying mechanisms.

RECENT FINDINGS: There is a need to plan for resuming the normal elective stone surgery in the post-COVID era, keeping a clear record of all surgeries that are being deferred and identifying subgroups of surgical priorities, for the de-escalation phase. Telehealth is very useful because it contributes to reduce virus dissemination guaranteeing at the same time an adequate response to patients' care needs. Once the pandemic is over, teleurology will continue to be utilized to offer cost-effective care to urological patients and it will be totally integrated in our clinical practice. SUMMARY: This COVID-19 pandemic represents a real challenge for all national health providers: on the one hand, every effort should be made to assist COVID patients, while on the other hand we must remember that all other diseases have not disappeared in the meanwhile and they will urgently need to be treated as soon as the pandemic is more under control. A correct prioritization of cases when surgical activity will progressively return back to normality is of paramount importance.","Proietti, Silvia; Basulto-Martinez, Mario; Pavia, Maria Pia; Luciani, Lorenzo; Gaboardi, Franco; Giusti, Guido",Curr Opin Urol,,439

501628,Necessity Is the Mother of Innovation-The Time to Collaborate Is Now,2020,"The emergence of a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 (B1. 1.7) in the United Kingdom (UK) during late 2020 has raised major public health concerns. Several mutations have been reported in the genome of the B.1.1.7 variant including the N501Y and 69-70deletion in the Spike region that has implications on virus transmissibility and diagnostics. Although the B.1.1.7 variant has been reported by several countries, only three cases have been reported in Pakistan through whole-genome sequencing. Therefore, the objective of the study was to investigate the circulation of B.1.1.7 variant of concern (VOC) in Pakistani population. We used a two-step strategy for the detection of B.1.1.7 with initial screening through TaqPathTM COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, US) followed by partial spike (S) gene sequencing of a subset of samples having the spike gene target failure (SGTF). From January 01, 2021, to February 21, 2021, a total of 2,650 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 70.4% (n = 1,867) showed amplification of all the 3 genes (ORF, N, and S). Notably, 29.6% (n=783) samples have been SGTF that represented numbers from all the four provinces and suggest a rather low frequency during the first 3 weeks of January (n = 10, n = 13, and n = 1, respectively). However, the numbers have started to increase in the last week of January, 2021. During February, 726 (93%) cases of SGTF were reported with a peak (n = 345) found during the 3rd week. Based on the partial sequencing of SGTF samples 93.5% (n = 29/31) showed the characteristic N501Y, A570D, P681H, and T716I mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant. In conclusion, our findings showed an upsurge of B.1.1.7 cases in Pakistan during February, 2021 affecting 15 districts and warranting large scale genomic surveillance, strengthening of laboratory network and implementation of appropriate control measures in the country.","Umair, Massab; Salman, Muhammad; Rehman, Zaira; Badar, Nazish; Ali, Qasim; Ahad, Abdul; Ikram, Aamer",Front Public Health,,439
501992,Case report: Cerebral thromboembolism in an unconscious covid-19 patient in intensive care,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Work in occupations with higher levels of occupational stress can bring mental health costs. Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers, and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6-12 months for up to 66 months. MEASUREMENTS: Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and sense of personal accomplishment (PA). RESULTS: Older participants had lower scores of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those 55 years or older but increased among those 25-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: Older working adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer mental health outcomes.","Hybels, Celia F; Blazer, Dan G; Eagle, David E; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean",Int Psychogeriatr,,439

502736,Association between pre-admission acid suppressive medication exposure and severity of illness in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,2020,"AIM: To understand the impact of COVID-19 on radiology trainee experience and well-being. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire designed to capture the impact of COVID-19 on radiology training, working patterns, and well-being was sent to all speciality trainees in a regional UK radiology school. The survey was distributed at the beginning of May 2020 and responses collected over 2 weeks. Trainees were questioned about changes that had occurred over a time period starting at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. All survey responses (n=29) were anonymised and the results were subsequently analysed. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent (29 of 47) of trainees within the deanery, who were spread across seven different hospital sites, responded to the questionnaire. All trainees felt that overall radiology workload had decreased in response to COVID-19. Seventy-two percent (21/29) stated that their workload had significantly decreased. Seventy percent (19/27) reported decreased subspecialty experience, and 19% (5/27) reported a complete lack of subspecialty training. Twenty-four percent (7/29) of trainees were redeployed from radiology to clinical ward-based work. Forty-eight percent reported experiencing a worsening in their well-being compared to before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on training and well-being. Lessons learnt from this report should help prepare for a second-wave of COVID-19 or future pandemics.","Veerasuri, S; Vekeria, M; Davies, S E; Graham, R; Rodrigues, J C L",Clin Radiol,,439
502786,More on Persistent Poor Health Post-COVID-19 Is Not Associated with Respiratory Complications or Initial Disease Severity,2021,"Background: A request for consumer health information training for public librarians led to the development of a specialized consumer health reference and health literacy training program by professional consumer health librarians from an academic medical center. Professional consumer health librarians created an interactive presentation aimed at improving public librarians' ability to respond to consumer health questions and provide vetted health resources. Case Presentation: Building on professional expertise, librarians at Weill Cornell Medicine developed a live class demonstration accompanied by a representative subject LibGuide to support public librarians who assist patrons with health questions. Skills involved in effectively communicating with patrons who are seeking consumer health information include conducting reference interviews, matching patrons' needs with appropriate resources, teaching useful Internet search methods, assessing health information, and understanding health literacy issues. Originally envisioned as two in-person live demonstrations, the team proactively adapted the program to respond to the stay-at-home social-distancing order put in place in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Conclusions: The team successfully led an in-person live training session followed by an adapted online training experience, the latter designed to complete the curricula while complying with city and state orders.","DeRosa, Antonio P; Jedlicka, Caroline; Mages, Keith C; Stribling, Judy Carol",J Med Libr Assoc,,439

The identification of this virus in the feces of more than 50% of infected individuals indicates the possibility of viral shedding and fecal to oral transmission. Preliminary reports have also identified alterations in the intestinal microbiota profile in the infected individuals. Moreover, Covid-19 patients manifest various degrees of liver injury characterized by alterations in liver function enzymes. Interestingly, the manifestation of digestive symptoms and liver abnormalities correlate with disease severity, the incidence of the critical outcome, and the recovery time of the patients. However, the pathogenic mechanisms behind Covid-19 induced abnormalities in the gut-liver axis seem multifactorial in origin. This review compiles the current knowledge sourced from pre-clinical and clinical research and summarizes the various gastrointestinal and hepatic dysfunction observed following infection with Covid-19 virus, and also explores the possible mechanistic link precipitating the abnormalities in the gut-liver axis.

503835,Reply to: Lactate-dehydrogenase associated with mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Mexico,2021,"BACKGROUND: Numerous smartphone apps are targeting physical activity and healthy eating, but empirical evidence on their effectiveness for initialization and maintenance of behavior change, especially in children and adolescents, is still limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to conceptualize a theory-based and evidence-based mHealth intervention called SMARTFAMILY (SF) that targets physical activity and healthy eating in a collective family-based setting. Subsequently, the app will be refined and re-evaluated to analyze additional effects of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and gamification features. METHODS: A smartphone app based on behavior change theories and behavior change techniques was developed and implemented and will be evaluated with family members individually and cooperatively (SF trial). Existing evidence and gained results were used to refine and will be used to re-evaluate the app (SF2.0 trial). Both trials are cluster randomized controlled trials with 3 measurement occasions. The intervention group uses the app for 3 consecutive weeks, whereas the control group receives no treatment. Baseline measurements (T0) and postintervention measurements (T1) include physical activity (ie, self-reported and accelerometry) and healthy eating measurements (ie, self-reported fruit and vegetable intake) as the primary outcomes. The secondary outcomes (ie, self-reported) are intrinsic motivation, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and the family health climate, complemented by an intentional measure in SF2.0. Four weeks following T1, a follow-up assessment (T2) is completed by the participants, consisting of all questionnaire items to assess the stability of the intervention effects. Mixed-method analysis of covariance will be used to calculate the primary intervention effects (ie, physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake) while controlling for covariates, including family health climate, behavior-specific self-efficacy, and intrinsic motivation. RESULTS: This study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and ethically approved by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. For both trials, it is hypothesized that the apps will positively influence physical activity and healthy eating in the whole family. Furthermore, SF2.0 is expected to produce stronger effects (ie, higher effect sizes) compared to SF. SF app development and piloting are completed. Data acquisition for the SF trial is terminated and discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SF2.0 app development and piloting are completed, while data acquisition is ongoing. Participant recruitment for the SF 2.0 trial started in February 2020. The results for SF are expected to be published in mid-2021, and the results of SF2.0 are expected to be published in mid-2022. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, it is hypothesized that targeting the whole family will facilitate behavior change at the individual level and the family level, as the implemented strategies address changes in daily family life. Furthermore, subsequent app development (SF2.0) with supplementary addition of motivation-enhancing features and a JITAI approach is expected to enhance positive intervention effects.

Using US Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX) claims data (2000-2014), we identified a population-based pregnancy cohort of women with HIV who filled &#8805;1 prescription for antiretroviral therapies (ART) during the first trimester. Women on tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) were compared with women receiving ART without TDF. Major malformations were identified by ICD-9 codes using validated algorithms. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using propensity score (PS) stratification to control for potential confounders. We incorporated the results into prior knowledge by conducting a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis. Major congenital malformations were diagnosed in 37 out of 866 (4.27%) infants exposed to TDF and 38 out of 1,020 (3.73%) infants exposed to ART other than TDF; the adjusted RR was 1.21 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.90). Estimates for specific malformations were imprecise. The pooled RR from the meta-analysis with six prior studies was 0.88 (0.75 to 1.03). Based on evidence accumulated in patients with HIV, first trimester TDF use does not increase the risk of major congenital malformations overall in the newborn compared to other ART.","Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia; Bateman, Brian T; Straub, Loreen; Zhu, Yanmin; Mogun, Helen; Fischer, Michael; Huybrechts, Krista F",Am. j. epidemiol,,439

We constructed a modeling tool to aid active public health officials to estimate healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impact of population-wide social-distancing interventions. METHODS: The tool uses an SEIR compartmental model to project the pandemic's local spread. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. RESULTS: Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at six to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals >70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.

In this review, we summarize evidence that the aforementioned diseases and drugs exert significant epigenetic pressure on genes encoding MMPs, tissue inhibitors of MMPs, and factors that transcriptionally regulate the expression of MMPs. Our understanding of human pathologies associated with alterations in the proteolytic activity of MMPs must consider that these pathologies and their medicinal treatments may impose epigenetic pressure on the expression of MMP genes. Whether the epigenetic mechanisms affecting the activity of MMPs can be therapeutically targeted warrants further research.","Sarker, Hassan; Haimour, Ayman; Toor, Ravneet; Fernandez-Patron, Carlos",Biomolecules,,439

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is the most effective method to control disease spread and prevent further mortality. As such, a high-precision and rapid yet economic assay method is urgently required. Herein, we propose an innovative method to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using isothermal amplification of nucleic acids on a mesh containing multiple microfluidic pores. Hybridization of pathogen DNA and immobilized probes forms a DNA hydrogel by rolling circle amplification and, consequently, blocks the pores to prevent fluid movement, as observed. Following optimization of several factors, including pore size, mesh location, and precision microfluidics, the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be 0.7 aM at 15-min incubation. These results indicate rapid, easy, and effective detection with a moderate-sized LOD of the target pathogen by remote point-of-care testing and without the requirement of any sophisticated device.","Kim, Hwang-Soo; Abbas, Naseem; Shin, Sehyun",Biosens Bioelectron,,439
514118,A Combination of Type A Aortic Dissection and COVID-19: Operative Mortality of 33%?,2020,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has inspired novel strategies for keeping worksites operational and workers safe, with varying degrees of success. In southern Chile, where more than a third of the world’s farmed salmon is produced, the industrial aquaculture sector has been largely successful at avoiding major disruptions and financial losses by mobilizing strategies developed during previous sanitary crises that threatened the health of fish and the industry itself. Here, I engage with the literature on crises and disasters to evaluate these strategies as well as their unintended consequences. I contend that many of the strategies developed to address COVID‐19 as a sanitary crisis and prevent the spread of the virus have deepened the divisions between aquaculture firms and the remote coastal communities where they operate. These social and economic divisions have the potential to undermine the industry’s long‐term viability.

514133,Clinical Characteristics of 545 Cases Confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Stadium Cabin Hospital,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems around the world. Emerging evidence has suggested that substantially few patients seek help for suicidality at clinical settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has elicited concerns of an imminent mental health crisis as the course of the pandemic continues to unfold. Clarifying the relationship between the public's attention to knowledge about suicide and the public's attention to knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic may provide insight into developing prevention strategies for a putative surge of suicide in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this retrospective, longitudinal time-series study is to understand the relationship between temporal trends of interest for the search term ""suicide"" and those of COVID-19-related terms, such as ""social distancing,"" ""school closure,"" and ""lockdown."" METHODS: We used the Google Trends platform to collect data on daily interest levels for search terms related to suicide, several other mental health-related issues, and COVID-19 over the period between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. A correlational analysis was performed to determine the association between the search term ''suicide'' and COVID-19-related search terms in 16 countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between interest levels for the search term ""suicide"" before and after school closure. RESULTS: We found that interest levels for the search term ""suicide"" statistically significantly inversely correlated with interest levels for the search terms ""COVID-19"" or ""coronavirus"" in nearly all countries between February 14, 2020 and May 13, 2020. Additionally, search interest for the term ''suicide'' significantly and negatively correlated with that of many COVID-19-related search terms, and search interest varied between countries. The Mann-Kendall test was used to examine significant differences between search interest levels for the term ""suicide"" before and after school closure. The Netherlands (P=.19), New Zealand (P=.003), the United Kingdom (P=.006), and the United States (P=.049) showed significant negative trends in interest levels for suicide in the 2-week period preceding school closures. In contrast, interest levels for suicide had a significant positive trend in Canada (P<.001) and the United States (P=.002) after school closures. CONCLUSIONS: The public's attention to suicide might inversely correlate with the public's attention to COVID-19-related issues. Additionally, several anticontagion policies, such as school closure, might have led to a turning point for mental health crises, because the attention to suicidality increased after restrictions were implemented. Our results suggest that an increased risk of suicidal ideation may ensue due to the ongoing anticontagion policies. Timely intervention strategies for suicides should therefore be an integral part of efforts to flatten the epidemic curve.","Burnett, Dayle; Eapen, Valsamma; Lin, Ping-I",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,439

514472,Hypertension is a clinically important risk factor for critical illness and mortality in COVID-19: A meta-analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The physiological impact of wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), in particular filtering-face-piece 3 (FFP3) masks, has increasingly been gaining importance since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). So far, gas exchange has been examined using transcutaneously measured partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), ergo-spirometry and impedance cardiography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this structured investigation, arterial blood gas analysis in a 30-year-old female resident was carried out during a 13-hour day shift on the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria. An FFP3 mask (3MTM AuraTM) with an exhalation valve was continuously worn, except for 1 break of 20 min. Arterial blood samples were obtained before putting on the PPE, and after 5 h, 9 h and 13 h of working in the contaminated area. RESULTS: During the multi-hour wearing time, an increase in PaCO2 (the baseline value: 29.3 mm Hg, the max. value: 38.9 mm Hg) and a continuous decrease in partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2, the baseline value: 102 mm Hg, the min. value: 80.8 mm Hg) was detectable. CONCLUSIONS: All measured values were within the normal range, but a trend towards an insufficient gas exchange could be suspected.","Fantin, Raffaella",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,439

AIM: To compare the pre, lockdown, and post-lockdown AR patient characteristics during a period of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) social isolation. METHODS: An observational study with retrospective data collection, consisting of AR between 26 January and 23 June 2020. RESULTS: There were 16 981 AR consisting of 1983 (11.7%) primary evacuations and 14 998 (88.3%) inter-hospital transfers, with a population median age of 52 years (interquartile range 29.0-69.0), with 49.0% (n = 8283) of the cohort being male and 38.0% (n = 6399) being female. There were six confirmed and 230 suspected cases of COVID-19, with the majority of cases (n = 134; 58.3%) in the social isolation period. As compared to pre-restriction, the odds of retrieval for the restriction and post-restriction period differed across time between the major diagnostic groups. This included, an increase in cardiovascular retrieval for both restriction and post-restriction periods (odds ratio (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.24 and OR 1.18 95%, CI 1.08-1.30 respectively), increases in neoplasm in the post restriction period (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.64) and increases for congenital conditions in the restriction period (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.39-4.71). Cardiovascular and congenital conditions had increased rates of priority 1 patients in the restriction and post restriction periods. There was a decrease in endocrine and metabolic disease retrievals in the restriction period (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.98). There were lower odds during the post-restriction period for retrievals of the respiratory system (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.93), and disease of the skin (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.6-1.0). Distribution between the 2019 and 2020 time periods differed (P < 0.05), with the lockdown period resulting in a significant reduction in activity. CONCLUSION: The lockdown period resulted in increased AR rates of circulatory and congenital conditions.","Gardiner, Fergus W; Gillam, Marianne; Churilov, Leonid; Sharma, Pritish; Steere, Mardi; Hannan, Michelle; Hooper, Andrew; Quinlan, Frank",Intern Med J,,439
515469,Evaluation of Computed Tomography (Ct) Chest as a Screening Tool for Covid-19 in Surgical Patients Presenting to the Royal Victoria Hospital Emergency Department-a Northern Irish Study,2021,"With the imposition of the Movement Control Order (MCO) or lockdown due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are drastic changes in the movement and activity among Malaysians: increased psychological distress due to perception of COVID-19 as a health threat, increased time spent with families, and decreased time away from home could either intensify relationship problems or draw families closer to each other. This study aimed to examine the perceived psychological distress and relationship quality among couples before and during MCO in Malaysia and factors predictive of participants' well-being. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Perceived Relationship Quality Component Inventory, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale were disseminated through the snowball sampling technique. The study found that the participants (N = 124) perceived significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress during MCO compared with before MCO. However, no significant differences between the couples were found before and during MCO in relationship quality, except in the trust subscale. Trust on the couple was higher during MCO. Multiple regression results showed that depression and stress predicted participants' well-being negatively during MCO. In contrast, total relationship quality, sexual relationship quality, satisfaction, and trust predicted participants' well-being positively.","Chua, Bee Seok; Siau, Ching Sin; Fitriana, Mimi; Low, Wah-Yun; Abdul Wahab Khan, Rahmattullah Khan Bin",Asia Pac J Public Health,,439

There is a critical need to better understand the landscape of non-vaccination in Michigan to assess the risk of vaccine-preventable outbreaks in the state, yet there is no agreed-upon best practice for characterizing spatial clustering of non-vaccination, and numerous clustering metrics are available in the statistical, geographic, and epidemiologic literature. We used school-level NME data to characterize the spatiotemporal landscape of vaccine exemptions in Michigan from 2008-2018 using Moran's I, the Isolation Index, Modified Aggregation Index, and the Theil Index at four spatial scales. We also used thresholds of 5%, 10%, and 20% non-vaccination to assess the bias incurred when aggregating vaccination data. We found that aggregating school-level data to levels commonly used for public reporting can lead to large biases in identifying the number and location of at-risk students, and that different clustering metrics yielded variable interpretations of the non-vaccination landscape in Michigan. This paper shows the importance of choosing clustering metrics with their mechanistic interpretations in mind: be it large- or fine-scale heterogeneity, or between-and-within group contributions to spatial variation.","Masters, Nina B; Delamater, Paul L; Boulton, Matthew L; Zelner, Jon",Am. j. epidemiol,,439

In addition, while antibodies are effective specific labels, their reproducibility is often inconsistent, and they are difficult to use when staining thick specimens. We report the use of conventional, commercially available fluorescent dyes for rapid and intense covalent labeling of proteins and carbohydrates in super-resolution (expansion) microscopy and cleared tissue microscopy. This approach, which we refer to as Fluorescent Labeling of Abundant Reactive Entities (FLARE), produces simple and robust stains that are modern equivalents of classic small-molecule histology stains. It efficiently reveals a wealth of key landmarks in cells and tissues under different fixation or sample processing conditions and is compatible with immunolabeling of proteins and in situ hybridization labeling of nucleic acids.","Mao, Chenyi; Lee, Min Yen; Jhan, Jing-Ru; Halpern, Aaron R; Woodworth, Marcus A; Glaser, Adam K; Chozinski, Tyler J; Shin, Leonard; Pippin, Jeffrey W; Shankland, Stuart J; Liu, Jonathan T C; Vaughan, Joshua C",Sci.

Because of their presumed advantages in handling and analyzing vast amounts of data, computer systems of automated decision-making (ADM) are implemented and substitute humans in decision-making processes. In this study, we focus on a specific application of ADM in contrast to human decision-making (HDM), namely the allocation of Covid-19 vaccines to the public. In particular, we elaborate on the role of trust and social group preference on the legitimacy of vaccine allocation. We conducted a survey with a 2x2 randomized factorial design among n=1602 German respondents, in which we utilized distinct decision-making agents (HDM vs. ADM) and prioritization of a specific social group (teachers vs. prisoners) as design factors. Our findings show that general trust in ADM systems and preference for vaccination of a specific social group influence the legitimacy of vaccine allocation. However, contrary to our expectations, trust in the agent making the decision did not moderate the link between social group preference and legitimacy. Moreover, the effect was also not moderated by the type of decision-maker (human vs. algorithm). We conclude that trustworthy ADM systems must not necessarily lead to the legitimacy of ADM systems.","Lunich, Marco; Kieslich, Kimon",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.08946v1.pdf,439

It mainly infects cells of the lower respiratory tract and has been linked to severe respiratory complications. Although multiple routes of transmission have been reported in the literature, there is no definitive evidence for transplacental transmission. We present a case of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 likely due to transplacental transmission. CASE REPORT: 31-year-old Hispanic woman in the final week of pregnancy developed mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. She had a history of Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and gestational diabetes. Two days later, she gave birth to a baby girl who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on the first day after birth.

592494,Chest pain and high troponin level without significant respiratory symptoms in young patients with COVID-19,2020,"Deep vein thrombosis causes several acute and chronic vessel complications and puts patients at risk of subsequent sepsis development. This unique study aimed to estimate the risk of sepsis development in DVT patients compared with non-DVT patients. This population-based cohort study used records of a longitudinal health insurance database containing two million patients defined in Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Our study included patients aged over 20 years with a new diagnosis of DVT with at least two outpatient department visits or an admission between 2001 and 2014. Patients with a diagnosis of sepsis before the index date were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to homogenize the baseline characteristics between the two groups. To define the independent risk of the DVT group, a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratios. After PSM, the DVT group (n = 5753) exhibited a higher risk of sepsis (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.59–1.90) compared with non-DVT group (n = 5753). Patients with an increased risk of sepsis were associated with being elderly aged, male, having diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, malignancy, and use of antibiotics. In conclusion, this population-based cohort study demonstrated an increased risk of sepsis in DVT patients compared with non-DVT patients. Thus, early prevention and adequate treatment of DVT is necessary in clinical practice.","Yeh, Ying-Tung; Tsai, Sheng-En; Chen, Ying-Cheng; Yang, Shun-Fa; Yeh, Han-Wei; Wang, Bo-Yuan; Yeh, Liang-Tsai; Shih, Nai-Chen; Wang, Yu-Hsun; Chen, Yin-Yang; Yeh, Chao-Bin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18157879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360172/,439
592675,Impact of COVID-19 on people with cystic fibrosis,2020-04-15,"Public pension funding problems may contribute to a state's poor economic performance. This paper examines that proposition, using state-level data on public pensions developed by the Pew Trust, and jointly by the Federal Reserve Board and the Bureau of Economic Analysis. There is little evidence that measures of the level of unfunded pension plan liabilities lead directly to a state's soft economic performance, though growth in unfunded liabilities appear to be associated with lower growth. While these results suggest that reductions in the growth of a state's pension debt may be beneficial, they arguably do not imply that dramatic action to reduce liabilities is necessarily called for. In that regard, the implications are comparable to those of Lenney et al. (2019), that suggest that reasonable goals for some presumed highly troubled systems are stabilization of the ratio of their unfunded liabilities to their state's nominal GDP, rather than outright elimination of the debt.","Steindel, Charles",Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836312/; https://doi.org/10.1057/s11369-020-00183-3,439

592970,Pre-admission acetylsalicylic acid therapy and impact on in-hospital outcome in COVID-19 patients: The ASA-CARE study,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUND: Based on current evidence, recent guidelines of the National Institute of Health, USA indicated the use of remdesivir and dexamethasone for the treatment of COVID-19 patients with mild-moderate disease, not requiring high-flow oxygen. No therapeutic agent directed against the immunologic pathogenic mechanisms related to the cytokine release syndrome complicating the disease was indicated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review was to assess the clinical impact of different therapies for COVID-19; thus, helping to identify the optimal management of the disease. To explain the rationale for the different therapeutic approaches, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and the immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. METHODS: The efficacy assessment of the different treatments was performed by a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Available English language published articles including randomised controlled trials, open-label trials of antivirals and immune therapies extracted from Medline, Google Scholar, and MedRxiv databases were analysed. For inclusion, the primary end point of the trials had to be the efficacy as measured by the improvement of clinical features, or mortality, or the Intensive Care Unit Admission rate, or the discharge number. Case reports, paediatric studies, and studies without control group were excluded. The literature search was extended up to August 15, 2020. RESULTS: After the removal of duplicate articles, and the exclusion of studies not meeting the eligibility criteria, 2 trials of lopinavir/ritonavir, 1 of favipiravir, 3 of remdesivir, 1 of dexamethasone, 3 of hydroxychloroquine, 2 of colchicine, 6 of tocilizumab, 1 of sarilumab, 1 of siltuximab, 2 of anakinra, 3 of baricitinib, 1 of ruxolitinib, 1 of mavrilimumab, and 1 of itolizumab were suitable for the review. Among antivirals, only remdesivir significantly reduced the time to recovery, and mortality. Data for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were largely inconclusive. In a large trial, dexamethasone 6 mg/day reduced mortality by one-third. Trials of tocilizumab and sarilumab did not definitively demonstrate efficacy. Anakinra significantly reduced the mortality in 2 trials. Three retrospective trials on a cumulative number of 145 patients, reported the efficacy of baricitinib, with significant reduction of intensive care unit admission, and deaths. These results were recently confirmed by the ACTT-2 trial. Due to paucity of studies and to the small size clinical series, the results of other immune therapies were not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond the supportive therapy, up to now the best therapeutic approach for COVID-19 may be a three-step combination therapy, including remdesivir 100 mg/day (200 mg loading dose on first day) in the first stage of the disease, and combined dexamethasone 6 mg/day plus baricitinib 4 mg/day to target the immune dysregulation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The promising results of anakinra should be confirmed by the ongoing RCTs.

593025,Critical COVID-19 complicating recovery from surgical repair of congenital heart disease,2021-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Emerging viral diseases, most of which are caused by the transmission of viruses from animals to humans, pose a threat to public health. Discovering pathogenic viruses through surveillance is the key to preparedness for this potential threat. Next generation sequencing (NGS) helps us to identify viruses without the design of a specific PCR primer. The major task in NGS data analysis is taxonomic identification for vast numbers of sequences. However, taxonomic identification via a BLAST search against all the known sequences is a computational bottleneck. DESCRIPTION: Here we propose an enhanced lowest-common-ancestor based method (ELM) to effectively identify viruses from massive sequence data. To reduce the computational cost, ELM uses a customized database composed only of viral sequences for the BLAST search. At the same time, ELM adopts a novel criterion to suppress the rise in false positive assignments caused by the small database. As a result, identification by ELM is more than 1,000 times faster than the conventional methods without loss of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that ELM will contribute to direct diagnosis of viral infections.

593298,Better clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 minority patients with accompanying gastrointestinal symptoms,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: A crucial balance exists between oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms in the functional immune system. We aimed to evaluate the contributions of balance between these systems to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), a devastating pandemic caused by viral infection. METHOD: We analyzed serum oxidant and antioxidant stress parameters according to the clinical and demographic characteristics of children and adults with COVID‐19 and compared them against the values of healthy controls. Serum native thiol (NT), total thiol (TT), disulfide, total antioxidant status, total oxidant status, and ischemia‐modified albumin levels were evaluated and compared between groups. RESULTS: A total of 79 children and 74 adults were evaluated in the present study, including 46 children and 40 adults with COVID‐19, 33 healthy children, and 34 healthy adults. TT, NT, and disulfide levels were significantly lower in the adult COVID‐19 group than in all other groups (p = .001, p = .001, and p = .005, respectively). Additionally, TT and NT levels were significantly lower in both pediatric and adult COVID‐19 cases with severe disease course than mild/moderate course. TT and NT levels were identified as predictors for the diagnosis of the adult COVID‐19 cases and as independent predictors for disease severity in both children and adults with COVID‐19. CONCLUSION: Parameters that reveal the oxidant and antioxidant capacity, including TT and NT, appear to be good candidates for the accurate prediction of the clinical course among patients with COVID‐19.","Aykac, Kubra; Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Yayla, Burcu Ceylan Cura; Gurlevik, Sibel Lacinel; Oygar, Pembe Derin; Bolu, Nuriye Boduc; Tasar, Medine Aysin; Erdinc, Fatma Sebnem; Ertem, Gulay Tuncer; Neselioglu, Salim; Erel, Ozcan; Cengiz, Ali Bülent; Ceyhan, Mehmet",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34265172/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25549,439
593343,Opening Pandora’s box: surgical tracheostomy in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients,2020-07-09,"BACKGROUND: The novel SARS-CoV-2 has quickly become a global pandemic since the first reported case in December 2019, with the virus infecting millions of people to date. The spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a key role in binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a host cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2. S proteins that are expressed on the cell membrane can initiate receptor-dependent syncytia formation that is associated with extensive tissue damage. Formation of syncytia have been previously observed in cells infected with various other viruses (e.g., HIV, Ebola, Influenza, and Herpesviruses). However, this phenomenon is not well documented and the mechanisms regulating the formation of the syncytia by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully understood. RESULTS: In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), as well as human ACE2 expression vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell–cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. CONCLUSIONS: This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays. Additionally, this study suggest that spike protein expressed by vaccines may affect different ACE2-expressing host cells after SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration. The long-term effects of these vaccines should be monitored carefully. Δ19-S mRNA may represent a safer mRNA vaccine design in the future.

593635,Predictors of severity and mortality among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Rhode Island,2021-06-18,"OBJECTIVE: To identify themes and temporal trends in the sentiment of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets and to explore variations in sentiment at world national and United States state levels. METHODS: We collected English-language tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines posted between November 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We applied the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner tool to calculate the compound score to determine whether the sentiment mentioned in each tweet was positive (compound ≥ 0.05), neutral (-0.05 < compound < 0.05), or negative (compound ≤ -0.05). We applied the latent Dirichlet allocation analysis to extract main topics for tweets with positive and negative sentiment. Then we performed a temporal analysis to identify time trends and a geographic analysis to explore sentiment differences in tweets posted in different locations. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2,678,372 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets, tweets with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments were 42.8%, 26.9%, and 30.3%, respectively. We identified five themes for positive sentiment tweets (trial results, administration, life, information, and efficacy) and five themes for negative sentiment tweets (trial results, conspiracy, trust, effectiveness, and administration). On November 9, 2020, the sentiment score increased significantly (score = 0.234, p = 0.001), then slowly decreased to a neutral sentiment in late December and was maintained until the end of January. At the country level, tweets posted in Brazil had the lowest sentiment score of −0.002, while tweets posted in the United Arab Emirates had the highest sentiment score of 0.162. The overall average sentiment score for the United States was 0.089, with Washington, DC having the highest sentiment score of 0.144 and Wyoming having the lowest sentiment score of 0.036. CONCLUSIONS: Public sentiment on COVID-19 vaccines varied significantly over time and geography.

DESIGN: Observational. SETTING: Thirty-three Boston-area LTCFs over a 3-year period. PARTICIPANTS: Residents of long-term care who had previously participated in a trial of vitamin E supplementation and had paired serum samples available for viral analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Viral antibody titers to eight respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus serotype three (PIV-3), PIV-2, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and coronaviruses 229E and OC43) were measured using enzyme immunoassay at baseline and 53 weeks. Infection was defined as a more than quadrupling of viral titers. Clinical data on respiratory illnesses were collected throughout the study period. RESULTS: A total of 617 persons were enrolled in the trial. Of these, 382 (62%) had sera available for viral analysis. A total of 204 viral infections were documented in 157 subjects. Serological responses to all eight viruses were documented, with hMPV (12.8%) and coronavirus 229E (10.5%) being the most common and PIV-2 (2.4%) the least common. The occurrence of bronchitis (P = .007), pneumonia (P = .02), and any lower respiratory tract infection (P = .002) was significantly associated with having a viral diagnosis.

Postmortem analysis of serum IgE can provide helpful information for determining anaphylaxis. However, postmortem serum always suffers from hemolysis. To investigate the interference of hemolysis on postmortem analysis of total IgE by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) and verify the suitability of the commercially available ECLIA kit for postmortem hemolyzed blood with the dilution-correction method, different levels of hemolyzed serum were prepared to evaluate the interference of hemolysis. A linear regression analysis was then performed on the concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood and the corresponding serum. Our results indicated that hemolysis negatively interfered with the total IgE analysis by ECLIA and the interference (|Bias%|) increased with increasing levels of hemolysis. After controlling for |Bias%| by dilution, the test concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood was still significantly lower than that in the serum (P < 0.05) and resulted in eight false-negative cases. A strong correlation was observed between the test concentration of total IgE in the completely hemolyzed blood and that in the serum (r = 0.983). After correction by the regression formula, the corrected concentration revealed no significant differences and exhibited the same diagnostic ability, compared with the serum total IgE concentration. These results indicate that the completely hemolyzed blood is not recommended for postmortem analysis of total IgE directly. The dilution-correction method might have potential utility in forensic practice for evaluating serum total IgE concentrations.","Wang, Tianqi; Li, Zeyu; Jia, Yuqing; Zhu, Baoli; Cao, Zhipeng",Int J Legal Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-021-02578-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33783602/,439

METHODS: This is a single-centre cohort study of adults with COVID-19 admitted to New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medicine from 3 March 2020 through 15 May 2020. Baseline and outcome variables, as well as lab and ventilatory parameters, were generated for the admitted and intubated cohorts after stratifying by BMI category. Linear regression models were used for continuous, and logistic regression models were used for categorical outcomes. RESULTS: The study included 1337 admitted patients with a subset of 407 intubated patients. Among admitted patients, hospital length of stay (LOS) and home discharge was not significantly different across BMI categories independent of demographic characteristics and comorbidities. In the intubated cohort, there was no difference in in-hospital events and treatments, including renal replacement therapy, neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning. Ventilatory ratio was higher with increasing BMI on days 1, 3 and 7. There was no significant difference in ventilator free days (VFD) at 28 or 60 days, need for tracheostomy, hospital LOS, and discharge disposition based on BMI in the intubated cohort after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: In our COVID-19 population, there was no association between obesity and morbidity outcomes, such as hospital LOS, home discharge or VFD.

Our observed results show that the dramatic NO(x) decrease (77%) led to significant O(3) increases (a factor of 2) during the COVID‐19 lockdown in megacity Hangzhou, China. Model simulations further demonstrate large increases of daytime OH and HO(2) radicals and nighttime NO(3) radical, which can promote the gas‐phase reaction and nocturnal multiphase chemistry. Therefore, enhanced NO(3) (−) and SO(4) (2−) formation was observed during the COVID‐19 lockdown because of the enhanced oxidizing capacity. The PM(2.5) decrease was only partially offset by enhanced aerosol formation with its reduction reaching 50%. In particular, NO(3) (−) decreased largely by 68%. PM(2.5) chemical analysis reveals that vehicular emissions mainly contributed to PM(2.5) under normal conditions in Hangzhou.

The objective of this descriptive analysis was to assess the initial adoption, feasibility and safety of a family medicine–led remote monitoring program, COVIDCare@Home, to manage the care of patients with COVID-19 in the community. METHODS: COVIDCare@Home is a multifaceted, interprofessional team–based remote monitoring program developed at an ambulatory academic centre, the Women’s College Hospital in Toronto. A descriptive analysis of the first cohort of patients admitted from Apr. 8 to May 11, 2020, was conducted. Lessons from the implementation of the program are described, focusing on measure of adoption (number of visits per patient total, with a physician or with a nurse; length of follow-up), feasibility (received an oximeter or thermometer; consultation with general internal medicine, social work or mental health, pharmacy or acute ambulatory care unit) and safety (hospitalizations, mortality and emergency department visits). RESULTS: The COVIDCare@Home program cared for a first cohort of 97 patients (median age 41 yr, 67% female) with 415 recorded virtual visits. Patients had a median time from positive testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to first appointment of 3 (interquartile range [IQR] 2–4) days, with a median virtual follow-up time of 8 (IQR 5–10) days. A total of 4 (4%) had an emergency department visit, with no patients requiring hospitalization and no deaths; 16 (16%) of patients required support with mental and social health needs. INTERPRETATION: A family medicine–led, team-based remote monitoring program can safely manage the care of outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Virtual care approaches, particularly those that support patients with more complex health and social needs, may be an important part of ongoing health system efforts to manage subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other diseases.","Agarwal, Payal; Mukerji, Geetha; Laur, Celia; Chandra, Shivani; Pimlott, Nick; Heisey, Ruth; Stovel, Rebecca; Goulbourne, Elaine; Bhatia, R.

RESULTS: A total of 858 rheumatologists were included in the analysis (27.3% of registered in ArLAR), 37% were 35–44 years old, 60% were females, and 48% worked in the private sector. The impact of COVID-19 was a decrease of 69% in hospitalizations, 65% in outpatient clinic, 56% in infusion centers, and 43% in income. It was associated with the region (highest in the Gulf), use of telemedicine, impact on income and practice sector (lowest in private). There was a hydroxychloroquine shortage in 47%. Telemedicine was mostly based on traditional telephone contacts and e-mails and reimbursed in 12%. Fifteen rheumatologists (1.8%) were infected and 156 cases of COVID-19 were reported among patients. The top-cited unmet needs in rheumatology practice were access to drugs and a telemedicine platform. CONCLUSIONS: The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on rheumatology practice may compromise rheumatic diseases control. Better access to drugs and providing telemedicine platforms are recommended to improve the practice.

To compare the clinical characteristics of local cases of COVID-19 in China compared with those imported from abroad. This was a retrospective study of confirmed cases of COVID-19 admitted at the Beijing Ditan Fever Emergency Department between February 29(th), 2020, and March 27(th), 2020. The clinical characteristics of the patients were compared between local and imported cases. Compared with local cases, the imported cases were younger (27.3 ± 11.7 vs. 43.6 ± 22.2 years, P < .001), had a shorter interval from disease onset to admission (1.0 (0.0–2.0) vs 4.0 (2.0–7.0) days, P < .001), lower frequencies of case contact (17.4% vs 94.1%, P < .001), fever (39.1% vs 82.4%, P < .001), cough (33.3% vs 51.0%, P = .03), dyspnea (1.9% vs 11.8%, P = .01), fatigue (7.5% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.001), muscle ache (4.7% vs. 25.5%, P < 0.001), and comorbidities (P < .05). The imported cases were less severe than the local cases, with 40.4% versus 5.9% mild cases, 2.8% versus 15.7% severe cases, and no critical cases (P < .001). The length of hospital stay was longer in imported cases than in local cases (32.3 ± 14.5 vs 21.7 ± 11.2 days, P < .001). The imported cases showed smaller biochemical perturbations than the local cases. More imported cases had no sign of pneumonia at computed tomography (45.0% vs 14.9%, P = .001), and none had pleural effusion (0% vs 14.9%, P < .001).

METHODS: Using an individual-based model, we simulated the spread of COVID-19 in Daegu. An individual can be infected through close contact with infected people in a household, at work/school, and at religious and social gatherings. We created a synthetic population from census sample data. Then, 9,000 people were randomly selected from the entire population of Daegu and set as members of the Shincheonji Church. We did not take into account population movements to and from other regions in Korea. RESULTS: Using the individual-based model, the cumulative confirmed cases in Daegu through March 26, 2020, were reproduced, and it was confirmed that the hotspot, i.e., the Shincheonji Church had a different probability of infection than non-hotspot, i.e., the Daegu community. For 3 scenarios (I: school closing, II: school opening after April 6, III: school opening after April 6 and the mean period from symptom onset to hospitalization increasing to 4.3 days), we predicted future changes in the pattern of COVID-19 spread in Daegu. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to scenario I, it was found that in scenario III, the cumulative number of patients would increase by 107 and the date of occurrence of the last patient would be delayed by 92 days.","Son, Woo-Sik",Epidemiol Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580535/; https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020042,439

601140,Adaptation of Adult Pathways to Improve the Care of Adult Patients at Pediatric Hospitals.,2021-07-29,"A hallmark of infection by respiratory viruses is productive infection of and the subsequent destruction of the airway epithelium. These viruses can also target other stromal cell types as well as in certain instances, CD45(+) hematopoietic cells either resident in the lungs or part of the inflammatory response to infection. The mechanisms by which the virus produces injury to these cell types include direct infection with cytopathic effects as a consequence of replication. Host mediated damage is also a culprit in pulmonary injury as both innate and adaptive immune cells produce soluble and cell-associated pro-inflammatory mediators. Recently, it has become increasingly clear that in addition to control of excess inflammation and virus elimination, the resolution of infection requires an active repair process, which is necessary to regain normal respiratory function and restore the lungs to homeostasis. The repair response must re-establish the epithelial barrier and regenerate the microarchitecture of the lung. Emerging areas of research have highlighted the importance of innate immune cells, particularly the newly described innate lymphoid cells, as well as alternatively activated macrophages and pulmonary stem cells in the repair process. The mechanisms by which respiratory viruses may impede or alter the repair response will be important areas of research for identifying therapeutic targets aimed at limiting virus and host mediated injury and expediting recovery.","Gorski, Stacey A.; Hufford, Matthew M.; Braciale, Thomas J.",Current Opinion in Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608464/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879625712000739; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625712000739; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc3378727?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coviro.2012.04.006,439
601149,Anosmia is associated with lower in-hospital mortality in COVID-19,2020-10-01,"Although the discovery and characterization of multiple tumor antigens have sparked the development of many antigen/derived cancer vaccines, many are poorly immunogenic and thus, lack clinical efficacy. Adjuvants are therefore incorporated into vaccine formulations to trigger strong and long-lasting immune responses. Adjuvants have generally been classified into two categories: those that ‘depot’ antigens (e.g. mineral salts such as aluminum hydroxide, emulsions, liposomes) and those that act as immunostimulants (Toll Like Receptor agonists, saponins, cytokines). In addition, several novel technologies using vector-based delivery of antigens have been used. Unfortunately, the immune system declines with age, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence, and this is characterized by functional changes in both innate and adaptive cellular immunity systems as well as in lymph node architecture. While many of the immune functions decline over time, others paradoxically increase. Indeed, aging is known to be associated with a low level of chronic inflammation—inflamm-aging. Given that the median age of cancer diagnosis is 66 years and that immunotherapeutic interventions such as cancer vaccines are currently given in combination with or after other forms of treatments which themselves have immune-modulating potential such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the choice of adjuvants requires careful consideration in order to achieve the maximum immune response in a compromised environment. In addition, more clinical trials need to be performed to carefully assess how less conventional form of immune adjuvants, such as exercise, diet and psychological care which have all be shown to influence immune responses can be incorporated to improve the efficacy of cancer vaccines. In this review, adjuvants will be discussed with respect to the above-mentioned important elements.","Cuzzubbo, Stefania; Mangsbo, Sara; Nagarajan, Divya; Habra, Kinana; Pockley, Alan Graham; McArdle, Stephanie E.

The bioactive sphingolipid ceramide, induced by aging stress, mediates mitophagy and cell death; however, the aging-related roles of ceramide metabolism in regulating T cell function remain unknown. Here, we show that activated T cells isolated from aging mice have elevated C14/C16 ceramide accumulation in mitochondria, generated by ceramide synthase 6, leading to mitophagy/mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistically, aging-dependent mitochondrial ceramide inhibits protein kinase A, leading to mitophagy in activated T cells. This aging/ceramide-dependent mitophagy attenuates the antitumor functions of T cells in vitro and in vivo. Also, inhibition of ceramide metabolism or PKA activation by genetic and pharmacologic means prevents mitophagy and restores the central memory phenotype in aging T cells. Thus, these studies help explain the mechanisms behind aging-related dysregulation of T cells’ antitumor activity, which can be restored by inhibiting ceramide-dependent mitophagy.","Vaena, Silvia; Chakraborty, Paramita; Lee, Han Gyul; Janneh, Alhaji H.; Kassir, Mohamed Faisal; Beeson, Gyda; Hedley, Zachariah; Yalcinkaya, Ahmet; Sofi, M.

Species D adenoviruses offer potential advantages for gene therapy applications, with low rates of pre-existing immunity detected across screened populations. However, many aspects of the basic virology of species D—such as their cellular tropism, receptor usage, and in vivo biodistribution profile—remain unknown. Here, we have characterized human adenovirus type 49 (HAdV-D49)—a relatively understudied species D member. We report that HAdV-D49 does not appear to use a single pathway to gain cell entry, but appears able to interact with various surface molecules for entry. As such, HAdV-D49 can transduce a broad range of cell types in vitro, with variable engagement of blood coagulation FX. Interestingly, when comparing in vivo biodistribution to adenovirus type 5, HAdV-D49 vectors show reduced liver targeting, whilst maintaining transduction of lung and spleen. Overall, this presents HAdV-D49 as a robust viral vector platform for ex vivo manipulation of human cells, and for in vivo applications where the therapeutic goal is to target the lung or gain access to immune cells in the spleen, whilst avoiding liver interactions, such as intravascular vaccine applications.","Bates, Emily A.; Counsell, John R.; Alizert, Sophie; Baker, Alexander T.; Suff, Natalie; Boyle, Ashley; Bradshaw, Angela C.; Waddington, Simon N.; Nicklin, Stuart A.; Baker, Andrew H.; Parker, Alan L.",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34452348/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081483,439

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay targeting two regions of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) to a high complexity molecular-based, laboratory-developed EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a diagnostic comparison study by testing nasopharyngeal samples on the two assays. Assay agreement was assessed by overall percent agreement and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 184 nasopharyngeal samples were tested using the two assays, of which 180 showed valid results and were included for the comparative analysis. Overall percent agreement between the assays was 98.3 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 95.2–99.7) and kappa coefficient was 0.97 (95 % CI 0.93–1.0). One sample was detected on the SHC laboratory developed test (LDT) and not on the Panther Fusion, and had a Ct of 35.9. Conversely, 2 samples were detected on the Panther Fusion and not on the LDT, and had Ct values of 37.2 and 36.6. CONCLUSION: The Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay and the SHC LDT perform similarly on clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Other considerations, including reagent availability, turnaround time, labor requirements, cost and instrument throughput should guide the decision of which assay to perform.","Hogan, Catherine A.; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Huang, ChunHong; Garamani, Natasha; Stevens, Bryan; Zehnder, James; Pinsky, Benjamin A.",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301256; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32353760/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301256,439

As the US population ages, the number of older racial and ethnic minority individuals will increase. Including these individuals in research is an important step towards reducing health disparities. METHODS: We used data from HealthStreet, a University of Florida community engagement program which uses community health workers to assess the health of the community, to assess willingness to participate in different types of health research by race/ethnicity. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to assess willingness to participate among adults aged 50 and older, by race/ethnicity (n = 4694). RESULTS: Our sample was 42.0% non-Hispanic White, 52.8% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.2% Hispanic. Non-Hispanic White participants reported more past research participation than non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic participants (28.7% vs. 19.0% and 19.2%, respectively). Compared with non-Hispanic White participants, non-Hispanic Black participants were less willing to participate in most types of studies, while Hispanic participants were less willing to participate in studies that might be seen as invasive (required blood sample, genetic sample, or participants to take medicine, or use of medical equipment). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides investigators with a general profile of research preferences by race/ethnicity; compared with non-Hispanic White individuals, non-Hispanic Black individuals are less willing to participate in most studies, while Hispanic individuals are less willing to participate in studies that may be seen as invasive or demanding.

604040,Severity does not impact on exercise capacity in COVID-19 survivors,2021-08-14,"COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading outbreak globally. Emerging evidence demonstrates that older individuals and people with underlying metabolic conditions of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor. The ACE-2 receptor is a part of the dual system renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) consisting of ACE-Ang-II-AT (1) R axis and ACE-2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis. In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT (1) R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis. The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. In effect, the balance between these two axes may determine the prognosis. The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1–7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise. Further evidence needs to be gathered on whether modulation of the renin angiotensin system would be advantageous due to upregulation of Mas activation or harmful due to the concomitant ACE-2 receptor upregulation in the acute management of COVID-19.","Dalan, Rinkoo; Bornstein, Stefan R.; El-Armouche, Ali; Rodionov, Roman N; Markov, Alexander; Wielockx, Ben; Beuschlein, Felix; Boehm, Bernhard O.",Horm Metab Res,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1155-0501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340044/,439

The current study was aimed to determine the factors that affect the mortality of COVID-19 patients admitted in Baharloo hospital in Iran. METHODS: in the current retrospective study, 56 survived patients and 56 patients who were died (a total of 112 cases) because of COVID-19 infection were randomly selected from those who were admitted to Baharloo hospital. Each patient who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and had recovered from it matched with each non-survived patient in the term of age. Laboratory tests of all these patients at the time of admission were recorded and compared. All analyses performed using spss version 22 by considering α = 0.05 as a significant level. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the age and gender distribution between the two groups (p > 0.05). The prevalence of diabetes among survived patients was 37.5% and among non-survived patients was 26.8% and there was no statistical difference between two groups regarding this comorbidity (p = 0.22). Also, there was no statistical difference in the prevalence of hypertension and coronary heart diseases between two groups (p > 0.05).

Its role appears particularly relevant in two subgroups of patients—young males and elderly women—and among those affected by co-morbidities, where the variant frequency is higher among individuals who were mildly affected by the disease and did not need hospitalization or oxygen therapy than among those more severely affected, who required oxygen therapy, ventilation or intubation. This study provides useful information for the identification of patients at risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19, and encourages the usage of drugs affecting the expression of TMPRSS2 or inhibiting protein activity.","Monticelli, Maria; Hay Mele, Bruno; Benetti, Elisa; Fallerini, Chiara; Baldassarri, Margherita; Furini, Simone; Frullanti, Elisa; Mari, Francesca; Andreotti, Giuseppina; Cubellis, Maria Vittoria; Renieri, Alessandra",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33921689/; https://doi.org/10.3390/genes12040596,439

Objectives The objective of this study was to characterize the impact of preoperative carbohydrate loading on postoperative bariatric surgery outcomes. Setting University Hospital. Methods Patients undergoing a primary minimally invasive Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) between 2018 and 2020 were randomized to standard management or intervention. Standard management patients were nothing by mouth (NPO) after midnight prior to surgery. Intervention patients consumed 2 carbohydrate drinks: 1 the night before and another 3 hours prior to surgery. Primary outcomes analyzed included postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), length of stay, and overall complications. Results In total, 134 patients were analyzed: 64 intervention (47.8%) and 70 (52.2%) standard. In the end, 7% and 15% of patients were lost to follow-up at 6-weeks and 3-months, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in length of stay (2.0 ± 1.2 vs 2.1 ± .9 d; P = .65) or postoperative outcomes between the 2 groups. There were no episodes of aspiration among the intervention group. Among RYGB patients, intervention patients had a shorter duration of nausea compared with standard patients. There was no significant difference in glycemic control among patients with and without diabetes. Conclusions Preoperative carbohydrate drinks can be administered to bariatric surgery patients without significant risks. Carbohydrate loading preoperatively can decrease the duration of PONV in RYGB patients. Carbohydrate drinks can be safely included in bariatric ERAS protocols for patients with and without diabetes, although the benefits remain unknown.","Suh, Sarah; Hetzel, Emily; Alter-Troilo, Katie; Lak, Kathleen; Gould, Jon C.; Kindel, Tammy L.; Higgins, Rana M.",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550728921002045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016554/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1550728921002045; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2021.04.014,439

Here we outline our approach to the resit virtual OSCE (“VOSCE”) for final year medical students that we undertook during “lockdown” in the current pandemic. METHODS: The original ‘pre Covid’ examination blueprint was reviewed and modified for the virtual environment in both format and content. In anticipation of the new format delivery, a number of pre-training sessions took place for all parties, and standardised templates were developed. RESULTS: A total of 9 students undertook the VOSCE, which took the form of a two-part exam (a communication and clinical examination component, and a practical procedures component). The VOSCE was completed by all students, examiners, simulated patients and invigilators on an online digital platform with no issues with regards to technical problems. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 6 students passed the VOSCE and as such progressed to graduation. The limitation of assessing some particular types of skills across the remote format (such as practical procedures) was recognised. The training and the templates developed were helpful in case the VOSCE format needs to be adopted in future at short notice and/or expanded in future.","Blythe, Jenny; Patel, Nimesh S.

However, this recommendation lacks an evidence basis and is controversial. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the dose-response relationship between CFS and mortality in COVID-19 patients, with a goal of supplementing the evidence of its use. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search from several electronic databases up until 8 September 2020. We searched for studies investigating COVID-19 patients and reported both (1) CFS and its distribution (2) CFS and its association with mortality. The outcome of interest was mortality, defined as clinically validated death or non-survivor. The odds ratio (ORs) will be reported per 1% increase in CFS. The potential for a non-linear relationship based on ORs of each quantitative CFS was examined using restricted cubic splines with a three-knots model. RESULTS: There were a total of 3817 patients from seven studies. Mean age was 80.3 (SD 8.2), and 53% (48–58%) were males. The pooled prevalence for CFS 1–3 was 34% (32–36%), CFS 4–6 was 42% (40–45%), and CFS 7–9 was 23% (21–25%). Each 1-point increase in CFS was associated with 12% increase in mortality (OR 1.12 (1.04, 1.20), p = 0.003; I(2): 77.3%). The dose-response relationship was linear (P(non-linearity)=0.116). The funnel-plot analysis was asymmetrical; Trim-and-fill analysis by the imputation of two studies on the left side resulted in OR of 1.10 [1.03, 1.19]. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed that increase in CFS was associated with increase in mortality in a linear fashion.","Pranata, Raymond; Henrina, Joshua; Lim, Michael Anthonius; Lawrensia, Sherly; Yonas, Emir; Vania, Rachel; Huang, Ian; Lukito, Antonia Anna; Suastika, Ketut; Kuswardhani, R.A.

We examined sleep hygiene and symptoms of disrupted sleep through late April and May and demographic and psychological variables related to vulnerability/resilience to negative outcomes. METHODS: Participants (Part1: N=180, Part2: N=64; ages 18-85) solicited from a college (students, faculty/staff, alumni, parents) and local community (churches, community centers, libraries) completed a 30-minute survey (measures: sleep hygiene (SH), symptoms of sleep disruption, mental health, personality, social distancing, COVID-19 impact/experience, and demographics) for possible prizes. Part 1, April 20th-May 12th, participants answered trait questionnaires and state questionnaires for before and during social distancing, then repeated state questionnaires two weeks later (Part 2). RESULTS: Following initial COVID related changes, 66.1% of participants reported worsening symptoms of sleep disruption, 27.9% reported no change, and 6.3% reported improvements. 40.3% reported worsening SH, 53.5% no change, and 6.3% improvements. At 2-week follow-up, 30.4% of participants shifted from reporting no change to SH improvements over baseline. Overall, participants showed significant worsening of symptoms of sleep disruption (sleepiness, moodiness, avolition, cognitive impairments) and SH behaviors (less consistent bed- and wake-times, more frequently staying too long in bed, more pre-bed alerting activities, more bedtime negative emotion, more use of bed for purposes other than sleep, more active technology use) (d’s from .23-1.00). Worsening sleep hygiene with COVID-19 was significantly predicted by younger age (r(157)=.164, p<.05), more avoidant coping (r(151)= -.337, p<.05), lower life satisfaction (r(156)=.200, p<.05) and greater impact/experience of COVID-19 (r(150)= -.270, p<.05). Symptoms of sleep disruption showed similar, but larger, relationships. CONCLUSION: Initial social distancing may have disrupted routines, added stress, and resulted in worsened sleep and sleep hygiene. Over time some adapted and improved, but most did not. Our results suggest change, especially crises such as a pandemic, may alter established behavior for the worse and/or add significant stress. Without intervention, even the robust, i.e., young, may suffer. Variables identifying those more vulnerable to disrupted sleep following change and those more likely to experience worsening sleep may help identify targets for future interventions.

610472,Point of care lung ultrasound is useful when screening for CoVid-19 in Emergency Department patients,2020-06-12,"Hierarchical geographical traffic networks are critical for our understanding of scaling laws in human trajectories. Here, we investigate the susceptible-infected epidemic process evolving on hierarchical networks in which agents randomly walk along the edges and establish contacts in network nodes. We employ a metapopulation modeling framework that allows us to explore the contagion spread patterns in relation to multi-scale mobility behaviors. A series of computer simulations revealed that a shifted power-law-like negative relationship between the peak timing of epidemics [Formula: see text] and population density, and a logarithmic positive relationship between [Formula: see text] and the network size, can both be explained by the gradual enlargement of fluctuations in the spreading process. We employ a semi-analytical method to better understand the nature of these relationships and the role of pertinent demographic factors. Additionally, we provide a quantitative discussion of the efficiency of a border screening procedure in delaying epidemic outbreaks on hierarchical networks, yielding a rather limited feasibility of this mitigation strategy but also its non-trivial dependence on population density, infector detectability, and the diversity of the susceptible region. Our results suggest that the interplay between the human spatial dynamics, network topology, and demographic factors can have important consequences for the global spreading and control of infectious diseases. These findings provide novel insights into the combined effects of human mobility and the organization of geographical networks on spreading processes, with important implications for both epidemiological research and health policy.","Han, Xiao-Pu; Zhao, Zhi-Dan; Hadzibeganovic, Tarik; Wang, Bing-Hong",Commun Nonlinear Sci Numer Simul,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1007570413003882; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2013.09.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288419/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570413003882,439

METHODS: All the structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 were transfected and overexpressed in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B respectively, and typical antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) ISG15 expression was detected by qRT-PCR. RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis was performed between control and Spike (S) protein-overexpressed BEAS-2B cells. The expression of ACE2 and IFN effector JAK-STAT signaling activation were detected in control and S protein-overexpressed BEAS-2B cells by qRT-PCR or/and Western blot respectively. The interaction between S protein with STAT1 and STAT2, and the association between JAK1 with downstream STAT1 and STAT2 were measured in BEAS-2B cells by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). RESULTS: S protein could activate IFN effects and downstream ISGs expression. By transcriptome analysis, overexpression of S protein induced a set of genes expression, including series of ISGs and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Mechanistically, S protein enhanced the association between the upstream JAK1 and downstream STAT1 and STAT2, so as to promote STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and ACE2 expression. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 S protein enhances ACE2 expression via facilitating IFN effects, which may help its infection.","Zhou, Ye; Wang, Mu; Li, Yunhui; Wang, Peihui; Zhao, Ping; Yang, Zixuan; Wang, Suyuan; Zhang, Liyuan; Li, Zhenyang; Jia, Kaiwei; Zhong, Cuiping; Li, Nan; Yu, Yizhi; Hou, Jin",Immunol Lett,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165247821001097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228987/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2021.06.008; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165247821001097?v=s5,439

The short- and medium-term effects of the infection have been described, but the description of the long-term sequelae is lacking in the literature. METHODS: Patients healed from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from February 2020 to May 2020 were considered for inclusion in this study, regardless of the severity of the disease during the acute phase. Eligible patients were consecutively contacted and a semistructured interview was administered between February and March 2021 by trained medical staff. RESULTS: Three hundred three patients were eligible and accepted to participate in the study and were enrolled. Of those surveyed, most patients (81%) reported at least 1 symptom, and the most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (52%), pain (48%), and sleep disorders (47%). Sensory alterations were present in 28% of surveyed patients, but in most of these cases (74% of those affected by sensory alterations or 20% of the overall sample) symptoms reported were either anosmia or dysgeusia. Higher prevalence was generally observed with increasing age, although the most relevant differences were observed when comparing young versus middle-aged adults. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were still suffering from symptoms identified at shorter follow-up, and the most frequent symptoms included fatigue, pain, and sleep disorders. A more severe impairment in the acute phase did not seem to predict more severe complications.","Lombardo, Michele Davide Maria; Foppiani, Andrea; Peretti, Giuseppe Michele; Mangiavini, Laura; Battezzati, Alberto; Bertoli, Simona; Martinelli Boneschi, Filippo; Zuccotti, Gian Vincenzo",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34386546/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofab384,439
612864,Cardiorespiratory fitness in adolescents before and after the COVID-19 confinement: a prospective cohort study,2021-03-17,"Identifying viral antagonists of innate immunity and determining if they contribute to pathogenesis are critical for developing effective strategies to control emerging viruses. Previously, we reported that an endoribonuclease (EndoU) encoded by murine coronavirus plays a pivotal role in evasion of host innate immune defenses in macrophages. Here, we asked if the EndoU activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV), which causes acute diarrhea in swine, plays a role in antagonizing the innate response in porcine epithelial cells and macrophages, the sites of viral replication. We constructed an infectious clone of PEDV-Colorado strain (icPEDV-wt) and an EndoU-mutant PEDV (icPEDV-EnUmt) by changing the codon for a catalytic histidine residue of EndoU to alanine (His226Ala). We found that both icPEDV-wt and icPEDV-EnUmt propagated efficiently in interferon (IFN)-deficient Vero cells. In contrast, the propagation of icPEDV-EnUmt was impaired in porcine epithelial cells (LLC-PK1), where we detected an early and robust transcriptional activation of type I and type III IFNs. Infection of piglets with the parental Colorado strain, icPEDV-wt, or icPEDV-EnUmt revealed that all viruses replicated in the gut and induced diarrhea; however, there was reduced viral shedding and mortality in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals. These results demonstrate that EndoU activity is not required for PEDV replication in immortalized, IFN-deficient Vero cells, but is important for suppressing the IFN response in epithelial cells and macrophages, which facilitates replication, shedding, and pathogenesis in vivo. We conclude that PEDV EndoU activity is a key virulence factor that suppresses both type I and type III IFN responses. IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) can emerge from an animal reservoir into a naive host species to cause pandemic respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases with significant mortality in humans or domestic animals. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an alphacoronavirus (alpha-CoV), infects gut epithelial cells and macrophages, inducing diarrhea and resulting in high mortality in piglets. How PEDV suppresses the innate immune response was unknown. We found that mutating a viral endoribonuclease, EndoU, results in a virus that activates both the type I interferon response and the type III interferon response in macrophages and epithelial cells. This activation of interferon resulted in limited viral replication in epithelial cell cultures and was associated with reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets. This study reveals a role for EndoU activity as a virulence factor in PEDV infection and provides an approach for generating live-attenuated vaccine candidates for emerging coronaviruses.","Deng, Xufang; van Geelen, Albert; Buckley, Alexandra C.; O’Brien, Amornrat; Pillatzki, Angela; Lager, Kelly M.; Faaberg, Kay S.; Baker, Susan C.",Journal of Virology,https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/93/8/e02000-18.full.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02000-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728254/,439

The frequency of drug-induced SIADH increases with age; as many as 20% of patients residing in nursing homes have serum sodium levels below 135 mEq/L. Mild hyponatremia is associated with cognitive changes, gait instability, and falls. Severe hyponatremia is associated with cerebral edema, seizures, permanent disability, and/or death. Although pharmacogenetic tests are now being deployed for some drugs capable of causing SIADH (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, and opioid analgesics), the implementation of these tests has been based upon the prior known association of these drugs with other serious adverse drug reactions (e.g., electrocardiographic abnormalities). Work is needed in large observational cohorts to quantify the strength of association between pharmacogene variants and drug-induced SIADH so that decision support can be developed to identify patients at high risk.","Wilke, Russell A.",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11090853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575630/,439

614888,The role of the NP in primary care of adults with autism spectrum disorder,2021-09-28,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Cytokine release syndrome is a dangerous complication of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib in the management of this complication. METHODS: The retrospective study included COVID-19 patients with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of 60–150 mg/L. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients who received tofacitinib (TOF group) and 30 patients who did not receive any anti-cytokine drugs (control [CON] group) were enrolled. Mortality and the incidence of admission to the intensive care unit were lower in the TOF group than in the CON group (16.6% vs. 40.0%, p = 0.009; and 15.6% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.004). There was a significant decrease in the volume of the affected part of the lungs (p = 0.022) and a significant increase in oxygen saturation (p = 0.012) in the TOF group than in the CON group 7–10 days after the beginning tofacitinib administration. CRP level was lower in the TOF group than in the CON group (7 [3–22] vs. 20 [5–52] mg/L; p = 0.048) 7–10 days after the start of the administration of tofacitinib. During this period, the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation or those in the prone position increased in the CON group compared to those in the TOF group (26.7% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.002; 33.3% vs. 6.7%, p = 0.020). There was no significant difference in the development of secondary infections, liver or kidney injury, and cytopenia between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib was effective and safe for managing the cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19. Randomized controlled double-blind trials with tofacitinib with and without the simultaneous use of glucocorticoids are required to confirm our findings.","Maslennikov, Roman; Ivashkin, Vladimir; Vasilieva, Ekaterina; Chipurik, Maxim; Semikova, Polina; Semenets, Victoria; Russkova, Tatyana; Levshina, Anna; Grigoriadis, Diana; Magomedov, Shamil; Efremova, Irina; Dzhakhaya, Natiya",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023513/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1094553921000511?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pupt.2021.102039; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1094553921000511,439

Popular strategies for mitigating misinformation include crowdsourcing, machine learning, and media literacy programs that require social media users to classify news in binary terms as either true or false. However, research on peer influence suggests that framing decisions in binary terms can amplify judgment errors and limit social learning, whereas framing decisions in probabilistic terms can reliably improve judgments. In this preregistered experiment, we compare online peer networks that collaboratively evaluated the veracity of news by communicating either binary or probabilistic judgments. Exchanging probabilistic estimates of news veracity substantially improved individual and group judgments, with the effect of eliminating polarization in news evaluation. By contrast, exchanging binary classifications reduced social learning and maintained polarization. The benefits of probabilistic social learning are robust to participants’ education, gender, race, income, religion, and partisanship.","Guilbeault, Douglas; Woolley, Samuel; Becker, Joshua",PLoS One,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.06019v2.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33690668/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247487,439

Youth and teen Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) are variations of adult MHFA that aims to help adults and adolescents recognize the signs and provide help where appropriate. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the current evidence for youth and teen MHFA, providing direction for future training and research. METHODS: A systematic search was performed on September 12, 2020 on PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Cochrane using keywords related to teen or youth MHFA, adolescents, and mental health. A narrative synthesis was then carried out. RESULTS: Of the 695 articles identified, 14 studies were included. All studies were from the U.S. and Australia. All studies demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge, recognition, stigmatizing attitudes, confidence, helping intentions, and helping behavior in both adult and youth participants. Improvement in knowledge and confidence was most reported, and improvement in helping behavior was the least reported. There is encouraging evidence of long-term benefits after the training. CONCLUSIONS: More studies need to be conducted in non-Western countries, high-risk populations, and different professional settings. Future interventions could also consider different modes of learning, longer-term follow-up, and the measurement of outcomes that evaluate the quality of helping behavior.","Ng, Sok Hui; Tan, Norman Jun Hao; Luo, Yang; Goh, Wei Sheng; Ho, Roger; Ho, Cyrus Su Hui",J Adolesc Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33221189/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.10.018,439

METHODS: WHO’s official COVID-19 cases were evaluated up to 27 Mar 2020. Public measures adopted by Turkey in combating the COVID-19 were examined. The compliance of those applying to Family Health Centers (FHC) with these measures was also evaluated. RESULTS: Overall, 178 people who applied to the FHC were included in the study. Of the participants, 65.2% were women, and the average age was 56.47±17.27 (Min:18, Max:92). The most frequently used personal protection (96.1%) against the epidemic was liquid soap. According to the participants, avoiding patients (99.7%) and frequent hand washing (97.2%) were stated to as the most effective measures to protect against COVID-19. One of the first and most influential bodies in the fight against COVID-19 in Turkey is the Scientific Committee consisting of academicians. Turkey has taken measures such as closing land borders, stopping all flights, vacationing schools, closing places of worship, and stopping sports events. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 has affected societies in many areas such as health, education, sports, and trade. Countries should take appropriate and timely measures to combat COVID-19. The public must comply with the precautions taken to fight COVID-19. Besides, all countries should take general precautions for public health against increasing epidemics.","DOĞAN, Mehmet; BAYRAKTAR, Muhammet",Iran J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34268207/; https://doi.org/10.18502/ijph.v49is1.3671,439

Play, a fundamental part of childhood, may be integral to children's health during crises. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of quarantine, isolation and other restrictive environments on play and whether play mitigates adverse effects of such restrictions. Fifteen peer‐reviewed studies were identified, spanning hospitals, juvenile and immigration detention and refugee camps. We found evidence of changes in children's access to play in crises and quarantine. These studies indicated how play might support children enduring isolation but lacked robust investigations of play as an intervention in mitigating impacts of restriction. Studies pertaining to children in isolation due to infectious disease outbreaks were notably absent. It is important that the potential effects of changes to such a crucial aspect of childhood are better understood to support children in this and future crises.","Graber, Kelsey M.; Byrne, Elizabeth M.; Goodacre, Emily J.; Kirby, Natalie; Kulkarni, Krishna; O'Farrelly, Christine; Ramchandani, Paul G.",Child Care Health Dev,https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238034/,439

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as a key cell entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2 and suggested to be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial infection stage. Recent studies have demonstrated that ACE2 expression is highly enriched in nasal epithelial cells and type II alveolar epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of respiratory tract as the primary target site of SARS‐CoV‐2. The expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells is tightly regulated by inflammatory milieu and environmental and internal stimuli. Very recently, ACE2 has been reported to have different expression levels in airways under distinct chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergic asthma, which may associate with the COVID‐19 risk and affect the management of primary airway diseases. In this review, we focus on the cutting‐edge progress in distribution, expression, and regulation of ACE2 in respiratory system in physiological and pathological conditions, and their implication for the development of COVID‐19. We also discuss the management of airway diseases, including asthma, COPD, allergic rhinitis, and rhinosinusitis in the era of COVID‐19.","Yao, Yin; Wang, Hai; Liu, Zheng",Clin Exp Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/cea.13746; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975865/,439

With the pandemic rapidly spreading, and health delivery systems being overwhelmed, it is imperative that safe and effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are rapidly explored to improve survival. In this paper, we use established and emerging evidence to propose a testable hypothesis that, a vicious positive feedback loop of des‐Arg(9)‐bradykinin‐ and bradykinin‐mediated inflammation → injury → inflammation, likely precipitates life threatening respiratory complications in COVID‐19. Through our hypothesis, we make the prediction that the FDA‐approved molecule, icatibant, might be able to interrupt this feedback loop and, thereby, improve the clinical outcomes. This hypothesis could lead to basic, translational, and clinical studies aimed at reducing COVID‐19 morbidity and mortality.","Roche, Joseph A.; Roche, Renuka",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32359101/; https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202000967,439

Little is known about the frequencies of VRTI in relation to visiting policies in the NICU. Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of symptomatic and asymptomatic VRTI in our family-centered NICU. Methods: This was a 12-month, prospective, observational study from February 2018 to January 2019. Infants hospitalized ≥72 h were eligible for the study. To determine the frequency of VRTI, multiplexed point-of-care testing (mPOCT) of symptomatic infants was combined with a weekly screening of all infants. Our 10-bed NICU is 24/7 open to families and visitors. The number of simultaneous visitors is restricted to two per patient. Parents and visitors are instructed in hand hygiene and advised to avoid visits in cases of respiratory illness. Siblings irrespective of age may visit the NICU following a physical check-up. Results Multiplexed point-of-care testing (71 symptomatic episodes) combined with the weekly screening (272 episodes) yielded in 21 positive samples from 2 of the 67 infants enrolled in the study. Both infants were first detected during symptomatic episodes. Rhino-/enterovirus were detected in all cases. Conclusion: Respiratory viruses were detected during symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes but affected <3% of infants enrolled in the study. In our unit, a low frequency of VRTI was attained despite adherence to family integrated care including liberal visiting policies for younger siblings.","Kidszun, André; Neurohr, Anna; Gröndahl, Britta; Tippmann, Susanne; Schreiner, Daniel; Winter, Julia; Mahmoudpour, Seyed Hamidreza; Gehring, Stephan; Mildenberger, Eva",Front Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2020.606262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33313030/,439

The internet is a major source of health information. eHealth literacy is the ability of individuals to find, assess, and use health information available on the internet. OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to assess coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and examine the relationship between eHealth literacy and COVID-19−related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs). METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults. We adapted the 8-item eHealth Literacy Scale to develop the Coronavirus-Related eHealth Literacy Scale (CoV-eHEALS) to measure COVID-19−related knowledge, conspiracy beliefs, and adherence to protective behaviors (eg, wearing facial masks and social distancing). Our analyses identified sociodemographic associations with the participants’ CoV-eHEALS scores and an association between the CoV-eHEALS measure and COVID-19 KAPs. RESULTS: The internal consistency of the adapted CoV-eHEALS measure was high (Cronbach α=.92). The mean score for the CoV-eHEALS was 29.0 (SD 6.1). A total of 29% (306/1074) of the survey participants were classified as having low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy (CoV-eHEALS score <26). Independent associations were found between CoV-eHEALS scores and ethnicity (standardized β=–.083, P=.016 for Black participants) and education level (standardized β=–.151, P=.001 for participants with high-school education or lower). Controlling for demographic characteristics, CoV-eHEALS scores demonstrated positive independent associations with knowledge (standardized β=.168, P<.001) and adherence to protective behaviors (standardized β=.241, P<.001) and a negative association with conspiracy beliefs (standardized β=–.082, P=.009). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an estimate of coronavirus-related eHealth literacy among US adults. Our findings suggest that a substantial proportion of US adults have low coronavirus-related eHealth literacy and are thus at a greater risk of lower and less-protective COVID-19 KAPs. These findings highlight the need to assess and address eHealth literacy as part of COVID-19 control efforts.

We analysed the impact of baseline immunosuppression in COVID-19 mortality and the role of severe lymphopenia in immunocompromised subjects. Methods. We analysed all patients admitted with COVID-19 in a tertiary hospital in Madrid between March 1st and April 30th 2020. Epidemiological and clinical data, including severe lymphopenia (<500 lymphocytes/mm(3)) during admission, were analysed and compared based on their baseline immunosuppression condition. Results. A total of 1594 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were hospitalised during the study period. 166 (10.4%) were immunosuppressed. Immunocompromised patients were younger (64 vs. 67 years, p = 0.02) but presented higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, heart, neurological, lung, kidney and liver disease (p < 0.05). They showed more severe lymphopenia (53% vs 24.1%, p < 0.001), lower SapO(2)/FiO(2) ratios (251 vs 276, p = 0.02) during admission and higher mortality rates (27.1% vs 13.5%, p < 0.001). After adjustment, immunosuppression remained as an independent factor related to mortality (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.24, p < 0.001). In the immunosuppressed group, age (OR = 1.06, p = 0.01), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR = 12.27, p = 0.017) and severe lymphopenia (OR = 3.48, p = 0.04) were the factors related to high mortality rate.

In the present study, we assessed the effect of the pandemic on the subjective and objective fitness of high-level nonelite runners. METHODS: The MASTERS Athletic Study is an ongoing survey of training and health habits of high-level nonelite runners, the majority of whom compete in marathons and other extreme endurance events. We invited participants to a web-based questionnaire regarding training and fitness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Comparisons were made between subjective and objective fitness as well as well as the relationship of prepandemic training volume and history of COVID-19 on change in fitness during the pandemic, using Mann–Whitney rank-sum tests and chi-square tests for nonparametric and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 189 runners completed the survey, of whom 26 (13.8%) reported prior diagnosis with COVID-19. In terms of the subjective sense of fitness compared to before the pandemic, 49 (25.9%) reported they were less fit, 55 (29.1%) reported they were more fit, and 85 (45.0%) reported their fitness was unchanged. These assessments correlated well with objective measurement of training volume in MET-min/week. Runners with improved fitness at present had a lower calculated training volume before the pandemic versus those who reported unchanged or worsened fitness. There was no relationship between the report of prior COVID-19 and either subjective or objective measures of fitness. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a variable effect on the fitness of high-level nonelite runners. We found an inverse relationship between baseline training volume and the likelihood of runners reporting improved fitness and no relationship between a history of COVID-19 and change in fitness through the pandemic. Understanding the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletic fitness will help guide strategies to maintain physical health and wellness through future public health crises.","Matsumura, Martin E.; Martin, Bryan; Matsumura, Thomas; Qureshi, Ataul",J Sports Med (Hindawi Publ Corp),https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9682520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34621903/,439

However, as a pivotal procedure before and after surgery, the inventory work of surgical instruments has not been researched with the CV-powered technologies. To reduce the risk and hazard of surgical tools’ loss, we propose a study of systematic surgical instrument classification and introduce a novel attention-based deep neural network called SKA-ResNet which is mainly composed of: (a) A feature extractor with selective kernel attention module to automatically adjust the receptive fields of neurons and enhance the learnt expression and (b) A multi-scale regularizer with KL-divergence as the constraint to exploit the relationships between feature maps. Our method is easily trained end-to-end in only one stage with few additional calculation burdens. Moreover, to facilitate our study, we create a new surgical instrument dataset called SID19 (with 19 kinds of surgical tools consisting of 3800 images) for the first time. Experimental results show the superiority of SKA-ResNet for the classification of surgical tools on SID19 when compared with state-of-the-art models. The classification accuracy of our method reaches up to 97.703%, which is well supportive for the inventory and recognition study of surgical tools.

Particularly, where the 4(th) industrial revolution is expected to fundamentally change the economy, society, and financial systems, it may also create opportunities for a zero-carbon future. Therefore, in the context of UK's legally binding commitment to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050, we analyse the role of economic growth, R&D expenditures, financial development, and energy consumption in causing carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions. Employing the bootstrapping bounds testing approach to examine short- and long-run relationships, our analysis is based on historical data from 1870 to 2017. The results suggest the existence of cointegration between CO(2) emissions and its determinants. Financial development and energy consumption lead to environmental degradation, but R&D expenditures help to reduce CO(2) emissions. The estimated environmental effects of economic growth support the EKC hypothesis. While a U-shaped relationship is found between financial development and CO(2) emissions, the nexus between R&D expenditures and CO(2) emissions is analogues to the EKC. In the context of the efforts to tackle climate change, our findings suggest policy prescriptions by using financial development and R&D expenditures as the key tools to meet the emissions target.","Shahbaz, Muhammad; Nasir, Muhammad Ali; Hille, Erik; Mahalik, Mantu Kumar",Technol Forecast Soc Change,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520310817; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120255; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040162520310817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32904903/,439
622890,Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND: Although the SARS outbreak involved few probable cases of infection in Europe, swift international spread of infections raised the possibility of outbreaks. In particular, SARS presented a sociopsychological and economic threat to European Chinese communities because of their close links with the outbreak’s origins. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted among Chinese residents in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to identify the origins of SARS risk perceptions and their impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences from the perspective of vulnerable communities living in unaffected regions. Analysis was informed by protection motivation theory. RESULTS: Results revealed that information from affected Asia influenced risk perceptions and protective behavior among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When high risk perceptions were combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidance-based precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS. These actions may have contributed to the adverse impacts of SARS on the communities. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of European Chinese communities suggest that practical and timely information, and consistent implementation of protective measures from central governments are essential to protect vulnerable populations in unaffected regions from unnecessary alarm and harm during outbreaks of emerging infections.","Jiang, Xinyi; Elam, Gillian; Yuen, Cicely; Voeten, Helene; de Zwart, Onno; Veldhuijzen, Irene; Brug, Johannes",Int J Behav Med,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12529-008-9005-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19277874/,439
622964,Dysnatremia is a predictor for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021-02-24,"Respiratory viral infections are the most important triggers of asthma exacerbations. Rhinovirus (RV), the common cold virus, is clearly the most prevalent pathogen constantly circulating in the community. This virus also stands out from other viral factors due to its large diversity (about 170 genotypes), very effective replication, a tendency to create Th2-biased inflammatory environment and association with specific risk genes in people predisposed to asthma development (CDHR3). Decreased interferon responses, disrupted airway epithelial barrier, environmental exposures (including biased airway microbiome), and nutritional deficiencies (low in vitamin D and fish oil) increase risk to RV and other virus infections. It is intensively debated whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of bronchiolitis, whereas RV starts to dominate after 1 year of age. Breathing difficulty induced by either of these viruses is associated with later asthma, but the risk is higher for those who suffer from severe RV-induced wheezing. The asthma development associated with these viruses has unique mechanisms, but in general, RV is a risk factor for later atopic asthma, whereas RSV is more likely associated with later non-atopic asthma. Treatments that inhibit inflammation (corticosteroids, omalizumab) effectively decrease RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, decreases the risk of severe RSV illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. A better understanding of personal and environmental risk factors and inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma is crucial in developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.","Jartti, Tuomas; Bønnelykke, Klaus; Elenius, Varpu; Feleszko, Wojciech",Semin Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31989228/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00281-020-00781-5,439

Self-quarantine was suggested by Chinese government to block the spread of the COVID-19. During the self-quarantine, the media played an indispensable role in acquisition of information about the disease. And it could also impact on people's mental health. Therefore, it is necessary to study the psychological outcome resulted from media use during the outbreak of COVID-19. The data in this article could help researchers to explore the mechanism between media use and mental health, and to have a deeper comprehension of the impact of media use on mental health during a public health emergency.

626557,Adult cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Tiered Patient Triage Guidance Statement,2020-04-16,"Dysregulation of the inflammatory response in humans can lead to various inflammatory diseases, like asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. The innate branch of the immune system, including macrophage and neutrophil functions, plays a critical role in all inflammatory diseases. This part of the immune system is well-conserved between humans and the zebrafish, which has emerged as a powerful animal model for inflammation, because it offers the possibility to image and study inflammatory responses in vivo at the early life stages. This review focuses on different inflammation models established in zebrafish, and how they are being used for the development of novel anti-inflammatory drugs. The most commonly used model is the tail fin amputation model, in which part of the tail fin of a zebrafish larva is clipped. This model has been used to study fundamental aspects of the inflammatory response, like the role of specific signaling pathways, the migration of leukocytes, and the interaction between different immune cells, and has also been used to screen libraries of natural compounds, approved drugs, and well-characterized pathway inhibitors. In other models the inflammation is induced by chemical treatment, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and copper, and some chemical-induced models, such as treatment with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), specifically model inflammation in the gastro-intestinal tract. Two mutant zebrafish lines, carrying a mutation in the hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1a gene (hai1a) and the cdp-diacylglycerolinositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (cdipt) gene, show an inflammatory phenotype, and they provide interesting model systems for studying inflammation. These zebrafish inflammation models are often used to study the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, to increase our understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of drugs and to develop novel glucocorticoid drugs. In this review, an overview is provided of the available inflammation models in zebrafish, and how they are used to unravel molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory response and to screen for novel anti-inflammatory drugs.","Xie, Yufei; Meijer, Annemarie H.; Schaaf, Marcel J.

626847,Cardiorespiratory Fitness Attenuates the Impact of Risk Factors Associated With COVID-19 Hospitalization,2021-01-20,"BACKGROUND: A variety of in-service emergency care training courses are currently being promoted as a strategy to improve the quality of care provided to seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries. Most courses have been developed in high-income countries. However, whether these courses improve the ability of health professionals to provide appropriate care in low-income countries remains unclear. This is the first update of the original review. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of in-service emergency care training on health professionals' treatment of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com); MEDLINE, Ovid SP; EMBASE, Ovid SP; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), part of The Cochrane Library (http://www.cochranelibrary.com) (including the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register); Science Citation Index and Social Sciences Citation Index, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Knowledge/Science and eight other databases. We performed database searches in February 2015. We also searched clinical trial registries, websites of relevant organisations and reference lists of related reviews. We applied no date, language or publication status restrictions when conducting the searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted-time-series studies that compared the effects of in-service emergency care training versus usual care were eligible for inclusion. We included only hospital-based studies and excluded community-based studies. Two review authors independently screened and selected studies for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) for each outcome using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We described results and presented them in GRADE tables. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In-service neonatal emergency care courses probably improve health professionals' treatment of seriously ill babies in the short term. Further multi-centre randomised trials evaluating the effects of in-service emergency care training on long-term outcomes (health professional practice and patient outcomes) are needed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In-service training for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries WHAT QUESTION WAS THE REVIEW ASKING? This is the first update of the original Cochrane review, whose objective was to find out whether additional emergency care training programmes can improve the ability of health workers in poor countries to care for seriously ill newborns and children admitted to hospitals. Researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all studies that could answer this question and found two relevant studies. WHAT ARE THE KEY MESSAGES? The review authors suggest that giving health professionals in poor countries additional training in emergency care probably improves their ability to care for seriously ill newborns. We need additional high-quality studies, including studies in which health professionals are trained to care for seriously ill older children. BACKGROUND: TRAINING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO CARE FOR SERIOUSLY ILL BABIES AND CHILDREN: In poor countries, many babies and children with serious illnesses die even though they have been cared for in hospitals. One reason for this may be that health workers in these countries often are not properly trained to offer the care that these children need. In poor countries, children often become seriously ill because of conditions such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea, and may need emergency care. For newborn babies, the most common reason for emergency care is too little oxygen to the baby during birth. If this goes on for too long, the person delivering the baby has to help the baby breathe, and sometimes has to get the baby's heart rate back to normal. This is called neonatal resuscitation. Neonatal resuscitation is a skilled task, and the health worker needs proper training. As babies need to be resuscitated quickly, the health worker needs to know how to prepare for this before the baby is born. For instance, he or she needs to know how to prepare the room and proper equipment. Health workers in poor countries often do not have these skills, and these babies are likely to die. Babies can also be harmed if the health worker does not resuscitate the baby correctly. Several training programmes have been developed to teach health workers how to give emergency care to seriously ill babies and children. But most of these have been developed and tested in wealthy countries, and we don't know whether they would work in poor countries. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN POOR COUNTRIES ARE GIVEN EXTRA TRAINING? The review authors found two relevant studies. These studies compared the practices of health professionals who had been given extra training in the care of newborns with the practices of health professionals who did not receive extra training. In the first study, nurses at a maternity hospital in Kenya completed a one-day training course on how to resuscitate newborn babies. This course was adapted from the UK Resuscitation Council, and it included lectures and practical training. The study suggests that after these training courses: health professionals are probably more likely to resuscitate newborn babies correctly (moderate certainty of the evidence); and newborn babies may be less likely to die while being resuscitated (low certainty of the evidence). In the second study, doctors, nurses and midwives in five Sri Lankan hospitals were given a four-day training course on how to prepare for and provide care for newborns. This course was adapted from the World Health Organization (WHO) Training Modules on Essential Newborn Care and Breastfeeding, and included lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. This study suggests that after these training courses: health professionals probably are more likely to be well prepared to resuscitate newborn babies (moderate certainty of the evidence). Unfortunately, the two studies followed up with health professionals for only two to three months after they received training. We therefore don't know if the benefits of the training courses lasted over time. The review authors found no studies that looked at the effects of training programmes on the care of older children. HOW UP-TO-DATE IS THIS REVIEW? Review authors searched for studies that had been published up to February 2015.","Opiyo, Newton; English, Mike",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25968066/; https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd007071.pub3,439

Albeit important, criteria such as these obscure other key metrics of success such as the role of the interactions between participants and intervention deliverers, or contextual factors that shape an intervention’s activities and outcomes. In line with advocacy to expand evaluation criteria for health interventions, we designed this qualitative study to examine how a subsample of Black men in MEN Count, an HIV/STI risk reduction and healthy relationship intervention with employment and housing stability case management for Black men in Washington, DC, defined the intervention’s success. We also examined the contextual factors that shaped participation in the study’s peer counseling sessions. We conducted structured interviews with 38 Black men, ages 18 to 60 years (M = 31.1, SD = 9.33) who completed at least one of three peer counseling sessions. Analyses highlighted three key themes: (a) the favorable impact of Mr. Stroman, the lead peer counselor, on participants’ willingness to participate in MEN Count and disclose their challenges—we dubbed this the “Stroman Effect”; (b) the importance of Black men intervention deliverers with relatable life experiences; and (c) how contextual factors such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic, needs for housing and employment services and safe spaces to talk about challenges, and absentee fathers shaped participation. We discuss the study’s implications for sustainable programs after funding ends and future multilevel health interventions to promote health equity for poor urban Black men.","Bowleg, Lisa; Massie, Jenné S.; Holt, Sidney L.; Boone, Cheriko A.; Mbaba, Mary; Stroman, Wayne A.; Urada, Lianne; Raj, Anita",Am J Mens Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1557988320943352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32693659/,439

Viral pseudotypes have proven to be powerful tools to study the effects of viral evolution on serological outcomes, viral tropism and immunogenicity studies. Pseudotyped viruses are chimeric constructs in which the outer (surface) glycoprotein(s) of one virus is combined with the replication-defective viral “core” of another virus. Pseudotypes allow for accurate, sequence-directed, sensitive antibody neutralisation assays and antiviral screening to be conducted within a low biosecurity facility and offer a safe and efficient alternative to wildtype virus use. The protocol outlined here represents a rapid and reliable method for the generation of high-titre pseudotype viral particles with the MERS-CoV spike protein on a lentiviral core, and is adapted from previously published protocols. This protocol is optimised for transfection in a 100 mm Petri dish with 7 ml of supernatant harvested, however it can be readily scaled to different production volumes. This protocol has a number of advantages including: • Use of readily available reagents. • Consistent, high virus titres. • Rapid generation of novel glycoproteins for research into strain variation.","Grehan, K.; Ferrara, F.; Temperton, N.",MethodsX,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016115000461; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2215016115000461; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26587388/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2015.09.003,439
630764,"Hospital mortality and resource implications of hospitalisation with COVID-19 in London, UK: a prospective cohort study",2020-07-17,At times of personalized and individualized medicine the concept of randomized- controlled clinical trials (RCTs) is being questioned. This review article explains principles of evidence-based medicine in oncology and shows an example of how evidence can be generated independently from RCTs. Personalized medicine involves molecular analysis of tumor properties and targeted therapy with small molecule inhibitors. Individualized medicine involves the whole patient (tumor and host) in the context of immunotherapy. The example is called Individualized Multimodal Immunotherapy (IMI). It is based on the individuality of immunological tumor–host interactions and on the concept of immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) induced by an oncolytic virus. The evidence is generated by systematic data collection and analysis. The outcome is then shared with the scientific and medical community. The priority of big pharma studies is commercial benefit. Methods used to achieve this are described and have damaged the image of RCT studies in general. A critical discussion is recommended between all partners of the medical health system with regard to the conduct of RCTs by big pharma companies. Several clinics and institutions in Europe try to become more independent from pharma industry and to develop their own modern cancer therapeutics. Medical associations should include references to such studies from personalized and individualized medicine in their guidelines.,"Schirrmacher, Volker; Sprenger, Tobias; Stuecker, Wilfried; Van Gool, Stefaan W.",Biomedicines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717895/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines8080237,439

There is some concern that patients with immuno-mediated diseases such as IBD, which are frequently treated with immunosuppressive therapies, may have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection with its related serious adverse outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and biologic drugs, which are commonly prescribed to these patients, have been associated with higher rates of severe viral and bacterial infections including influenza and pneumonia. It is not known whether these drugs can be so harmful as to justify their interruption during COVID-19 infection or if, on the contrary, patients with IBD can benefit from them. As shown by recent reports, it cannot be excluded that drugs that suppress the immune system can block the characteristic cytokine storm of severe forms of COVID-19 and consequently reduce mortality. Another cause for concern is the up-regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors that has been noticed in these patients, which could facilitate the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this narrative review is to clarify the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD, the clinical characteristics of patients who contract the infection, and the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and immunosuppressive treatment.","Corrias, Angelica; Cortes, Gian Mario; Bardanzellu, Flaminia; Melis, Alice; Fanos, Vassilios; Marcialis, Maria Antonietta",Children (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/children8090753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34572185/,439

The clinical utility of Ct values remains unclear for gastrointestinal infections. Objectives: This systematic review assesses the global medical literature for associations between Ct values of gastrointestinal pathogens and patient presentation and clinical outcomes. Data Sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library databases: searched January 14–17, 2020. Study Eligibility Criteria: Studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values and clinical outcomes in adult and pediatric populations were included. Animal studies, reviews, meta-analyses, and non-English language studies were excluded. Participants: Humans infected with gastrointestinal pathogens, detected with qPCR. Interventions: Diagnostics assessing Ct values. Extracted data were reported narratively. Results: Thirty-three eligible studies were identified; the most commonly studied pathogens were Clostridioides difficile (n = 15), norovirus (n = 10), and rotavirus (n = 9). Statistically significant associations between low C. difficile Ct values and increased symptom severity or poor outcome were reported in 4/8 (50%) studies, and increased risk of death in 1/2 (50%) studies; no significant associations were found between Ct value and duration of symptoms or length of hospital stay. Among studies of norovirus, 5/7 (71%), mainly genogroup II, reported symptomatic cases with significantly lower median Ct values than controls. Significantly lower rotavirus Ct values were also observed in symptomatic cases vs. controls in 3/7 (43%) studies, and associated with more severe symptoms in 2/2 studies. Contradictory associations were identified for non-C. difficile bacterial and parasitic pathogens. Conclusions: In conclusion, some studies reported clinically useful associations between Ct values and patient or healthcare outcomes; additional, well-designed, large-scale trials are warranted based on these findings.

Risk factors for severe COVID-19 include diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is no vaccine and no approved therapy. Therapeutic approaches are aimed at preventing viral replication and spread, limiting the impact of the inflammatory overdrive (cytokine storm), preventing thromboembolic complications and replacing or supporting organ function. However, despite organ support, mortality is currently 65% for those receiving advanced respiratory support and 78% for those requiring renal replacement therapies. Thus, efforts should be made to provide adjuvant organ protection therapy. This may imply novel therapies in clinical development (e.g., the Fas ligand trap asunercept), but uptake of repurposed drugs already in clinical use may be faster. In this regard, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were recently shown to protect the heart and kidney both within and outside of a diabetic milieu context. Further, preclinical data support a beneficial effect for the lung. We now discuss the potential benefits and risks of SGLT2 inhibitors in COVID-19 and an ongoing clinical trial testing the impact of dapagliflozin on outcomes in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.","Fernandez-Fernandez, Beatriz; D’Marco, Luis; Górriz, Jose Luis; Jacobs-Cachá, Conxita; Kanbay, Mehmet; Luis-Lima, Sergio; Porrini, Esteban; Sarafidis, Pantelis; Soler, María José; Ortiz, Alberto",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605278/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072030,439

Therefore, reviewing the collated clinical characteristics of non-survivors might assist in current preventive efforts, triaging, and management of survivors. The aim of this review was to summarize the clinical characteristics of non-survivor cases due to the infection caused by a novel coronavirus and to identify the relevant data that might put the new cases at increased mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have identified three published articles on novel coronavirus reported during December 01, 2020, to March 15, 2020, which have described the mortality rate in Wuhan, Hubei, China. RESULTS: The mean duration of studies (i.e., the three retrospective studies with 278 cases) was 24.7 days, and the duration of onset to dyspnea was variable between 8 and 5 days. The main reported complications were acute respiratory distress, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and acute cardiac disease. The overall major comorbidity reported was cardiovascular diseases at 23.7% (66 of 278). The reported overall mortality rate was 8.3% (23 of 278), with the highest mortality rate of 15.0% (6 of 41) reported in Jin Yintan Hospital at Wuhan city. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical characteristics of the non-survivors from the novel coronavirus included adult males, aged older than 50 years, having comorbidities of cardiovascular disease, respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and diabetes with higher admission to the intensive care unit. The mortality rate was high in two of the reported studies (15.0% and 11.0%), which was decreased in the later-dated study to 3.4%.","Elnour, Asim Ahmed; Don, Judit; Yousif, Isra; Gnana, Kishore; Abdi, Semira; Alhajri, Noora; Al Amoodi, Abdulla; Fathelrahman, Ahmed Ibrahim; Mohammed Magboul1, Salma; Mohamed, Sasha; Ahmed, Sahar Asim; Sadeq, Adel",J Pharm Bioallied Sci,https://doi.org/10.4103/jpbs.jpbs_282_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100781/,439

Three cases presented in this article show several different perspectives where telehealth was utilized. For the first patient, appointments were successfully completed via telehealth;however, the patient's family opted to continue with an unsecure internet connection at a local laundromat. For the second patient, a stable internet connection could not be obtained in his home, thus making telehealth appointments unavailable. The caregiver of this patient ended up driving to the clinic to have adjustments made in person. For the third patient, telehealth appointments were unavailable due to unstable internet connections as well as difficulty setting up video interpreting services. These cases highlight the idea that telehealth can be incredibly beneficial, when used correctly. For some, the option to attend appointments virtually gives them access to specialists that otherwise may not be available. For other patients, aspects such as access to smart devices and steady internet access must be considered to ensure a successful connection. The hope is that this article sheds light on some of the potential setbacks that can come from the use of telehealth appointments in a practice and provides discussion regarding for whom telehealth may be appropriate, even in pediatric patients.

As such, EDs must be able to reorganize and reformat operations to meet the changing needs and staggering patient volume. This paper addresses ways to adapt departmental operations to better manage in times of elevated disease burden, specifically identifying areas of intervention to help limit crowding and spread. Using experience from past outbreaks and the current COVID-19 pandemic, we advise strategies to increase surge capacity and limit patient inflow. Triage should identify and geographically cohort symptomatic patients within a designated unit to limit exposure early in an outbreak. Screening and PPE guidelines for both patient and staff should be followed closely, as determined by hospital administration and the CDC. Equipment needs are also greatly affected in an outbreak; we emphasis portable radiographic equipment to limit transport, and an upstocking of certain medications, respiratory supplies, and PPE.","Whiteside, Tess; Kane, Erin; Aljohani, Bandar; Alsamman, Marya; Pourmand, Ali",Am J Emerg Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S073567572030262X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336583/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073567572030262X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.04.032,439

HCC remains a global health problem and is highly aggressive with unfavorable prognosis. Even with surgical interventions and newer medical treatment regimens, patients with HCC have poor survival rates. These limited therapeutic strategies and mechanistic understandings of HCC immunopathogenesis urgently warrant non-palliative treatment measures. Irrespective of the multitude etiologies, the liver microenvironment in HCC is intricately associated with chronic necroinflammation, progressive fibrosis, and cirrhosis as precedent events along with dysregulated innate and adaptive immune responses. Central to these immunological networks is the complement cascade (CC), a fundamental defense system inherent to the liver which tightly regulates humoral and cellular responses to noxious stimuli. Importantly, the liver is the primary source for biosynthesis of >80% of complement components and expresses a variety of complement receptors. Recent studies implicate the complement system in liver inflammation, abnormal regenerative responses, fibrosis, carcinogenesis, and development of HCC. Although complement activation differentially promotes immunosuppressive, stimulant, and angiogenic microenvironments conducive to HCC development, it remains under-investigated. Here, we review derangement of specific complement proteins in HCC in the context of altered complement regulatory factors, immune-activating components, and their implications in disease pathogenesis. We also summarize how complement molecules regulate cancer stem cells (CSCs), interact with complement-coagulation cascades, and provide therapeutic opportunities for targeted intervention in HCC.","Malik, Astha; Thanekar, Unmesha; Amarachintha, Surya; Mourya, Reena; Nalluri, Shreya; Bondoc, Alexander; Shivakumar, Pranavkumar",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33718121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.627701,439

The possibility of lung involvement was ruled out by thoracic computed tomography. Despite stable vital signs, we reduced the intensity of immunosuppressive therapy and maintained home self-isolation promptly.

Six-species biofilms were enzymatically treated by anaerobic growth in a medium containing DNase I and proteinase K. Biofilms were exposed to a low concentration of CHX at defined time points. After 64h, biofilms were either harvested and quantified by cultural analyses or stained for confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analyses using either Live/Dead kit or different fluorescent dyes. A mixture of YoPro1 and SYTOX(™) Green, Fluorescent Brightener 28 (Calcofluor), and SYPRO(™) Ruby Protein Gel Stain was used to stain total DNA, exopolysaccharides, and extracellular proteins, respectively. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) was visualized via an indirect immunofluorescence assay (Mouse anti-DNA IgG, Goat anti-Mouse IgG, Streptavidin-Cy3). Overall, the total colony-forming units significantly decreased after combined treatment with a low concentration of CHX and enzymes compared to the group treated with CHX alone (p<0.001). These findings also apply to five species individually (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus oralis, Actinomyces oris, Veillonella dispar, and Candida albicans) occurring in the biofilms, with Fusobacterium nucleatum being the only exception. Furthermore, CLSM images showed less dense biofilms and a reduction in cell numbers after combined treatment compared to the group without enzymes. The combination of enzymes capable of disturbing the matrix integrity with antimicrobial agents thus appears to be a promising approach for biofilm disruption and killing.","Gränicher, Kay Andrin; Karygianni, Lamprini; Attin, Thomas; Thurnheer, Thomas",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650542/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.741863,439

This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring.","Eisenkraft, Arik; Maor, Yasmin; Constantini, Keren; Goldstein, Nir; Nachman, Dean; Levy, Ran; Halberthal, Michael; Horowitz, Netanel A.; Golan, Ron; Rosenberg, Elli; Lavon, Eitan; Cohen, Ornit; Shapira, Guy; Shomron, Noam; Ishay, Arik Ben; Sand, Efrat; Merin, Roei; Fons, Meir; Littman, Romi; Gepner, Yftach",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575328/,439
639752,"Reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients treated with colchicine: Results from a retrospective, observational study",2021-03-24,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to gain an understanding of the paradox of the immunity in COVID‐19 patients with T cells showing both functional defects and hyperactivation and enhanced proliferation. METHODS: A total of 280 hospitalised patients with COVID‐19 were evaluated for cytokine profiles and clinical features including viral shedding. A mouse model of acute infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was applied to dissect the relationship between immunological, virological and pathological features. The results from the mouse model were validated by published data set of single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID‐19 patients. RESULTS: The levels of soluble CD25 (sCD25), IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐10 and TNF‐α were higher in severe COVID‐19 patients than non‐severe cases, but only sCD25 was identified as an independent risk factor for disease severity by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis and showed a positive association with the duration of viral shedding. In agreement with the clinical observation, LCMV‐infected mice with high levels of sCD25 demonstrated insufficient anti‐viral response and delayed viral clearance. The elevation of sCD25 in mice was mainly contributed by the expansion of CD25(+)CD8(+) T cells that also expressed the highest level of PD‐1 with pro‐inflammatory potential. The counterpart human CD25(+)PD‐1(+) T cells were expanded in BALF of COVID‐19 patients with severe disease compared to those with modest disease. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that high levels of sCD25 in COVID‐19 patients probably result from insufficient anti‐viral immunity and indicate an expansion of pro‐inflammatory T cells that contribute to disease severity.","Xie, Min; Yunis, Joseph; Yao, Yin; Shi, Jing; Yang, Yang; Zhou, Pengcheng; Liang, Kaili; Wan, Yanmin; Mehdi, Ahmed; Chen, Zhian; Wang, Naiqi; Xu, Shuyun; Zhou, Min; Yu, Muqing; Wang, Ke; Tao, Yu; Zhou, Ying; Li, Xiaochen; Liu, Xiansheng; Yu, Xiao; Wei, Yunbo; Liu, Zheng; Sprent, Jonathan; Yu, Di",Clin Transl Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614032/; https://doi.org/10.1002/cti2.1251,439

Preliminary reports indicate a higher incidence of barotrauma in patients with C-ARDS[1] both on invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) This study examines the incidence and risk factors for barotrauma and change in outcomes after barotrauma in patients with severe C-ARDS on positive pressure respiratory support (PPRS). Methods and materials: This is a retrospective study of C-ARDS associated barotrauma over 5 months in patients on PPRS in a tertiary COVID care center. The type of barotrauma, intervention, related factors, such as type of respiratory support (iMV vs NIV), airway pressure prior to the occurrence of barotrauma, and post-barotrauma outcomes were analyzed. Results: A total of 38/410 (9.3%) C-ARDS patients on PPRS [mean age 57.82 +/- 13.3(SD) years, 32 males (84.2%)] developed barotrauma. Of these, 20 patients (52.6%) were on NIV and 18 (47.4%) patients were iMV on standard recommended settings. The median P/F ratio of patients on MV at the time of barotrauma was 116.4 (IQR 72.4, 193.25). The details of barotrauma were as follows: 24 patients had pneumothorax (PTX), 2 had pneumo-mediastinum and 12 had subcutaneous emphysema. Overall, 24/38 (63.2%) patients, including 15/18 (83.3%) on MV succumbed to their illness. The barotrauma happened a median of 6.5 days (IQR 4.75,13) after admission and 15 days (IQR 10.25,18.0) from symptom onset. The median duration from barotrauma to death was 7 days (IQR 2.25, 8.0) and barotrauma to discharge (for survivors) was 12.5 days (IQR 8.0, 21.25). All patients received steroids and 11/38 (28.9%) received additional immunosuppression with tocilizumab. Conclusion: A high incidence of barotrauma was seen in this large series of severe C-ARDS patients on PPRS. Barotrauma led to further deterioration in the clinical status leading to a fatal outcome in the majority of the MV patients, despite prompt treatment.","Kalpakam, H.; Bansal, S.; Suresh, N. .; Kade, S.; Thorbole, A.; Mehta, R.

The circulation of new variants with emerging clinical characteristics requires more studies focusing the impact of preexisting health conditions on outcome of COVID-19 accurately. AIMS: Main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) on disease prognosis and severe health outcomes among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on 799 patients with COVID-19 during December 10, 2020, to February 10, 2020 in Bangladesh. Logistic regression analysis was performed for age, sex, diabetes, CVD and symptoms on fatality. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to predict the survival rate. RESULTS: Fatality was detected in 40% (318 of 799) patients with COVID-19. Among 318 fatalities, 90.6% were detected in patients with CVD and 74.5% in patients with diabetes. Case fatality rate was highest in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (94, 184 of 195). Fever (91%) and dry cough (71%) were the most frequent symptoms. CVD (42.2%), diabetes (32.7%) and obesity (18%) were prevalent. The highest odds of risk was detected in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes (OR: 6.98, 95% CI, 4.21 to 7.34). Female patients had the highest survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 318 fatality was seen in 799 patients with COVID-19. The highest odds of fatality risk was detected in patients with COVID-19, CVD and diabetes. The risk increased many folds when CVD and diabetes coexisted in patients.","Sharif, Nadim; Ahmed, Shamsun Nahar; Opu, Rubayet Rayhan; Tani, Mahmuda Rahman; Dewan, Dolly; Daullah, Muktasid Ud; Shanto, Rakibul Islam; Parvez, Anowar Khasru; Talukder, Ali Azam; Dey, Shuvra Kanti",Diabetes Metab Syndr,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1871402121001430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993046/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1871402121001430?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2021.05.005,439

The objective was to assess the impact of the first lockdown on LBP course among chronic LBP patients. METHODS: Descriptive and analytical, cross-sectional, multicenter study, conducted by questionnaire from mid-May to end of June 2020 among patients treated for chronic LBP in 6 French and 1 Swiss center. Collected data concerned changes in LBP intensity during lockdown, lockdown experience, physical activity (PA) practice and sedentary lifestyle prior and during lockdown, recourse to care, consumption of psychoactive substances for LBP, and professional activity and its conditions during lockdown. RESULTS: 360 participants (58.6% women, 52.1 ± 13.4 years) were included of which 65% were active (63% keep on working of which 54% teleworked). LBP got worse in 41.1%, mean VAS went from 49.5 ± 21.6 before to 53.5 ± 22.4 during lockdown (p < 0.001) and needed increase of treatment by 29% but very few people increased their consumption psychoactive substances for analgesia. Half of participants had well-experienced lockdown. Findings revealed a significant decrease in PA and increase of sedentary during lockdown (p < 0.0001). Good experience of lockdown was associated with LBP improvement (OR = 0.6 [0.3–0.9]) and decrease of PA with LBP worsening (OR = 1.9 [1.1–3.2]). Teleworking was also associated with LBP worsening. Gender, age, or BMI did not influence LBP course. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that chronic LBP people suffered from increase in self-perceived LBP during lockdown and help to better understand the factors associated with their condition.

Some medications which are used to treat other diseases seem to be effective in treating COVID-19 even without explicit support. The existing drugs that are summarized in this review primarily focused on therapeutic agents that possessed activity against other RNA viruses such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Drug repurposing or repositioning is a promising field in drug discovery that identifies new therapeutic opportunities for existing drugs such as corticosteroids, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors, interferons, protease inhibitors, ivermectin, melatonin, teicoplanin, and some others. A search for new drug/drug targets is underway. Thus, blocking coronavirus structural protein, targeting viral enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, and membrane fusion blocker (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and CD147 inhibitor) are major sites based on molecular targets for the management of COVID-19 infection. The possible impact of biologics for the management of COVID19 is promising and includes a wide variety of options such as cytokines, nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression, bioengineered and vectored antibodies, and various types of vaccines. This review demonstrates that the available data are not sufficient to suggest any treatment for the eradication of COVID-19 to be used at the clinical level.

In this study, we investigate the presence of PDCoV in diagnostic samples, which were further categorized by case identification (ID), and the association between occurrence, age, specimen and location between March and September 2014. Approximately, 7% of the case IDs submitted from the US were positive for PDCoV. Specimens were categorized into eight groups, and the univariate analysis indicated that oral fluids had 1.89 times higher odds of detecting PDCoV compared to feces. While the 43–56 day age group had the highest percentage of PDCoV positives (8.4%), the univariate analysis indicated no significant differences between age groups. However, multivariable analysis for age adjusted by specimen indicated the >147 day age group had 59% lower odds than suckling pigs of being positive for PDCoV. The percentage of PDCoV in diagnostic samples decreased to <1% in September 2014. In addition, 19 complete PDCoV genomes were sequenced, and Bayesian analysis was conducted to estimate the emergence of the US clade. The evolutionary rate of the PDCoV genome is estimated to be 3.8 × 10(−4) substitutions/site/year (2.3 × 10(−4)–5.4 × 10(−4), 95% HPD). Our results indicate that oral fluids continue to be a valuable specimen to monitor swineherd health, and PDCoV has been circulating in the US prior to 2014.","Homwong, Nitipong; Jarvis, Matthew C.; Lam, Ham Ching; Diaz, Andres; Rovira, Albert; Nelson, Martha; Marthaler, Douglas",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26611652/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300453; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300453; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.11.001,439

We determined prevalence and predictors of empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Randomly sampled cohort of 1705 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in 38 Michigan hospitals between 3/13/2020-6/18/2020. Data were collected on early (prescribed within 2 days of hospitalization) empiric antibacterial therapy and community-onset bacterial co-infections (positive culture or diagnostic test within 3 days). Poisson generalized estimating equation models were used to assess predictors of empiric antibacterial use. RESULTS: Of 1705 patients with COVID-19, 56.6% were prescribed early empiric antibacterial therapy; 3.5% (59/1705) had a confirmed community-onset bacterial infection. Across hospitals, early empiric antibacterial use varied from 27%-84%. Patients were more likely to receive early empiric antibacterial therapy if they were older (adjusted rate ratio [ARR]: 1.04 [1.00-1.08] per 10 years), had a lower body mass index (ARR: 0.99 [0.99-1.00] per kg/m (2)), had more severe illness (e.g., severe sepsis, ARR: 1.16 [1.07-1.27]), had a lobar infiltrate (ARR: 1.21 [1.04-1.42]), or were admitted to a for-profit hospital (ARR: 1.30 [1.15-1.47]). Over time, COVID-19 test turnaround time (returned ≤1 day in March [54.2%, 461/850] vs. in April [85.2%, 628/737], P<.001) and empiric antibacterial use (ARR: 0.71 [0.63-0.81] April vs. March) decreased. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of confirmed community-onset bacterial co-infections was low. Despite this, half of patients received early empiric antibacterial therapy. Antibacterial use varied widely by hospital.

Patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) are in a particularly difficult situation. The purpose of the present study was to contribute to the very limited research on the everyday aspects of functioning in PID patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The survey included 85 adult PID patients treated with immunoglobulin replacement therapy in four reference centers for immunology. Everyday functioning of the patients as well as their opinion concerning new solutions in medical care were analyzed. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of patients experiencing fear/anxiety has increased from 47% to 70%. The wide dissemination of information about the SARS-CoV-2 in the media has increased anxiety in 40% of the patients. Patients diagnosed with PID were most afraid of the exposure to contact with strangers, especially in public places. As many as 67 respondents (79%) considered the introduction of restrictions concerning social functioning as good. Only every fifth person learned about the pandemic from reliable sources. Eighty three percent of the patients receiving immunoglobulin substitution experienced less fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients positively evaluated the solutions related to the direct delivery of drugs to the place of residence in order to continue home IgRT therapy. Fifty three respondents (62.5%) believed that the possibility of a remote consultation was a very good solution. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to increase educational activities concerning the pandemic provided by health care professionals, as patients obtain information mainly from the media and the Internet, which adversely affects the feeling of anxiety. The pandemic, in addition to the very negative impact on patients and the deterioration of their daily functioning, has made patients appreciate their life more, devote more time to family and friends, and do things they like.","Napiórkowska-Baran, Katarzyna; Rosada, Tomasz; Więsik-Szewczyk, Ewa; Ziętkiewicz, Marcin; Matyja-Bednarczyk, Aleksandra; Baranowska, Karolina; Alska, Ewa; Tykwińska, Marta; Szynkiewicz, Ewa; Zacniewski, Robert; Grochowalska, Kinga; Bartuzi, Zbigniew",Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1177/20587384211044344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34565194/,439

To provide an overview of the landscape of therapeutic research for COVID-19, we conducted a review of registered clinical trials. Methods: A review of currently registered clinical trials was performed on registries, including the Chinese (chictr.org.cn) and US (clinicaltrials.gov) databases to identify relevant studies up to March, 7th 2020. The search was conducted using the search terms “2019-nCoV”, “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Hcov-19”, “new coronavirus”, “novel coronavirus”. We included interventional clinical trials focusing on patients with COVID-19 and assessing antiviral drugs or agents. Findings: Out of the 353 studies identified, 115 clinical trials were selected for data extraction. Phase IV trials were the most commonly reported study type (n=27, 23%). However, 62 trials (54%) did not describe the phase of the study. Eighty percent (n=92) of the trials were randomized with parallel assignment and the median number of planned inclusions was 63 (IQR, 36-120). Open-label studies were the most frequent (46%) followed by double-blind (13%) and single blind studies (10%). The most frequently assessed therapies were: stem cells therapy (n=23 trials), lopinavir/ritonavir (n=15), chloroquine (n=11), umifenovir (n=9), hydroxychloroquine (n=7), plasma treatment (n=7), favipiravir (n=7), methylprednisolone (n=5), and remdesivir (n=5). Remdesivir was tested in 5 trials with a median of 400 (IQR, 394-453) planned inclusions per trial, while stem cells therapy was tested in 23 trials, but had a median of 40 (IQR, 23-60) planned inclusions per trial. Lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with the highest total number of planned inclusions (2606) followed by remdesivir (2155). Only 52% of the clinical trials reported the treatment dose (n=60) and only 34% (n=39) the duration. The primary outcome was clinical in 76 studies (66%), virological in 27 (23%); radiological in 9 (8%) or immunological in three studies (3%).

This drill provided the opportunity to evaluate the ability of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (NYC-DOHMH) emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system to detect a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness. METHODS: The evaluation was a prospective simulation. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill as mock patients. RESULTS: Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH. The electronic chief complaint for 24 (57%) of these patients indicated febrile or respiratory illness. The drill did not generate a statistical signal in the NYC-DOHMH SaTScan analysis. The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 hierarchical categories based on chief complaints: sepsis (2), cold (3), diarrhea (2), respiratory (20), fever/flu (4), vomit (3), and other (8). The number of respiratory visits, while elevated on the day of the drill, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used for spatial analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This drill with a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness failed to trigger a signal from the NYC-DOHMH emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system.

The focus was set to create organoid-derived monolayers (ODMs) using the transwell system amenable for infection studies, and we provide straightforward guidelines for their generation and differentiation from organ-derived intestinal crypts. To this end, we reduced medium variations to an absolute minimum, allowing generation and differentiation of three-dimensional organoids for all four species and the subsequent generation of ODMs. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunolabeling with antibodies against marker proteins as well as transepithelial-electrical resistance (TEER) measurements were used to characterize ODM’s integrity and functional state. These experiments show an overall uniform generation of monolayers suitable for Toxoplasma gondii infection, although robustness in terms of generation of stable TEER levels and cell differentiation status varies from species to species. Murine duodenal ODMs were then infected with T. gondii and/or Giardia duodenalis, two parasites that temporarily co-inhabit the intestinal niche but have not been studied previously in cellular co-infection models. T. gondii alone did not alter TEER values, integrity and transcriptional abundance of tight junction components. In contrast, in G. duodenalis-infected ODMs all these parameters were altered and T. gondii had no apparent influence on the G. duodenalis-triggered phenotype. In conclusion, we provide robust protocols for the generation, differentiation and characterization of intestinal organoids and ODMs from four species. We show their applications for comparative studies on parasite-host interactions during the early phase of a T. gondii infection but also its use for co-infections with other relevant intestinal protozoans.","Holthaus, David; Delgado-Betancourt, Estefanía; Aebischer, Toni; Seeber, Frank; Klotz, Christian",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2020.610368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33692963/,439

This system generates estimates of the current reproductive rate, Rt, together with predictions of future daily deaths and clearly outperforms a number of alternative forecasting systems that have been presented recently. Our current (14th April 2020) estimates for Rt are, respectively, UK 0.49 (0.0 – 1.02), Spain 0.55 (0.33 – 0.77), Italy 0.90 (0.74 – 1.06) and France 0.67 (0.40 – 0.94) (mean and 95% credible intervals). Thus, we believe that the epidemics have been successfully suppressed in each of these countries, with high probability. Our approach is trivial to set up for any region and generates results in a few minutes on a laptop. We believe it would be straightforward to set up equivalent frameworks using more complex and realistic models, and hope that some experts in the field of epidemiological modelling will consider investigating this approach further.","Annan, James D; Hargreaves, Julia C",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.14.20065227,439
649387,Admission SpO(2) and ROX index predict outcome in patients with COVID-19,2021-07-27,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 has been reported to be a prothrombotic condition; however, multicenter data comparing this with other viral pneumonias in those requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are lacking. We conducted a multicenter study using whole-body CT to examine the prevalence, severity, and nature of vascular complications in coronavirus disease 2019 in comparison with patients with other viral pneumonias. DESIGN: We analyzed whole-body CT scans for the presence of vascular thrombosis (defined as pulmonary artery thrombus, venous thrombus, systemic arterial thrombus, or end-organ infarct). The severity, distribution, and morphology of pulmonary artery thrombus were characterized. Competing risk cumulative incidence analysis was used to compare survival with discharge. SETTING: Three centers of the English national extracorporeal membrane oxygenation service. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted with either coronavirus disease 2019 or noncoronavirus disease 2019 viral pneumonia admitted from January 2019. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One-hundred thirty-six patients (45.2 ± 10.6 yr old, 39/146 [27%] female) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support underwent whole-body CT scans at admission. Of these, 86 had coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia, and 50 had noncoronavirus disease 2019 viral pneumonia. Vascular thrombosis was seen more often in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (odds ratio, 12.9 [95% CI 4.5-36.8]). In those with coronavirus disease 2019, 57 (73%) demonstrated pulmonary artery thrombus or pulmonary perfusion defects. Eighty-two percent of thrombus exhibited emboli-like morphology. The location of pulmonary artery thrombus and parenchymal perfusion defects was only concordant in 30% of cases. The risk of mortality was higher in those with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with noncoronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia (χ2 = 3.94; p = 0.047). Mortality was no different in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with or without vascular thrombosis (χ2 = 0.44; p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronavirus disease 2019 is associated with a higher prevalence of vascular thrombosis compared with noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonias. The pattern of pulmonary vascular changes suggests concurrent embolic disease and small vessel disease. Despite this, vascular thrombosis was not linked to poorer short-term prognosis in those with coronavirus disease 2019.","Weir-McCall, Jonathan R; Galea, Gabriel; Mun Mak, Sze; Joshi, Kushal; Agrawal, Bobby; Screaton, Nicholas; Toshner, Mark; Ruggiero, Alessandro; Benedetti, Giulia; Brozik, Jan; Machin, Ruth; Das, Indrajeet; Kotnik, Marusa; Sun, Julia; Mackay, Michael; Jacob, Joseph; Rodrigues, Jonathan C L; Camporota, Luigi; Vuylsteke, Alain",Crit. care med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582412/; https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005322,439

This, in turn, defeats the whole purpose of non-medical containment measures, like quarantine, lockdown, travel ban, physical distancing etc., by keeping the average reproduction rate above 1. To stress upon the importance of extensive random testing for breaking the chains of transmissions, we have formulated a detailed framework for carrying out cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of extensive random testing in comparison to targeted testing (the existing testing policy followed by most countries). This framework can be easily extended for CEA of any other non-medical or even medical interventions for containing epidemics. We have developed a new version of the basic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental model, called the susceptible-infected (quarantined/ free) - recovered- deceased [SI(Q/F)RD] model, to incorporate the impact of undetected cases on the transmission dynamics of the epidemic. Further, we have presented a Dirichlet-Beta state-space formulation of the SI(Q/F)RD model for the estimation of its parameters using posterior realizations from Gibbs sampling procedure. As an application, the proposed methodology is implemented to forecast the COVID-19 transmission in California and Florida, and further carry out CEA of extensive random testing over targeted testing.","Deo, V.; Grover, G.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248830; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.24.20248830v1?rss=1,439

Design Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services (CMS) Nursing Home COVID-19 data were linked with other NH- or community-level data (e.g. Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reporting, Minimum Data Set, Nursing Home Compare, and the American Community Survey). Setting and Participants NHs with more than 30 occupied beds (N=13,123) with weekly reported NH COVID-19 records between the weeks of 06/07/2020 and 08/23/2020. Measurements/ Model Weekly indicators of any new COVID-19 cases and any new deaths (outcome variables) were regressed on the percent of Black/Hispanic residents in a NH, stratified by the percent of Blacks/Hispanics in the community in which the NH was located. A set of linear probability models with NH random-effects and robust standard errors were estimated, accounting for other covariates. Results The racial/ethnic composition of NHs and their communities were both associated with the likelihood of having COVID-19 cases and death in NHs. The racial/ethnic composition of the community played an independent role in the likelihood of COVID-19 cases/death in NHs, even after accounting for the COVID-19 infection rate in the community (i.e. daily cases per 1000 people in the county). Moreover, the racial/ethnic composition of a community modified the relationship between NH characteristics (e.g. staffing) and the likelihoods of COVID-19 cases/death. Conclusions and Implications To curb the COVID-19 outbreaks in NHs and protect vulnerable populations, efforts may be especially needed in communities with a higher concentration of racial/ethnic minorities.

It has a remarkably high resistance profile with few effective antifungal agents, mostly limited to voriconazole and liposomal amphotericin B. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) by 1 of these 2 antifungal agents further complicates the management of these infections. CASE REPORT: A 38-year-old woman with short bowel syndrome presented to the hospital with concerns of abdominal pain and loose stools. An abdominal CT was negative for inflammatory or ischemic bowel disease, and there was no evidence of liver disease. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and required transfer to the ICU due to hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. On day 43 of her admission, the patient developed a low-grade fever, for which she underwent central-line and peripheral-blood cultures that were positive for Fusarium dimerum. The central line was removed and i.v. voriconazole was started. After 3 days of treatment, the patient’s liver enzymes rose abruptly. Voriconazole was discontinued and replaced with liposomal amphotericin B, and the liver enzymes improved significantly. The patient completed 14 days of therapy and was discharged from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: This is a case of F. dimerum infection followed by DILI from voriconazole treatment. Her infection was resolved after switching to liposomal amphotericin B, with improvement in liver enzymes on day 1 after discontinuing voriconazole. This observation demonstrates that altering antifungal classes may be an appropriate strategy when confronted with DILI.","Alshaya, Omar A.; Saleh, Rana A.; Alshehri, Shaden D.",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.932544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34373441/,439
654359,Comorbidities and Risk Factors for Severe Outcomes in COVID-19 Patients in Saudi Arabia: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2021-08-12,"Summary Neurodegenerative diseases are a horrendous burden for their victims, their families, and society as a whole. For half a century scientists have pursued the hypothesis that these diseases involve a chronic viral infection in the brain. However, efforts to consistently detect a specific virus in brains of patients with such diseases as Alzheimer’s or multiple sclerosis have generally failed. Neuropathologists have become increasingly aware that most patients with neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate marked deterioration of the brain olfactory bulb in addition to brain targets that define the specific disease. In fact, the loss of the sense of smell may precede overt neurological symptoms by many years. This realization that the olfactory bulb is a common target in neurodegenerative diseases suggests the possibility that microbes and/or toxins in inhaled air may play a role in their pathogenesis. With regard to inhaled viruses, neuropathologists have focused on those viruses that infect and kill neurons. However, a recent study shows that a respiratory virus with no neurotropic properties can rapidly invade the mouse olfactory bulb from the nasal cavity. Available data suggest that this strain of influenza is passively transported to the bulb via the olfactory nerves (mechanism unknown), and is taken up by glial cells in the outer layers of the bulb. The infected glial cells appear to be activated by the virus, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and block further spread of virus within the brain. At the time that influenza symptoms become apparent (15h post-infection), but not prior to symptom onset (10h post-infection), proinflammatory cytokine-expressing neurons are increased in olfactory cortical pathways and hypothalamus as well as in the olfactory bulb. The mice go on to die of pneumonitis with severe acute phase and respiratory disease symptoms but no classical neurological symptoms. While much remains to be learned about this intranasal influenza-brain invasion model, it suggests the hypothesis that common viruses encountered in our daily life may initiate neuroinflammation via olfactory neural networks. The numerous viruses that we inhale during a lifetime might cause the death of only a few neurons per infection, but this minor damage would accumulate over time and contribute to age-related brain shrinkage and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Elderly individuals with a strong innate inflammatory system, or ongoing systemic inflammation (or both), might be most susceptible to these outcomes. The evidence for the hypothesis that common respiratory viruses may contribute to neurodegenerative processes is developed in the accompanying article.","Majde, Jeannine A.",Medical Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236772/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710000885; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710000885,439

In this article, porneia refers to access to sex workers, as well as online pornography, and masturbation by residents in RAC. Sex work is legal and regulated in Aotearoa New Zealand. METHODS: The present study was a two-arm mixed-method cross-sectional study using a concurrent triangulation design. A validated survey tool was developed. Data were collected in 2018–2019: 433 staff surveys were collected from 35 RAC across the country; 61 interviews were carried out with 77 staff, residents, and family members. RESULTS: Staff opinions about sex work and pornography were inconclusive. Nevertheless, access to sex workers occurs in many RAC facilities across the country. Interviews demonstrated a diversity of responses among the three groups; staff attitudes are paramount. CONCLUSIONS: Some staff are prepared for resident requests for sex workers; others continue to look to policies and management for guidance, but such policies are often lacking. Most staff have adopted the language of needs vs. rights which dominates the literature. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Staff education on sexuality and facility policy is essential; education for residents and their families is also desirable. Facilities often over-notify third parties.

657256,Association of Body mass index (BMI) with Critical COVID-19 and in-hospital Mortality: a dose-response meta-analysis,2020-09-16,"The pandemic spread of the COVID-19 virus has, as of 20th of April 2020, reached most countries of the world. In an effort to design informed public health policies, many modelling studies have been performed to predict crucial outcomes of interest, including ICU solicitation, cumulated death counts, etc... The corresponding data analyses however, mostly rely on restricted (openly available) data sources, which typically include daily death rates and confirmed COVID cases time series. In addition, many of these predictions are derived before the peak of the outbreak has been observed yet (as is still currently the case for many countries). In this work, we show that peak phase and data paucity have a substantial impact on the reliability of model predictions. Although we focus on a recent model of the COVID pandemics, our conclusions most likely apply to most existing models, which are variants of the so-called 'Susceptible-Infected-Removed' or SIR framework. Our results highlight the need for performing systematic reliability evaluations for all models that currently inform public health policies. They also motivate a plea for gathering and opening richer and more reliable data time series (e.g., ICU occupancy, negative test rates, social distancing commitment reports, etc).","Daunizeau, J.; Moran, R.

In this paper, a nanocomposite (PMo(12)@RGO-AIL) with electrostatic interaction of RGO and Keggin-type [PMo(12)O(40)](3−) has been fabricated and characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, and TEM. To prepare PMo(12)@RGO-AIL, a strategy of covalent modification is developed between amino-based ionic liquid and RGO, helping to achieve the uniform dispersion of [PMo(12)O(40)](3−). When the PMo(12)@RGO-AIL was used as a cathode for LIBs, it could exhibit more excellent reversible capacity, cycle stability, and rate capability than those of samples without modifying by ionic liquids.

Hence, advancing our understanding of the comprehensive entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2, especially the host factors that facilitate viral infection, is crucial for the discovery of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 has previously been documented to reach cells by binding with ACE2 and CD147 receptors in host cells that interact with the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. A novel entry factor, called neuropilin 1(NRP1), has recently been discovered as a co-receptor facilitating the entry of SARS-CoV-2. NRP1 is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein widely distributed throughout the tissues of the body and acts as a multifunctional co-receptor to bind with different ligand proteins and play diverse physiological roles as well as pathological and therapeutic roles in different clinical conditions/diseases, including COVID-19. The current review, therefore, briefly provides the overview of SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms, the structure of NRP1, and their roles in health and various diseases, as well as extensively discusses the current understanding of the potential implication of NRP1 in SARS-CoV-2 entry and COVID-19 treatment.","Chekol Abebe, Endeshaw; Mengie Ayele, Teklie; Tilahun Muche, Zelalem; Asmamaw Dejenie, Tadesse",Biologics,https://doi.org/10.2147/btt.s307352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33986591/,439

A dysregulated inflammatory state has been proposed as a key driver of clinical complications in COVID-19, with a potential detrimental role of granulocytes. However, a comprehensive phenotypic description of circulating granulocytes in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients is lacking. In this study, we used high-dimensional flow cytometry for granulocyte immunophenotyping in peripheral blood collected from COVID-19 patients during acute and convalescent phases. Severe COVID-19 was associated with increased levels of both mature and immature neutrophils, and decreased counts of eosinophils and basophils. Distinct immunotypes were evident in COVID-19 patients, with altered expression of several receptors involved in activation, adhesion, and migration of granulocytes (e.g., CD62L, CD11a/b, CD69, CD63, CXCR4). Paired sampling revealed recovery and phenotypic restoration of the granulocytic signature in the convalescent phase. The identified granulocyte immunotypes correlated with distinct sets of soluble inflammatory markers, supporting pathophysiologic relevance. Furthermore, clinical features, including multiorgan dysfunction and respiratory function, could be predicted using combined laboratory measurements and immunophenotyping. This study provides a comprehensive granulocyte characterization in COVID-19 and reveals specific immunotypes with potential predictive value for key clinical features associated with COVID-19.","Lourda, Magda; Dzidic, Majda; Hertwig, Laura; Bergsten, Helena; Palma Medina, Laura M; Sinha, Indranil; Kvedaraite, Egle; Chen, Puran; Muvva, Jagadeeswara R; Gorin, Jean-Baptiste; Cornillet, Martin; Emgård, Johanna; Moll, Kirsten; García, Marina; Maleki, Kimia T; Klingström, Jonas; Michaëlsson, Jakob; Flodström-Tullberg, Malin; Brighenti, Susanna; Buggert, Marcus; Mjösberg, Jenny; Malmberg, Karl-Johan; Sandberg, Johan K; Henter, Jan-Inge; Folkesson, Elin; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Sönnerborg, Anders; Eriksson, Lars I; Rooyackers, Olav; Aleman, Soo; Strålin, Kristoffer; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Björkström, Niklas K; Svensson, Mattias; Ponzetta, Andrea; Norrby-Teglund, Anna; Chambers, Benedict J",Proc.

The Case for a Virtual Recovery Program,2021-06-01,"Introducción y objetivos: La información sobre el daño miocárdico en la población con COVID-19 es muy escasa. Nuestro objetivo es evaluar el daño cardiaco en pacientes con COVID-19 y determinar la correlación entre las concentraciones de troponina T ultrasensible (TnT-us) y fracción aminoterminal del propéptido natriurético cerebral (NT-proBNP) con la gravedad de la COVID-19. Métodos: Se incluyó a 872 pacientes consecutivos con COVID-19 confirmada desde febrero a abril del 2020. Se determinó al ingreso la TnT-us a 651 pacientes y la NT-proBNP a 506. El daño miocárdico se definió como una TnT-us > 14 ng/l, > percentil 99. Las cifras de NT-proBNP > 300 pg/ml se consideraron relacionadas con daño miocárdico. El objetivo primario fue muerte o ventilación mecánica (VM) a 30 días. Resultados: Se observó daño miocárdico según la TnT-us en el 34,6%. Las tasas del evento muerte o VM fueron superiores en los pacientes con daño miocárdico (el 39,1 frente al 9,1%). Los valores de TnT-us y NT-proBNP fueron predictores independientes de muerte o VM (HR = 2,18; IC95%, 1,23-3,83 y HR = 1,87; IC95%, 1,05-3,36) y de mortalidad total (HR = 2,91; IC95%, 1,211-7,04 y HR = 5,47; IC95%, 2,10-14,26). Se observó que la NT-proBNP mejoró de manera significativa el modelo predictivo de la troponina para muerte o VM (estadístico C, 0,83-0,84) y mortalidad total (estadístico C, 0,85-0,87). Conclusiones: El daño miocárdico analizado al ingreso se observó con frecuencia entre los pacientes con COVID-19 y es un potente predictor de muerte y necesidad de VM. La NT-proBNP mejoró la precisión pronóstica de la determinación de troponina. Introduction and objectives: COVID-19 is currently causing high mortality and morbidity worldwide. Information on cardiac injury is scarce. We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively). NT-ProBNP significantly improved the troponin model discrimination of mortality or MV (C-index 0.83 to 0.84), and of mortality alone (C-index 0.85 to 0.87). Conclusions: Myocardial injury measured at admission was a common finding in patients with COVID-19. It reliably predicted the occurrence of mortality and need of MV, the most severe complications of the disease. NT-proBNP improved the prognostic accuracy of hs-TnT.","Calvo-Fernández, Alicia; Izquierdo, Andrea; Subirana, Isaac; Farré, Nuria; Vila, Joan; Durán, Xavier; García-Guimaraes, Marcos; Valdivielso, Sandra; Cabero, Paula; Soler, Cristina; García-Ribas, Cora; Rodríguez, Clara; Llagostera, Marc; Mojón, Diana; Vicente, Miren; Solé-González, Eduard; Sánchez-Carpintero, Andrea; Tevar, Cristina; Marrugat, Jaume; Vaquerizo, Beatriz",Rev Esp Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.recesp.2020.09.017; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300893220305492?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300893220305492; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33262553/,439
660222,Characteristics and Outcomes Among Hospitalized COVID-19-Positive Patients in a Nonurban Environment,2021-02-10,"Objective: Medical conversation plays a central role in disease management and therapy. In teaching, standardized patients (SPs) are increasingly being used to present conversation situations with students and provide feedback afterwards. In order to maintain this teaching concept under pandemic conditions, a digital model was developed that should offer both high security and high authenticity. Methodology: A total of 176 teaching units of 45 minutes each were conducted digitally from May to August 2020. During the teaching units, medical students conducted interviews with SPs portraying various patients. The online conference software “HeiConf” was used for this purpose. During the teaching units, a total of 354 students were able to practice conversation techniques such as NURSE and SPIKES. After the teaching units, feedback was provided by students and SPs. Results: The digital lessons about medical conversation with SPs received positive feedback from SPs and students. The authenticity of the role portrayal of SPs seemed to be unaffected by the new format. Students were successful in training and observing conversation techniques. However, aspects of non-verbal communication, atmosphere and group dynamics as well as further discussions could not be carried out to the same extent as in the usual classroom teaching. Conclusion: The conversion of SP-based teaching to a digital format was successful in a short period of time and was able to prevent a cancellation of teaching units about medical conversation. Concrete conversation techniques could be tried out digitally by students. Due to the deficits of digital teaching in terms of non-verbal communication and atmosphere, a blended-learning format is planned for the future. In the first instance, concrete conversation techniques will be learned online in order to focus more on profound aspects of communication and discussions in a later physical teaching unit with SPs, thus enabling a learning experience that is as authentic as possible.","Hartmann, Lilly; Kaden, Jens J.; Strohmer, Renate",GMS J Med Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33659626/; https://doi.org/10.3205/zma001417,439

Design Online patient survey. Setting New York City Academic Medical Center. Patients or Participants In Mid-March of 2020 there was a moratorium on elective services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In our institution, 220 patients were identified who had gynecologic surgery postponed. Of these patients, 150 patients were successfully contacted and invited to participate in the study, and 86 completed the survey. Interventions The research instrument was an online survey, which included a validated anxiety questionnaire. Measurements and Main Results Indications for surgery were fibroids (48%), abnormal bleeding (16%), ovarian mass (16%), endometriosis (12%), incontinence (8%), infertility (7%), prolapse (5%), and dysplasia (2%). On the Zung Self-Rated Anxiety Scale, 92% scored within normal range and 8% scored mild-to-moderate anxiety level. 50% of patients reported feeling more anxious about COVID exposure, 22% were more anxious about waiting for surgery, and 28% were equally anxious about both. Sentiment analysis of an open-ended question about postponement revealed 52% of responses were negative, 27% neutral, and 21% positive. Primary themes within negative responses were “frustrated” or “disappointed” about surgery cancellation. Primary themes within positive responses were “safe” or “relieved.” During the postponement, 60% of patients reported symptoms were the same, 27% worse, and 13% better. 36% of patients reported using alternative therapy while awaiting surgery, the most common being non-opioid pain medication (37%), hormonal therapy (29%), dietary changes (29%), supplements (20%), bladder training exercises (7%), pessary (2%), and pelvic floor physical therapy (2%). 80% reported access to MyChart, and 30% participated in telehealth visits, of which all reported satisfaction with the visit. Conclusion Patients with benign gynecologic surgery postponed due to COVID-19 had a negative impression of this impact on their care.","Kossl, K.; Gaigbe-Togbe, B.; Baxter, B.

We sought to evaluate the clinical impact of thrombosis in COVID-19-positive patients over the span of the pandemic to date. We analyzed COVID-19-positive patients with the diagnosis of thrombosis who presented to the MedStar Health system (11 hospitals in Washington, DC, and Maryland) during the pandemic (March 1, 2020 – March 31, 2021). We compared clinical course and outcomes based on the presence or absence of thrombosis and then, specifically, cardiac thrombosis. The cohort included 11,537 COVID-19-positive admitted patients. Of these patients, 1,248 had non-cardiac thrombotic events and 1,009 had cardiac thrombosis (myocardial infarction) during their hospital admission. Of the non-cardiac thrombotic events, 562 (45.0%) were pulmonary embolism, 480 (38.5%) were deep venous thromboembolism, and 347 (27.8%) were stroke. In the thrombosis arm, the cohort's mean age was 64.5 ± 15.3 years, 53.3% were men, and a majority were African American (64.9%). Patients with thrombosis tended to be older, with more co-morbidities. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher (16.0%) in COVID-19-positive patients with concomitant thrombosis versus those without thrombosis (7.9%; p <0.001) but lower than in COVID-19-positive patients with cardiac thrombosis (24.7%; p <0.001). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with thrombosis are at higher risk for in-hospital mortality. However, this prognosis is not as grim as cardiac thrombosis.

663498,Role of viral and bacterial pathogens in causing pneumonia among Western Australian children: a case–control study protocol,2018-03-16,"INTRODUCTION: Early and rapid confirmation of dengue infections strengthens disease surveillance program and are critical to the success of vector control measures. Rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) are increasingly used to confirm recent dengue infections due to their ease of use and short turnaround time for results. Several studies undertaken in dengue-endemic Southeast Asia have reported the performance of RDTs against enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and virus isolation methods. However, few studies have compared multiple RDTs for the detection of dengue NS1 antigen and IgM antibody in a single combo cassette. We evaluated six RDTs in Singapore for their utility in routine clinical testing to detect recent dengue infections. METHODS: The evaluation comprised two phases. The first phase sought to determine each RDT’s specificity to dengue NS1 and IgM using zika and chikungunya virus supernatant and zika convalescent samples. RDTs that cross-reacted with zika or chikungunya were not further tested in phase 2. The second phase sought to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the remaining RDTs to dengue NS1 and IgM using pre-characterised dengue specimens and non-dengue/chikungunya febrile clinical specimens. RESULTS: None of the RDTs cross-reacted with zika IgM in Phase 1. Truquick and Quickprofile cross reacted with zika and chikungunya viruses and were not evaluated thereafter. Standard Q had the highest dengue NS1 and IgM sensitivity at 87.0% and 84.3% respectively whereas Bioline (68.5%) and Multisure (58.3%) had the lowest dengue NS1 and IgM sensitivity respectively. Combining dengue NS1/IgM detection results greatly improved the RDT ability to detect recent dengue infection; Standard Q had the highest sensitivity at 99.1% while Multisure had the lowest at 92.6%. All the RDTs were highly specific for dengue NS1 and IgM (96.7% to 100%). All the RDTs had high positive predictive values (98.4% to 100%) for NS1, IgM and combined NS1/IgM parameters whereas Standard Q had the highest negative predictive values at 68.2% (NS1), 63.8% (IgM) and 96.8% (NS1/IgM). For the RDTs, detection of NS1 declined from acute to convalescent phase of illness whereas IgM detection rate gradually increased over time. CONCLUSION: In our study, several RDTs were evaluated for their diagnostic accuracy and capability in detecting recent dengue infection. Standard Q demonstrated a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and capability in the detection of NS1 and IgM biomarkers.

663810,When to call it off: Defining the role of low-dose corticosteroids in thwarting the progression of non-severe COVID-19,2021-01-21,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate nurses’ perceptions of oral healthcare provision to inpatients in Japanese hospitals and the infection control measures taken by them after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, to promote collaborative oral healthcare in hospitals. METHOD: The participants were 1,037 nurses working in inpatient wards at four hospitals in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey, approximately six months after the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: More than 90% of the 734 nurses participating in this study positively perceived the preventive effect of oral healthcare on aspiration pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and viral infection. However, approximately half of them had negative perceptions about their knowledge and confidence regarding the control of COVID-19 with oral healthcare provision, and 84.7% expected to be provided with the necessary information by oral health professionals. Further, 537 nurses (73.2%) provided oral healthcare to their patients; nine nurses (1.7%) responded that those patients who received oral healthcare decreased after the lockdown; and 12 (2.4%) responded that they could no longer collaborate with oral health professionals because of the lockdown. Additionally, 41.7 % of them used neither protective glasses nor face shields even after the lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that almost all the nurses positively perceived the effect of oral healthcare on the prevention of viral infection and pneumonia. However, some nurses perceived that their oral healthcare provision and collaborative oral healthcare were negatively affected. It also showed that most nurses’ knowledge, confidence, and use of infection control measures were insufficient. This study proposes that oral health professionals should support nurses in providing oral healthcare by providing them with information on COVID-19 infection control measures to prevent infection transmission through oral healthcare.","Haresaku, Satoru; Aoki, Hisae; Kubota, Keiko; Nakashima, Fuyuko; Uchida, Souhei; Jinnouchi, Akio; Naito, Toru",Int Dent J,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020653921001301; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419244/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.identj.2021.06.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020653921001301?v=s5,439

Multimodal monitoring of patients with COVID-19 may delineate the specific features of COVID-19–related encephalopathy and guide clinical management. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical, biological, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in association with electroencephalographic (EEG) features for patients with COVID-19, and to better refine the features of COVID-19–related encephalopathy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study conducted in Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, enrolled 78 hospitalized adults who received a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) and underwent EEG between March 30 and June 11, 2020. EXPOSURES: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal specimen using a reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction assay or, in the case of associated pneumonia, on a computed tomography scan of the chest. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data on the clinical and paraclinical features of the 78 patients with COVID-19 were retrieved from electronic patient records. RESULTS: Of 644 patients who were hospitalized for COVID-19, 78 (57 men [73%]; mean [SD] age, 61 [12] years) underwent EEG. The main indications for EEG were delirium, seizure-like events, and delayed awakening in the intensive care unit after stopping treatment with sedatives. Sixty-nine patients showed pathologic EEG findings, including metabolic-toxic encephalopathy features, frontal abnormalities, periodic discharges, and epileptic activities. Of 57 patients who underwent brain MRI, 41 showed abnormalities, including perfusion abnormalities, acute ischemic lesions, multiple microhemorrhages, and white matter–enhancing lesions. Fifty-five patients showed biological abnormalities, including dysnatremia, kidney failure, and liver dysfunction, the same day as the EEG. The results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis were negative for SARS-Cov-2 for all tested patients. Nine patients who had no identifiable cause of brain injury outside COVID-19 were further isolated; their brain injury was defined as COVID-19–related encephalopathy. They represented 1% (9 of 644) of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Six of these 9 patients had movement disorders, 7 had frontal syndrome, 4 had brainstem impairment, 4 had periodic EEG discharges, and 3 had MRI white matter–enhancing lesions. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results from this cohort of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 suggest there are clinical, EEG, and MRI patterns that could delineate specific COVID-19–related encephalopathy and guide treatment strategy.","Lambrecq, Virginie; Hanin, Aurélie; Munoz-Musat, Esteban; Chougar, Lydia; Gassama, Salimata; Delorme, Cécile; Cousyn, Louis; Borden, Alaina; Damiano, Maria; Frazzini, Valerio; Huberfeld, Gilles; Landgraf, Frank; Nguyen-Michel, Vi-Huong; Pichit, Phintip; Sangare, Aude; Chavez, Mario; Morélot-Panzini, Capucine; Morawiec, Elise; Raux, Mathieu; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Rufat, Pierre; Galanaud, Damien; Corvol, Jean-Christophe; Lubetzki, Catherine; Rohaut, Benjamin; Demeret, Sophie; Pyatigorskaya, Nadya; Naccache, Lionel; Navarro, Vincent",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720371/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.1489,439

The basic reproduction number R0 of India is calculated to be 1.15, whereas for various states it ranges from 1.03 in Uttarakhand to 7.92 in Bihar. The statistical parameters for most of the states indicates the high significance of the predicted results. It is estimated that the epidemic curve flattening in India will start from the first week of July and epidemic may end in the third week of October with final epidemic size ~1,75,000. The epidemic in Kerala is in final phase and is expected to end by first week of June. Among Indian states, Maharashtra is severely affected where the ending phase of epidemic may occur in the second week of September with epidemic size of ~55,000. The model indicates that the fast growth of infection in Punjab is from 27th April 2020 to 2nd June 2020, thereafter, curve flattening will start and the epidemic is expected to finished by the first week of July with the estimated number of ~3300 infected people. The epidemic size of COVID-19 outbreak in Delhi, West Bengal, Gujrat, Tamil Nadu and Odisha can reach as large as 24,000, 18,000, 16,000, 13,000 and 11,000, respectively, however, these estimations may be invalid if large fluctuation of data occurs in coming days.","Jakhar, M.; Ahluwalia, P.

Poor data record system coupled with under- (over)-reporting of malaria cases affects the country’s malaria elimination activities. Thus, malaria data at health facilities and health offices are important particularly to monitor and evaluate the elimination progresses. This study was intended to assess overall reported malaria cases, reporting quality, spatiotemporal trends and factors associated in Gedeo zone, South Ethiopia. METHODS: Past 8 years retrospective data stored in 17 health centers and 5 district health offices in Gedeo Zone, South Ethiopia were extracted. Malaria cases data at each health center with sociodemographic information, between January 2012 and December 2019, were included. Meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorology agency of Ethiopia. The data were analyzed using Stata 13. RESULTS: A total of 485,414 suspected cases were examined for malaria during the previous 8 years at health centers. Of these suspects, 57,228 (11.79%) were confirmed malaria cases with an overall decline during the 8-year period. We noted that 3758 suspected cases and 467 confirmed malaria cases were not captured at the health offices. Based on the health centers records, the proportions of Plasmodium falciparum (49.74%) and P. vivax (47.59%) infection were nearly equivalent (p = 0.795). The former was higher at low altitudes while the latter was higher at higher altitudes. The over 15 years of age group accounted for 11.47% of confirmed malaria cases (p < 0.001). There was high spatiotemporal variation: the highest case record was during Belg (12.52%) and in Dilla town (18,150, 13.17%, p < 0.001) which is located at low altitude. Monthly rainfall and minimum temperature exhibited strong associations with confirmed malaria cases. CONCLUSION: A notable overall decline in malaria cases was observed during the eight-year period. Both P. falciparum and P. vivax were found at equivalent endemicity level; hence control measures should continue targeting both species. The noticed under reporting, the high malaria burden in urban settings, low altitudes and Belg season need spatiotemporal consideration by the elimination program.

666061,Estimated Sp02/Fio2 ratio to predict mortality in patients with suspected COVID-19 in the Emergency Department: a prospective cohort study,2020-06-02,"Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused, and continues to cause, severe economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. The pathogenic mechanism and immune regulatory interactions between PEDV and the host remain largely unknown. In this study, the interaction between autophagy and PEDV replication in intestinal porcine epithelial (IPEC-J2) cells was investigated. The effects of the structural and nonstructural proteins of PEDV on the autophagy process and the autophagy-related signaling pathways were also examined. The results shown that PEDV replication increased the autophagy flux in IPEC-J2 cells, and that autophagy was beneficial to PEDV replication, which may be one of the reasons for the rapid damage to intestinal epithelial cells and the enhanced virulence of PEDV in both newborn piglets and finishing pigs. When autophagy was pharmacologically induced by rapamycin, PEDV replication increased from 8.5 × 105 TCID50/mL to 8.8 × 106 TCID50/mL in IPEC-J2 cells. When autophagy was pharmacologically suppressed by hydroxychloroquine, PEDV replication decreased from 8.5 × 105 TCID50/mL to 7.9 × 104 TCID50/mL. To identify which PEDV proteins were the key inducers of autophagy, all 4 structural proteins and 17 nonstructural proteins of PEDV were eukaryotic expressed. It was found that the nonstructural protein 6 (nsp6) and ORF3 of PEDV were able to induce significant autophagy in IPEC-J2 cells, but the other proteins were unable to induce autophagy. It was indicated that nsp6-induced autophagy mainly occurred via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The results accelerate the understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of PEDV infection and provide new insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies.","Lin, Huixing; Li, Bin; Liu, Mingxing; Zhou, Hong; He, Kongwang; Fan, Hongjie",Veterinary Microbiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378113520301656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32402351/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378113520301656; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108684,439

Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases. Rapid identification and isolation of cases, quarantine of close contacts, and active monitoring of other contacts have been effective in suppressing expansion of the outbreak and have implications for other countries experiencing outbreaks.","Ng, Yixiang; Li, Zongbin; Chua, Yi Xian; Chaw, Wei Liang; Zhao, Zheng; Er, Benjamin; Pung, Rachael; Chiew, Calvin J.; Lye, David C.; Heng, Derrick; Lee, Vernon J.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6911e1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32191691/,439

In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS Cov2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS Cov2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS Cov2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.","Nanda, Piyush; Ghosh, Amit",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.29.402404,439

Although to date CPV‐2 is circulating in all continents, most of the current studies have analysed the amino acid changes accounted in the VP2 gene sequence, with limited information on virus introductions from other countries. The aim of this study was to analyse the genetic features of CPV‐2c strains currently spreading in Italy. Swabs and tissue samples were collected from dogs suspected of CPV infection. The nearly complete genome sequence from the CPV‐positive samples was obtained. The co‐circulation of two different but related CPV‐2c strains, with amino acid changes characteristic of CPV strains of Asian origin (NS1: 60V, 544F, 545F, 630P – NS2: 60V, 151N, 152V ‐ VP2: 5A/G, 267Y, 297A, 324I, 370R), were observed. The phylogenetic analyses inferred from the NS1 and VP2 gene sequences confirmed the relationship with Asian CPV‐2c strains.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui and to identify predictors of viral clearance. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data collected from discharged patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. We compared clinical features between viral clearance and viral persistence, and evaluated factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 83 patients involved in the study, the median age was 43 years, while 60.2% were male, 35.4% had comorbidities, and the mortality was zero. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days (interquartile range (IQR), 2-7 days), and the median time from the illness onset to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 16 days (IQR, 13-18 days). The factors influencing viral clearance were as follows: (1) delayed admission (beta 1.057, 95% CI 0.810-1.304; p ≤ 0.001) and (2) underlying comorbidities (beta 1.907, 95% CI 0.198-3.616; p = 0.029). No significant differences were observed in the length of stay (p = 0.246) and pneumonia between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients based on computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.124). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed admission and underlying comorbidities may effectively predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. For those infected with SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatic patients without any clinical symptoms should be traced and isolated.

Thus, there is an urgent need to interpret the available literature in order to establish safe practices for dental professionals as well as limit the spread of infection through saliva. The study intends to provide up-to-date, compiled evidence-based information related to saliva and its association with COVID-19. It further provides suggestions for safe practices in dentistry in current pandemic times. Oral symptoms may be strongly suggestive of early diagnosis and disease progression in COVID-19 patients. Viral loads in saliva are reported higher than standard nasopharyngeal swabs in few studies, majorly in the 1(st) week of symptom onset. Besides, salivary diagnostics has many additional advantages of being noninvasive, comfortable to the patients with the possibility of point-of-care testing for diagnosing COVID-19. High-efficiency particulate arrestor filter, rubber dam application and high-volume evacuator can reduce spatter and droplets/aerosol production. Povidone-iodine-based mouthwash maybe mouthwash of choice before any dental examination or procedures due to its ability to decrease severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 viral loads in the mouth.

To improve our understanding of human oligodendrocyte development, which could facilitate development of remyelination-based treatment strategies, here we describe time-course single-cell-transcriptomic analysis of developing human stem cell-derived oligodendrocyte-lineage-cells (hOLLCs). The study includes hOLLCs derived from both genome engineered embryonic stem cell (ESC) reporter cells containing an Identification-and-Purification tag driven by the endogenous PDGFRα promoter and from unmodified induced pluripotent (iPS) cells. Our analysis uncovers substantial transcriptional heterogeneity of PDGFRα-lineage hOLLCs. We discover sub-populations of human oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (hOPCs) including a potential cytokine-responsive hOPC subset, and identify candidate regulatory genes/networks that define the identity of these sub-populations. Pseudotime trajectory analysis defines developmental pathways of oligodendrocytes vs astrocytes from PDGFRα-expressing hOPCs and predicts differentially expressed genes between the two lineages. In addition, pathway enrichment analysis followed by pharmacological intervention of these pathways confirm that mTOR and cholesterol biosynthesis signaling pathways are involved in maturation of oligodendrocytes from hOPCs.","Chamling, Xitiz; Kallman, Alyssa; Fang, Weixiang; Berlinicke, Cynthia A.; Mertz, Joseph L.; Devkota, Prajwal; Pantoja, Itzy E.

We perform a longitudinal analysis of the early innate responses in children and adults with mild infection within household clusters. Children display fewer symptoms than adults despite similar initial viral load and mount a robust anti-viral immune signature typical of SARS-CoV-2 infection and characterized by early interferon gene responses, increases in cytokines such as CXCL10 and GM-CSF, and changes in blood cell numbers. When compared to adults, the antiviral response resolves faster (within a week of symptoms); monocytes and dendritic cells are more transiently activated; and genes associated with B-cell activation appear earlier in children. Nonetheless, these differences do not have major effects on the quality of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses. Our findings reveal that better early control of inflammation as observed in children may be key for rapidly controlling infection and limiting disease course.","Vono, Maria; Huttner, Angela; Lemeille, Sylvain; Martinez-Murillo, Paola; Meyer, Benjamin; Baggio, Stephanie; Sharma, Shilpee; Thiriard, Anais; Marchant, Arnaud; Godeke, Gert-Jan; Reusken, Chantal; Alvarez, Catia; Perez-Rodriguez, Francisco; Eckerle, Isabella; Kaiser, Laurent; Loevy, Natasha; Eberhardt, Christiane S.; Blanchard-Rohner, Geraldine; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Didierlaurent, Arnaud M.",Cell Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109773; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124721012274?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34587479/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124721012274,439

There was an increase in the number of white blood cells in the blood, including neutrophils and eosinophils; moderate anaemia; ascites; and possible mesenteric peritonitis. Exploratory laparotomy revealed firm, multifocal small nodules in the mesentery. As the nodules were surgically unresectable, they were biopsied. Histologically, the nodules were composed of thin trabeculae of dense collagen fibres mixed with plump fibroblasts and numerous eosinophils, consistent with feline gastrointestinal eosinophilic sclerosing fibroplasia. Bacteria were not detected on histological examination of the nodules and cytology of the ascites.

In other chronic diseases than Parkinson’s disease, care management models have been deployed to deliver integrated and personalized care, yielding positive effects on patients’ health outcomes, quality of life and health care utilization. However, care management models have been highly heterogeneous, as there is currently no clear operationalization of its core elements. In addition, most care management models are disease-specific and not tailored to the individual needs and preferences of a patient. In this viewpoint we present an integrated and personalized care management model for persons with Parkinson’s disease costing of five core elements: (1) care coordination, (2) patient navigation, (3) information provision, (4) early detection of signs and symptoms through proactive monitoring and (5) process monitoring. Following the description of each core element, implications for implementing the model into practice are discussed. Finally, we provide clinical and methodological considerations on the evaluation of care management models.","van Halteren, Angelika D.; Munneke, Marten; Smit, Eva; Thomas, Sue; Bloem, Bastiaan R.; Darweesh, Sirwan K.

All vehicular movement, construction work, industries, national highways, etc. remained closed during lockdown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of lockdown on the case load and epidemiology of orthopaedic trauma cases in the state of Telangana. METHODS: This study was a multi-centre, retrospective observational study. Data were collected from 8 teaching hospitals, 8 corporate hospitals, 1 dedicated industrial trauma, and hand injury center and 56 consultants with individual practice. Data were collected in two groups, pre-lockdown period (23rd Feb to 24th March) and lockdown period (25th march to 25th April). Patient demographics, type of injury, and cause of injury were collected. This was done using an online survey form and retrieval of case data from health records. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in total trauma numbers during lockdown by 1266 cases (pre-lockdown n = 2020 and lockdown n = 754), amounting to a decrease by 62.7% (p < 0.01). RTA was the leading cause of trauma in all age groups except in elderly and we found a reduction of 77.9% cases during lockdown (n = 1343 vs. n = 298). The numbers of fragility fractures in elderly were unaffected due to lockdown. CONCLUSION: RTA was the major cause of injuries in young adults and adults. Though they cannot be eliminated, RTA numbers can be reduced by strict implementation of traffic rules and better road infrastructure. Lockdown had no effect on incidence of fragility fractures in elderly. With changes in life style and more people working from home there may be a reduction in overall injuries in future.","Maryada, Venkateshwar Reddy; Mulpur, Praharsha; Guravareddy, Annapareddy Venkata; Pedamallu, Sudhir Kumar; Vijay Bhasker, Bolgam",Indian J Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43465-020-00226-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836367/,439

Our aim was to evaluate how RT-PCR Ct values among children with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 compared with that of adult subjects. Methods: Patients (aged from 2 months to [≤]18 years, and adults) with signs and symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection for less than 7 days, were prospectively enrolled in the study from May to November 2020. All participants performed RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection; Ct values of ORF1ab, N, and S gene-targets, and the average of all the three probes were used as surrogates of viral load. Results: Of the total of 376 participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection there were 21 infants, 62 children and 293 adults. The RT-PCR Ct values of children under 18 were not significantly different from that of adults, as observed by the analyzed probes (namely ORF1ab, N, and S), and by the mean of all 3 gene-targets. However, infants had significantly lower Ct values compared to children and adults (P = 0.044). Discussion: Ct values for children were not significantly different than that of adults with positive SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, infants had even lower Ct values when compared to older children and adults. Although viral load is not the only determinant of transmission, infants may play a significant role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the community, especially if or when this population returns to regular daycare activities.","Polese-Bonatto, M.; Sartor, I.

Yet, when the COVID-19 epidemic plagued the country, fourteen states were practicing their chosen decision not to enact the Medicaid expansion policy. We examined the consequences of this nationwide split in Medicaid design on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic between the expansion and non-expansion states. Our study shows that, on average, the expansion states had 217.56 fewer confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents than the non-expansion states [-210.41; 95%CI (-411.131) - (-2.05); P<0.05]. Also, the doubling time of COVID-19 cases in Medicaid expansion states was longer than that of non-expansion states by an average of 1.68 days [1.6826; 95%CI 0.4035-2.9617; P<0.05]. These findings suggest that proactive investment in public health preparedness was an effective protective policy measure in this crisis, unsurpassed by the benefits of COVID-19 emergency plans and funds. The study findings could be relevant to policymakers and healthcare strategists in non-expansion states considering their states' preparations for such public health crises.","Hussein, M.

This experiment also showed participants tweets that aligned with their previously held beliefs to determine how flags affect their overall opinions. Results showed that flagging tweets lowered participants’ attitudes about them, though this effect was less pronounced in participants who frequently used social media or consumed more news, especially from Facebook or Fox News. Some participants also changed their opinions after seeing the flagged tweets. The results suggest that social media companies can flag suspicious or inaccurate content as a way to fight misinformation.

The severity and mortality of COVID-19 are associated with virus-induced dysfunctional inflammatory responses and cytokine storms. However, the interplay between host inflammatory responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, the major structural protein of the virion, promotes the virus-triggered activation of NF-κB signaling. After binding to viral RNA, N protein robustly undergoes liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), which recruits TAK1 and IKK complex, the key kinases of NF-κB signaling, to enhance NF-κB activation. Moreover, 1,6-hexanediol, the inhibitor of LLPS, can attenuate the phase separation of N protein and restrict its regulatory functions in NF-κB activation. These results suggest that LLPS of N protein provides a platform to induce NF-κB hyper-activation, which could be a potential therapeutic target against COVID-19 severe pneumonia.","Wu, Yaoxing; Ma, Ling; Cai, Sihui; Zhuang, Zhen; Zhao, Zhiyao; Jin, Shouheng; Xie, Weihong; Zhou, Lingli; Zhang, Lei; Zhao, Jincun; Cui, Jun",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-021-00575-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895773/,439

This paper presents a case of a female patient who developed subacute thyroiditis soon after receiving the adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The patient presented with severe neck pain and her blood results demonstrated an initial thyrotoxic phase followed by a hypothyroid phase. She had no past history of thyroiditis or thyroid dysfunction. Subacute thyroiditis occurring after COVID-19 vaccination is rare but also probably underreported.

This study compared immunogenicity and reactogenicity of CoronaVac in once naturally infected health-care workers (HCWs) and uninfected HCWs. All HCWs were immunized with two doses of CoronaVac (600 U/0.5 ml) intramuscularly at a 28-day interval. Adverse reactions were obtained by web-based questionnaires or telephone calls seven days after each vaccine dose. Detection of antibody levels against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was done four weeks after the second dose of the vaccine. We enrolled 103 previously naturally infected and 627 uninfected HCWs. The mean time for vaccination after the first nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 positivity was 64 days (range: 15–136 days) in previously naturally infected HCWs. Among the previously naturally infected HCWs, 41 (40%) were asymptomatic, 52 (50%) had mild upper respiratory tract infections, 10 (105) had pneumonia, and only 6 (5%) were hospitalized. Any reported adverse reactions, either from the first dose or the second dose of vaccine administration, did not differ between previously infected and uninfected HCWs. Anti-RBD antibody titers were obtained in 50 (51%) of 103 previously infected HCWs and 142 (23%) of 627 uninfected HCWs. Anti-RBD antibody titers were significantly higher in HCWs with a previous natural infection (median 1220 AU/ml, range: 202–10328 AU/mL) than in uninfected HCWs (median: 913 AU/ml, range: 2.8–15547 AU/mL, p = .032).

Also, we investigated the relative expression of these miRNAs and mRNAs during hospitalization. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 5 mL of blood sample were taken from COVID-19 patients with different grades and during hospitalization from several health centers of Yazd, Tehran, and Zahedan province of Iran from December 20, 2020 to March 2, 2021. The relative expression of miRNAs and mRNAs was evaluated by q-PCR. RESULTS: We found that the relative expression of hsa-miR-31-3p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, and hsa-miR-126-3p was significantly decreased and the relative expression of their mRNA targets (ZMYM5, COL5A3, and CAMSAP1) was significantly increased with the increase of disease grade. Conversely, the relative expression of hsa-miR-17-3p was significantly increased and its mRNA target (DICER1) was significantly decreased with the increase of disease grade. This pattern was exactly seen during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients who did not respond to treatment. In COVID-19 patients who responded to treatment, the expression of selected miRNAs and their mRNA targets returned to the normal level. A negative significant correlation was seen between (1) the expression of hsa-miR-31-3p and ZMYM5, (2) hsa-miR-29a-3p and COL5A3, (3) hsa-miR-126-3p and CAMSAP1, and (4) hsa-miR-17-3p and DICER1 in COVID-19 patients with any grade (P < 0.05) and during hospitalization.

673176,"Prevalence of depression during the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 pandemics: A protocol for overview of systematic reviews",2020-09-18,"Background: A novel coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China and reported to WHO on 31 December 2019. WHO declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. The first case in the US was reported in January 2020. Since mid-March 2020, the number of confirmed cases has increased exponentially in the States, with 1.1 million confirmed cases, and 57.4 thousand deaths as of 30 April 2020. Even though some believe that this new lethal coronavirus does not show any partiality to the rich, previous epidemiological studies find that the poor in the US are more susceptible to the epidemics due to their limited access to preventive measures and crowded living conditions. In this study, we postulate that the rich is more susceptible to Covid-19 infection during the early stage before social distancing measures have been introduced. This may be attributed to the higher mobility (both inter- and intra-city), given their higher tendency to travel for business/education, and to more social interactions. However, we postulate after the lockdown/social distancing has been imposed, the infection among the rich may be reduced due to better living conditions. Further, the rich may be able to afford better medical treatment once infected, hence a relatively lower mortality. In contrast, without proper medical insurance coverage, the poor may be prevented from receiving timely and proper medical treatment, hence a higher mortality. Method: We will collect the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the US during the period of Jan 2020 to Apr 2020 from Johns Hopkins University, also the number of Covid-19 tests in the US from the health departments across the States. County-level socio-economic status (SES) including age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, occupation, employment status, immigration status, and housing price, will be collected from the US Census Bureau. State/county-level health conditions including the prevalence of chronic diseases will be collected from the US CDC. State/county-level movement data including international and domestic flights will be collected from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We will also collect the periods of lockdown/social distancing. Regression models are constructed to examine the relationship between SES, and Covid-19 infection and mortality at the state/county-level before and after lockdown/social distancing, while accounting for Covid-19 testing capacities and co-morbidities. Expected Findings: We expect that there is a positive correlation between Covid-19 infection and SES at the state/county-level in the US before social distancing. In addition, we expect a negative correlation between Covid-19 mortality and SES.","Han, Y.; Li, V. O. K.; Lam, J. C. K.; Guo, P.; Bai, R.; Fok, W. W.

Knockout mice defective in IFN signaling quickly succumb to all kinds of viral infections. Likewise, humans with genetic defects in interferon signaling die of viral disease at an early age. Among the known interferon-induced antiviral mechanisms, the Mx pathway is one of the most powerful. Mx proteins belong to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases and have direct antiviral activity. They inhibit a wide range of viruses by blocking an early stage of the viral replication cycle. Likewise, the protein kinase R (PKR), and the 2–5 OAS/RNaseL system represent major antiviral pathways and have been extensively studied. Viruses, in turn, have evolved multiple strategies to escape the IFN system. They try to go undetected, suppress IFN synthesis, bind and neutralize secreted IFN molecules, block IFN signaling, or inhibit the action of IFN-induced antiviral proteins.

674716,A Survey of Internal Medicine Interns Regarding the Most Useful Topics to Include in an Internal Medicine Track of a “Get Ready for Residency Boot Camp” Course,2020-10-21,"Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition worldwide. It has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO in a very short span of time. The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain, India, and USA, among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next-generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is predicted to have high antigenicity, safety, and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants, were utilized to construct a multi-epitope-vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with a high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product.

675931,Be Prepared,2020-03-17,"INTRODUCTION/AIM: This retrospective study aimed to quantify the changes in motor function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) due to the government‐imposed travel restrictions associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. METHODS: Twelve DMD patients were enrolled in this investigation (mean ± SD age: 9.8 ± 3.6 y). Their physical characteristics and motor function were evaluated approximately 3 mo before, immediately before, and approximately 3 mo after the travel restrictions were decreed. Statistical comparisons were performed of the changes in motor function before and after the travel restrictions. RESULTS: The change in range of motion (ROM) of ankle dorsiflexion was significantly decreased after the travel restrictions. Changes in body mass index and other motor function parameters were not significant. DISCUSSION: An apparent decrease in the amount of physical activity due to travel restrictions in response to COVID‐19 negatively affected ankle dorsiflexion ROM but not other motor functions. A more sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular physical therapy services most likely contributed to this reduction. The use of remote rehabilitation tools with the involvement of physiotherapists may help mitigate such changes and prevent more severe physical decline.","Nishizawa, Hitomi; Nakamura, Akinori",Muscle Nerve,https://doi.org/10.1002/mus.27348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34105182/,439

Priorities such as minimizing viral transmission, preserving (personal protective equipment) PPE, and freeing hospital beds have driven unconventional approaches to managing GI patients. Conversion of endoscopy units to COVID units and redeployment of gastroenterology (GI) fellows and faculty has profoundly changed the profile of most GI services. Meanwhile, consult and procedural volumes have been drastically reduced. In this review we share our collective experiences, how we have changed our practice of medicine, in response to the COVID surge. While we will review our management of specific consults and conditions, the overarching theme focuses primarily on non-invasive measures and maximizing medical therapies. Endoscopic procedures have been reserved for those timely interventions that are most likely to be therapeutic. The role of multidisciplinary discussion, while always important, has now become critical. And the support of our faculty and trainees remains essential. Local leadership can encourage well-being by frequent team check-ins and foster trainee development through remote learning. Advancing a clear vision and a transparent process for how to organize and triage care in the recovery phase will allow for a smooth transition to our “new normal.”","Sethi, Amrita; Swaminath, Arun; Latorre, Melissa; Behin, Daniel S.; Jodorkovsky, Daniela; Calo, Delia; Aroniadis, Olga; Mone, Anjali; Mendelsohn, Robin B.; Sharaiha, Reem Z.; Gonda, Tamas A.; Khanna, Lauren G.; Bucobo, Juan Carlos; Nagula, Satish; Ho, Sammy; Carr-Locke, David L.; Robbins, David H.",Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1542356520305280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32330565/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356520305280?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2020.04.032,439

As early life adversity has the potential to alter an individual’s appraisal of threat, we hypothesized that individuals exposed to adversity in childhood may also exhibit increased threat from environmental stressors, which in turn may impact their state anxiety levels. We examined the relations between adverse childhood experiences, assessed using the Adverse Childhood Experiences Scale (ACEs), perceived threat from COVID-19, and state anxiety in a sample of adults. Additionally, flexibility is implicated in adaptive coping with life’s stressors so we also assessed participants’ cognitive flexibility. Parallel mediation regression analyses revealed that both perceived threat from COVID-19 and flexibility in the appraisal of challenges mediated the influence of maltreatment, but not household dysfunction, on state anxiety. Our data indicate that experience with early life adversity in the form of maltreatment is associated with increased perceived threat from COVID-19, which results in higher anxiety levels for the individual. In contrast, childhood maltreatment is associated with reduced flexibility in appraising challenges, which in turn mediates the relationship between maltreatment and anxiety. The findings of this study adds to the limited literature on the impact of early life adversity on cognitive flexibility and highlights the psychological toll of COVID-19 on individuals who have been exposed to adverse childhood experiences.","Kalia, Vrinda; Knauft, Katherine; Hayatbini, Niki",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306748/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243881,439

677524,Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic,2020-11-04,"Introduction: Innovative interventions are needed to address the growing burden of breast cancer globally, especially among vulnerable patient populations. Given the success of Community Health Workers (CHWs) in addressing communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases, this scoping review will investigate the roles and impacts of CHWs in breast cancer screening programs. This paper also seeks to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of these programs, with particular attention paid to differences between CHW-led interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs).Methods: A scoping review was performed using six databases with dates ranging from 1978 to 2019. Comprehensive definitions and search terms were established for ‘Community Health Workers’ and ‘breast cancer screening’, and studies were extracted using the World Bank definition of LMIC. Screening and data extraction were protocolized using multiple independent reviewers. Chi-square test of independence was used for statistical analysis of the incidence of themes in HICs and LMICs.Results: Of the 1,551 papers screened, 33 were included based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Study locations included the United States (n=27), Bangladesh (n=1), Peru (n=1), Malawi (n=2), Rwanda (n=1), and South Africa (n=1). Three primary roles for CHWs in breast cancer screening were identified: education (n=30), direct assistance or performance of breast cancer screening (n=7), and navigational services (n=6). In these roles, CHWs improved rates of breast cancer screening (n=23) and overall community member knowledge (n=21). Two studies performed cost-analyses of CHW-led interventions.Conclusion: This review extends our understanding of CHW effectiveness to breast cancer screening. It illustrates how CHW involvement in screening programs can have a significant impact in LMICs and HICs, and highlights the three CHW roles of education, direct performance of screening, and navigational services that emerge as useful pillars around which governments and NGOs can design effective programs in this area.","Hand, Taylor; Rosseau, Natalie A.; Stiles, Christina E.; Sheih, Tianna; Ghandakly, Elizabeth; Oluwasanu, Mojisola; Olopade, Olufunmilayo I.",Global health action,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33899695/; https://doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2021.1883336,439

The S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains internal domains called fusion peptides (FP) that play essential roles in virus entry. Although membrane fusion has been broadly studied, there are still major gaps in the molecular details of lipid rearrangements in the bilayer during fusion peptide-membrane interactions. Here we employed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electron spin resonance (ESR) to gather information on the membrane fusion mechanism promoted by two putative SARS FPs. DSC data showed the peptides strongly perturb the structural integrity of anionic vesicles and support the hypothesis that the peptides generate opposing curvature stresses on phosphatidylethanolamine membranes. ESR showed that both FPs increase lipid packing and head group ordering as well as reduce the intramembrane water content for anionic membranes. Therefore, bending moment in the bilayer could be generated, promoting negative curvature. The significance of the ordering effect, membrane dehydration, changes in the curvature properties and the possible role of negatively charged phospholipids in helping to overcome the high kinetic barrier involved in the different stages of the SARS-CoV-mediated membrane fusion are discussed.","Basso, Luis G.

From predictions of peptide binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules with moderate accuracy, limited allele coverage, and no good estimates of the other events in the antigen-processing pathway, the field has evolved significantly. Methods have now been developed that produce highly accurate binding predictions for many alleles and integrate both proteasomal cleavage and transport events. Moreover have so-called pan-specific methods been developed, which allow for prediction of peptide binding to MHC alleles characterized by limited or no peptide binding data. Most of the developed methods are publicly available, and have proven to be very useful as a shortcut in epitope discovery.

The study represents an exhaustive compilation of relevant macroeconomic data regarding the status of the agri-food sector from a demand side perspective and an overview of the food product producer and consumer prices after the shock. Its main purpose is to assess the resilience level of the agri-food sector to the coronavirus pandemic, analyzing its effect on commodity prices and focusing on the supply and value chain. The results highlight that fresh and perishable products, whose production or harvest took place during the first wave of COVID-19, have suffered price level effects, while storable products have not registered significant impacts. This phenomenon is mainly due to the vulnerability of the harvest and production phases, which affected fresh and perishable products supply, and to the resilience of transports and logistics, which instead ensured the supply of storable products to the final consumer. Especially in case of future pandemic waves, the implications and information deriving from the present analysis could support researchers, policy makers and managers, serving as an assessment tool to build suitable strategies for the whole agri-food supply chain and thus ensure sector resilience during these unprecedented times.","Coluccia, Benedetta; Agnusdei, Giulio Paolo; Miglietta, Pier Paolo; De Leo, Federica",Food Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956713520307556?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33424138/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107839; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956713520307556,439

Due to the lack of immediately available vaccines and effective drugs, many policy- and decision-makers have focused on non-pharmacological methods, including social distancing. This study was aimed at assessing the effects of the implementation of this policy in Iran, one of the countries most affected by COVID-19. We conducted a quasi-experimental study, utilizing the interrupted time series analysis (ITSA) approach. Methods: We collected daily data between February 20, 2020 and January 29, 2021, through governmental websites from 954 public hospitals and healthcare settings. The Iranian government launched the social distancing policy on March 27, 2020. Statistical analyses, including ITSA, were carried out with R software Version 3.6.1 (London, UK). Results: During the study period, 1,398,835 confirmed incidence cases and 57,734 deaths occurred. We found a decrease of -179.93 (95% CI: -380.11 to -20.25, P-value=0.078) confirmed incidence cases following the implementation of the social distancing policy, corresponding to a daily decrease in the trend of -31.17 (95% CI: -46.95 to -15.40, P-value=0.08).

679336,False-negative RT-PCR for COVID-19 and a diagnostic risk score: a retrospective cohort study among patients admitted to hospital,2021-02-09,"There were excellent reasons to reform intensive animal agriculture prior to COVID-19. Unfortunately, though, intensive animal agriculture has grown rapidly over the last century. All signs indicate that it will continue to grow in the future. This is bad news for billions of animals. It’s also bad news for those who want an animal-friendly food system. Because the public isn’t very concerned about the plight of animals—or is concerned, but has a high tolerance for cognitive dissonance—animal activists regularly engage in indirect activism. Indirect activism involves arguing that some cause that’s indirectly related to the activist’s primary agenda provides reasons to act in ways that are congruent with that agenda. In this paper, we consider the two indirect arguments that animal activists advanced in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: first, some used COVID-19 to criticize intensive animal agriculture—many of these had US-based audiences as their target; second, and more modestly, some activists used COVID-19 to condemn wet markets specifically. We contend that both arguments had the risk of backfiring: they risked promoting the very systems that are worst for animals. We then assess the moral significance of this risk, concluding that while it may have been permissible to advance these arguments, there were some serious moral considerations against doing so—ones that weren’t addressed by flagging animal activists’ concern for animals or any other stakeholder in the discussion. In both cases, we think there are plausible precautionary arguments against the strategies that these activists pursued. Additionally, in the case of arguments against wet markets specifically, we contend that the precautionary argument can be supplemented with a side constraint condition that, arguably, activists violated insofar as they were acting in ways that maintain a racist and xenophobic system.","Spiehler, Alyse; Fischer, Bob",Food Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41055-021-00090-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027033/,439
679525,Adjunctive Corticosteroids for COVID-19: A Retrospective Cohort Study,2020-07-21,"A one-dimensional droplet evaporation model is used to estimate the droplet lifetime from evaporation in air. The mathematical model invokes assumptions of spherical symmetry, ideal gas mixture, binary diffusion, no re-condensation on droplet surface, and constant properties. Four initial droplet diameters (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mm), two ambient temperatures (20 and 30 C) and a range of ambient relative humidity are considered. For the conditions studied, the results show that the ambient relative humidity plays an important role in the droplet lifetime calculation. Increasing the ambient temperature does not necessarily decrease the droplet lifetime; it occurs only when the ambient relative humidity is set below 37%. When the ambient relative humidity is higher than 37%, the higher ambient temperature (30 C) results in a longer droplet lifetime for the same initial droplet diameter considered. The results also suggest that there may exist a critical ambient relative humidity; beyond which, the droplet lifetime will increase exponentially. For ambient temperature at 30 C, the critical ambient relative humidity is around 55.7%. It must be mentioned that the results of this study do not imply that the COVID-19 virus will be deactivated at the end of the droplet lifetime. The study simply shows the potential effects resulting from the ambient temperature and ambient relative humidity on virus carrying drops.","Chen, Lea-Der",Int J Hyg Environ Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113568; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463920305149?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615522/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1438463920305149,439

Scholars refer to this finding as the prevention paradox. We examine whether this logic applies to SARS-CoV-2 infected persons considered low to moderate risk. METHODS: We conducted a population-representative survey and sero-surveillance study for SARS-CoV-2 among adults in Orange County, California. Participants answered questions about health behaviors and provided a finger-pin-prick sample from 10 July to 16 August 2020. RESULTS: Of the 2979 adults, those reporting low- and moderate-risk behavior accounted for between 78% and 92% of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Asymptomatic individuals, as well as persons with low and moderate scores for self-reported likelihood of having had SARS-CoV-2, accounted for the majority of infections.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.","Malloy, G.

Cancer patients are at risk for infection exposure and serious complications. A prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for the timely adoption of isolation measures and the appropriate management of cancer treatments. In lung cancer patients the symptoms of infection 19 may resemble those exhibited by the underlying oncologic condition, possibly leading to diagnostic overlap and delays. Moreover, cancer patients might display a prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV-2, causing long interruptions or delay of cancer treatments. However, the association between the positivity of RT-PCR assays and the patient’s infectivity remains uncertain. We describe the case of a patient with non-small cell lung cancer, and a severe ab extrinseco compression of the trachea, whose palliative radiotherapy was delayed because of the prolonged positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2. The patient did not show clinical symptoms suggestive of active infection, but the persistent positivity of RT-PCR assays imposed the continuation of isolation measures and the delay of radiotherapy for over two months. Finally, the negative result of SARS-CoV-2 viral culture allowed us to verify the absence of viral activity and to rule out the infectivity of the patient, who could finally continue her cancer treatment.","Ferrari, Anna; Trevenzoli, Marco; Sasset, Lolita; Di Liso, Elisabetta; Tavian, Toni; Rossi, Lucia; Di Meco, Eugenia; Cattelan, Anna Maria",Curr Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3390/curroncol28010083; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567626/,439

METHODS: We acquired information and data on the general information, infection and death status of health care workers in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak and completed statistical analyses. RESULTS: We have obtained the data on 2,457 infected cases among health care workers in Wuhan, China. More than half of the infected individuals were nurses (52.06%), while 33.62% of infected cases were doctors and 14.33% of cases were medical staff. In particular, the case infection rate of nurses (2.22%) was remarkably higher than that of doctors (1.92%). Most infected cases among health care workers were female (72.28%). A majority of the infected health care workers (89.26%) came from general hospitals, followed by specialized hospitals (5.70%) and community hospitals (5.05%). The case infection rate of health care workers (2.10%) was dramatically higher than that of non-health care workers (0.43%). The case fatality rate of health care workers (0.69%) was significantly lower than that of non-health care workers (5.30%). CONCLUSIONS: The infection risk of HCWs is clearly higher than that of non-HCWs. HCWs play an essential role in fighting the pandemic. The analysis of the infection status of HCWs is essential to attract enough attention from the public, provide effective suggestions for government agencies and improve protective measures for HCWs.","Zheng, Lichun; Wang, Xiang; Zhou, Chongchong; Liu, Qin; Li, Shuang; Sun, Qin; Wang, Mengjia; Zhou, Qian; Wang, Wenmei",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409825/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa588,439

Induced abortion (IA) and the recent COVID-19 pandemic can be contributing factors to it but these have not been adequately studied so far. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relation of IA incidence and the COVID-19 pandemic to declining rates of delivery, as per our Sardinian experience. METHODS We analyzed the registered data from the official Italian statistics surveys of deliveries and IA in the last 10 years from 2011 to 2020 in Sardinia. RESULTS A total of 106,557 deliveries occurred and a progressive decrease in the birth rate has been observed. A total of 18,250 IA occurred and a progressive decline has been observed here as well. The ratio between IA and deliveries remained constant over the decade. Between 2011 and 2019 a variation of -4.32% was observed for IA while in the last year, during the COVID-19 pandemic the decrease of the procedures was equal to -12.30%. For the deliveries, a mean variation of the -4.8% was observed between the 2011 and the 2019 while in the last year, during the COVID-19 pandemic the decrease was about -9%. Considering the about 30% reduction of live births between 2011 and 2020, there is an almost proportional reduction in IA. CONCLUSIONS Public policy responses to decreasing fertility, especially pronatalist ones, would be provided with evidence base about trends in delivery and IA and women's decision making.","Corda, Valentina; Monni, Giovanni; Murgia, Federica; Piras, Alba; Ibba, Rosa Maria; Chervenak, Frank A; McCullough, Laurence B",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388327/; https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0289,439

METHODS: From 5/15–6/1/2020, Bhutanese and Burmese refugee community leaders were invited to complete an anonymous, online survey and shared the link with other community members who were English-proficient, ≥18 years old, and currently living in the USA. We identified characteristics associated with pandemic-related discrimination and stress applying ordinal logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 218 refugees from 23 states, nearly one third of participants reported experiencing at least one type of discrimination, and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of pandemic-related stress. Having had COVID-19, having a family member with COVID-19, and being an essential worker were associated with discrimination. Discrimination, financial crisis, and female gender were associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing pandemic-related discrimination should remain a priority, as should the promotion of social support and coping strategies.

EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil), rich in saturated fatty acids and commonly used in the Mediterranean diet, seems to control post-prandial hyperglycemia better than butter. Subjects with type 1 diabetes are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease and show endothelial dysfunction, an early manifestation of atherosclerosis in the first years of the disease. Our study aims to evaluate whether EVOO and butter influence endothelial function in subjects with type 1 diabetes when added to a single high glycemic index (HGI) meal. In this exploratory cross-over study, 10 subjects with type 1 diabetes and 6 healthy subjects were scheduled to receive two types of HGI meals: one enriched with EVOO and one with butter. Before and after each test meal at different time points, all subjects underwent the evaluation of endothelial function by flow-mediated dilation technique, glucose and lipids measurements, and gastric emptying assessment by ultrasound. Flow-mediated dilation significantly increased after EVOO-enriched meal compared with butter in subjects with type 1 diabetes (two-way-repeated measurements ANOVA, p = 0.007). In patients with type 1 diabetes, the add-on of EVOO to HGI meal improves vascular function compared to butter, which has detrimental effects.","Cutruzzolà, Antonio; Parise, Martina; Vallelunga, Rosarina; Lamanna, Francesco; Gnasso, Agostino; Irace, Concetta",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13072436; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34371945/,439

Nasal high-flow therapy could possibly increase the spreading of exhalates from patients. The aim of this study is to investigate whether nasal high-flow therapy affects the range of the expiratory plume compared with spontaneous breathing. DESIGN: Interventional experiment on single breaths of a healthy volunteer. SETTING: Research laboratory at the Bauhaus-University Weimar. SUBJECTS: A male subject. INTERVENTIONS: Videos and images from a schlieren optical system were analyzed during spontaneous breathing and different nasal high-flow rates. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The maximal exhalation spread was 0.99, 2.18, 2.92, and 4.1 m during spontaneous breathing, nasal high-flow of 20 L/min, nasal high-flow of 40 L/min, and nasal high-flow of 60 L/min, respectively. Spreading of the expiratory plume in the sagittal plane can completely be blocked with a surgical mask. CONCLUSIONS: Nasal high-flow therapy increases the range of the expiratory air up to more than 4 meters. The risk to pick up infectious particles could be increased within this range. Attachment of a surgical mask over the nasal high-flow cannula blocks the expiratory airstream.","Dellweg, Dominic; Kerl, Jens; Gena, Amayu Wakoya; Alsaad, Hayder; Voelker, Conrad",Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000005009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34135285/,439
685405,Cardiac Rehabilitation and Complementary Physical Training in Elderly Patients after Acute Coronary Syndrome: A Pilot Study,2021-05-25,"Bovine eimeriosis is considered to be of considerable importance for the productivity and health of cattle worldwide. Despite the importance of cattle farming in Austria, little is known in this country about the abundance and distribution of bovine Eimeria spp. The objective of this study was to obtain detailed information about the occurrence of different Eimeria spp. on Austrian dairy farms. Fecal samples from individual calves (n = 868) from 296 farms all over Austria (82 districts) were collected. Additionally, each farmer was questioned about the occurrence of calf diarrhea, and about the knowledge on coccidiosis and possible control measures. On 97.97% of the investigated farms, calves excreted Eimeria oocysts, and 83.67% of the individual samples were positive. After sporulation of positive samples pooled from each farm, 11 Eimeria species were found, with E. bovis (in 65.54% of the samples and 27.74% of the farms), E.zuernii (63.85%/13.86%), E. auburnensis (56.76%/13.41%) and E. ellipsoidalis (54.05%/14.38%) being the most prevalent, followed by E. alabamensis (45.61%/11.56%), E. subspherica (35.14%/5.5.05%), E. cylindrica (33.11%/7.00%), and E. canadensis (31.08%/7.74%). E. wyomingensis, E. pellita and E. bukidnonensis were only found sporadically (3.04–4.73% of the samples and 0.16–0.59% of the farms). Mixed infections were present on all farms (2–9 Eimeria species/farm). Prevalences by state provinces were high throughout with 77.1–87.9% of the samples and 93.8–100% of the farms. Lower Austria had the highest percentage of positive farms, and Vorarlberg the lowest. Individual OPG (oocysts per gram of feces) values were generally low; 75% of the samples had an OPG of 1,000 or less. The highest detected OPG was 72,400. The mean OPG was 2,525 with above average numbers in Tirol, Carinthia, and Lower Austria. The mean OPG values were significantly positively correlated with the cattle density in the different districts. The majority of the samples were from female Simmenthal calves. Clinical coccidiosis (diarrhea) was observed in 74 cases, and (semi-)liquid diarrhea (56 animals) was significantly correlated with OPG (p < 0.05). Linear regression on the OPG data showed that OPG values significantly decreased with increasing age of the calves, while the percentage of positive samples increased with age (p < 0.05 for both). The term “coccidia” was familiar to 45% of the farmers, and anticoccidial treatment was performed by 13.51% of them, most commonly with toltrazuril. Considering the ubiquitous occurrence and the possible clinical and economic relevance of calf eimeriosis, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.","Koutny, H.; Joachim, A.; Tichy, A.; Baumgartner, W.",Parasitol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00436-011-2715-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22167365/,439

In autopsies the most observed pattern is diffuse alveolar damage with alveolar-epithelial type-II cell hyperplasia, hyaline membranes, and frequent thromboembolic disease. However, these observations cannot explain some clinical, radiological and physiopathological features observed in SARS-CoV-2 interstitial pneumonia, including the occurrence of vascular enlargement on CT and preserved lung compliance in subjects even presenting with or developing respiratory failure. Histological investigation on early-phase pneumonia on perioperative samples and lung biopsies revealed peculiar morphological and morpho-phenotypical changes including hyper-expression of phosphorylated STAT3 and immune checkpoint molecules (PD-L1 and IDO) in alveolar-epithelial and endothelial cells. These features might explain in part these discrepancies.","Chilosi, Marco; Poletti, Venerino; Ravaglia, Claudia; Rossi, Giulio; Dubini, Alessandra; Piciucchi, Sara; Pedica, Federica; Bronte, Vincenzo; Pizzolo, Giovanni; Martignoni, Guido; Doglioni, Claudio",Mod Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-021-00808-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883694/,439

The commitment of the PPC team and the engagement of the family at different levels can play a key role in advancing a better quality of life in children and families. Method: A descriptive pre-post educational intervention study was carried out. The creation of a training program (with the term “school” used to denote this effort) strives to prepare caretakers to master the skills as well as provide support for the care of children with serious conditions requiring palliative through home-based initiatives. The analysis includes aspects of learning and satisfaction with the activity in a final sample of 14 families who had one child enrolled into a home-based palliative care program. Results: After the educational intervention in our school, the mean score of the theoretical evaluation was 9.14 points (SD 0.96), showing improvement with respect to the initial assessment, (mean diff. of +0.98 points). Although the analysis of all conceptual areas demonstrates a trend towards a positive impact of the intervention, feeding-related instruction saw the highest level of improvement, with a mean difference of +1.43 points.

There are still many unknowns on the implication of cellular factors that regulate the entry process. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the carboxy-terminal endodomain of S, which faces the cytosol during and after opening of the fusion pore at early stages of the virus life cycle. Here we show that the ezrin membrane-actin linker interacts with S endodomain through the F1 lobe of its FERM domain and that both the eight carboxy-terminal amino-acids and a membrane-proximal cysteine cluster of S endodomain are important for this interaction in vitro. Interestingly, we found that ezrin is present at the site of entry of S-pseudotyped lentiviral particles in Vero E6 cells. Targeting ezrin function by small interfering RNA increased S-mediated entry of pseudotyped particles in epithelial cells. Furthermore, deletion of the eight carboxy-terminal amino acids of S enhanced S-pseudotyped particles infection. Expression of the ezrin dominant negative FERM domain enhanced cell susceptibility to infection by SARS-CoV and S-pseudotyped particles and potentiated S-dependent membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Ezrin interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain and limits virus entry and fusion. Our data present a novel mechanism involving a cellular factor in the regulation of S-dependent early events of infection.","Millet, Jean Kaoru; Kien, François; Cheung, Chung-Yan; Siu, Yu-Lam; Chan, Wing-Lim; Li, Huiying; Leung, Hiu-Lan; Jaume, Martial; Bruzzone, Roberto; Malik Peiris, Joseph S.; Altmeyer, Ralf Marius; Nal, Béatrice",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23185364/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049566,439

Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate–ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective comparative study including three groups of children with recurrent tonsillitis. Group 1: (100 patients) had no prophylactic treatment. Group 2 (100 patients) received [60 mg/kg] prophylactic dose of AZT divided as (10 mg/kg/day) over 6 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Group 3 (100 patients) received AZT as in group 2 plus commercially available Echinacea in a dose of 5 ml oral suspension; 3 times daily for 10 consecutive days every month for 6 consecutive months. Number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of tonsillitis symptoms were assessed and compared in different groups. RESULTS: Group 2 and group 3 had significant less number of tonsillitis attacks and severity of assessed symptoms during 6 months of prophylactic treatment with significant better results in group 3 (i.e. AZT plus Echinacea) compared to group 2 (I.e.

Similarly, there is limited knowledge regarding the effect of the approved treatments on conception and pregnancy outcomes. Here, we report the first series of pregnancies in PNH patients from the Middle Eastern region from our tertiary care hospital. Ten pregnancies in four females after diagnosis with PNH were identified. In terms of PNH management, only eculizumab was used, as the safety of ravulizumab use in pregnancies has not yet been established. In the antepartum period, the patients had variable symptoms that ranged from mild symptoms including epistaxis, tea-colored urine and vaginal bleeding to life-threatening vessel thrombosis. Further, red blood cell and platelet transfusions were required because of bleeding and hemolysis in four pregnancies. The pregnancy outcomes varied, but based on these, the safety of eculizumab use during pregnancy remained inconclusive. The postpartum period was complicated in one case by portal vein thrombosis and was managed accordingly. In conclusion, pregnant females with PNH are at an increased risk for complications due to PNH, and thus experienced hematologists and obstetricians should be involved jointly in their care.","Al-Dosari, Yara Mohammad; Al-Zahrani, Hazza; Al-Mohareb, Fahad; Hashmi, Shahrukh",Saudi J Med Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.4103/sjmms.sjmms_4_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084110/,439

We sought to discover proteins differentially expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from mice infected with MHV-68. Mice were infected intranasally with MHV-68. After nine days, as the lytic phase of infection resolved, differential BAL proteins were identified by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Of 23 unique proteins, acute phase proteins, vitamin A transport, and oxidative stress response factors Pdx6 and EC-SOD (Sod3) were enriched. Correspondingly, iNOS2 was induced in lung tissue by seven days post-infection. Oxidative stress was partly a direct result of MHV-68 infection, as reactive oxygen species (ROS) were induced in cultured murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human lung A549 cells infected with MHV-68. Finally, mice infected with a recombinant MHV-68 co-expressing inflammatory cytokine murine interleukin 6 (IL6) showed exacerbated oxidative stress and soluble type I collagen characteristic of tissue recovery. Thus, oxidative stress appears to be a salient feature of MHV-68 pathogenesis, in part caused by lytic replication of the virus and IL6. Proteins and small molecules in lung oxidative stress networks therefore may provide new therapeutic targets to ameliorate respiratory virus infections.","Bortz, Eric; Wu, Ting-Ting; Patel, Parthive; Whitelegge, Julian P.; Sun, Ren",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30486363/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10120670,439

690233,Statin Use Is Associated with a Decreased Risk of Mortality among Patients with COVID-19,2021-04-01,"The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in South Africa was identified on 5 March 2020, and by 26 March the country was in full lockdown (Oxford stringency index of 90)1. Despite the early response, by November 2020, over 785,000 people in South Africa were infected, which accounted for approximately 50% of all known African infections2. In this study, we analyzed 1,365 near whole genomes and report the identification of 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 isolated between 6 March and 26 August 2020. Most of these lineages have unique mutations that have not been identified elsewhere. We also show that three lineages (B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 and C.1) spread widely in South Africa during the first wave, comprising ~42% of all infections in the country at the time. The newly identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 nucleotide mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence, including one amino acid change on the spike protein, D614G (ref. 3), was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa by the end of August 2020. An early South African-specific lineage, B.1.106, which was identified in April 2020 (ref. 4), became extinct after nosocomial outbreaks were controlled in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Our findings show that genomic surveillance can be implemented on a large scale in Africa to identify new lineages and inform measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Such genomic surveillance presented in this study has been shown to be crucial in the identification of the 501Y.V2 variant in South Africa in December 2020 (ref. 5).","Tegally, Houriiyah; Wilkinson, Eduan; Lessells, Richard J; Giandhari, Jennifer; Pillay, Sureshnee; Msomi, Nokukhanya; Mlisana, Koleka; Bhiman, Jinal N; von Gottberg, Anne; Walaza, Sibongile; Fonseca, Vagner; Allam, Mushal; Ismail, Arshad; Glass, Allison J; Engelbrecht, Susan; Van Zyl, Gert; Preiser, Wolfgang; Williamson, Carolyn; Petruccione, Francesco; Sigal, Alex; Gazy, Inbal; Hardie, Diana; Hsiao, Nei-Yuan; Martin, Darren; York, Denis; Goedhals, Dominique; San, Emmanuel James; Giovanetti, Marta; Lourenço, José; Alcantara, Luiz Carlos Junior; de Oliveira, Tulio",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01255-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531709/,439
690751,Covid-19 pandemic and possible rebound phenomenon in incidence of acute myocardial infarction,2020-11-17,"Visitor restriction policies have been implemented on many hospital units as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. These policies are integral to the strategies that hospitals are using to limit exposure risks during the pandemic. However, visitor restriction policies disproportionally affect hospitalized children. The trauma caused by lack of family at the bedside of adult patients during the Covid-19 pandemic has been studied but there is a lack of primary research on the impact of the Covid-19 visiting policy restrictions on pediatric patients. Long term studies are needed to understand the effect of this separation on children and their caregivers.","McBride, Deborah L.",J Pediatr Nurs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34538537/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0882596321002724?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.09.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0882596321002724,439
