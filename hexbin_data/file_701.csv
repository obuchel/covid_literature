19899,"100 Years of the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head and Neck Surgery:: Where do we come from? Where are we? Where are we going?",2021-05-13,"Tissue engineering is an evolving multi-disciplinary field with cutting-edge technologies and innovative scientific perceptions that promise functional regeneration of damaged tissues/organs. Tissue engineered medical products (TEMPs) are biomaterial-cell products or a cell-drug combination which is injected, implanted or topically applied in the course of a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. Current tissue engineering strategies aim at 3D printing/bioprinting that uses cells and polymers to construct living tissues/organs in a layer-by-layer fashion with high 3D precision. However, unlike conventional drugs or therapeutics, TEMPs and 3D bioprinted tissues are novel therapeutics and need different regulatory protocols for clinical trials and commercialization processes. Therefore, it is essential to understand the complexity of raw materials, cellular components, and manufacturing procedures to establish standards that can help to translate these products from bench to bedside. These complexities are reflected in the regulations and standards that are globally in practice to prevent any compromise or undue risks to patients. This review comprehensively describes the current legislations, standards for TEMPs with a special emphasis on 3D bioprinted tissues. Based on these overviews, challenges in the clinical translation of TEMPs & 3D bioprinted tissues/organs along with their ethical concerns and future perspectives are discussed.","Sekar, Muthu Parkkavi; Budharaju, Harshavardhan; Zennifer, Allen; Sethuraman, Swaminathan; Vermeulen, Niki; Sundaramurthi, Dhakshinamoorthy; Kalaskar, Deepak M",J Tissue Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8330463/,701
60404,Risk factors for symptomatic anastomotic post-operative recurrence following ileo-colic resection in Crohn's disease.,2021-01-15,"Although near-infrared spectroscopy is increasingly being used to monitor cerebral oxygenation in neonates, it has a limited penetration depth. The T2-prepared Blood Imaging of Oxygen Saturation (T2-BIOS) magnetic resonance sequence provides an oxygen saturation estimate on a voxel-by-voxel basis, without needing a respiratory calibration experiment. In 15 neonates, oxygen saturation measured by T2-prepared blood imaging of oxygen saturation and near-infrared spectroscopy were compared. In addition, these measures were compared to cerebral blood flow and venous oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus. A strong linear relation was found between the oxygen saturation measured by magnetic resonance imaging and the oxygen saturation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy ( R2 = 0.64, p < 0.001). Strong linear correlations were found between near-infrared spectroscopy oxygen saturation, and magnetic resonance imaging measures of frontal cerebral blood flow, whole brain cerebral blood flow and venous oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus ( R2 = 0.71, 0.50, 0.65; p < 0.01). The oxygen saturation obtained by T2-prepared blood imaging of oxygen saturation correlated with venous oxygen saturation in the sagittal sinus ( R2 = 0.49, p = 0.023), but no significant correlations could be demonstrated with frontal and whole brain cerebral blood flow. These results suggest that measuring oxygen saturation by T2-prepared blood imaging of oxygen saturation is feasible, even in neonates. Strong correlations between the various methods work as a cross validation for near-infrared spectroscopy and T2-prepared blood imaging of oxygen saturation, confirming the validity of using of these techniques for determining cerebral oxygenation.","Alderliesten, Thomas; De Vis, Jill B; Lemmers, Petra Ma; Hendrikse, Jeroen; Groenendaal, Floris; van Bel, Frank; Benders, Manon Jnl; Petersen, Esben T",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x16647737; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27151900/,701

61278,Adverse obstetric history is not a risk factor for poor outcome after ventral rectopexy for obstructive defaecation syndrome.,2018,"BACKGROUND Parenchymal transection represents a crucial step during liver surgery and many different techniques have been described so far. Stapler resection is supposed to be faster than CUSA resection. However, whether speed impacts on the inflammatory response in patients undergoing liver resection (LR) remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a randomized controlled trial including 40 patients undergoing anatomical LR. Primary endpoint was transection speed (cm2/min). Secondary endpoints included the perioperative change of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, overall surgery duration, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS Mean transection speed was significantly higher in patients undergoing stapler hepatectomy compared to CUSA resection (CUSA: 1 (0.4) cm2/min vs. Stapler: 10.8 (6.1) cm2/min; p<0.0001). Analyzing the impact of surgery duration on inflammatory response revealed a significant correlation between IL-6 levels measured at the end of surgery and the overall length of surgery (p<0.0001, r = 0.6188). Patients undergoing CUSA LR had significantly higher increase of interleukin-6 (IL-6) after parenchymal transection compared to patients with stapler hepatectomy in the portal and hepatic veins, respectively (p = 0.028; p = 0.044). C-reactive protein levels on the first post-operative day were significantly lower in the stapler cohort (p = 0.010). There was a trend towards a reduced overall surgery time in patients with stapler LR, especially in the subgroup of patients undergoing minor hepatectomies (p = 0.020). CONCLUSIONS Liver resection using staplers is fast, safe and suggests a diminished inflammatory response probably due to a decreased parenchymal transection time.

Our aim was to compare the incidence of flames with and without smoke evacuation in a porcine ex vivo model. A monopolar device was activated after application of either 70% isopropyl alcohol/2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG-IPA) or 74% isopropyl alcohol/0.7% iodine povacrylex (iodine-IPA) skin preparations. No suction was compared with standard wall suction and 2 monopolar devices with built-in smoke evacuators. Flames were generated in 60% of CHG-IPA and 47% of iodine-IPA tests without suction. Wall suction did not significantly reduce fires (CHG-IPA 43% vs. 60%, P=0.30; iodine-IPA 57% vs. 47%, P=0.61). Use of both smoke evacuation devices reduced fires for CHG-IPA (17% vs. 60%, P=0.001 and 20% vs. 60%, P=0.004) but not for iodine-IPA. Smoke evacuation devices reduce fire risk when used with a chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation.","Carmichael, Heather; Samuels, Jason M; Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Robinson, Thomas N; Barnett, Carlton C; Jones, Teresa S; Jones, Edward L","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0000000000000734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633578/,701
66387,Pathogenesis of morbidity after fast-track laparoscopic colonic cancer surgery.,2011,"BACKGROUND The single-injection start regimen for aripiprazole once-monthly 400 mg (AOM 400) in patients with schizophrenia requires a single intramuscular injection in the gluteal or deltoid site and 14 days of concurrent oral therapy. A simplified, single-day regimen of two injections at separate gluteal and/or deltoid injection sites, together with a single 20-mg dose of oral aripiprazole on the 1st day, was assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS A previously developed population-pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for characterizing aripiprazole PK following oral administration and gluteal intramuscular depot injection was expanded to include deltoid injection. Simulations were conducted to assess PK profiles following various (including two-injection) start regimens. Postmarketing data on patients who received higher-than-recommended AOM doses were used to assess overall safety/tolerability. RESULTS The two-injection start regimen with a single concurrent oral dose displayed a comparable PK profile to the single-injection start regimen with concurrent 14-day oral administration in simulations. The safety assessment indicated the two-injection start regimen was unlikely to be associated with safety concerns beyond those expected with a single-injection start regimen. CONCLUSION These data support use of the two-injection start regimen in clinical practice to reduce reliance on daily oral administration and optimize the therapeutic benefits of AOM 400 in patients with schizophrenia.","Wang, Yanlin; Wang, Xiaofeng; Harlin, Matt; Larsen, Frank; Panni, Moeen; Yildirim, Murat; Madera, Jessica; Arias, Liz; Forbes, Andy; Mustafa, Nihal; Ruiz-White, Inez; Raoufinia, Arash",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2021.1965974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407720/,701
66776,Right lateral position for laparoscopic splenic flexure mobilization.,2011,"INTRODUCTION Chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), originally were prescribed for prevention or treatment of malaria, but now successfully are used in several rheumatologic diseases. In addition, in recent decades considering their immunomodulatory effects, high tolerably and low cost, they are evaluated for various viral infections from HIV to COVID-19. AREAS COVERED In this review we tried to summarize all available studies on HCQ and CQ efficacy for management of viral infections and the probable mechanisms of action. The data were collected by searching ""Hydroxychloroquine"", ""Choloroquine"", ""Viral infection"", and names of various viral infections in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from commencement to June 2020. Out of 95 search results, 74 most relevant works were gathered. EXPERT OPINION HCQ/CQ showed acceptable efficacy in HIV especially as an adjuvant treatment beside routine HAART. However, for some viral infections such as ZIKA, EBOLA, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, human studies are lacking. In the COVID-19 pandemic, in vitro and preliminary human studies showed encouraging findings. However, later well-designed trials and retrospective studies with large sample size, not only reported non-significant efficacy but also showed more cardiac adverse reactions. Alkalinisation of acid vesicles is the most important mechanism of action.","Naghipour, Sara; Ghodousi, Mahsa; Rahsepar, Sara; Elyasi, Sepideh",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14787210.2020.1792291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32631083/,701

71219,Adult Hirschsprung's disease in Jamaica: operative treatment and outcome.,2011,"Activation of the stimulator of interferon gene (STING) pathway within the tumor microenvironment has been shown to generate a strong antitumor response. Although local administration of STING agonists has promise for cancer immunotherapy, the dosing regimen needed to achieve efficacy requires frequent intratumoral injections over months. Frequent dosing for cancer treatment is associated with poor patient adherence, with as high as 48% of patients failing to comply. Multiple intratumoral injections also disrupt the tumor microenvironment and vascular networks and therefore increase the risk of metastasis. Here, we developed microfabricated polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) particles that remain at the site of injection and release encapsulated STING agonist as a programmable sequence of pulses at predetermined time points that mimic multiple injections over days to weeks. A single intratumoral injection of STING agonist-loaded microparticles triggered potent local and systemic antitumor immune responses, inhibited tumor growth, and prolonged survival as effectively as multiple soluble doses, but with reduced metastasis in several mouse tumor models. STING agonist-loaded microparticles improved the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and substantially decreased the tumor recurrence rate from 100 to 25% in mouse models of melanoma when administered during surgical resection. In addition, we demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of STING microparticles on an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in mice that does not allow multiple intratumoral injections. These findings could directly benefit current STING agonist therapy by decreasing the number of injections, reducing risk of metastasis, and expanding its applicability to hard-to-reach cancers.","Lu, Xueguang; Miao, Lei; Gao, Wenting; Chen, Ziqi; McHugh, Kevin J; Sun, Yehui; Tochka, Zachary; Tomasic, Stephanie; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Hyacinthe, Alain; Huang, Yuxuan; Graf, Tyler; Hu, Quanyin; Sarmadi, Morteza; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; Jaklenec, Ana",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz6606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32801144/,701
75824,Would endoscopic surgery be the gold standard for stapes surgery in the future? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-07-09,"Lack of vaccine confidence can contribute to drops in vaccination coverage and subsequent outbreaks of diseases like measles and polio. Low trust in vaccines is attributed to a combination of factors, including lack of understanding, vaccine scares, flawed policies, social media and mistrust of vaccine manufacturers, scientists and decision-makers. The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare societies' vulnerability to new pathogens and the critical role of vaccines (and their acceptability) in containing this and future pandemics. It has also put science at the forefront of the response, with several governments relying on academics to help shape policy and communicate with the public. Against this backdrop, protecting public trust in scientists and scientific output is arguably more important than ever. Yet, conflicts of interest (CoI) in biomedical research remain ubiquitous and harmful, and measures to curb them have had limited success. There is also evidence of bias in industry-sponsored vaccine studies and academics are voicing concerns about the risks of working in a CoI prevalent research area. Here, we set out to challenge established thinking with regard to vaccine confidence, by shifting the gaze from a deficit in public understanding towards probity in research relationships and suggesting an alternative and perhaps complementary strategy for addressing vaccine mistrust. We argue that a concerted effort needs to be made to revisit the norms that undergird contemporary vaccine research, coupled with a willingness of all stakeholders to reimagine those relationships with an emphasis on demonstrating trustworthiness and probity.","Wheelock, Ana; Ives, Jonathan",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106805; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687913/,701
77137,"Diverticulitis Management, a Snapshot Collaborative Audit Study (DAMASCUS): protocol for an international, multicentre, prospective observational study.",2021-04-29,"Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are potent GABAA receptor agonists and strong anticonvulsants. In the developing brain they can cause neuronal and oligodendroglia apoptosis, impair synaptogenesis, inhibit neurogenesis and trigger long-term neurocognitive sequelae. In humans, the vulnerable period is projected to extend from the third trimester of pregnancy to the third year of life. Infants with seizures and epilepsies may receive barbiturates, benzodiazepines and their combinations for days, months or years. How exposure duration affects neuropathological sequelae is unknown. Here we investigated toxicity of phenobarbital/midazolam (Pb/M) combination in the developing nonhuman primate brain. Neonatal rhesus monkeys received phenobarbital intravenously, followed by infusion of midazolam over 5 (n = 4) or 24 h (n = 4). Animals were euthanized at 8 or 36 h and brains examined immunohistochemically and stereologically. Treatment was well tolerated, physiological parameters remained at optimal levels. Compared to naïve controls, Pb/M exposed brains displayed widespread apoptosis affecting neurons and oligodendrocytes. Pattern and severity of cell death differed depending on treatment-duration, with more extensive neurodegeneration following longer exposure. At 36 h, areas of the brain not affected at 8 h displayed neuronal apoptosis, while oligodendroglia death was most prominent at 8 h. A notable feature at 36 h was degeneration of neuronal tracts and trans-neuronal death of neurons, presumably following their disconnection from degenerated presynaptic partners. These findings demonstrate that brain toxicity of Pb/M in the neonatal primate brain becomes more severe with longer exposures and expands trans-synaptically. Impact of these sequelae on neurocognitive outcomes and the brain connectome will need to be explored.","Noguchi, Kevin K; Fuhler, Nicole A; Wang, Sophie H; Capuano, Saverio; Brunner, Kevin R; Larson, Shreya; Crosno, Kristin; Simmons, Heather A; Mejia, Andres F; Martin, Lauren D; Dissen, Gregory A; Brambrink, Ansgar; Ikonomidou, Chrysanthy",Neurobiology of disease,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2020.105245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385515/,701

Objective To determine whether mandatory daily employee symptom attestation data can be used as syndromic surveillance to estimate COVID-19 hospitalizations in the communities where employees live. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study was conducted from April 2, 2020, to November 4, 2020, at a large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total of 2384 beds and 136 000 discharges in New England. The participants included 6841 employees who worked on-site at hospital 1 and lived in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Exposure Daily employee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text messaging system from a single hospital. Main Outcomes and Measures Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7-day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital census at each hospital. Results Among 6841 employees living within the 10 hospitals' service areas, 5120 (74.8%) were female individuals and 3884 (56.8%) were White individuals; the mean (SD) age was 40.8 (13.6) years, and the mean (SD) time of service was 8.8 (10.4) years. The study model had a MAE of 6.9 patients with COVID-19 and a weighted MAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital network. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5 patients (weighted MAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). For context, the mean network all-cause occupancy was 1286 during this period, so an error of 6.9 is only 0.5% of the network mean occupancy. Operationally, this level of error was negligible to the incident command center. At hospital 1, a doubling of the number of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponded to 4 additional employees reporting symptoms at the mean for hospital 1) was associated with a 5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at hospital 1 in 7 days (regression coefficient, 0.05; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07; P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that a real-time employee health attestation tool used at a single hospital could be used to estimate subsequent hospitalizations in 7 days at hospitals throughout a larger hospital network in New England.","Horng, Steven; O'Donoghue, Ashley; Dechen, Tenzin; Rabesa, Matthew; Shammout, Ayad; Markson, Lawrence; Jegadeesan, Venkat; Tandon, Manu; Stevens, Jennifer P",JAMA network open,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.13782; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34137827/,701

MATERIAL AND METHODS The program included a total of 44 patients (88 procedures) subjected to videothoracoscopy and clipping of the TSNS in a one day surgery unit. Data were collected and analysed retrospectively, and a descriptive and comparative statistical analysis was performed between the two periods (A and B). RESULTS The overall morbidity was 5 cases (11.3%). The post-surgical occurrence rate of HH was 4.54% (2 cases), and the incidence of compensatory sweating was 65.9% (minimal in 26 of the 29 cases). On comparing period B with period A, there was a significant decrease in surgical time, disappearance of recurrence of HH, a decrease of 30% in morbidity, reduction by half in the incidence of moderate to severe compensatory sweating, and an increase in the level of satisfaction. The clamps were removed in one of the poorly tolerated compensatory sweating cases, resulting in its disappearance. CONCLUSIONS Clipping the TSNS is a safe technique in the one day surgery unit, with a short learning curve (20 cases) after which comparable, or even better, results are obtained than those of sympatholysis. These results, together with their potential reversibility, makes it, in our opinion, the technique of choice in the surgery of the TSNS.","Martinez-Barenys, Carlos; Pérez, Javier; López De Castro, Pedro; Melero, Alicia; Mesa, Miguel; García, Samuel; Fernández, Esther; Astudillo, Julio",Cirugia espanola,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ciresp.2012.02.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22520560/,701

We retrospectively reviewed patients with MIS-C needing ECMO support admitted to a single Paediatric and Cardiac Intensive Care Unit within a regional center for MIS-C in South East England. Two children required ECMO for cardiovascular support. Both developed thrombotic events despite receiving heparin infusions at dosing higher than the interquartile range for our ECMO population. Case 1 developed a right anterior and middle cerebral artery infarct, which led to his death. Case 2 had a right atrial thrombus, which resolved without complication. When compared with patients undergoing ECMO in the same institution in pre-MIS-C era, fibrinogen levels were consistently higher before and during ECMO therapy. MIS-C patients presenting with hyperfibrinogenemia are likely to have a propensity toward thrombotic complications; this must be considered when optimizing the anticoagulation strategy on ECMO.","Minen, Federico; Hands, Christopher; Mustafa, Muhammad R; Pienaar, Alison; Lillie, Jon",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346988/,701

DESIGN Prospective study. ANIMALS 16 black-tailed prairie dogs. PROCEDURES Black-tailed prairie dogs were placed in an anesthesia chamber for induction of general anesthesia, which was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen delivered via mask. Immediately following anesthetic induction, a venous blood sample was obtained from the medial saphenous vein; a second venous blood sample was obtained just prior to anesthetic gas shutoff. An evaluation of venous blood gas analytes was performed on each sample. General linear mixed models with repeated measures were used for data analyses. RESULTS Median anesthetic time was 90 minutes (range, 60 to 111 minutes). A significant increase from immediately after induction to completion of anesthesia was observed in Pco2 and mean blood chloride ion, BUN, and creatinine concentrations. A decrease in Po2, mean blood pH, and anion gap was observed from induction of anesthesia to completion. No significant differences during anesthesia were observed in mean base excess or blood bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, blood glucose, lactate, and total CO2 concentrations. No complications occurred during or after anesthesia for any animal. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Examination of prairie dogs often requires general anesthesia, with isoflurane currently the inhalation agent of choice. Results suggested respiratory acidosis and relative azotemia may occur during isoflurane anesthesia of prairie dogs. Given the increased risk associated with anesthesia in small mammals and the propensity for respiratory disease in prairie dogs, insight into physiologic changes associated with isoflurane anesthesia in healthy prairie dogs can aid in perioperative evaluation and anesthetic monitoring in this rodent species.","Gardhouse, Sara M; Eshar, David; Bello, Nora; Mason, Diane",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.247.4.404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26225612/,701

During the first 24 hours of FN, paracetamol recipients had significantly lower peak temperature than placebo: mean 38.2 (standard deviation 0.8) °C versus 38.9 (0.4) °C; difference -0.78 °C (95% CI -1.38 to -0.18); p = .013. Bacterial load measurement was not informative. Paracetamol lowers body temperature during FN, and definitive trials to determine its impact on FN outcomes are needed.

Although previous studies have focused on the sexual risk behaviours among men who have sex with men (MSM), studies regarding binge alcohol drinking among MSM in Myanmar are scarce. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to identify the alcohol consumption patterns among MSM aged over 18 years in two major cities of Myanmar where the MSM population is higher than other regions. Purposive sampling was applied and sampling was made through Myanmar MSM network. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Patterns of alcohol consumption were described as frequency/percentage and mean/median as appropriate. Bivariate analysis was also done to find out the association between types of MSM and binge drinking. Results: A total of 256 MSM included in the study (mean age, 27.33±7.7 years). Of 256 participants, 225 MSM had the experience of alcohol consumption in their lifetime (225/256, 87.9%). Among ever drinkers, 152 MSM consumed alcohol within three months (152/225, 67.6%). Regarding beer consumption, the highest proportions of MSM from both groups (42.8%, 36.8%) consumed 1-3 times per week. Overall, 57.2% of young MSM and 41.2% of adult MSM consumed beer together with their friends. Nearly 34% of young MSM and nearly 38% of adult MMS consumed beer at gatherings of friends. At different time periods, higher proportions of Thange (partners of MSM) had experienced of binge drinking than apwint (open) and apone (hidden) (p<0.05). Conclusions: The current study identified the alcohol consumption patterns in terms of type, amount, frequency at different time periods among MSM in major cities of Myanmar. It is suggested to develop and implement alcohol control policy for MSM since the proportion of current drinkers as well as binge drinking higher among these groups.","Htut, Kyaw-Min; Areesantichai, Chitlada; Mon, Myo-Myo",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.25707.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500776/,701

This study aimed to investigate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetics of LY03004 compared with those on Risperdal Consta®. METHODS A total of 100 Chinese patients with stable schizophrenia were randomly assigned to the LY03004 or Risperdal Consta® treatment group. Each patient received five biweekly intramuscular injections of 25 mg risperidone long-acting injection microspheres. A total of 34 blood samples before and after injections from Day 1 to Day 113 were collected from each patient, and polymorphic alleles of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 (*4, *10, *14), CYP3A5 (*3), and ABCB1 (C1236 > T, G2677T/A, and C3435T) were analyzed using Sanger sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS The risperidone Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, AUC0-tau,ss, and the ratio of risperidone to 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-R) in CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (IMs) were significantly different compared with those in normal metabolizers (NMs) in both the LY03004 and Risperdal Consta® groups (P < 0.05). However, 9-OH-R was not significantly different between IMs and NMs (P > 0.05). The AUC0-tau,ss of the active moiety (risperidone plus 9-OH-R) was 6.51 ± 3.34 in NMs and 7.00 ± 1.81 in IMs (P = 0.071) in the LY03004 group and 6.07 ± 2.31 and 7.95 ± 3.42 (P = 0.053) in NMs and IMs, respectively, in the Risperdal Consta® group. In the LY03004 group, the Cmax,ss of risperidone in carriers of the ABCB1-C3435T TT variant was significantly lower than that in CC and CT carriers (TT 7.76 ± 4.23 ng/mL, CT 11.6 ± 8.27 ng/ml, CC 14.3 ± 7.66 ng/ml; P = 0.045), but no significant differences were found in the active moiety. In the Risperdal Consta® group, C3435T TT carriers had significantly lower Cmin,ss of the active moiety (TT 5.09 ± 4.38 ng/ml, CT 11.4 ± 8.42 ng/ml, CC 14.3 ± 6.43 ng/ml; P = 0.007). Furthermore, Cmin,ss of the active moiety was significantly different among all ABCB1-G2677T/A genotypes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The pharmacokinetics of risperidone and the ratio of risperidone to 9-OH-R were highly dependent on CYP2D6 activity. However, there was no significant effect in 9-OH-R. A future study involving a larger sample is required to verify whether CYP2D6 IMs have lower risperidone active moiety clearance than CYP2D6 NMs for LAI formulations. In addition, the risperidone active moiety was eliminated faster in ABCB1-G2677T/A and C3435T TT carriers receiving Risperdal Consta®.","Ma, Lingyue; Xiang, Qian; Zhao, Nan; Hu, Changqing; Fang, Meng; Tan, Yunlong; Chen, Song; Wang, Zining; Liu, Pinglan; Sun, Kaoxiang; Li, Youxin; Wu, Fuxi; Tian, Hongjun; Fang, Maosheng; Zhao, Xia; Wang, Gang; Cui, Yimin",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400943/,701

METHODS We used data from 4583 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or minor stroke enrolled in the TIAregistry.org to perform a nested case-control analysis to evaluate pre- and post-CEA/CAS risk. Cases were defined as patients with a CEA/CAS during the 1-year follow-up period. For each case, 2 controls with a follow-up time greater than the time from qualifying event to CEA/CAS were randomly selected, matched by age and sex. Primary outcome was defined as major vascular events (MVE, including stroke, cardiovascular death, and myocardial infarction). RESULTS The median delay from symptom onset of qualifying event to CEA/CAS was 11 days (interquartile range, 6-23). Overall, patients with CEA/CAS had a higher 1-year risk of MVE than other patients (14.8% versus 5.8%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.61-3.60; P<0.001). During the matched preprocedural period, MVE occurred in 14 (7.5%) cases and in 13 (3.5%) controls, with an adjusted odds ratio =2.46 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.64; P=0.03). In the postprocedural period, the risk of MVE was also higher in cases than in controls (adjusted P<0.03). CONCLUSIONS Patients with CEA/CAS had a higher 12-month risk of MVE, as well as during pre- and postprocedural periods. These results suggest that patients in whom CEA/CAS is anticipated are likely to be an informative population for inclusion in studies testing new antithrombotic strategies started soon after symptom onset.","Hobeanu, Cristina; Lavallée, Philippa C; Rothwell, Peter M; Sissani, Leila; Albers, Gregory W; Bornstein, Natan M; Caplan, Louis R; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Ferro, José M; Hennerici, Michael G; Labreuche, Julien; Molina, Carlos; Steg, Philippe Gabriel; Touboul, Pierre-Jean; Uchiyama, Shinichiro; Vicaut, Éric; Wong, Lawrence K S; Amarenco, Pierre",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.116.015171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28289241/,701
102314,Haemorrhoids: 21st-century management.,2012,"OBJECTIVE Aortic arch aneurysmal disease remains a therapeutic challenge. For patients unsuitable for standard open surgery, hybrid repair with debranching of the supra-aortic arteries followed by thoracic endovascular grafting has been shown to be an effective solution. The aim of this study was to report the clinical outcomes of a single-institution experience using hybrid aortic arch repair. METHODS The cases of all consecutive patients submitted to hybrid aortic arch repair between January 2010 and June 2018 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The outcomes of the study were 30-day mortality, perioperative complications, 2-year survival, endoleak, and reintervention rates. RESULTS A total of 35 patients with a median age of 71 years (interquartile range, 62-77 years) were submitted to hybrid aortic arch repair, with a median follow-up of 26.9 months (interquartile range, 2.4-63.6 months). Ten procedures (28.6%) were performed urgently for contained rupture. The most common etiology was degenerative (n = 14 [40.0%]). The proximal landing zones according to the Ishimaru classification were zone 2 in 20 patients (57.1%), zone 1 in 12 patients (34.3%), and zone 0 in 3 patients (8.6%). Early endoleaks were observed in six patients (17.1%), equally distributed between type I and type II. Late endoleaks were identified in 4 of 24 patients (16.7%; type I, n = 2 [8.3%]; type II, n = 1 [4.2%]; and type III, n = 1 [4.2%]). Thirty-day mortality rate was 14.3% (n = 5) with an early death rate of 8.7% (2/23) in elective cases and 30.0% (3/10) in urgent cases (odds ratio [OR], 4.93; confidence interval [CI], 0.68-35.67; P = .128). Except in one patient, 30-day mortality was associated with landing zone 0 or zone 1 (26.7% vs 5.0%; OR, 6.91; CI, 0.68-69.86; P = .141). Three patients (8.6%) suffered a postoperative stroke, and no episodes of spinal cord ischemia were observed. Two-year survival rate was 67.8% (CI, 49.4%-80.8%). Survival rates were significantly lower with increasing age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; CI, 1.03-1.18; P = .004), urgent procedure (HR, 4.80; CI, 1.56-14.80; P = .003), zone 0 or zone 1 (HR, 6.34; CI, 1.73-23.18; P = .001), presence of arrhythmia (HR, 3.76; CI, 1.22-11.62; P = .013), and cerebrovascular disease (HR, 4.12; CI, 1.38-12.35; P = .006). A multivariate analysis identified age (HR, 1.11; P = .047) and zone 0 or zone 1 (HR, 4.93; P = .033) as the only predictors for overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid aortic arch repair seems to be an alternative for higher risk patients not suitable for open repair, but selection of patients is crucial and may benefit from further refinement. In this study, worse outcomes were seen in older patients and those who required more proximal landing zones.","Soares, Tony R; Melo, Ryan; Amorim, Pedro; Ministro, Augusto; Sobrinho, Gonçalo; Silvestre, Luís; Fernandes E Fernandes, Ruy; Martins, Carlos; Fernandes E Fernandes, José; Pedro, Luís Mendes",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2019.11.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067880/,701

Our purpose is to describe a successful curriculum administrative structure that promoted faculty buy-in and accountability, learner responsibility, and acceptable resource usage. METHODS A total of 14 American College of Surgery (ACS) modules were included in the postgraduate year 1 curriculum. Before arrival, 2 modules were sent to newly matched residents. Remaining modules were administered over a 4-month period, with integrated, independent practice opportunities, as well as 4 mentored and 1 peer practice sessions. A total of 2 verifications of proficiency (VOP) progress exams and 1 final comprehensive VOP were administered. To promote faculty ownership, 1 faculty member was asked to lead each module. Module leaders attended an orientation and development session, and created an instructional management plan. Each module was taught by the leader and 2 additional faculty coinstructors, and evaluated by residents. Equipment, resource costs, and man-hours were tracked. RESULTS Faculty buy-in was demonstrated by enthusiastic participation, with only 2 absences. Residents gave high ratings to all the modules (range, 4.22-4.89/5). Curriculum costs were approximately $21,500, reduced from potential costs of $187,000 if all simulators would have been purchased new. The estimated budget for year 2 is $17,000. CONCLUSION It is critical for new curricula to have resident and faculty buy-in, accountability for quality teaching and learning, and reasonable resource use.

However its use has been limited in children. We describe the largest experience with GES in children with long-term outcomes. METHODS Data were collected on children who underwent GES over a 10-year period. Data regarding demographics, medical history, hospital course, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Symptom scores (validated Likert scores) were compared using a paired Student's t test. RESULTS Overall, 97 patients underwent GES, and a majority were teenage Caucasian girls. Ninety-six had temporary GES (tGES), and 66 had improvement in their symptoms. A total of 67 underwent permanent implantation (pGES), and there was significant reduction in all individual symptoms (p<0.001) as well as the total symptom score (TSS) (p<0.0001) at 1, 6, 12, and >12 months. Recurrence of symptoms leading to device removal occurred in 7 cases. Forty-one patients had continued improvement in symptoms for over 12 months, with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (range 1-9 years). CONCLUSIONS This study represents the largest experience of systematic application of GES in children.

The use of i.v. fluid has represented the cornerstone for the treatment of hypoperfusion for two centuries. METHODS As a part of International Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative XII Fluids Workgroup meeting, we sought to incorporate recent advances in our understanding of vascular biology into a more comprehensive yet accessible approach to the patient with hypoperfusion. In this workgroup, we attempted to develop a framework that incorporates key aspects of the vasculature into a diagnostic approach. RESULTS The four main components of our proposal involve the assessment of the blood flow (BF), vascular content (vC), the vascular barrier (vB), and vascular tone (vT). Any significant perturbation in any of these domains can lead to hypoperfusion at both the macro- and micro-circulatory level. We have termed the BF, vC, vB, and vT diagnostic approach the vascular component (VC) approach. CONCLUSIONS The VC approach to hypoperfusion has potential advantages to the current diagnostic system. This approach also has the distinct advantage that it can be used to assess the systemic, regional, and micro-vasculature, thereby harmonizing the approach to clinical vascular diagnostics across these levels. The VC approach will need to be tested prospectively to determine if this system can in fact improve outcomes in patients who suffer from hypoperfusion.","Chawla, L S; Ince, C; Chappell, D; Gan, T J; Kellum, J A; Mythen, M; Shaw, A D",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1093/bja/aeu298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231767/,701

METHOD Parents of 159 children completed online self-report measures at three time points during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic; 1) Delay and Mitigation Phase (March 2020 - May 2020), 2) Reopening of Society Phase (June 2020 - July 2020), and 3) Wave 2 Case Acceleration Phase (September 2020 - October 2020). Participants were allocated to the Clinical group if they met the clinical cut off point on the Conduct or Hyperactivity/Inattention subscales of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at Time 1. RESULTS Parents of children with externalising difficulties experienced significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of wellbeing, and engaged in higher levels of avoidant-focused coping strategies longitudinally. There was a significant difference between outcomes at the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, for stress related to parenting, personal/family stress related to the impact of the COVID-19, and type of coping strategies employed. Children with externalising difficulties, in comparison to children without externalising difficulties, showed significantly greater adjustment over time for behavioural and emotional difficulties, as reported by their parents.

METHODS Twenty-nine patients underwent intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair with DynaMesh at one of two hospitals. Patients characteristics, surgical procedures and postoperative analgesia were comparable at both sites. RESULTS Six patients developed DynaMesh-related complications that required surgical reintervention by laparotomy within 1 year of operation. Surgical reintervention was for adhesions in five patients and the mesh had to be explanted in three. One mesh was explanted because of early infection.

This review discusses emerging threats, newer modalities of diagnostic tests and emerging treatment options, and also highlights the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance. RECENT FINDINGS Nosocomial pneumonia is increasingly due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms in immunosuppressed patients. Viral pneumonias remain a very significant threat, present atypically and carry a high mortality. Aspergillosis remains the most common fungal infection, and infections due to Mucorales are increasing. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is on the increase throughout the world. Mixed infections are common and early bronchoscopy with appropriate microbiological tests, including molecular diagnostics, optimise management and reduce mortality. CONCLUSION Pulmonary infection remains the most frequent infectious complication in the immunocompromised host. These complex infections are often mixed, have atypical presentations and can be due to multidrug-resistant organisms. Multidisciplinary involvement in specialist centres with appropriate diagnostics, treatment and infection control improves outcome. There is a desperate need for new antimicrobial agents active against Gram-negative pathogens.","Godbole, Gauri; Gant, Vanya",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcp.0b013e32835f82a9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23508112/,701

However, current systems rely significantly on the high local oxygen levels and strongly acidic conditions (pH = 3.0-5.0). Simultaneously, the produced ROS can be rapidly consumed by intracellular glutathione (GSH) in the electron transport chain. Herein, an original and biomimetic CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst was prepared based on the assembly of Au and Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on the surface of hollow CoO nanocapsules. The as-synthesized nanozyme exhibits extremely high stability under physiological conditions, whereas it undergoes spontaneous disintegration in the unique tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequently, the decomposition products can catalyze a cascade of biochemical reactions to produce abundant ROS without any external stimuli. Thus, the present nanoplatform can increase intracellular ROS levels through continuous supply of H2O2, relief of local hypoxia and depletion of GSH, which result in remarkable and specific tumor damage both in vitro and in vivo. The findings of this study highlight the promising potential of CoO@AuPt nanocatalyst as a TME-responsive CDT nanomagnet for highly efficient tumor therapy.","Fu, Shiyan; Yang, Ruihao; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Weiwei; Du, Guangyuan; Cao, Yang; Xu, Zhigang; Cui, Hongjuan; Kang, Yuejun; Xue, Peng",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2020.120279; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763613/,701

The study showed that the viruses were present in 7 air (among them 71.4% were BLV-positive and 28.6% were BAdV-positive), 14 surface (among them 85.7% were BLV-positive and 14.3% were BAdV-positive), and 34 milk (all were BLV-positive only) samples. Statistical analysis revealed that both the air and surfaces in studied occupational environment were more frequently contaminated with BLV than with BAdV (Chi-square test: p = 0.002, Fisher's Exact test: p = 0.002). Kruskal-Wallis tests showed significant differences in BLV genome concentrations in the air (p = 0.045) as well as in BLV and BAdV genome concentrations on surfaces (p = 0.005 and p = 0.040, respectively) between studied processing areas. In units of genome copies (gc) per area, the highest concentrations of BLV and BAdV genomes in the air (9.8 × 101 ± 1.14 × 102 gc/m3 and 5.4 × 101 ± 9.1 × 101 gc/m3, respectively) and on surfaces (9.83 × 102 ± 7.41 × 102 gc/100cm2 and 2.30 × 102 ± 3.8 × 102 gc/100cm2, respectively) were observed in milk reception area. The air and surfaces of pre-production zones were also significantly more contaminated with BAdV genomes compared to production areas (Mann-Whitney test: p = 0.039 and p = 0.029, respectively). This study showed that dairy workers may be exposed to bovine viruses through the inhalation of bioaerosols and contact with contaminated surfaces. To reduce the probability of virus transmission from the raw milk to humans, efficient surface cleaning procedures degrading viral particles should be introduced and the use of personal protection equipment, especially within pre-production zones, should be required. As the raw milk may be a source of bovine viruses, the development of strategies for both the control and eradication of BLV and BAdV among cattle seems to be also urgently needed.","Stobnicka-Kupiec, Agata; Gołofit-Szymczak, Małgorzata; Górny, Rafał L; Cyprowski, Marcin",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1742914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255403/,701
120605,Comment on 'Closure of the perineal defect after abdominoperineal excision for rectal adenocarcinoma - ACPGBI Position Statement'.,2019,"The phase transitional behavior of two homologous series of five-ring banana-shaped compounds comprising fluorine substituents synthesized through covalent linking of two chemically dissimilar rod-like anisometric cores (arms) to central 1,3-phenylene is reported. The novelty of these molecules originates from the fact that the molecules are highly nonsymmetrical. One of the arms, which is either salicylaldimine or Schiff base core, possesses two vicinal fluorine atoms at the terminal ring having a -decyloxy tail; while the -alkyl tail attached to the other arm was varied to realize a homologous series of compounds. The mesophases have been characterized by several complementary studies. The banana-shaped systems having short or medium alkyl chain lengths form apolar columnar (two-dimensional) structures, while on ascending the series, a polar smectic phase is stabilized. Detailed electro-optical investigations on one of the polar smectic phases revealed a synclinic antiferroelectric (racemic) ground state structure, which switches, as expected, to an anticlinic ferroelectric state by the application of an electrical field. At higher field strengths applied for an extended time interval, the anticlinic ferroelectric state switches to a synclinic ferroelectric (chiral) state. Upon field removal, these domains switch to an anticlinic antiferroelectric (chiral) state, which eventually nucleates to the original antiferroelectric synclinic (racemic) state. Remarkably, the associated spontaneous polarization value exceeds 800 nC cm, which is among the highest reported hitherto.","Yelamaggad, Channabasaveshwar V; Shashikala, Indudhara Swamy; Hiremath, Uma S; Liao, Guangxun; Jakli, Antal; Rao, Doddamane S Shankar; Prasad, Subbarao Krishna; Li, Quan",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b608278e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680219/,701

In this study, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were transduced to express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) using a lentiviral vector (LV-VIP). These transduced DCs (LV-VIP-DCs) were then injected intravenously (i.v.) into 16-week-old (before disease onset) and 21-week-old (after disease onset) SAPP mice in order to prevent or attenuate the disease. Outcome measures included behavioral tests, clinical and histological scoring, electrophysiology, real-time PCR, flow cytometry analyses, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LV-VIP-DCs were recruited to the inflamed sciatic nerve and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines. A single injection of LV-VIP-DC delayed the onset of disease, stabilized, and attenuated clinical signs correlating with ameliorated behavioral functions, reduced nerve demyelination, and improved nerve conduction. This proof-of-principle study is an important step potentially leading to a clinical translational study using DCs expressing VIP in cases of CIDP refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapy.","Yalvac, Mehmet E; Arnold, William David; Hussain, Syed-Rehan A; Braganza, Cilwyn; Shontz, Kimberly M; Clark, Kelly Reed; Walker, Christopher M; Ubogu, Eroboghene E; Mendell, Jerry R; Sahenk, Zarife",Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,https://doi.org/10.1038/mt.2014.77; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153175/,701

One of the most common indications for enteroscopy is obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), followed by small bowel stenosis, tumors, and inflammatory bowel disease. Although enteroscopes have been regarded as useful tools, correct guidelines are required to ensure that we manipulate these enteroscopes safely and efficiently in clinical practice. Herein, the Japanese Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society has developed 'Clinical Practice Guidelines for Enteroscopy' in collaboration with the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology, the Japanese Gastroenterological Association, and the Japanese Association for Capsule Endoscopy. These guidelines are based on the evidence available until now, but small bowel endoscopy is a relatively new technology, so the guidelines include recommendations based on a consensus reached among experts when the evidence has not been considered sufficient. These guidelines were not designed to be disease-based, but focus on how we should use small bowel CE and BAE in everyday clinical practice.","Yamamoto, Hironori; Ogata, Haruhiko; Matsumoto, Takayuki; Ohmiya, Naoki; Ohtsuka, Kazuo; Watanabe, Kenji; Yano, Tomonori; Matsui, Toshiyuki; Higuchi, Kazuhide; Nakamura, Tetsuya; Fujimoto, Kazuma",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/den.12883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28370422/,701

Early age of onset and prolonged disease duration indicate poor prognosis. Janus kinase inhibitors are being investigated in phase 3 clinical trials in adolescents and adults with AA OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of oral tofacitinib in pre-adolescent patients with AA. METHODS A retrospective review of case records of all pre-adolescent patients with AA treated with oral tofacitinib in a single center between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS Fourteen patients were identified, aged 7 to 11 years. Nine patients experienced clinically significant improvement in their SALT (Severity of Alopecia Tool) score. Three patients achieved complete remission (SALT score of 0), seven (63.6%) achieved over 50% improvement in SALT score from baseline. One patient had no change from baseline, another experienced additional hair loss. After an average of 9 months of treatment, the median SALT score improvement was 67.7%. The improvement was similar in patients with baseline SALT scores greater than 50 and those with baseline SALT scores below 10. Adverse events were mild. LIMITATIONS The retrospective nature of the data, small sample size, lack of a control group, referral bias to a specialist hair center, and concomitant use of other medications including oral minoxidil in all patients. CONCLUSION There is a role for tofacitinib as a systemic therapy in AA and this should be further evaluated in prospective clinical trials in pre-adolescents.","Jerjen, Rebekka; Meah, Nekma; Trindade de Carvalho, Lara; Wall, Dmitri; Eisman, Samantha; Sinclair, Rodney",Pediatric dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/pde.14422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33099833/,701

The condition has in severe cases been treated surgically with supraglottoplasty. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the evidence and recommendations for surgical intervention in treating patients with EILO. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase to identify relevant studies describing surgical treatment of patients diagnosed with severe EILO. According to eligibility criteria, data were independently extracted by two reviewers. To assess the risk of bias of each included study, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was used. Results The screening process identified 11 observational studies with a total of 75 patients. Findings indicated that many beneficial outcomes are to be found in surgical treatment for EILO. These indications were found both on visual verification of improvement of the laryngeal obstruction during exercise and patient self-reported symptom severity. The average NOS score (4.3) indicated low level of evidence in the included studies. Conclusion Studies reporting effects of surgical treatment of EILO have shown promising results in patients with laryngeal obstruction. However, the heterogeneity of study methodologies and the level of evidence precludes definitive recommendations for or against supraglottoplasty at this time; prospective and methodologically robust studies are now needed.

Using deep immunophenotyping with high-dimensional single-cell analysis and mass cytometry we could demonstrate an altered immune response in MPN patients following vaccination. We found that prior to vaccination, MPN patients had reduced numbers of naive CD4 T cells. Furthermore, at 3-weeks and 3-months post-vaccination there was evidence of both delayed and impaired B- and T-memory cells responses. Thus, although, the immune systems of MPN patients can 'recognise' the Influenza A vaccine, the response appears inferior compared to healthy controls.","Alimam, Samah; Ann Timms, Jessica; Harrison, Claire N; Dillon, Richard; Mare, Tracey; DeLavallade, Hugues; Radia, Deepti; Woodley, Claire; Francis, Yvonne; Sanchez, Katy; Kordasti, Shahram; McLornan, Donal P",British journal of haematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.17096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159465/,701

However, there is little research on how individuals' coping strategies were related to changes in mental health over time. METHODS The current study used data from the COVID-19 Social Study in the United Kingdom (N = 26,505) to explore whether coping strategies (problem-focused, emotion-focused, avoidant, and socially-supportive) were associated with (i) better mental health as lockdown was introduced, and (ii) faster recovery over time. RESULTS People with greater use of problem-focused, avoidant, and supportive coping displayed more mental health symptoms, while greater use of emotion-focused coping was associated with fewer mental health symptoms. Symptoms decreased over time for all coping strategies, but only socially-supportive coping was associated with a faster decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms, indicating a potential protective effect of social support on psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS Problem-, avoidant- and emotion-focused coping strategies were not associated with faster improvements in mental health. Suggesting the adoption of one of these coping styles in itself is not necessarily a driver of improvements in mental health; rather, specific attributes of the behaviours expressed as part of this coping style appear to be important in and of themselves.","Fluharty, Meg; Bu, Feifei; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.113958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33965772/,701

Using this framework, video footage from two cricket matches were visually analysed, one pre-COVID-19 pandemic and one 'COVID-19 aware' game in early 2020. The number of opportunities for one participant to be exposed to biological secretions belonging to another participant was recorded as an exposure, as was the estimated severity of exposure as defined from literature. Events were rated based upon distance between subjects, relative orientation of the subjects, droplet generating activity performed (e. g., talking) and event duration. In analysis we reviewed each risk category independently and the compound effect of an exposure i. e., the product of the scores across all categories. With the application of generic, non-cricket specific, social distancing recommendations and general COVID-19 awareness, the number of exposures per 100 balls was reduced by 70%. More impressive was the decrease in the most severe compound ratings (those with two or more categories scored with the highest severity) which was 98% and the reduction in exposures with a proximity <1 m, 96%. Analysis of the factors effecting transmission risk indicated that cricket was likely to present a low risk, although this conclusion was somewhat arbitrary omitting a comparison with a non-cricketing activity.","England, Rory; Peirce, Nicholas; Wedatilake, Thamindu; Torresi, Joseph; Kemp, Simon; Cook, Malcolm; Mitchell, Sean; Harland, Andy",International journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1342-8071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33511617/,701

We aimed to study the use of antiseizure drugs by these women in Switzerland, with a particular focus on valproate. METHODS We conducted a retrospective descriptive study using the healthcare claims database of the Swiss health insurance Helsana (2014–18). We established two separate study populations: (1) a cohort of pregnancies leading to a delivery, and (2) all women of childbearing age (15–45 years) who were insured with Helsana for at least one year during the study period. We identified the dispensation of valproate, lamotrigine, carbamazepine, levetiracetam, topiramate, pregabalin, gabapentin, phenobarbital, and phenytoin (1) between delivery and three months prior to the estimated date of the last menstrual period, and (2) by calendar year. We quantified exposure prevalence of each antiseizure drug as the number of women with ≥1 prescription fill per 10,000 (1) pregnancies, and (2) women by calendar year. Results were weighted for the demographic distribution of the Helsana population relative to the Swiss population. RESULTS We identified a weighted pregnancy population of 387,418 pregnancies, with a mean maternal age at delivery of 31.9 years (standard deviation 5.1). Lamotrigine was the most frequently dispensed antiseizure drug during pregnancy (20/10,000), followed by levetiracetam (11/10,000), and pregabalin (3.8/10,000). Valproate was dispensed to 1.9/10,000 women during pregnancy and to 1.3/10,000 women within 90 days prior to the last menstrual period but not during pregnancy. The weighted study population of women aged 15–45 years consisted of 2,781,151 women, of whom 74,080 (270/10,000) were exposed to ≥1 of the evaluated antiseizure drugs. Pregabalin was the most frequently dispensed antiseizure drug (64/10,000), followed by lamotrigine (46/10,000), topiramate (32/10,000), and valproate (25/10,000). The use of valproate decreased from 28/10,000 women in 2014 to 21/10,000 women in 2018. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of exposure to valproate during pregnancy was comparable to Denmark and lower than in other European countries. Despite decreasing exposure prevalence, the use of valproate in women of childbearing age in Switzerland seems higher than the actual clinical need.","Spoendlin, Julia; Blozik, Eva; Graber, Sereina; Rauch, Marlene; Marxer, Carole; Rüegg, Stephan; Meier, Christoph; Winterfeld, Ursula; Panchaud, Alice",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.20386; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423241/,701

METHODS: The sample of this cross-sectional and correlational type of study consisted of 618 nurses calculated with the snowball sampling method. The data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researchers, the state anxiety inventory, and the trait anger and anger expression scale and was conducted between May 10 and 20, 2020 using an online questionnaire form. Percentage, mean, standard deviation, the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Spearman correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: The mean age of nurses was 34.98 ± 8.36 years (min: 20; max: 53), 87.4% were women, and 81.7% experienced a high level of anxiety. The anger scores of the participants were found to be 20.04 ± 4.43, the anger-in score was 15.55 ± 3.34, the anger-out score was 14.01 ± 2.87, and the anger control score was 22.93 ± 3.6. Being married, the presence of chronic disease, living in the Marmara region, working shifts, presence of an individual over 65 years of age at home, and having a COVID-19 test were found to be risk factors that significantly increase nurses' anxieties. A significant positive relationship was found between the anxiety scores, trait anger (r = 0.249, p = 0.000), anger-in (r = 0.174, p = 0.000) and anger-out (r = 0.205, p = 0.000) scores of nurses, and a significant negative relationship was found between the anxiety scores and anger control (r = 0.249, p = 0.000) score. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that in the COVID-19 pandemic the anxiety levels of the nurses were high and that the high anxiety level negatively affected the style of anger expression, but the nurses were successful in maintaining anger control. In line with these results, it is important that nurses develop effective coping strategies to reduce their anxiety levels and that they receive increased levels of support in managing anger expression.","Bayrak, Nurten Gülsüm; Uzun, Sevda; KulakaÇ, Nursen",Perspect. psychiatr. care,,701

With the closure of offices and educational institutions, and the emerging norm of work from home and online education, along with the lack of services of domestic worker, the need to perform unpaid chores in the household has increased. Simultaneously, the requirements of social distancing and sanitization have created new unpaid chores. Owing to the sexual division of labour, and gendered roles and social norms of performing domestic and care work, the burden of unpaid work falls disproportionately on women. In this context, the objective of the paper is to study the impact of COVID-19 on time spent on unpaid work and the underlying gender differences in the urban centres in India. Specifically, the paper will do a comparative analysis of the gender differences in time spent on unpaid work before and during the lockdown, and analyse the reasons for the same.","Chauhan, Priyanshi",Gender Issues,,701
