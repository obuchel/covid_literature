4454,Hypoalbuminemia and Obesity in Orthopaedic Trauma Patients: Body Mass Index a Significant Predictor of Surgical Site Complications,2020-02-06,"Washington, DC continues to experience a generalized HIV-1 epidemic. We characterized the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Viral samples from 68 participants from 2016 through 2017 were sequenced and paired with epidemiological data. Phylogenetic and network inferences, drug resistant mutations (DRMs), subtypes and HIV-1 diversity estimations were completed. Haplotypes were reconstructed to infer transmission clusters. Phylodynamic inferences based on the HIV-1 polymerase (pol) and envelope genes (env) were compared. Higher HIV-1 diversity (n.s.) was seen in men who have sex with men, heterosexual, and male participants in DC. 54.0% of the participants contained at least one DRM. The 40–49 year-olds showed the highest prevalence of DRMs (22.9%). Phylogenetic analysis of pol and env sequences grouped 31.9–33.8% of the participants into clusters. HIV-TRACE grouped 2.9–12.8% of participants when using consensus sequences and 9.0–64.2% when using haplotypes. NGS allowed us to characterize the local phylodynamics of HIV-1 in DC more broadly and accurately, given a better representation of its diversity and dynamics. Reconstructed haplotypes provided novel and deeper phylodynamic insights, which led to networks linking a higher number of participants. Our understanding of the HIV-1 epidemic was expanded with the powerful coupling of HIV-1 NGS data with epidemiological data.","Gibson, Keylie M.; Jair, Kamwing; Castel, Amanda D.; Bendall, Matthew L.; Wilbourn, Brittany; Jordan, Jeanne A.; Crandall, Keith A.; Pérez-Losada, Marcos",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7004982/,242

12493,Guideline Approaches for Cardioendocrine Disease Surveillance and Treatment Following Spinal Cord Injury,2018-11-15,"The assessment of postmortem degradation of skeletal muscle proteins has emerged as a novel approach to estimate the time since death in the early to mid-postmortem phase (approximately 24 h postmortem (hpm) to 120 hpm). Current protein-based methods are limited to a small number of skeletal muscle proteins, shown to undergo proteolysis after death. In this study, we investigated the usability of a target-based and unbiased system-wide protein analysis to gain further insights into systemic postmortem protein alterations and to identify additional markers for postmortem interval (PMI) delimitation. We performed proteomic profiling to globally analyze postmortem alterations of the rat and mouse skeletal muscle proteome at defined time points (0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpm), harnessing a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics approach. Hierarchical clustering analysis for a total of 579 (rat) and 896 (mouse) quantified proteins revealed differentially expressed proteins during the investigated postmortem period. We further focused on two selected proteins (eEF1A2 and GAPDH), which were shown to consistently degrade postmortem in both rat and mouse, suggesting conserved intra- and interspecies degradation behavior, and thus preserved association with the PMI and possible transferability to humans. In turn, we validated the usefulness of these new markers by classical Western blot experiments in a rat model and in human autopsy cases. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of mass spectrometry–based analysis to discover novel protein markers for PMI estimation and show that the proteins eEF1A2 and GAPDH appear to be valuable markers for PMI estimation in humans.

12572,Ground glass opacity on chest CT scans from screening to treatment: A literature review,2020-08-17,"An approach based on Gateway recombination technology to efficiently construct silencing vectors was developed for use in the biotechnologically important fungus Aspergillus niger. The transcription activator of xylanolytic and cellulolytic genes XlnR of A. niger was chosen as target for gene silencing. Silencing was based on the expression vector pXLNRir that was constructed and used in co-transformation. From all the strains isolated (N = 77), nine showed poor xylan-degrading activities in two semi-quantitative plate assays testing different activities for xylan degradation. Upon induction on d-xylose, transcript levels of xlnR were decreased in the xlnR-silenced strains, compared to a wild-type background. Under these conditions, the transcript levels of xyrA and xynB (two genes regulated by XlnR) were also decreased for these xlnR-silenced strains. These results indicate that the newly developed system for rapid generation of silencing vectors is an effective tool for A. niger, and this can be used to generate strains with a tailored spectrum of enzyme activities or product formation by silencing specific genes encoding, e.g., regulators such as XlnR.","Oliveira, José Miguel; van der Veen, Douwe; de Graaff, Leo H.; Qin, Ling",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7420921/,242

13521,Short-Term Exercise Progression of Cardiovascular Patients throughout Cardiac Rehabilitation: An Observational Study,2020-09-29,"Background: Obesity is a primary limiting factor in liver stiffness measurement (LSM). The impact of obesity has always been evaluated in terms of body mass index (BMI), without studying the effects of skin-to-liver distance (SLD) on LSM. We studied the impact of SLD on LSM in a cohort of obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery and intra-operatory liver biopsy. Materials and Methods: 299 patients underwent LSM by point-shear wave elastography (ElastPQ protocol), with two different ultrasound machines. SLD was measured as the distance between the skin and the liver capsule, perpendicular to where the region of interest (ROI) was positioned. We used the following arbitrary cut-offs: <5.7 kPa, F0–1; 5.7–7.99 kPa, F2; ≥8 kPa, F3–4. Results: We developed two logistic regression models using elastography–histology agreement (EHA) as the dependent variable and SLD as the independent variable. The model based on the second machine showed strongly more performant discriminative and calibration metrics (AIC 38.5, BIC 44.2, Nagelkerke Pseudo-R2 0.894, AUROC 0.90). The SLD cut-off value of 34.5 mm allowed a correct EHA with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93%, negative predictive value of 100%, positive predictive value of 87%, an accuracy of 96%, and positive likelihood ratio of 3.56. Conclusion: The impact of SLD is machine-dependent and should be taken into consideration when interpreting LSM. We believe that our findings may serve as a reference point for appropriate fibrosis stratification by liver elastography in obese patients.","Giuffrè, Mauro; Giuricin, Michela; Bonazza, Deborah; Rosso, Natalia; Giraudi, Pablo José; Masutti, Flora; Palmucci, Stefano; Basile, Antonio; Zanconati, Fabrizio; de Manzini, Nicolò; Tiribelli, Claudio; Palmisano, Silvia; Crocè, Lory Saveria",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7601552/,242

Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin β cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation.","Bu, Wenting; Levitskaya, Zarina; Loh, Zhi Yang; Jin, Shengyang; Basu, Shibom; Ero, Rya; Yan, Xinfu; Wang, Meitian; Ngan, So Fong Cam; Sze, Siu Kwan; Tan, Suet-Mien; Gao, Yong-Gui",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7373317/,242
14513,The Specific Carbohydrate Diet and Diet Modification as Induction Therapy for Pediatric Crohn’s Disease: A Randomized Diet Controlled Trial,2020-12-06,"Behind the environmental regulatory capture (ERC) lies a complex network of interactions and interests. Identifying the roles of stakeholders in the ERC network and their behavioral motives can illuminate the mechanism of ERC incidents, and provide policy recommendations for reducing other types of regulatory capture. Drawing on the regulatory capture and principal-agent theories, this study develops a triple-layer principal-agent model of environmental regulation practices in China. We further conduct a social network analysis (SNA) on the ERC case in the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) of Bobai County, Guangxi Province, China to illustrate the hidden interactions and interest transmission structure among stakeholders in ERC. The results show that the ERC presents obvious characteristics of concealment and complexity, and individual capture often evolves into collective capture. Different stakeholders are in different positions and play different roles in the network. The environmental regulatory authority, the commissioned regulatory agency, and the agency of enterprises form the core power circle of the ERC network, in which the first two play the role of intermediary and the latter acts as an initiator. They together occupy the structural hole position and dominate the evolution of the ERC network. Peripheral structure stakeholders play the role of “bridge” and profit from the expanding ERC network. It is recommended that the principle of decentralization and the balance of power must be taken into consideration. Quantitative analysis methods such as SNA should be applied to clarify accountability when punishing responsible persons. More subjects are also encouraged to participate in environmental regulations and report illegal acts actively. Finally, a blacklist system should be established in the field of environmental protection for regulating the professional and social morality of all parties.","Tu, Yu; Peng, Benhong; Elahi, Ehsan; Wu, Weiku",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762369/,242

CDR132L is a synthetic lead-optimized oligonucleotide inhibitor with proven preclinical efficacy and safety in heart failure (HF) early after myocardial infarction (MI), and recently completed clinical evaluation in a Phase 1b study (NCT04045405). The aim of the current study was to assess safety and efficacy of CDR132L in a clinically relevant large animal (pig) model of chronic heart failure following MI. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a chronic model of post-MI HF, slow-growing pigs underwent 90 min left anterior descending artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Animals were randomized and treatment started 1-month post-MI. Monthly intravenous (IV) treatments of CDR132L over 3 or 5 months (3× or 5×) were applied in a blinded randomized placebo-controlled fashion. Efficacy was evaluated based on serial magnetic resonance imaging, haemodynamic, and biomarker analyses. The treatment regime provided sufficient tissue exposure and CDR132L was well tolerated. Overall, CDR132L treatment significantly improved cardiac function and reversed cardiac remodelling. In addition to the systolic recovery, diastolic function was also ameliorated in this chronic model of HF. CONCLUSION: Monthly repeated dosing of CDR132L is safe and adequate to provide clinically relevant exposure and therapeutic efficacy in a model of chronic post-MI HF. CDR132L thus should be explored as treatment for the broad area of chronic heart failure.","Batkai, Sandor; Genschel, Celina; Viereck, Janika; Rump, Steffen; Bär, Christian; Borchert, Tobias; Traxler, Denise; Riesenhuber, Martin; Spannbauer, Andreas; Lukovic, Dominika; Zlabinger, Katrin; Hašimbegović, Ena; Winkler, Johannes; Garamvölgyi, Rita; Neitzel, Sonja; Gyöngyösi, Mariann; Thum, Thomas",Eur Heart J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813625/,242

15075,The Smart Class Teaching Module for Rehabilitation Medicine English Education in China,2021-01-17,"BACKGROUND: Falls have implications for the health of older adults. Strength and balance interventions significantly reduce the risk of falls; however, patients seldom perform the dose of exercise that is required based on evidence. Health professionals play an important role in supporting older adults as they perform and progress in their exercises. Teleconferencing could enable health professionals to support patients more frequently, which is important in exercise behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the overall concept and acceptability of teleconferencing for the delivery of falls rehabilitation with health care professionals and older adults and to examine the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of teleconferencing delivery with health care professionals and patients. METHODS: There were 2 stages to the research: patient and public involvement workshops and usability and feasibility testing. A total of 2 workshops were conducted, one with 5 health care professionals and the other with 8 older adults from a community strength and balance exercise group. For usability and feasibility testing, we tested teleconferencing both one-to-one and in small groups on a smartphone with one falls service and their patients for 3 weeks. Semistructured interviews and focus groups were used to explore acceptability, usability, and feasibility. Focus groups were conducted with the service that used teleconferencing with patients and 2 other services that received only a demonstration of how teleconferencing works. Qualitative data were analyzed using the framework approach. RESULTS: In the workshops, the health care professionals thought that teleconferencing provided an opportunity to save travel time. Older adults thought that it could enable increased support. Safety is of key importance, and delivery needs to be carefully considered. Both older adults and health care professionals felt that it was important that technology did not eliminate face-to-face contact. There were concerns from older adults about the intrusiveness of technology. For the usability and feasibility testing, 7 patients and 3 health care professionals participated, with interviews conducted with 6 patients and a focus group with the health care team. Two additional teams (8 health professionals) took part in a demonstration and focus group. Barriers and facilitators were identified, with 5 barriers around reliability due to poor connectivity, cost of connectivity, safety concerns linked to positioning of equipment and connectivity, intrusiveness of technology, and resistance to group teleconferencing. Two facilitators focused on the positive benefits of increased support and monitoring and positive solutions for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Teleconferencing as a way of delivering fall prevention interventions can be acceptable to older adults, patients, and health care professionals if it works effectively. Connectivity, where there is no Wi-Fi provision, is one of the largest issues. Therefore, local infrastructure needs to be improved. A larger usability study is required to establish whether better equipment for delivery improves usability.","Hawley-Hague, Helen; Tacconi, Carlo; Mellone, Sabato; Martinez, Ellen; Chiari, Lorenzo; Helbostad, Jorunn; Todd, Chris",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837999/,242

The objective of this study was to develop a novel method to rapidly clone the full-length cDNA of a very virulent NDV by only one assembly step. A completely synthetic 15 kb cDNA of a Malaysian genotype VIII NDV known as strain AF2240-I with additional flanking BsmBI sites was synthesised. However, to completely follow the rule-of-six, the additional G residues that are traditionally added after the T7 promoter transcription initiation site were not synthesised. The synthetic fragment was then cloned into low-copy number transcription vector pOLTV5-phiX between the T7 promoter and HDV Rz sequences through digestion with BbsI. The construct was co-transfected with helper plasmids into BSRT7/5 cells. A recombinant NDV called rAF was successfully rescued using transfection supernatant harvested as early as 16 h post-transfection. Virus from each passage showed an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and a mean death time (MDT) similar to the parent strain AF2240-I. Moreover, rAF possessed an introduced mutation which was maintained for several passages. The entire rescue using the one-step assembly procedure was completed within a few weeks, which is extremely fast compared to previously used methods.","Murulitharan, Kavitha; Yusoff, Khatijah; Omar, Abdul Rahman; Peeters, Ben P.

16455,Urinary Metabolite Signatures for Predicting Elderly Stroke Survivors with Depression,2021-03-25,"Infection with the deadly rabies virus (RABV) leads to alteration of cellular gene expression. The RABV, similar to other neurodegenerative diseases may be implicated in neuronal death due to an imbalance in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Parvalbumin (PV) and Secretagogin (Scgn), two members of the Calcium-Binding Proteins (CBPs) are useful neuronal markers responsible for calcium regulation and buffering with possible protective roles against infections. This study investigated whether infection with rabies virus causes variance in expression levels of PV and Scgn using the Challenge virus standard (CVS) and Nigerian Street Rabies virus (SRV) strains. Forty-eight, 4-week-old BALB/c mice strains were divided into two test groups and challenged with Rabies virus (RABV) infection and one control group. The presence of RABV antigen was verified by direct fluorescent antibody test (DFAT) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to assess PV and Scgn gene expression. Infection with both virus strains resulted in significant (p < 0.05) increases in expression during early infection. Mid-infection phase caused reduced expression for both genes. However, as infection progressed to the terminal phase, a lower increase in expression was measured. Gene expression and viral load correlation indicated no positive relationship. Neurons with these CBPs may have a greater capacity to buffer calcium and be more resistant to degenerative changes caused by RABV. This implies that, when PV and Scgn expression levels are kept adequately high, the integrity of neurons may be maintained and degeneration caused by RABV infection may be prevented or stopped, hence, these are possible constituents of effective rabies therapy.","Kanu, Brenda; Kia, Grace S.

17639,Genomic Action of Sigma-1 Receptor Chaperone Relates to Neuropathic Pain,2021-01-18,"Depleting the microenvironment of important nutrients such as arginine is a key strategy for immune evasion by cancer cells. Many tumors overexpress arginase, but it is unclear how these cancers, but not T cells, tolerate arginine depletion. In this study, we show that tumor cells synthesize arginine from citrulline by upregulating argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1). Under arginine starvation, ASS1 transcription is induced by ATF4 and CEBPβ binding to an enhancer within ASS1. T cells cannot induce ASS1, despite the presence of active ATF4 and CEBPβ, as the gene is repressed. Arginine starvation drives global chromatin compaction and repressive histone methylation, which disrupts ATF4/CEBPβ binding and target gene transcription. We find that T cell activation is impaired in arginine-depleted conditions, with significant metabolic perturbation linked to incomplete chromatin remodeling and misregulation of key genes. Our results highlight a T cell behavior mediated by nutritional stress, exploited by cancer cells to enable pathological immune evasion.","Crump, Nicholas T.; Hadjinicolaou, Andreas V.; Xia, Meng; Walsby-Tickle, John; Gileadi, Uzi; Chen, Ji-Li; Setshedi, Mashiko; Olsen, Lars R.; Lau, I-Jun; Godfrey, Laura; Quek, Lynn; Yu, Zhanru; Ballabio, Erica; Barnkob, Mike B.; Napolitani, Giorgio; Salio, Mariolina; Koohy, Hashem; Kessler, Benedikt M.; Taylor, Stephen; Vyas, Paresh; McCullagh, James S.O.; Milne, Thomas A.; Cerundolo, Vincenzo",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8131582/,242
17644,Financial incentives and deposit contracts to promote HIV retesting in Uganda: A randomized trial,2021-05-04,"The complexities of viral evolution can be difficult to elucidate. Software simulating viral evolution provides powerful tools for exploring hypotheses of viral systems, especially in situations where thorough empirical data are difficult to obtain or parameters of interest are difficult to measure. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection has no durable cure; this is primarily due to the virus’ ability to integrate into the genome of host cells, where it can remain in a transcriptionally latent state. An effective cure strategy must eliminate every copy of HIV-1 in this ‘persistent reservoir’ because proviruses can reactivate, even decades later, to resume an active infection. However, many features of the persistent reservoir remain unclear, including the temporal dynamics of HIV-1 integration frequency and the longevity of the resulting reservoir. Thus, sophisticated analyses are required to measure these features and determine their temporal dynamics. Here, we present software that is an extension of SANTA-SIM to include multiple compartments of viral populations. We used the resulting software to create a model of HIV-1 within host evolution that incorporates the persistent HIV-1 reservoir. This model is composed of two compartments, an active compartment and a latent compartment. With this model, we compared five different date estimation methods (Closest Sequence, Clade, Linear Regression, Least Squares, and Maximum Likelihood) to recover the integration dates of genomes in our model’s HIV-1 reservoir. We found that the Least Squares method performed the best with the highest concordance (0.80) between real and estimated dates and the lowest absolute error (all pairwise t tests: P < 0.01). Our software is a useful tool for validating bioinformatics software and understanding the dynamics of the persistent HIV-1 reservoir.","Jones, Bradley R; Joy, Jeffrey B",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132731/,242

Yet, professional vulnerability to secondary traumatic stress (STS) is under-researched in foster carers, as is the suitability of associated intervention techniques. We therefore investigated incidence of STS and psychological predictors relevant to secondary and primary stress appraisal in UK foster carers. METHODS: British foster carers (n = 187; 81% female; aged 23–72 years; mean length of experience 9 years) were approached through a range of organizations managing paid foster caring in the UK for a survey study. Self-report measures were obtained on STS, burnout and compassion satisfaction from the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale, as well as on primary trauma and variables previously recommended for inclusion in training targeting secondary trauma: empathy, resilience and self-care. RESULTS: High levels of STS and burnout were found among foster carers. In multivariate model testing, STS was directly and positively predicted by burnout, compassion satisfaction and primary trauma (R(2) = 0.54, p < 0.001). Resilience, empathy and self-care did not show direct associations with STS, but self-care had a significant indirect effect on STS. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the view that STS is a substantial risk factor in foster caring. While self-care is confirmed as a promising factor in intervention, the roles of empathy and resilience are more ambiguous.","Bridger, Kay M.; Binder, Jens F.; Kellezi, Blerina",J Child Fam Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222129/,242

In last section, the future perspectives in both basic and clinical investigations towards unmet medical needs in AECHB and HBV ACLF are discussed. 1. Factors affecting the prognosis of patients with severe hepatitis B include those related to the virus (including viral load, HBeAg expression, and gene mutation), patient age, co-morbidity, TBil, INR, serum Cr, and the host genetic background. Indicators associated with patient prognosis include TBil, total cholesterol, albumin and prealbumin, hepatic encephalopathy, kidney damage, alpha-fetoprotein and vitamin D binding protein, blood sodium level, virus HBeAg expression and genotype, and blood glucose. 2. In addition to TBil, INR, hepatic encephalopathy, Cr level and AFP as indicators for prognosis of severe hepatitis, some other parameters such as clinical signs, symptoms, serum levels of total cholesterol and albumin and natrium, and coagulation factors are all valuable in assessment. The roles of cell apoptosis, liver regeneration and immunological parameters in assessing patient prognosis are under study. Prognostic evaluating systems include MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, KCI and CTP score. 3. Prevention of severe hepatitis B should be started in asymptomatic patients. Close observation, sufficient rest, adequate nutrition, meticulous nursing and psychological care, preventing and removing exacerbating factors, treating concomitant diseases, reasonable antiviral and comprehensive therapies are helpful to prevent CHB patients from developing to severe hepatitis. For patients who already have severe hepatitis B, the prevention and management of complications is important for lowering mortality rate. 4. New research directions in acute-on-chronic liver failure include: (1) Additional well controlled studies using present or new liver systems are warranted. Other approaches include the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor to treat infections as well as the potential of use of stem cells to restore immune integrity and enhance liver regeneration. (2) Using new cell lines and animal models to understand the molecular biology of HBV, the immune response and to develop novel therapies. (3) Development of new anti-HBV strategies, e.g. silencing or remove cccDNA, enhancing immunologic clearance of HBV infection, inhibiting virus entry or HBc expression and using CRISP to disrupt cccDNA.","Wang, Yu-Ming; Yang, Dao-Feng; Wang, Ming; Selzner, Nazia; Farrokhi, Kaveh; Chruscinski, Andrzej; Levy, Gary",Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Hepatitis B,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498886/,242
41083,Journal of Vascular Surgery – November 2020 Audiovisual Summary,2020-10-21,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the key regulators behind the inflammatory and pathological process associated with ophthalmic diseases. The role of IL-6-174 G/C polymorphism as well as intraocular IL-6 levels among various eye disease patients differ across studies and has not been systematically reviewed. Thus, this study aims to provide a summary to understand the relationship between IL-6 and ophthalmic disease. In total, 8,252 and 11,014 subjects for IL-6-174 G/C and intraocular levels of IL-6, respectively, were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. No association was found between IL-6-174 G/C polymorphisms with ocular diseases. Subgroup analyses revealed a suggestive association between the GC genotype of IL-6-174 G/C with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Further, the level of intraocular IL-6 among ocular disease patients in general was found to be higher than the control group [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–1.58, P < 0.00001]. Closer examination through subgroup analyses yielded similar results in several ocular diseases. This study thus indicates that the IL-6-174 G/C polymorphism does not predispose patients to ocular disease, although the GC genotype is likely to be a genetic biomarker for PDR. Moreover, intraocular IL-6 concentrations are related to the specific manifestations of the ophthalmic diseases. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm this conclusion.","Ulhaq, Zulvikar Syambani; Soraya, Gita Vita; Budu; Wulandari, Lely Retno",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7566646/,242

As new cases appear daily, infecting millions of people and causing thousands of deaths, the current in silico study aims to investigate the imidazolic alkaloids of the species Pilocarpus microphyllus (Jaborandi) as a potential inhibitory activity against the M(pro) protease from SARS-CoV-2, since it plays a fundamental role in the processing of polyproteins that are translated from viral RNA. Jaborandi is distributed in some Brazilian biomes, being easily identified, yet little researched, with proven anti-inflammatory, contraceptive, anti-diabetic and gastroprotective activities. In this work, DFT calculation of thermodynamic properties, electrostatic potential surface, frontier molecular orbitals and descriptors of chemical reactivity of imidazolic alkaloids were associated with the use of molecular docking techniques, molecular dynamics and ADMET predictions. One can verify a good reactivity chemistry and energetic stability of epiisopiloturine, epiisopilosine, isopilosine and e pilosine with some residues of amino acids present in the active site of the main protease of COVID-19. In this sense, the results point out to the imidazolic alkaloids of Jaborandi as promising targets for in vitro and in vivo tests, as possible candidates for inhibitors of the enzyme M(pro).","de Sá, Ézio R.

The ability to bridge this tension is paramount to ensure continued psychosocial treatment and the well-being of children. This paper discusses a study to determine the decision-making factors of social work students and practitioners when facing a suspicion of child abuse and neglect, how they justify their decision to report or not report to child protection services, and the current and future relationship repair strategies used with simulated clients during an objective structured clinical evaluation (OSCE). Nineteen BSW, MSW, and experienced practitioners (N = 19) underwent an OSCE with one of two child maltreatment vignettes, physical abuse or neglect. Fisher’s exact test was used to examine participants’ historical and current reporting behaviors. Independent samples T-tests, Cohen’s D, and qualitative content analysis was used to examine participants’ decision making and relationship repair strategies when faced with suspected child abuse and neglect. Results showed that six participants discussed the duty to report during the OSCE while 13 participants did not. Participants’ who discussed and did not discuss the duty to report during the OSCE articulated clear reasons for their decision and identified relationship repair strategies in working with the client. A sub-group of participants who identified the child maltreatment but did not discuss the duty to report, provided more tentative and complex reasons for their inaction and next steps in working with the client. All participants demonstrated a degree of competence and critical reflection in the OSCE, with integration for future learning. These findings are discussed and implications for future practice are offered.","Tufford, Lea; Lee, Barbara; Bogo, Marion; Wenghofer, Elizabeth; Etherington, Cassandra; Thieu, Vivian; Zhao, Rose",Clin Soc Work J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864800/,242

The scientific interest on coronaviruses has increased since the outbreak of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) that initiated in Wuhan, China. This was soon declared a ‘Public Health Emergency of International Concern’ by World Health Organisation (WHO). Presently, the best strategy against this pandemic is prevention through regular hand and face washes, use of masks, gloves and personal protective equipment and social distancing. At the government level, the task is to perform as many tests as possible to identify coronavirus infected people and to isolate them to avoid the uncontrollable spread of the virus. The ongoing and future strategies against coronavirus ensue that huge quantity of masks, plastic products (personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, face shields, etc.) and chemicals (chloroxylenol, chlorine, H(2)O(2), etc.) would be generated as waste in near future. Further, the amount of water consumption per person shall also increase. These effects can have unforeseen impacts on the environment. Apart from this, the ecological impacts on human–animal interactions can also be seen, such as people avoiding pets in coming future as a health and safety measure. The present review gives an overview of coronavirus, its current state of spread and environmental and ecological risks ensuing from the pandemic.","Ankit; Kumar, Amit; Jain, Vartika; Deovanshi, Ankit; Lepcha, Ayush; Das, Chandan; Bauddh, Kuldeep; Srivastava, Sudhakar",Environmental Sustainability,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7896832/,242
46338,The usefulness of dipyridamole stress echocardiography in high-risk patients before abdominal aneurism surgery,2021-02-08,"One of the global burdens of health care is an alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and liver-related death which is caused due to acute or chronic consumption of alcohol. Chronic consumption of alcohol damage the normal defense mechanism of the liver and likely to disturb the gut barrier system, mucosal immune cells, which leads to decreased nutrient absorption. Therapy of ALD depends upon the spectrum of liver injury that causes fatty liver, hepatitis, and cirrhosis. The foundation of therapy starts with abstinence from alcohol. Corticosteroids are used for the treatment of ALD but due to poor acceptance, continuing mortality, and identification of tumor necrosis factor-alpha as an integral component in pathogenesis, recent studies focus on pentoxifylline and, antitumor necrosis factor antibody to neutralize cytokines in the therapy of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Antioxidants also play a significant role in the treatment but till today there is no universally accepted therapy available for any stage of ALD. The treatment aspects need to restore the gut functions and require nutrient-based treatments to regulate the functions of the gut system and prevent liver injury. The vital action of saturated fatty acids greatly controls the gut barrier. Overall, this review mainly focuses on the mechanism of alcohol-induced metabolic dysfunction, contribution to liver pathogenesis, the effect of pregnancy, and targeted therapy of ALD.","Subramaniyan, Vetriselvan; Chakravarthi, Srikumar; Jegasothy, Ravindran; Seng, Wu Yuan; Fuloria, Neeraj Kumar; Fuloria, Shivkanya; Hazarika, Iswar; Das, Anju",Toxicol Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910406/,242

In August 2019, the Taiwan Ministry of Education implemented the new Curriculum Guidelines for 12-Year Basic Education. Being Taiwan’s first official curriculum that promoted self-directed learning, this study contributed to the emerging knowledge of how the introduction of the curriculum guidelines affected students’ readiness for self-directed learning. Three cohorts of high school students from seven schools returned 10,020 valid surveys. The Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS), a reputable instrument developed by Lucy Guglielmino (2000), was used in the study. The results provided a bird’s-eye view of evidence supporting our explanations for the positive, though slight, effect of implementing new curriculum guidelines in fostering self-directed high-school learners. Moreover, the progression of self-directed learning readiness appeared differently among schools and among different demographic associations. We suggest that future researchers both (a) qualitatively explore how specific latent variables were changed in different instructional interventions, and (b) conduct panel studies to advance our understanding of curriculum reform and learners’ self-direction.

ENT UK published guidance on the management of common emergencies encountered aimed to optimise safety for patient and clinician alongside reducing admission rate. We present an audit of our management of patients presenting with sore throat during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective data collection was undertaken between 1st April 2020 and 1st July 2020, inclusive. All patients presenting acutely to ENT services with sore throat were reviewed. Local practice was compared to the ENT UK COVID-19 adult tonsillitis and quinsy management guidelines published on 6th April 2020. RESULTS: A total of 19 patients presented to the ENT department with an acute sore throat during the audit period. Twelve patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, with all results being negative. All patients underwent an oral examination on review. Seventy-nine percent were discharged within 24 hours of admission. One patient required readmission within 30-days. CONCLUSIONS: With reduction in admissions, these results provide otolaryngologists with the reassurance for change of clinical practice. We recommend that for future practice to be safe for both patient and practitioner, the ENT UK guidelines are used to aid clinical decision-making especially during the COVID-19.","Eastwood, M; Lovett, A; Metcalfe, C; Bhimrao, S",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135725/,242

METHODS: We conducted in-person home interviews with 90 randomly selected households in March 2020 prior to the first reported case of COVID-19 in Kenya and followed up with 88 of these same households by phone in June 2020 during COVID-19. We assessed household food insecurity status using the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and assessed dietary diversity using the Household Dietary Diversity Score. We compared differences in household food insecurity scores and prevalence across time using the paired T-test and McNemar's test, respectively. We compared household dietary diversity scores and the proportion of households consuming each food group across time using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar's test for paired samples, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of severe food insecurity increased from 82% before COVID-19 to 91% during COVID-19 (P = 0.03) and household dietary diversity scores fell from 9.5 ± 1.5 to 8.6 ± 1.5 (P < 0.001). Households coped by reducing their food intake at mealtimes, borrowing money from family and friends, and purchasing food on credit. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a high and growing level of vulnerability faced by these communities. Strategies to address food insecurity and access to diverse foods during the COVID-19 pandemic are urgently needed.

It has been 12 years since the AMV was approved for implementation. One critical message from the ISG report and the AMV is to use the notion of linkages to change mining as an enclave activity to one integrated with the rest of the economy. Whilst this has not happened completely, some progress has been made. Besides, a lot has happened and is still happening. These include mining automation, energy transition and COVID-19 among others. One key global trend that will impact significantly on the mining sector is the energy transition; thus, Africa needs to position itself to take advantage of the opportunities, whilst mitigating the challenges. Furthermore, implementation of the AMV will only succeed when a supportive constituency is built by active engagement among governments, CSOs, the private sector and Research Think Tanks.","Atta-Mensah, Joseph; Busia, Kojo; Tsikata, Fui; Ahadjie, Jerry; Mutemeri, Nellie; Graham, Yao",Miner Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215318/,242

55287,Superinfections in COVID-19 Patients: Role of Antimicrobials,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) patients exhibit multiple organ malfunctions with a primary manifestation of acute and diffuse lung injuries. The Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is crucial to mediate viral entry into host cells; however, whether it can be cellularly pathogenic and contribute to pulmonary hyper‐inflammations in COVID‐19 is not well known. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this study, we developed a Spike protein‐pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV‐G) was used as the control. Two hours post‐infection (hpi), Spp showed more than 27‐75 times more viral burden in the lungs than other organs; it also exhibited about 3‐5 times more viral burden than VSV‐G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR(+) macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1(+) macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR‐γ were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in vivo as well as in macrophage‐like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the Spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 alone can induce cellular pathology, e.g. activating macrophages and contributing to induction of acute inflammatory responses.","Cao, Xiaoling; Tian, Yan; Nguyen, Vi; Zhang, Yuping; Gao, Chao; Yin, Rong; Fan, Daping; Cui, Taixing; Tan, Wenbin",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239867/,242

A Feasibility Trial,2021-07-22,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate lung cancer segmentation with a pretrained model and transfer learning. The pretrained model was constructed from an artificial dataset generated using a generative adversarial network (GAN). Materials and Methods: Three public datasets containing images of lung nodules/lung cancers were used: LUNA16 dataset, Decathlon lung dataset, and NSCLC radiogenomics. The LUNA16 dataset was used to generate an artificial dataset for lung cancer segmentation with the help of the GAN and 3D graph cut. Pretrained models were then constructed from the artificial dataset. Subsequently, the main segmentation model was constructed from the pretrained models and the Decathlon lung dataset. Finally, the NSCLC radiogenomics dataset was used to evaluate the main segmentation model. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used as a metric to evaluate the segmentation performance. Results: The mean DSC for the NSCLC radiogenomics dataset improved overall when using the pretrained models. At maximum, the mean DSC was 0.09 higher with the pretrained model than that without it. Conclusion: The proposed method comprising an artificial dataset and a pretrained model can improve lung cancer segmentation as confirmed in terms of the DSC metric. Moreover, the construction of the artificial dataset for the segmentation using the GAN and 3D graph cut was found to be feasible.","Nishio, Mizuho; Fujimoto, Koji; Matsuo, Hidetoshi; Muramatsu, Chisako; Sakamoto, Ryo; Fujita, Hiroshi",Front Artif Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8322116/,242

Clinical case report,2021-10-08,"The Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented decline of economic activity at the globe scale. To slow down the spread of the virus, most governments reacted with various measures of social distancing, such as mobility controls, business and school closures, etc. We investigate the short-term impact of social distancing measures on the US labour market, using a panel threshold model with high frequency (weekly) data on unemployment across US states allowing for heteroscedasticity. Labour is a key input in production, and thus a good proxy for the state of the economy. We find that changes in the restrictiveness of mandated social distancing, as measured by the Oxford Stringency Index, exert a strong impact on unemployment. The bulk of the reaction of unemployment to a change in the social distancing restrictions does not arise immediately, but with a delay of 2–4 weeks. In addition, the impact is asymmetric. If the policies switch to tighter regulations, the increase in unemployment is quicker and higher in absolute value than a decrease after relaxation. The state of the pandemic, proxied by the number of new infections and fatalities, constitutes only a marginal factor.","Dreger, Christian; Gros, Daniel",Econ Disaster Clim Chang,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503720/,242

The method is a step outside of the usual interior point framework. In anticipation to converging to a low-rank primal solution, a special nearly low-rank form of all primal iterates is imposed. To accommodate such a (restrictive) structure, the first order optimality conditions have to be relaxed and are therefore approximated by solving an auxiliary least-squares problem. The relaxed interior point framework opens numerous possibilities how primal and dual approximated Newton directions can be computed.

59161,Diagnostics of thrombosis of cerebral vessels and venous sinuses in patients after COVID-19,2021-10-08,"Our study presents a framework to estimate economic costs of the COVID-19 pandemic for the U.S. economy. We characterize whether the pandemic-related damages are short-lived or long-lasting. The potential damages are estimated in terms of losses in eight major variables, including employment, consumption, and GDP. To estimate damages from the pandemic, we utilize the pre-COVID potential level of the target variables, GDP for example, as a benchmark and compare these estimates with those that are calculated during the COVID pandemic. Our study suggests damages from the pandemic are not short-lived as the major sectors have shifted to a lower growth trajectory compared to the pre-COVID growth path. Focusing only on the real GDP level would paint an illusion of a stronger recovery back to the “normal.” Furthermore, the illusion of a stronger recovery may lead to a sooner-than-appropriate policy normalization.","Iqbal, Azhar; Bullard, Sam",Bus Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505471/,242
59175,Metabolic signature of hyposmia after mild COVID-19: An [18]F-FDG-pet study,2021-10-08,"Claims have a lot of space in construction projects, as they can have a considerable monetary value and thus negatively affect the final amount and duration of the project. This study seeks to suggest a building information modeling (BIM) approach to reduce most of the root causes of claims during the design phase. Thus, claims can be reduced during the project implementation phase. A questionnaire form was designed and distributed to 28 experts to obtain expert opinions on construction claims’ most important causes. In return, data were collected for 128 projects in Iraq, and the reasons for claims were extracted from them. After making the match between experts’ opinions and real projects, it was found that the match rate is high and that there are sixteen critical reasons for construction claims in Iraqi projects. After matching these causes with the BIM functions, a flowchart of each cause is drawn, and the inputs, tools, and outputs of the process are identified. The results showed the ability of BIM to prevent eight significant causes of claims (inaccurate quantities, excessive change orders, errors and design changes, flaws in drawings and specifications, and poor coordination between designers (structural, architectural, MEP)) through these BIM functions (3D visualization, clash detection, coordination, and take-off). The main results applied to a realistic case study show that BIM technology can be used as a precautionary approach during the design stage to reduce claims during implementation by (55.2%) so that the functions of this technology can solve the fundamental causes of claims in the construction projects sector in Iraq.","Ibraheem, Rehab Abdul Razzaq; Mahjoob, Ahmed Mohammed Raoof",Innov,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506101/,242
59193,Cognitive impairment in previously independent COVID-19 patients: The tip of the iceberg?,2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been widely described as an infodemic, an excess of rapidly circulating information in social and traditional media in which some information may be erroneous, contradictory, or inaccurate. One key theme cutting across many infodemic analyses is that it stymies users’ capacities to identify appropriate information and guidelines, encourages them to take inappropriate or even harmful actions, and should be managed through multiple transdisciplinary approaches. Yet, investigations demonstrating how the COVID-19 information ecosystem influences complex public decision making and behavior offline are relatively few. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether information reported through the social media channel Twitter, linked articles and websites, and selected traditional media affected the risk perception, engagement in field activities, and protective behaviors of French Red Cross (FRC) volunteers and health workers in the Paris region of France from June to October 2020. METHODS: We used a hybrid approach that blended online and offline data. We tracked daily Twitter discussions and selected traditional media in France for 7 months, qualitatively evaluating COVID-19 claims and debates about nonpharmaceutical protective measures. We conducted 24 semistructured interviews with FRC workers and volunteers. RESULTS: Social and traditional media debates about viral risks and nonpharmaceutical interventions fanned anxieties among FRC volunteers and workers. Decisions to continue conducting FRC field activities and daily protective practices were also influenced by other factors unrelated to the infodemic: familial and social obligations, gender expectations, financial pressures, FRC rules and communications, state regulations, and relationships with coworkers. Some respondents developed strategies for “tuning out” social and traditional media. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the information ecosystem may be just one among multiple influences on one group’s offline perceptions and behavior. Measures to address users who have disengaged from online sources of health information and who rely on social relationships to obtain information are needed. Tuning out can potentially lead to less informed decision making, leading to worse health outcomes.","Heyerdahl, Leonardo W; Lana, Benedetta; Giles-Vernick, Tamara",JMIR Infodemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507423/,242
59241,Assessment of radiation doses and image quality of multiple low-dose CT exams in COVID-19 clinical management,2021-10-08,"Background: Previous epidemiological studies have confirmed non-human primates (NHPs) as reservoirs for Cryptosporidium spp. , Giardia intestinalis, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi. It highlights the possibility of interspecies transmission between humans and macaques in laboratory animal facilities. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of pathogenic intestinal protozoan infections in macaques and humans and to determine the risk of cross-species transmission from One Health view. Materials and Methods: A total of 360 fecal samples, including 310 from the four Macaca mulatta groups, 25 from the facility workers in a laboratory animal facility, and 25 from the villagers nearby in Yongfu country, southeast China, were collected. Nested PCR assays were done for detecting protozoan pathogens from all the specimens. Furthermore, potential risk factors (gender, age, and direct contact) on the occurrence of intestinal protozoa infection among different sub-groups were evaluated. A phylogenetic and haplotype network analysis was conducted to examine the genetic structure and shared patterns of E. bieneusi and Cyclospora cayetanensis. Results: The pathogenic intestinal protozoa were detected in both human and macaque fecal samples. A total of 134 (37.2%) samples were tested positive, which included 113 (36.4%) macaques, 14 (56.0%) facility workers, and 7 (28.0%) villagers, respectively. There was no significant difference in four intestinal protozoa infections between facility workers and villagers (χ(2) = 2.4, P > 0.05). However, the positive rate of pathogenic intestinal protozoa in the facility workers, who had direct contact with macaques, was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.09–1.00, P < 0.05).Thirty-three ITS genotypes of E. bieneusi were identified, including five known genotypes (PigEBITS7, Peru8, Henan V, D, and CM1) and six novel genotypes (MEB1–6). Seven haplotypes were identified in the network analysis from C. cayetanensis-positive samples. Meanwhile, a phylogenetic and haplotype analysis confirmed the presence of zoonotic subtypes in NHPs and humans. Conclusion: The data collected from this study confirmed a high prevalence of intestinal protozoan infection in humans and macaques. These results warrant workers of such facilities and residents to limit contact with infected animals in order to minimize related health risks. The need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic transmission, especially from a One Health perspective, is recommended.","Li, Jian; Ren, Yijing; Chen, Haiying; Huang, Weiyi; Feng, Xinyu; Hu, Wei",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511526/,242
59502,The Exclusion of Patients with CKD in Prospectively Registered Interventional Trials for COVID-19-a Rapid Review of International Registry Data.,2020-09-08,"OBJECTIVE To examine associations of objectively-measured physical activity (PA) with changes in weight after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) over 7 years. BACKGROUND The contribution of free-living PA to surgery-induced weight loss and subsequent weight regain is not well understood. METHODS Participants of a multi-center prospective cohort study of bariatric surgery were followed annually ≥7 years. Of 807 participants who underwent RYGB and were given an activity monitor, 649 (80%) had sufficient data for this report (78% female; median age 47 years; median body mass index 46 kg/m). Mean daily steps, hours/day in sedentary behavior (SB) and minutes/week in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were determined at each assessment. Mixed models tested associations between PA measures and weight outcomes, controlling for sociodemographics, health status and eating behaviors. RESULTS Across follow-up, mean pre- to post-surgery changes in PA were small, and mean post-surgery PA level was below PA recommendations for health (e.g., 101 MVPA min/week 7 years post-surgery versus the ≥150 MVPA min/week recommendation). There was a dose-response association between more steps, less SB and more MVPA with greater weight loss. Steps and SB, but not MVPA, were also associated with weight regain. For example, participants in the highest versus lowest steps quartile lost 2.9% (95%CI, 1.8-4.1) more of their pre-surgery weight and regained 5.4% (95%CI, 2.4-8.3) less of their maximum weight lost across follow-up. CONCLUSION Despite only small increases in objectively-measured PA level after RYGB, PA level was independently associated with weight outcomes of bariatric surgery throughout 7 years of follow-up.

61581,Stress Cardiomyopathy with Transient Biventricular Dysfunction Following Recent COVID-19 Infection.,2021-03-01,"This article presents the design of an unobstrusive and wireless-enabled blood pressure (BP) monitoring system that is suitable for ambulatory use. By adopting low-profile electromechanical actuators and a compact printed circuit board design, this lightweight device can be worn directly on the occlusive cuff, therefore eliminating the need of two separate entities and long tubing interconnect usually seen in traditional ambulatory BP monitors (ABPM). Instead of executing the BP estimation algorithm directly on the device, the proposed design rather sends the raw oscillometric signal through a Bluetooth Low Energy link, thus granting any Bluetooth-enabled device to gather and process the signal using a dedicated application. This in turn allows to assess several systolic & diastolic BP estimation algorithms found in the literature without being limited by the device ressources. Three of them were tested with the designed prototype and validated with a reference equipment on 11 subjects. Overall, two of the algorithms revealed a mean absolute difference with the reference equipment of less than 5 mmHg and almost zero bias along with a standard deviation of less than 6 mmHg. Reproducibility results shown a mean difference between successive measurements of less than 3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation of less than 2.4 mmHg. The assembled prototype dimensions are 63.8 mm (W) x 134.8 mm (L) x 24.8 mm (H) and features an autonomy of 63.1 hours. Comparison with commercial ABPM devices shown that the proposed design is 18% to 33% smaller volume-wise and height is reduced by 17% to 25%.","Juteau, Nicolas; Gosselin, Benoit",IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbcas.2020.3026992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976107/,242

Our review included 32 studies. To detect obesity with body mass index (BMI), the meta-analyses rendered a sensitivity of 51.4% (95% CI 38.5-64.2%) and a specificity of 95.4% (95% CI 90.7-97.8%) in women, and 49.6% (95% CI 34.8-64.5%) and 97.3% (95% CI 92.1-99.1%), respectively, in men. For waist circumference (WC), the summary estimates for the sensitivity were 62.4% (95% CI 49.2-73.9%) and 88.1% for the specificity (95% CI 77.0-94.2%) in men, and 57.0% (95% CI 32.2-79.0%) and 94.8% (95% CI 85.8-98.2%), respectively, in women. The data were insufficient to pool the results for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) but were similar to BMI and WC. In conclusion, BMI and WC have serious limitations for use as obesity screening tools in clinical practice despite their widespread use. No evidence supports that WHR and WHtR are more suitable than BMI or WC to assess body fat. However, due to the lack of more accurate and feasible alternatives, BMI and WC might still have a role as initial tools for assessing individuals for excess adiposity until new evidence emerges.","Sommer, Isolde; Teufer, Birgit; Szelag, Monika; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Titscher, Viktoria; Klerings, Irma; Gartlehner, Gerald",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69498-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728050/,242

DESIGN Case-control study. SETTING University physical therapy clinic. PARTICIPANTS Women (N=60) divided into an LBP group and a control group. INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Amplitude of the electromyographic activity (root mean square values) of the gluteus maximus and external oblique muscles collected during 3 Pilates exercises: Shoulder Bridge performed on the mat, and Hip Roll and Breathing performed in equipment. Pain intensity was assessed in the LBP group. RESULTS The amplitude of the electromyographic activity was similar between groups (P≥.05). For both groups, the amplitude of the gluteus maximus was higher in the Shoulder Bridge exercise compared with the Hip Roll with 2 springs (control group: mean difference [MD]=.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], .05-.41; LBP group: MD=.29; 95% CI, .16-.31) and the Breathing exercise (control group: MD=-.40; 95% CI, -.55 to -.26; LBP group: MD=-.36; 95% CI, -.52 to -.20). The amplitude of the external oblique muscle was higher in the Shoulder Bridge compared with the Hip Roll with 2 springs (control group: MD=.13; 95% CI, .05-.21; LBP group: MD=.18; 95% CI, .03-.33). Pain intensity increased after exercises, but this increase was lower for the mat exercises. CONCLUSIONS Similar muscle activation between groups was found. The findings suggest that mat exercises caused less pain and a greater difference in the amplitude of muscle activation compared with the equipment-based exercises.","Oliveira, Naiane Teixeira Bastos de; Freitas, Sandra Maria Sbeghen Ferreira; Fuhro, Fernanda Ferreira; Luz, Maurício Antônio da; Amorim, Cesar Ferreira; Cabral, Cristina Maria Nunes",Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2016.09.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27693691/,242

The purpose of this article was to evaluate MRI features of uterine leiomyomas that predict volumetric response after uterine artery embolization (UAE). MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included 75 patients with 212 uterine leiomyomas who were successfully treated between August 2013 and December 2018. To predict uterine volumetric response, age, number of lesions, and baseline uterine volume were assessed. To predict leiomyoma volumetric response, a multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate six predictive factors: location, baseline leiomyoma volume, signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI, heterogeneity of signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI, and vascularity on subtraction imaging (SI). A five-variable predictive ROC model was developed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the signal intensity ratio on T2-weighted MRI, enhancement ratio, heterogeneity ratio on T2-weighted MRI, location, and baseline leiomyoma volume in predicting at least 40% leiomyoma volumetric response. RESULTS. Age, number of leiomyomas, and baseline uterine volume were not predictive of uterine volumetric response. A submucosal location was the best predictive factor of leiomyoma volumetric response, and it showed 32.2% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with a nonsubmucosal location (p < .001). Hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI was the second best predictive factor of leiomyoma volumetric response, and it showed 16.9% more volumetric response compared with hypointense leiomyomas (p = .013). A small baseline leiomyoma volume (< 58 cm3) was associated with 10.2% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with larger leiomyomas (p = .01). Leiomyomas that were hyperintense on SI showed 7.9% more leiomyoma volumetric response compared with those that were hypointense (p = .014). The five-variable ROC model showed high diagnostic accuracy with an AUC of 0.85, sensitivity of 82%, and specificity of 71%. CONCLUSION. A submucosal location, hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI, small baseline leiomyoma volume (< 58 cm3), and hyperintense leiomyoma on subtraction imaging are the main independent favorable predictors of leiomyoma volumetric response after UAE. An accurate predictive ROC model was developed that may help in selecting patients suitable for UAE. Quantitative assessment of heterogeneity on T2-weighted MRI showed promising results as a predictor of volumetric response, and further research in this area using texture analysis and radiomics is suggested.","Kurban, Lutfi Ali S; Metwally, Hesham; Abdullah, Mudar; Kerban, Abdurzag; Oulhaj, Abderrahim; Alkoteesh, Jamal Aldeen",AJR.

Toxin MenT3 inhibited growth of M. tuberculosis when not antagonized by its cognate antitoxin, MenA3. We solved the structures of toxins MenT3 and MenT4 to 1.6 and 1.2 Å resolution, respectively, and identified the biochemical activity and target of MenT3. MenT3 blocked in vitro protein expression and prevented tRNA charging in vivo. MenT3 added pyrimidines (C or U) to the 3'-CCA acceptor stems of uncharged tRNAs and exhibited strong substrate specificity in vitro, preferentially targeting tRNASer from among the 45 M. tuberculosis tRNAs. Our study identifies a previously unknown mechanism that expands the range of enzymatic activities used by bacterial toxins, uncovering a new way to block protein synthesis and potentially treat tuberculosis and other infections.","Cai, Yiming; Usher, Ben; Gutierrez, Claude; Tolcan, Anastasia; Mansour, Moise; Fineran, Peter C; Condon, Ciarán; Neyrolles, Olivier; Genevaux, Pierre; Blower, Tim R",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb6651; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923609/,242

65035,"Epidemiological determinants of COVID-19 infection and mortality: A study among patients presenting with severe acute respiratory illness during the pandemic in Bihar, India.",2020,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is an economically important infectious disease of swine. Constant emergence of variant strains of PRRS virus (PPRSV) and virus-mediated immune evasion followed by viral persistence result in increased incidence and recurrence of PRRS in swine herds. Current live and killed PRRSV vaccines administered by a parenteral route are ineffective in inducing complete protection. Thus, new approaches in design and delivery of PRRSV vaccines are needed to reduce the disease burden of the swine industry. Induction of an effective mucosal immunity to several respiratory pathogens by direct delivery of a vaccine to mucosal sites has proven to be effective in a mouse model. However, there are challenges in eliciting mucosal immunity to PRRS due to our limited understanding of safe and potent mucosal adjuvants, which could potentiate the mucosal immune response to PRRSV. The purpose of this review is to discuss methods for induction of protective mucosal immune responses in the respiratory tract of pigs. The manuscript also discusses how PRRSV modulates innate, adaptive and immunoregulatory responses at both mucosal and systemic sites of infected and/or vaccinated pigs. This information may help in the design of innovative mucosal vaccines to elicit superior cross-protective immunity against divergent field strains of PRRSV.","Renukaradhya, Gourapura J; Dwivedi, Varun; Manickam, Cordelia; Binjawadagi, Basavaraj; Benfield, David",Animal health research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1466252312000023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22717576/,242

This case points for a judicious approach to the selection of an anticoagulation strategy for deep venous thromboses in the setting of active AOSD. This case is of contemporary interest in its clinical similarity with COVID-19 symptoms and pathophysiology for which a careful diagnostic approach with a broad differential should be considered given the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 testing and the risk associated with treatment in the event of misdiagnosis.","Jones, Riley G; Hoyes, Brittany; Patel, Jaymin; Zaman, Muhammad Omer",BMJ case reports,https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-240986; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34158323/,242

Mutations in proteins that regulate cardiac muscle contraction can cause DCM; however, the mechanisms by which molecular-level mutations contribute to cellular dysfunction are not well-understood. Better understanding of these mechanisms might enable the development of targeted therapeutics that benefit patient subpopulations with mutations that cause common biophysical defects. We examined the molecular- and cellular-level impacts of a troponin T variant associated with pediatric-onset DCM, R134G. The R134G variant decreased calcium sensitivity in an in vitro motility assay. Using stopped-flow and steady-state fluorescence measurements, we determined the molecular mechanism of the altered calcium sensitivity: R134G decouples calcium binding by troponin from the closed-to-open transition of the thin filament and decreases the cooperativity of myosin binding to regulated thin filaments. Consistent with the prediction that these effects would cause reduced force per sarcomere, cardiomyocytes carrying the R134G mutation are hypocontractile. They also show hallmarks of DCM that lie downstream of the initial insult, including disorganized sarcomeres and cellular hypertrophy. These results reinforce the importance of multiscale studies to fully understand mechanisms underlying human disease and highlight the value of mechanism-based precision medicine approaches for DCM.","Barrick, Samantha K; Greenberg, Lina; Greenberg, Michael J",Molecular biology of the cell,https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e21-02-0082; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161147/,242

67588,Reply to: prediction of bilateral cerebral oxygen desaturation from a single sensor in adult cardiac surgery.,2019,"Some plus-stranded RNA viruses generate double membrane vesicles (DMVs), one type of the membrane replication factories, as replication sites. Little is known about the lipid components involved in the biogenesis of these vesicles. Sphingomyelin (SM) is required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, but the mechanism of SM involvement remains poorly understood. SM biosynthesis starts in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) giving rise to ceramide, which is transported from the ER to the Golgi by the action of ceramide transfer protein (CERT), where it can be converted to SM. In this study, inhibition of SM biosynthesis either by using small-molecule inhibitors or by knockout (KO) of CERT suppressed HCV replication in genotype-independent manner. This reduction in HCV replication was rescued by exogenous SM or ectopic expression of the CERT protein, but not by ectopic expression of non-functional CERT mutants. Observing low numbers of DMVs in stable replicon cells treated with a SM biosynthesis inhibitor or in CERT-KO cells transfected with either HCV replicon or with constructs that drive HCV protein production in a replication-independent system indicated the significant importance of SM to DMVs. The degradation of SM of the in vitro-isolated DMVs affected their morphology and increased the vulnerability of HCV RNA and proteins to ribonuclease and protease treatment, respectively. Poliovirus, known to induce DMVs, showed decreased replication in CERT-KO cells, while dengue virus, known to induce invaginated vesicles. did not. In conclusion, these findings indicated that SM is an essential constituent of DMVs generated by some plus-stranded RNA viruses.IMPORTANCE Previous reports assumed that sphingomyelin (SM) is essential for HCV replication, but the mechanism was unclear. In this study, we showed for the first time that SM and ceramide transfer protein (CERT), which is in the SM biosynthesis pathway, are essential for the biosynthesis of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), the sites of viral replication. Low numbers of DMVs were observed in CERT-KO cells transfected with replicon RNA or with constructs that drive HCV protein production in a replication-independent system. HCV replication was rescued by ectopic expression of the CERT protein, but not by CERT mutants that abolishes the binding of CERT to vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), indicating new roles for VAP and PI4P in HCV replication. The biosynthesis of DMVs has great importance to replication by a variety of plus-stranded RNA viruses. Understanding of this process is expected to facilitate the development of diagnosis and antivirus.","Gewaid, Hossam; Aoyagi, Haruyo; Arita, Minetaro; Watashi, Koichi; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Sakai, Shota; Kumagai, Keigo; Yamaji, Toshiyuki; Fukasawa, Masayoshi; Kato, Fumihiro; Hishiki, Takayuki; Mimata, Ayako; Sakamaki, Yuriko; Ichinose, Shizuko; Hanada, Kentaro; Muramatsu, Masamichi; Wakita, Takaji; Aizaki, Hideki",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01080-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938759/,242

The decision to deploy and the scale of deployment rely heavily on context and nature of the event and consequently a rapid assessment of needs/gaps is critical to an appropriate and customized response. METHODS In this study, we describe a desk-based study that provides: (1) knowledge about the medical needs that can be anticipated according to the phases of the disaster that is not rich in literature; and (2) a decision support framework for the deployment of EMTs to earthquakes that combines the results of a literature research and a Delphi study involving the opinion of 12 experts in the field. RESULTS The resulting framework is a tool that will help better mapping the configuration to the needs on the ground at the time the team becomes operational in the field and will assist those responsible for deploying and/or accepting EMTs in making informed decisions on deployment after an earthquake.

69162,Association of New Coronavirus Disease with Fragility Hip and Lower Limb Fractures in Elderly Patients.,2020-04-01,"Recent studies suggest a possible takeover of host antimicrobial autophagy machinery by positive-stranded RNA viruses to facilitate their own replication. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy in coxsackievirus replication. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a picornavirus associated with viral myocarditis, causes pronounced intracellular membrane reorganization after infection. We demonstrate that CVB3 infection induces an increased number of double-membrane vesicles, accompanied by an increase of the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and an accumulation of punctate GFP-LC3-expressing cells, two hallmarks of cellular autophagosome formation. However, protein expression analysis of p62, a marker for autophagy-mediated protein degradation, showed no apparent changes after CVB3 infection. These results suggest that CVB3 infection triggers autophagosome formation without promoting protein degradation by the lysosome. We further examined the role of the autophagosome in CVB3 replication. We demonstrated that inhibition of autophagosome formation by 3-methyladenine or small interfering RNAs targeting the genes critical for autophagosome formation (ATG7, Beclin-1, and VPS34 genes) significantly reduced viral replication. Conversely, induction of autophagy by rapamycin or nutrient deprivation resulted in increased viral replication. Finally, we examined the role of autophagosome-lysosome fusion in viral replication. We showed that blockage of the fusion by gene silencing of the lysosomal protein LAMP2 significantly promoted viral replication. Taken together, our results suggest that the host's autophagy machinery is activated during CVB3 infection to enhance the efficiency of viral replication.","Wong, Jerry; Zhang, Jingchun; Si, Xiaoning; Gao, Guang; Mao, Ivy; McManus, Bruce M; Luo, Honglin",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00641-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596087/,242

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) had been established as the first effective therapy for neonates with HIE; however, TH must be initiated within the first 6 hours after birth, and the number needed to treat is from 9 to 11 to prevent brain damage from HIE. Therefore, additional therapies for HIE are highly needed. In this review, we provide an introduction on the mechanisms of HIE cascade and how TH and cell therapies such as umbilical cord blood cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), especially umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs), may protect the brain in newborns, and discuss recent progress in regenerative therapies using UC-MSCs for neurological disorders. RESULTS The brain damage process ""HIE cascade"" was divided into six stages: (1) energy depletion, (2) impairment of microglia, (3) inflammation, (4) excitotoxity, (5) oxidative stress, and (6) apoptosis in capillary, glia, synapse and/or neuron. The authors showed recent 13 clinical trials using UC-MSCs for neurological disorders.

Methods An English-language literature review was done using search terms including extraperitoneal, transperineal, single-port, robotic surgery, prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy in various combinations. Unique features of the da Vinci SP® platform are discussed. Details of surgical techniques with single-port robotic platform are also covered. Results The relatively recent introduction of the da Vinci SP platform has led to the development of novel techniques for radical prostatectomy. Unique features of this platform including intracorporeal triangulation and double-articulating instruments will likely lead to widespread applications of this novel system. The principles of radical prostatectomy are reproducible with both extraperitoneal and perineal approaches via a single incision. Conclusions A better cosmetic results as well as a quick recovery maybe potential advantages of single-port extraperitoneal/transperineal robotic prostatectomy. By avoiding the peritoneal cavity, a lower rate of bowel related complications and minimum systemic CO2 absorption can be expected. Adverse effects of steep Trendelenburg positioning can be avoided with these techniques. Evaluation of the oncological and functional outcomes of these techniques will be necessary. Comparative trials with standard robotic surgery and cost-analysis studies remain hot topics for research after implementation of these new platforms at any institute.","Aminsharifi, Alireza; Sawczyn, Guilherme; Wilson, Clark A; Garisto, Juan; Kaouk, Jihad",Translational andrology and urology,https://doi.org/10.21037/tau.2019.11.35; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32420199/,242

PURPOSE A case of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurring as a reaction to ustekinumab therapy is reported. SUMMARY After starting ustekinumab for treatment of psoriatric arthritis, a 46-year-old female presented with flu-like symptoms and cough with blood-tinged sputum that had begun 1 week previously. Her initial computed tomography scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities. On bronchoscopy, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) return became bloodier from sample 1 to samples 2 and 3. Her BAL fluid was more than 90% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, a finding consistent with DAH. We ruled out infectious etiologies and other common vasculitis conditions that can cause DAH. A diagnosis of ustekinumab-induced DAH was made due to a temporal relationship between initiation of the drug and the patient's presentation and the absence of infection and other alternate diagnosis. Prior case reports including ustekinumab-induced pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease with a granulomatous component, and lupus syndrome have been reported, with this being the first case of DAH in a patient undergoing treatment of psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION A 46-year-old woman developed DAH during ustekinumab treatment. Symptoms abated after drug discontinuation and supportive treament. Clinicians must remain mindful of this rare complication of ustekinumab use in order to avoid potential delays in appropriate DAH treatment.","Gunasekaran, Kulothungan; Shukla, Anant; Palanisamy, Nageshwari; Singh Rahi, Mandeep; Wolff, Armand",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821925/,242

There is a lack of toxicity information of these commercial formulations and the effects of mixtures of FSA and fuels. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxic effects of different FSA, Gasoline Water Soluble Fraction (GWSF) and mixtures of each FSA and GWSF. Individual tests were performed with Daphnia similis and Artemia sp., the most toxic FSA to D. similis and Artemia sp. were F-500®, Cold Fire®, Agefoam®, and Kidde Sintex® 1%; the GWSF was the less toxic. The concentration addition (CA) model was used to predict the mixture effects and evaluate Synergism/Antagonism, Dose Ratio-dependent (DR) and Dose Level-dependent (DL). Cold Fire® with GWSF showed DL deviation to D. similis, marked mainly by synergism, for Artemia sp. DR pattern was predicted, with synergistic response mainly by Cold Fire®. Agefoam® and GWSF behaved additively for D. similis and DR for Artemia sp., with synergism being caused by Agefoam®. Kidde Sintex® 1% with GWSF were DR for both organisms, with Kidde Sintex® 1% being responsible for synergism.

Notably, research on the interaction of the two social forms (monogyne and polygyne) of the red imported fire ant (RIFA), Solenopsis invicta Buren, with microbes in its soil habitat is presently limited. In this study, we characterized bacterial microbiomes associated with RIFA nest soils and native (RIFA-negative) soils to better understand the effects of colonization of RIFA on soil microbial communities. Bacterial community fingerprints of 16S rRNA amplicons using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed significant differences in the structure of the bacterial communities between RIFA-positive and RIFA-negative soils at 0 and 10 cm depths. Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons provided fine-scale analysis to test for effects of RIFA colonization, RIFA social form, and soil depth on the composition of the bacterial microbiomes of the soil and RIFA workers. Our results showed the bacterial community structure of RIFA-colonized soils to be significantly different from native soil communities and to evidence elevated abundances of several taxa, including Actinobacteria. Colony social form was not found to be a significant factor in nest or RIFA worker microbiome compositions. RIFA workers and nest soils were determined to have markedly different bacterial communities, with RIFA worker microbiomes being characterized by high abundances of a Bartonella-like endosymbiont and Entomoplasmataceae.

Strong curvilinear dose-response associations were obtained for both suicidal ideation and attempts, with the lowest suicidal ideation and attempt risks at sleep durations of 8 h and 8-9 h per day (all Pnonlinearity < 0.001). A linear dose-response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plans (pooled OR = 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88-0.90) was obtained, indicating that the risk of suicide plans statistically decreased by 11% for every 1-h increase in sleep duration. Depression did not moderate the association between sleep duration and suicidality in youths. Our findings suggest curvilinear dose-response associations between sleep duration and the risks of suicidal ideation and attempts and a linear dose-response relationship between sleep duration and suicide plan risk. Additional longitudinal studies are warranted to establish causality.","Chiu, Hsiao-Yean; Lee, Hsin-Chien; Chen, Pin-Yuan; Lai, Ying-Fan; Tu, Yu-Kang",Sleep medicine reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2018.07.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30093362/,242

We reviewed a cohort of patients to assess the long-term effect of conservative management. We reviewed nine of 11 consecutive patients. We assessed objective outcomes including ranges of motion and strength and subjective outcomes including pain and function scores. We assessed seven women and two men. They had a mean age of 67 (range 48-82) years. Six of the nine patients had no more symptoms on the side of their FPL rupture than in the other thumb. Two were mildly more symptomatic and one much more symptomatic. Late thumb hyperextension did not appear to be a symptomatic problem. We recommend waiting at least 6 weeks before considering surgical reconstruction in patients who have an FPL rupture secondary to RA. The majority will recover so well that they may not choose reconstructive surgery.,"Giddins, G; Jefferson, L",Hand surgery & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hansur.2020.08.002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818690/,242
78999,Exercise interventions for people diagnosed with cancer: a systematic review of implementation outcomes.,2021-05-30,"The coronavirus family of positive-strand RNA viruses includes important pathogens of livestock, companion animals, and humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was responsible for a worldwide outbreak in 2003. The unusually complex coronavirus replicase/transcriptase is comprised of 15 or 16 virus-specific subunits that are autoproteolytically derived from two large polyproteins. In line with bioinformatics predictions, we now show that feline coronavirus (FCoV) nonstructural protein 16 (nsp16) possesses an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent RNA (nucleoside-2'O)-methyltransferase (2'O-MTase) activity that is capable of cap-1 formation. Purified recombinant FCoV nsp16 selectively binds to short capped RNAs. Remarkably, an N7-methyl guanosine cap ((7Me)GpppAC(3-6)) is a prerequisite for binding. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that nsp16 mediates methyl transfer from AdoMet to the 2'O position of the first transcribed nucleotide, thus converting (7Me)GpppAC(3-6) into (7Me)GpppA(2')(O)(Me)C(3-6). The characterization of 11 nsp16 mutants supported the previous identification of residues K45, D129, K169, and E202 as the putative K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad of the enzyme. Furthermore, residues Y29 and F173 of FCoV nsp16, which may be the functional counterparts of aromatic residues involved in substrate recognition by the vaccinia virus MTase VP39, were found to be essential for both substrate binding and 2'O-MTase activity. Finally, the weak inhibition profile of different AdoMet analogues indicates that nsp16 has evolved an atypical AdoMet binding site. Our results suggest that coronavirus mRNA carries a cap-1, onto which 2'O methylation follows an order of events in which 2'O-methyl transfer must be preceded by guanine N7 methylation, with the latter step being performed by a yet-unknown N7-specific MTase.","Decroly, Etienne; Imbert, Isabelle; Coutard, Bruno; Bouvet, Mickaël; Selisko, Barbara; Alvarez, Karine; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Snijder, Eric J; Canard, Bruno",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00407-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18417574/,242

To estimate the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in China, we evaluated the host serologic response, measured by the levels of immunoglobulins M and G in 17,368 individuals, in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, and geographic regions in the country, during the period from 9 March 2020 to 10 April 2020. In our cohorts, the seropositivity in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different subcohorts. Seroposivity progressively decreased in other cities as the distance to the epicenter increased. Patients who visited a hospital for maintenance hemodialysis and healthcare workers also had a higher seroprevalence of 3.3% (51 of 1,542, 2.5-4.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI)) and 1.8% (81 of 4,384, 1.5-2.3%, 95% CI), respectively. More studies are needed to determine whether these results are generalizable to other populations and geographic locations, as well as to determine at what rate seroprevalence is increasing with the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.

79310,Insertion of four different types of supraglottic airway devices by emergency nurses. A mannequin-based simulation study.,2020-11-30,"BACKGROUND Suboptimal medication adherence has been associated with increased resource utilization and mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are becoming increasingly important in the treatment of T2D. However, medications in this class differ considerably in their dosing frequency, which may impact adherence. We sought to perform a meta-analysis to compare adherence to injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly versus once-daily inpatients with T2D. METHODS Medline and Scopus were searched from 1/2005-7/2020 using keywords and MeSH terms pertaining to adherence and GLP-1RAs. Studies of adults with T2D were included if they compared adherence (as measured by proportion of days covered [PDC]) to injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly versus once-daily. A meta-analysis of non-overlapping studies was performed to evaluate the primary outcome of non-adherence, defined as the proportion of patients with a PDC<80. RESULTS A total of 7 studies evaluating 75,159 patients (range:2,886-30,097) with T2D were included. The follow-up periods of included studies ranged from 6-12 months. Injectable GLP-1RAs dosed once-weekly were either dulaglutide, albiglutide, or exenatide extended release; while liraglutide was the injectable once-daily agent evaluated in all included studies. Upon meta-analysis, once-weekly GLP-1RA dosing was associated with an 11% lower risk of non-adherence compared to once-daily dosing (risk ratio=0.89;95%confidence interval=0.83-0.95;I2=89%). CONCLUSION Once-weekly dosing of injectable GLP-1RAs was associated with better adherence versus once-daily dosing among patients with T2D. These findings coupled with the known detrimental consequences of non-adherence suggest that dosing frequency is an important factor to consider when selecting a GLP-1RA.","Weeda, Erin R; Muraoka, Alyssa K; Brock, Matthew D; Cannon, Jessica M",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527605/,242

METHODS Data for 120 consecutive, unselected patients undergoing tension-free laparoscopic incisional (n=63) or umbilical (n=57) hernia repair were prospectively collected. A multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate variables influencing outcomes. RESULTS Persistent seromas were observed in 13 patients (10.83%) and 2 recurrences (1.98%) occurred. Mesh size >300 cm was associated with increased hospital stay [odds ratio (OR) 4.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.5-15.53; P=0.008], increased postoperative day 1 (POD1) pain assessed with visual analog scale (OR 5.51; 95% CI, 1.76-17.2; P=0.003), and the presence of complications (OR 10.4; 95% CI, 1.85-58.96; P=0.007).

Lymph nodes contained two separate areas of MCL and cHL-like components. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like cells were accompanied by a prominent histiocyte background. HRS-like cells were CD5- , CD15+ , CD20- , CD30+ , PAX5+ , Bob.1- , Oct2- and EBER+ . The MCL component expressed cyclin D1 and SOX11, whereas cyclin D1 and SOX11 expressions were reduced and lost, respectively, in HRS-like cells. Polymerase chain reaction results showed a single clonal rearrangement of the IGH gene in MCL and cHL-like components. CCND1 break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization showed split signals in both MCL and HRS-like cells, suggesting that MCL and cHL-like components were clonally related. Acquisition of p53 expression and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positivity was seen in HRS-like cells. The patient died of disease progression with elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. The autopsy showed both MCL and cHL-like components around the bile ducts, splenic white pulp and bone marrow. The two components were phenotypically distinct, but genetically related, suggesting that transformation of MCL to HRS-like cells during the course of MCL in association with EBV infection.","Kanai, Risa; Miyagawa-Hayashino, Aya; Shishido-Hara, Yukiko; Nakamura, Naoya; Omatsu, Ikoi; Morinaga, Yukiko; Shimura, Yuji; Kuroda, Junya; Imura, Tetsuya; Itoh, Kyoko; Konishi, Eiichi",Pathology international,https://doi.org/10.1111/pin.13038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079423/,242

The aim of the present study was to compare the tumor stage, survival, and frequency of esophageal preservation in patients who presented with progression of Barrett's esophagus within a surveillance program versus those who presented with prevalent disease. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients treated for high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma from 2005 to 2010. The surveillance group included patients who had had at least 1 endoscopy and biopsy confirming intestinal metaplasia (with or without low-grade dysplasia) 6 months or more before the endoscopy showing progression. RESULTS A total of 224 patients were included in the present study, 36 in the surveillance group and 188 in the prevalence group. The surveillance patients had significantly earlier stage tumors (P < .0001) and were more likely to undergo endoscopic therapy and to keep their esophagus (44% vs 11%, P < .0001) than were patients with prevalent disease. Furthermore, the patients in the surveillance group were less likely to have lymph node metastases and had better overall and disease-free survival. No patient with high-grade dysplasia or an intramucosal tumor died of cancer. CONCLUSIONS Patients within a surveillance program for Barrett's esophagus had better survival and were less likely to have an esophagectomy than those who presented with prevalent disease. Treatment of intramucosal cancer was curative, and improved survival with surveillance was not secondary to lead time bias. Surveillance endoscopy remains important in patients with Barrett's esophagus.","Grant, Kimberly S; DeMeester, Steven R; Kreger, Vanessa; Oh, Daniel; Hagen, Jeffrey A; Chandrasoma, Parakrama; DeMeester, Tom R",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2012.12.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23312980/,242

To assess their role in the PRRSV life cycle, substitutions and deletions of the presumed catalytic cysteine and histidine residues of PCPalpha and PCPbeta were introduced into a PRRSV infectious cDNA clone. Mutations that inactivated PCPalpha activity completely blocked subgenomic mRNA synthesis, but did not affect genome replication. In contrast, mutants in which PCPbeta activity was blocked proved to be non-viable and no sign of viral RNA synthesis could be detected, indicating that the correct processing of the nsp1beta/nsp2 cleavage site is essential for PRRSV genome replication. In conclusion, the data presented here show that a productive PRRSV life cycle depends on the correct processing of both the nsp1alpha/nsp1beta and nsp1beta/nsp2 junctions.","Kroese, Michiel V; Zevenhoven-Dobbe, Jessika C; Bos-de Ruijter, Judy N A; Peeters, Ben P H; Meulenberg, Janneke J M; Cornelissen, Lisette A H M; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.83253-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18198380/,242

84627,Role of Interleukin-6 in Lung Complications in Patients With COVID-19: Therapeutic Implications.,2020-06-01,"GLOBAL IMPORTANCE The two feline retroviruses, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), are global and widespread, but differ in their potential to cause disease. VIRAL INFECTION - FIV FIV, a lentivirus that shares many properties with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can cause an acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which predisposes cats to other infections, stomatitis, neurological disorders and tumours. Although secondary infections are common, specific opportunistic infections or acquired immunodeficiency virus-defining infections, such as those that occur with HIV, are not commonly reported in FIV-infected cats. In most naturally infected cats, FIV does not cause a severe clinical syndrome; with appropriate care, FIV-infected cats can live many years before succumbing to conditions unrelated to their FIV infection. Thus, overall survival time is not necessarily shorter than in uninfected cats, and quality of life is usually high over many years or lifelong. VIRAL INFECTION - FELV FeLV, an oncornavirus, is more pathogenic than FIV. Historically, it was considered to account for more disease-related deaths and clinical syndromes in cats than any other infectious agent. Recently, the prevalence and importance of FeLV have been decreasing, mainly because of testing and eradication programmes and the use of FeLV vaccines. Progressive FeLV infection can cause tumours, bone marrow suppression and immunosuppression, as well as neurological and other disorders, and leads to a decrease in life expectancy. However, with appropriate care, many FeLV-infected cats can also live several years with a good quality of life. PRACTICAL RELEVANCE A decision regarding treatment or euthanasia should never be based solely on the presence or absence of a retrovirus infection. Antiviral chemotherapy is of increasing interest in veterinary medicine, but is still not used commonly. EVIDENCE BASE This article reviews the current literature on antiviral chemotherapy in retrovirus-infected cats, focusing on drugs that are currently available on the market and, thus, could potentially be used in cats.","Hartmann, Katrin",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x15610676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26486979/,242

Materials and Methods: The CRITISCH Registry is a prospective, national, interdisciplinary, multicenter registry evaluating the current practice of all available treatment options in 1200 consecutive CLTI patients. For the purposes of this analysis, only the 337 patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD treated by either BG (n=86; median 78 years, 48 men) or EVT (n=251; median age 80 years, 135 men) were analyzed. The primary composite outcome was amputation-free survival (AFS); secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and amputation-free time (AFT). All outcomes were evaluated in Cox proportional hazards models; the results are reported as the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly greater hazard of amputation or death after BG (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.03, p=0.028). The models for AFT and overall survival also suggested a higher hazard for BG, but the differences were not significant (AFT: HR 1.66, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.53, p=0.188; OS: HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.47, p=0.348). The absence of runoff vessels (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.60, p=0.008) was associated with a decreased AFS. The likelihood of amputation was higher in male patients (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 4.45, p=0.027) and was associated with a lack of runoff vessels (HR 1.95, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.95, p=0.065) and myocardial infarction (HR 3.74, 95% CI 1.23 to 11.35, p=0.020).

Conclusion: This analysis suggested that BG was associated with poorer AFS than EVT in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and CLTI.

In December 2006, we established passive hospital-based surveillance to identify the causes of acute undifferentiated fever in patients seeking healthcare. Fever was defined as tympanic membrane temperature >38 degrees C. From December 2006 to December 2008, 4233 patients were screened for influenza virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Of these patients, 1151 (27.2%) were positive for influenza. Cough (68.8% vs. 50.5%, P < 0.0001) and sore throat (55.0% vs. 41.9%, P < 0.0001) were more often associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza-infected patients compared to influenza-negative enrollees. A clear influenza season was evident between July and December with a peak during the rainy season. Influenza A and B viruses were identified in 768 (66.3%) and 388 (33.7%) of the influenza-positive population (n = 1153), respectively. In December 2008, passive surveillance identified infection of the avian influenza virus H5N1 in a 19-year-old farmer from Kandal province who subsequently recovered. From a subset of diagnostic samples submitted in 2007, 15 A(H1N1), seven A(H3N2) and seven B viruses were isolated. The predominant subtype tested was influenza A(H1N1), with the majority antigenically related to the A/Solomon Island/03/2006 vaccine strain. The influenza A(H3N2) isolates and influenza B viruses analysed were closely related to A/Brisbane/10/2007 or B/Ohio/01/2005 (B/Victoria/2/87-lineage) vaccine strains, respectively.

Method: An online survey of speech therapists in Hong Kong was conducted between February and March in 2020. The survey comprised up to 15 questions to assess participants' demographics, existing service delivery in telepractice, perception, and their training and knowledge on telepractice. Results: One hundred thirty-five speech (n = 135) speech language pathologists responded to the survey. About one-third (34.8%; n = 47) of participants reported having provided services through telepractice, whereas 72.3% of them started in <3 months and half of them considered it was less effective than face-to-face service. Among the other participants (n = 88), 83% of them indicated that unsuitable patient type and age as the main reason for not providing telepractice. The majority of participants had no prior training for delivering telepractice, and focused on technology when asked about their desired training. Knowledge of participants on telepractice was found only to align fairly with international guidelines. Discussions: The survey findings suggested that telepractice provision in Hong Kong was different from that of other countries where telepractice has been well established, due to the accelerated emergence by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The study showed how the development of telepractice would be like in a short time frame, and findings on perception and desired training could be a reference for a better establishment of this model of service.","Fong, Raymond; Tsai, Chun Fung; Yiu, Oi Yan",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0223; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667859/,242

Among other vulnerabilities, incarcerated populations often have high rates of mental disorders and substance use disorders, which may increase risks for morbidity and mortality during a pandemic. California's San Quentin State Prison (SQSP) experienced multiple outbreaks during the 1918 influenza pandemic, and, a century later, the prison faces a new pandemic. This Open Forum describes the modification of mental health services in SQSP during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This method achieves plasmid transfer via the application of an external electrical field, which both generates a transient increase in the permeability of cell plasma membranes, and promotes the incorporation of DNA plasmids by electrophoretic transfer through the permeabilized membranes. Here we describe a method for the preparation, injection, and electroporation of DNA plasmids into neonatal mouse retinal tissue. This method can be utilized to perform gain of function or loss of function studies in the mouse.

91954,Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMS) in Cardiovascular Disease.,2021-08-09,"The Salt Overly Sensitive (SOS) pathway regulates intracellular sodium ion homeostasis as a salt-stress response in plants. This pathway involves three main genes designated as SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3, which are members of the Na+ /H+ exchanger (NHX), CBL-interacting protein kinase (CIPK), and Calcineurin B-like (CBL) gene families, respectively. To identify and characterize SOS genes in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a species of the Amaranthaceae family, we conducted genome-wide identification and phylogenetic analyses of NHX, CIPK, and CBL genes from four Amaranthaceae species, Arabidopsis, and rice. Most Amaranthaceae genes exhibited orthologous relationships with Arabidopsis and/or rice, except a clade of Vac-type Amaranthaceae NHX genes. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed gene gain/loss events in Amaranthaceae species and the intron-less to intron-rich evolution of CIPK genes. A bacterial protein-rooted CIPK tree allowed naming most of the phylogenetic clades based on their evolutionary history. Single S. oleracea (So) SOS1, SOS2, and SOS3 proteins were identified. Direct protein-protein interaction was observed between SoSOS2 and SoSOS3 but not between SoSOS2 and SoSOS1 based on yeast two-hybrid assay. This may suggest distinct modes of action of spinach SOS proteins compared to Arabidopsis SOS proteins. Unlike SoSOS1 and SoSOS2, which were expressed at similar or higher levels in leaves than roots, SoSOS3 expression was significantly higher in roots than leaves, suggesting its greater importance in roots. The expression of SoSOS3 was upregulated in both roots and leaves under salinity compared to the control; however, SoSOS1 was only upregulated in roots. Thus, this study demonstrated the conservation of SOS pathway genes in spinach and also highlighted the complexity of SOS signaling in Amaranthaceae species. This article is protected by copyright.

This study assessed if circulating EPCs can predict long-term improvement of global left ventricular systolic function in patients with coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS In this single-center, prospective, observational study, 115 consecutive patients with CTOs were evaluated by standard transthoracic echocardiography (ECHO) before and 9-12 months after PCI. Numbers of circulating putative EPCs were determined by flow cytometry analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood samples drawn before and 72 h after PCI. RESULTS At mean 11.3 ± 2.5 months post vs. before PCI (all P < .05): by SAQ-7 summary scores, angina frequency, physical limitation and quality of life scores were greater; by ECHO, LVEDd decreased and LVEF increased, which were more significant in patients with Rentrop grades 2/3 vs. 0/1. At 72 h post vs. before PCI, CD34+VEGFR-2+CD133- (0.82 ± 0.32 × 106/L vs. 1.00 ± 0.39 × 106/L, P = .003), CD34+VEGFR-2+CD133+ (0.24 ± 0.12 × 106/L vs. 0.27 ± 0.14 × 106/L, P = .028), and CD14+Tie2+VEGFR-2+ (6.60 ± 3.32 × 106/L vs. 7.82 ± 3.91 × 106/L, P = .006) cell numbers were lower. The baseline levels of CD34+VEGFR-2+cells (P = .001) and CD14+Tie2+VEGFR-2+cells (P < .001) were association with the grade of collateralization. In addition, the baseline and peri-procedural decrease of circulating CD34+VEGFR-2+ cells correlated with the increase of LVEF (P < .001, P < .001, respectively) and the decrease of LVEDd (P = .022, P = .029, respectively) at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In this small study, the baseline levels of circulating CD34+VEGFR-2+ EPCs and its reduction after successful revascularization of CTOs correlated with long-term improvement in global LV systolic function.","Dai, Yuxiang; Huang, Jia; Chen, Yinyin; Chang, Shufu; Li, Chenguang; Lu, Hao; Ren, Daoyuan; Zhang, Feng; Huang, Zheyong; Qian, Juying; Ge, Lei; Ge, Junbo",International journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2020.08.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810548/,242
93064,Serum-soluble ST2 as a novel biomarker reflecting inflammatory status and illness severity in patients with COVID-19.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND The use of process evaluations is a growing area of interest in research groups working on complex interventions. This methodology tries to understand how the intervention was implemented to inform policy and practice. A recent systematic review by Liu et al. on process evaluations of complex interventions addressing non-communicable diseases found few studies in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) because it was restricted to randomized controlled trials, primary healthcare level and non-communicable diseases. Yet, LMICs face different barriers to implement interventions in comparison to high-income countries such as limited human resources, access to health care and skills of health workers to treat chronic conditions especially at primary health care level. Therefore, understanding the challenges of interventions for non-communicable diseases and neglected tropical diseases (diseases that affect poor populations and have chronic sequelae) will be important to improve how process evaluation is designed, conducted and used in research projects in LMICs. For these reasons, in comparison to the study of Liu et al., the current study will expand the search strategy to include different study designs, languages and settings. OBJECTIVE Map research using process evaluation in the areas of non-communicable diseases and neglected tropical diseases to inform the gaps in the design and conduct of this type of research in LMICs. METHODS Scoping review of process evaluation studies of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs of complex interventions implemented in LMICs including participants with non-communicable diseases or neglected tropical diseases and their health care providers (physicians, nurses, technicians and others) related to achieve better health for all through reforms in universal coverage, public policy, service delivery and leadership. The aspects that will be evaluated are as follows: (i) available evidence of process evaluation in the areas of non-communicable diseases and neglected tropical diseases such as frameworks and theories, (ii) methods applied to conduct process evaluations and (iii) gaps between the design of the intervention and its implementation that were identified through the process evaluation. Studies published from January 2008. Exclusion criteria are as follows: not peer reviewed articles, not a report based on empirical research, not reported in English or Spanish or Portuguese or French, reviews and non-human research. DISCUSSION This scoping review will map the evidence of process evaluations conducted in LMICs. It will also identify the methods they used to collect and interpret data, how different theories and frameworks were used and lessons from the implementation of complex interventions. This information will allow researchers to conduct better process evaluations considering special characteristics from countries with limited human resources, scarce data available and limited access to health care.","Lazo-Porras, María; Liu, Hueiming; Miranda, J Jaime; Moore, Graham; Burri, Mafalda; Chappuis, François; Perel, Pablo; Beran, David",Systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-021-01801-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34488877/,242

We therefore systematically investigated what has been published on the use of PET/MRI compared to PET/CT in the imaging of cancers outside the brain, focusing on clinical areas of application related to diagnosis, staging and restaging. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of simultaneous PET/MRI in cancer patients were chosen. RESULTS A total of 3,138 publications were identified and 116 published during the period 2012-2018 were included and were grouped according to the major cancer forms: 13 head and neck (HNC), 9 breast (BC), 21 prostate (PC), 14 gynaecological, 13 gastrointestinal (GIC), and 46 various cancers. Data from studies comparing PET/MRI and PET/CT for staging/restaging suggested the superiority of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for the detection of tumour extension and retropharyngeal lymph node metastases in nasopharyngeal cancer, and for the detection of liver metastases and possibly bone marrow metastases in high-risk BC. FDG PET/MRI tended to be inferior for the detection of lung metastases in HNC and BC. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI was superior to PET/CT for the detection of local PC recurrence. FDG PET/MRI was superior to FDG PET/CT for the detection of local tumour invasion in cervical cancer and had higher accuracy for the detection of liver metastases in colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION The scoping review methodology resulted in the identification of a huge number of records, of which less than 5% were suitable for inclusion and only a limited number allowed conclusions on the advantages/disadvantages of PET/MRI compared to PET/CT in the oncological setting. There was evidence to support the use of FDG PET/MRI in staging of nasopharyngeal cancer and high-risk BC. Preliminary data indicate the superiority of PET/MRI for the detection of local recurrence in PC, local tumour invasion in cervical cancer, and liver metastases in colorectal cancer. These conclusions are based on small datasets and need to be further explored.","Morsing, Anni; Hildebrandt, Malene Grubbe; Vilstrup, Mie Holm; Wallenius, Sara Elisabeth; Gerke, Oke; Petersen, Henrik; Johansen, Allan; Andersen, Thomas Lund; Høilund-Carlsen, Poul Flemming",European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00259-019-04402-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31267161/,242

This paper explores issues recruiting a representative resident cohort, as background to a study of residents, to acquire sociodemographic, health and disability data and trial an intervention designed to improve outcomes. METHODS We planned approaching all Auckland/Waitematā District villages and, via managers, contacting residents ('letter-drop'; 'door-knocks'). In 'small' villages (n ≤ 60 units), we planned contacting all residents, randomly selecting in 'larger' villages. We excluded those with doubtful or absent legal capacity. RESULTS We approached managers of 53 of 65 villages. Thirty-four permitted recruitment. Some prohibited 'letter-drops' and/or 'door-knocks'. Hence, we recruited volunteers (23 villages) via meetings, posters, newsletters and word-of-mouth, that is representative sampling obtained from 11/34 villages. We recruited 578 residents (median age = 82 years; 420 = female; 217:361 sampled:volunteers), finding differences in baseline parameters of sampled vs. volunteers. CONCLUSION Due to organisational/managers' policy, and national legislation restrictions, our sample does not represent our intended population well.

METHODS This retrospective study included 41 patients who had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus and undergone a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. They were divided into two groups based on their hemoglobin A1c level (group 1: hemoglobin A1c <6.0% and group 2: hemoglobin A1c ≥6.0%). All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination. The central macular thickness and central, nasal, and temporal choroidal thickness were measured using optical coherence tomography. RESULTS Of the 3,016 pregnant women screened, 7.5% (n=228) were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus during the study period and 41 of these patients were included in the study. Group 1 comprised 48 eyes from 24 patients and Group 2 consisted of 34 eyes of 17 patients. The average body mass index values were 30.8 ± 3.3 and 35.1 ± 9.0, respectively (p=0.002).

97563,Impact of body mass index on outcomes of laparoscopic adrenal surgery.,2011,"BACKGROUND Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy was first introduced in Mongolia in 1994, the benefits of the laparoscopic approach have been largely unavailable to the majority of the population. The burden of gallbladder disease in Mongolia is significant. Despite the barriers to expanding laparoscopic surgery in Mongolia (lack of physical resources and adequate training opportunities, a difficult political situation, and an austere environment), the Health Sciences University of Mongolia (HSUM) began looking for ways to further the development of laparoscopy for the entire country, including the rural areas where half the population resides. METHODS Combined didactic and practical training courses lasting 2 weeks were developed collaboratively by a private nongovernmental organization and HSUM. The courses were taught at tertiary care centers in the capital city (Ulaanbaatar) and in a smaller, rural city (Erdenet), the regional northern referral center. Demographic data, preoperative diagnosis, ultrasound and operative findings, operative times, length of hospital stay, and intraoperative and postoperative complication rates were compared from 2007-2008 from hospitals in Ulaanbaatar and Erdenet. RESULTS A total of 36 surgeons participated in the training classes, and a total of 410 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed. Ultrasound was used as a diagnostic tool in all cases. There was no significant difference in intraoperative or postoperative complications between hospitals in the capital, where the procedures were performed by skilled laparoscopic surgeons, and in Erdenet, where the training courses first introduced laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Neither were there differences in complication rates between cases during the teaching and nonteaching periods. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be expanded safely to the regional diagnostic referral centers in rural Mongolia through short-term training courses as a method to markedly improve access and outcomes for the 50% of the country previously denied the benefits of minimally invasive surgery.","Straub, Catherine M; Price, Raymond R; Matthews, Douglas; Handrahan, Diana L; Sergelen, Davaatseren",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-0965-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21293962/,242
97899,The role of biomarkers in diagnosis of COVID-19 - A systematic review.,2020-05-13,"Please see the Author Video associated with this article. Background: A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) has recently been described. Objective: To evaluate imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. Subjects and Methods: Imaging studies and medical records of sixteen patients (0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, peritoneum, as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third, senior radiologist. Results: Sixteen patients were included (10 male and 6 female; 20 months - 20 years). All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included: vomiting (12; 75%), abdominal pain (11; 69%), rash (10;62.5%), conjunctivitis (8;50%), diarrhea (7;44%), headache (6;37.5%), and sore throat (5;31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly (10; 62.5%), congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema (9; 56%), atelectasis (9; 56%), pleural effusions (7; 44%), adult respiratory distress syndrome (2; 12.5%) and pneumonia (1; 6%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 69-100%. Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for PE (6 [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and 2 [25%] by ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy). In 2 (25%), CTA demonstrated a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (US and CT) included small volume ascites (6; 38%), hepatomegaly (6; 38%), echogenic kidneys (5; 31%), bowel wall thickening (3; 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3; 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2; 13%), splenomegaly (1; 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1; 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were: cardiomegaly (12; 75%), pleural effusion (10; 63%) and atelectasis (10; 63%). 15 patients (94%) were discharged home (length of hospital stay 3-20 days). There were no mortalities. Conclusion: MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, though also solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process. Clinical Impact: The constellation of imaging findings in the setting of COVID-19 may alert pediatric radiologists to the diagnosis of MIS-C prior to rapid deterioration of patients.","Blumfield, Einat; Levin, Terry L; Kurian, Jessica; Lee, Edward Y; Liszewski, Mark C",AJR.

98413,Risk factors for vaginal mesh erosion after sacrocolpopexy in Korean women.,2020,"Coronavirus (CoV) transcription includes a discontinuous mechanism during the synthesis of sub-genome-length minus-strand RNAs leading to a collection of mRNAs in which the 5' terminal leader sequence is fused to contiguous genome sequences. It has been previously shown that transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) preceding each gene regulate transcription. Base pairing between the leader TRS (TRS-L) and the complement of the body TRS (cTRS-B) in the nascent RNA is a determinant factor during CoV transcription. In fact, in transmissible gastroenteritis CoV, a good correlation has been observed between subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) levels and the free energy (DeltaG) of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex formation. The only exception was sg mRNA N, the most abundant sg mRNA during viral infection in spite of its minimum DeltaG associated with duplex formation. We postulated that additional factors should regulate transcription of sg mRNA N. In this report, we have described a novel transcription regulation mechanism operating in CoV by which a 9-nucleotide (nt) sequence located 449 nt upstream of the N gene TRS core sequence (CS-N) interacts with a complementary sequence just upstream of CS-N, specifically increasing the accumulation of sg mRNA N. Alteration of this complementarity in mutant replicon genomes showed a correlation between the predicted stability of the base pairing between 9-nt sequences and the accumulation of sg mRNA N. This interaction is exclusively conserved in group 1a CoVs, the only CoV subgroup in which the N gene is not the most 3' gene in the viral genome. This is the first time that a long-distance RNA-RNA interaction regulating transcriptional activity specifically enhancing the transcription of one gene has been described to occur in CoVs.","Moreno, José L; Zúñiga, Sonia; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02622-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18272586/,242

This retrospective study performed at a tertiary teaching hospital was aimed to evaluate the effects of a physician-pharmacist joint clinic for cancer pain management. The study was performed between December 2016 and August 2019 and included 113 outpatients with moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Patients were divided into two groups according to the clinic each patient visited: the physician-pharmacist joint clinic (joint group, n=59) or physician-only clinic (usual group, n=54). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Morisky Medication Adherence Measure (MMAM) were used to collect data on pain intensity, interference, and medication adherence. Pain Management Index (PMI) was also calculated. BPI, MMAM, and PMI were assessed at baseline (patients' first visit, week 0) and week-4 follow-up. The Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess patients' Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at week 4. The primary outcomes were the improvement in pain intensity, adequacy of pain management, and medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the improvement in HRQoL. At week 4, compared to the usual group, the BPI pain intensity categories except the pain right now were significantly lower in the joint group: worst pain, 4 (3 - 7) versus 6 (4 - 8), P = 0.020; least pain, 1 (0 - 2) versus 2 (1 - 3), P = 0.010; average pain, 3 (2 - 4) versus 4 (2 - 5), P = 0.023; pain right now, 2 (1 - 3) versus 2 (0 - 4), P = 0.796. For the seven pain interference categories, there were no significant improvements in the joint group (P > 0.05). Significantly more patients achieved adequate pain control in the joint group than the usual group ((P = 0.002).

Accordingly, we evaluated their use in elderly hemodialysis patients with no other venous access options. METHODS A total of 70 elderly patients with iliac vein TCCs undergoing chronic hemodialysis were included in this study. Patients' baseline anthropometric and laboratory parameters were measured. Incidence of catheter dysfunction and of catheter-related infection was documented. RESULTS During the study period, a total of 99 new tunneled dialysis catheters were placed. Technical success rate was 100 %. Median infection-free survival and dysfunction-free survival after catheterization was 617 and 875 catheter days, respectively. Mean survival time per catheter was 1067 catheter days, corresponding to a total observation period of 65369 catheters days. CONCLUSIONS Iliac TCC is both technically feasible and effective for hemodialysis in elderly patients with no other venous access options.","Wang, Lihua; Wei, Fang; Sun, Guijiang; Chen, Haiyan; Yu, Haibo; Jiang, Aili",Journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-015-0198-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25966800/,242

In the present study, we determined whether porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an emerging veterinary virus, infects Vero cells by attaching to heparan sulfate. Western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and plaque formation assay revealed that PEDV infection was inhibited when the virus was pretreated with heparin (an analogue of heparan sulfate). There was no inhibitory effect when the cells were pre-incubated with heparin. We next demonstrated that enzymatic removal of the highly sulfated domain of heparan sulfate by heparinase I treatment inhibited PEDV infection. We also confirmed that sodium chlorate, which interferes with heparan sulfate biosynthesis, also inhibited PEDV infection. Furthermore, we examined the effect of two heparin derivatives with different types of sulfation on PEDV infection. The data suggested de-N-sulfated heparin, but not N-acetyl-de-O-sulfated heparin, inhibits PEDV infection. In summary, our studies revealed that heparan sulfate acts as the attachment factor of PEDV in Vero cells.","Huan, Chang-chao; Wang, Yue; Ni, Bo; Wang, Rui; Huang, Li; Ren, Xiao-feng; Tong, Guang-zhi; Ding, Chan; Fan, Hong-jie; Mao, Xiang",Archives of virology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2408-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896095/,242

The aim of this study was to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic on dental students in Saudi Arabia. METHODS A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted among dental students from different universities in Saudi Arabia selected using 2-stage cluster sampling. The psychological impact was assessed using the validated Arabic version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Item questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used as appropriate. A chi-squared test was used to compare the proportions between the sociodemographic data and logistic regression analysis to identify variables associated with the student's responses. RESULTS The internal consistency of the scale was excellent (0.954). A total of 697 dental students participated voluntarily in the study; their mean age was 21.76 ± 1.859 years, and 54.7% were female. The majority (96.1%) were single, and 69.4% lived in a household of > 5 persons. Significant differences in mental health outcomes were evident for gender, university, and survey time. Elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were recorded among 60.64%, 37.02%, and 34.92%, respectively, of the students. Females, students who lived alone, and junior students were more likely to experience psychological problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The presence of elevated levels of depression, anxiety and stress among dental students highlights the need for psychological empowerment strategies involving institutional counseling services.","Hakami, Zaki; Khanagar, Sanjeev B; Vishwanathaiah, Satish; Hakami, Abrar; Bokhari, Ahmed M; Jabali, Ahmad H; Alasmari, Dhafer; Aldrees, Abdullah M",Journal of dental education,https://doi.org/10.1002/jdd.12470; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128397/,242
102362,Risk of cardiovascular disease with lipoprotein(a) in familial hypercholesterolemia: a review.,2020,"Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for the efficient replication of rotavirus RRV in MA104 cells. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 decreased the yield of infectious virus under conditions where it severely reduces the synthesis of not only viral but also cellular proteins. Addition of nonessential amino acids to the cell medium restored both viral protein synthesis and cellular protein synthesis, but the production of progeny viruses was still inhibited. In medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, we showed that MG132 does not affect rotavirus entry but inhibits the replication of the viral genome. It was also shown that it prevents the efficient incorporation into viroplasms of viral polymerase VP1 and the capsid proteins VP2 and VP6, which could explain the inhibitory effect of MG132 on genome replication and infectious virus yield. We also showed that ubiquitination is relevant for rotavirus replication since the yield of rotavirus progeny in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive mutation in the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme was reduced at the restrictive temperature. In addition, overexpression of ubiquitin in MG132-treated MA104 cells partially reversed the effect of the inhibitor on virus yield. Altogether, these data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasome (UP) system has a very complex interaction with the rotavirus life cycle, with both the ubiquitination and proteolytic activities of the system being relevant for virus replication.","López, Tomás; Silva-Ayala, Daniela; López, Susana; Arias, Carlos F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05286-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21900156/,242

104067,Cardiology and COVID: a bidirectional association!,2021,"Viruses maximize their genetic coding capacity through a variety of biochemical mechanisms including programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF), which facilitates the production of multiple proteins from a single mRNA transcript. PRF is typically stimulated by structural elements within the mRNA that generate mechanical tension between the transcript and ribosome. However, in this work we show that the forces generated by the cotranslational folding of the nascent polypeptide chain can also enhance PRF. Using an array of biochemical, cellular, and computational techniques, we first demonstrate that the Sindbis virus structural polyprotein forms two competing topological isomers during its biosynthesis at the ribosome-translocon complex. We then show that the formation of one of these topological isomers is linked to PRF. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the translocon-mediated membrane integration of a transmembrane domain upstream from the ribosomal slip-site generates a force on the nascent polypeptide chain that scales with observed frameshifting. Together, our results indicate that cotranslational folding of this viral protein generates a tension that stimulates PRF. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first example in which the conformational state of the nascent polypeptide chain has been linked to PRF. These findings raise the possibility that, in addition to RNA-mediated translational recoding, a variety of cotranslational folding or binding events may also stimulate PRF.","Harrington, Haley R; Zimmer, Matthew H; Chamness, Laura M; Nash, Veronica; Penn, Wesley D; Miller, Thomas F; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana; Schlebach, Jonathan Patrick",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.012706; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32169904/,242

Little is known about the use of palliative care services in intensive care unit (ICU) settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission, between 7 March and 14 April 2020 to two academic teaching hospitals in New York City. Palliative care consultation included a one-time telemedicine consultation or continued telemedicine consultation and follow-up with multidisciplinary team involvement. Patient information was collected from the electronic health record and analyses were conducted with Stata V.15.1 (StataCorp) statistical software. RESULTS A total of 151 critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring ICU admission were identified, of whom 59 (39.07%) received an inpatient palliative care consultation. More than half of patients died (n=85/151, 56.29%), with 57.65% (n=49/85) of these patients receiving palliative care services during their hospitalisation. Patients who received palliative care consultation were more likely to be older, sicker and receive mechanical ventilation than their counterparts. Patients who died and did not receive palliative care were younger and required non-invasive ventilation support. CONCLUSION There is a lack of utilisation of palliative care in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Further research into predictors of poor outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients may help identify patients that would benefit from early palliative care involvement going forward.","Sheehan, Jacqueline; Ho, Kam Sing; Poon, Joseph; Sarosky, Kimberly; Fung, Jennifer Y",BMJ supportive & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268477/,242
106017,Reversal agents: do we need to administer with neuromuscular monitoring - an observational study.,2018,"INTRODUCTION The outbreak of COVID-19 led to lockdown, which in turn led to the closure of schools and colleges. This situation created an opportunity to transform the conventional learning methods into an online or virtual method using various digital platforms. Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences started online classes as an alternative way to resume education during this pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to identify the prevalence of medical science students with a positive attitude towards online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic in a medical college of Kathmandu, Nepal. METHODS The study was conducted among 513 students using descriptive cross-sectional study design who were currently studying Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, Proficiency Certificate Level Nursing, Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and Bachelor of Nursing Science under the Nepalese Army Institute of Health Sciences. Data was collected from June-July 2020 through an online self-administered questionnaire using Google forms. The results were presented through frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation. RESULTS In this study, 112 (87.5%) Bachelor of Science in Nursing, 189 (83.6%) Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery, and 63 (82.9%) Bachelor of Science in Nursing students had a positive attitude towards online classes, while 51 (61.5%) of Proficiency Certificate Level Nursing students had a negative attitude towards it. CONCLUSIONS Most bachelor-level students had a positive attitude towards online classes. With a positive attitude, students' participation and adaptability in online classes will be high, resulting in better academic performance.","Chalise, Gita Dhakal; Bharati, Mamata; Bajracharya, Jayendra; Kc, Ambu; Pradhan, Subhadra; Adhikari, Bibhav; Shrestha, Manoranjan",JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.31729/jnma.5413; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34506469/,242

The present review examines the evidence supporting the use of NPPV in acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to different conditions. Strong evidence supports the use of NPPV for ARF to prevent endotracheal intubation (ETI), as well as to facilitate extubation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to avoid ETI in acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, and in immunocompromised patients. Weaker evidence supports the use of NPPV for patients with ARF due to asthma exacerbations, with post-operative or post-extubation ARF, pneumonia, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or during bronchoscopy. NPPV should be applied under close clinical and physiological monitoring for signs of treatment failure and, in such cases, ETI should be promptly available. A trained team, careful patient selection and optimal choice of devices can optimise outcome of NPPV. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is increasingly being used in the management of acute respiratory failure but caregivers must respect evidence-supported indications and avoid contraidincations. Additionally, the technique must be applied in the appropriate location by a trained team in order to avoid disappointing results.","Ambrosino, N; Vagheggini, G",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00143507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378782/,242

This retrospective study was performed to determine the amount of colonic redundancy that can be expected by SFM. METHODS Retrospective review of medical record for a total of 203 patients who underwent SFM during laparoscopic AR or LAR for the treatment of sigmoid colon or rectal cancer was performed. RESULTS The obtained redundancy of the colon by SFM was 27.81 ± 7.29 cm from the sacral promontory. The redundancy of the colon by SFM with high ligation of the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) (29.54 ± 7.17 cm from the sacral promontory) was greater than that with low ligation of the IMV (24.94 ± 6.07 cm from the sacral promontory, P < 0.0001). It took about 9.82% of the total operation time to perform SFM. There was no intraoperative complication during SFM. CONCLUSIONS SFM during laparoscopic AR or LAR is a safe and feasible option. Based on the result of this study, one can gain about 27.81 cm redundancy of the colon by SFM.","Kye, Bong-Hyeon; Kim, Hyung-Jin; Kim, Hyun-Sil; Kim, Jun-Gi; Cho, Hyeon-Min",International journal of medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.8874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25013364/,242

Despite its ubiquity, a lack of definitive scientific understanding of the etiology, natural history, and biochemistry of seromas remains. We endeavored to create and examine seromas in a rat model in the setting of commonly used biologic implants and to examine the role of quilting sutures/mechanical fixation in mitigating seroma development. METHODS Female Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to either Quilting or Nonquilting groups then subdivided into one of 3 porcine dermal implant groups (Permacol Surgical Implant, Strattice Reconstructive Tissue Matrix, or XCM Biologic Tissue Matrix) or control group. A 5-cm midline back incision was made, the skin reflected and the latissimus dorsi muscle resected bilaterally. Implants were sutured into the surgical bed using a running suture. The skin of nonquilted rats was closed with a running subcuticular suture. Quilted rats underwent placement of absorbable quilting sutures spaced 2 cm apart between the skin and underlying implant or muscle before skin closure. Postoperatively, rats were monitored for seroma formation with fluid aspirated as needed. At 28 or 90 days, rats were euthanized. Seroma and implants were examined grossly and under light microscopy. RESULTS Of nonquilted rats, 42/54 (78%) developed seromas compared with 19/46 (41%) of quilted rats (P < 0.05), defined by bursa cavity present at necropsy. When a biologic implant was present, 28/35 (80%) of nonquilted rats developed seromas compared with 12/33 (36%) of quilted rats (P < 0.05). In the control group, 14/19 (74%) of nonquilted rats developed seromas compared with 7/13 (54%) of quilted rats. This difference was not statistically significant. Bursa presence was confirmed histologically in all cases, with no difference in bursa character seen between groups. CONCLUSIONS This study confirms a reliable rat model of seroma formation, with most of the rats exhibiting at least subclinical seromas. There was no difference in seroma formation rate in the presence of biologic implants, and no differences in bursa character between implants. Mechanical fixation with quilting sutures decreased seroma rate significantly in all subgroups. All rats with seromas at necropsy had histological evidence of a bursa with no difference in appearance between groups.","Hurwitz, Zachary M; Ignotz, Ronald A; Rowin, Craig; Freniere, Brian B; Lalikos, Janice F; Dunn, Raymond M",Annals of plastic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sap.0000000000000085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24401811/,242

While this function is preserved across species, centromeres display an array of dynamic features, including: (1) rapidly evolving DNA; (2) wide evolutionary diversity in size, shape and organization; (3) evidence of mutational processes to generate homogenized repetitive arrays that characterize centromeres in several species; (4) tolerance to changes in position, as in the case of neocentromeres; and (5) intrinsic fragility derived by sequence composition and secondary DNA structures. Centromere drive underlies rapid centromere DNA evolution due to the ""selfish"" pursuit to bias meiotic transmission and promote the propagation of stronger centromeres. Yet, the origins of other dynamic features of centromeres remain unclear. Here, we review our current understanding of centromere evolution and plasticity. We also detail the mutagenic processes proposed to shape the divergent genetic nature of centromeres. Changes to centromeres are not simply evolutionary relics, but ongoing shifts that on one side promote centromere flexibility, but on the other can undermine centromere integrity and function with potential pathological implications such as genome instability.","Balzano, Elisa; Giunta, Simona",Genes,https://doi.org/10.3390/genes11080912; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32784998/,242

Wild-type MeV preferentially infects lymphocytes by using signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM), whose expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, as a receptor. MeV also infects other epithelial and neuronal cells that do not express SLAM and causes pneumonia and diarrhea and, sometimes, serious symptoms such as measles encephalitis and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The discrepancy between the tissue tropism of MeV and the distribution of SLAM-positive cells suggests that there are unknown receptors other than SLAM for MeV. Here we identified CD147/EMMPRIN (extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer), a transmembrane glycoprotein, which acts as a receptor for MeV on epithelial cells. Furthermore, we found the incorporation of cyclophilin B (CypB), a cellular ligand for CD147, in MeV virions, and showed that inhibition of CypB incorporation significantly attenuated SLAM-independent infection on epithelial cells, while it had no effect on SLAM-dependent infection. To date, MeV infection was considered to be triggered by binding of its hemagglutinin (H) protein and cellular receptors. Our present study, however, indicates that MeV infection also occurs via CD147 and virion-associated CypB, independently of MeV H. Since CD147 is expressed in a variety of cells, including epithelial and neuronal cells, this molecule possibly functions as an entry receptor for MeV in SLAM-negative cells. This is the first report among members of the Mononegavirales that CD147 is used as a virus entry receptor via incorporated CypB in the virions.","Watanabe, Akira; Yoneda, Misako; Ikeda, Fusako; Terao-Muto, Yuri; Sato, Hiroki; Kai, Chieko",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02168-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20147391/,242

Such calls have included: two recent Lancet special commissions on impacts of climate change on health; and recognition by senior figures from the WHO and United Nations of relationships between human impacts on the natural world and disease pandemics, with some suggesting prevention of future pandemics may require a radical reassessment of modernity's relationship with the natural world.Among the medical humanities as a whole, however, calls for better and more widespread understandings of the ecological dimensions of health have not always been as prominent, or urgently expressed, as they might be.This paper, which presumes there is an urgent need for better and more widespread understandings of the ecological dimensions of human health, draws on ecological public health and other models to propose an ecological re-visioning of our conceptions of health and medical humanities; and in ways that challenge some contemporary assumptions about health, well-being and the 'good society'. Indeed, once we begin to heed what ecocritic Tim Morton terms 'the ecological thought', we may discover few areas of healthcare and the humanities remain untouched by its implications.With growing recognition that the fate of global human health and the fate of the biosphere are inextricably entwined, the project of a more ecologically dimensioned medical humanities appears both timely and urgent.

Patients with voice disorders may have difficulty with this technology, leading to frustration and reduction in quality of life. This study evaluates the ability of common voice recognition systems to transcribe dysphonic voices. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective evaluation of ""Rainbow Passage"" voice samples from patients with and without voice disorders. METHODS Participants with (n = 30) and without (n = 23) voice disorders were recorded reading the ""Rainbow Passage"". Recordings were played at standardized intensity and distance-to-dictation programs on Apple iPhone 6S™, Apple iPhone 11 Pro™, and Google Voice™. Word recognition scores were calculated as the proportion of correctly transcribed words. Word recognition scores were compared to auditory-perceptual and acoustic measures. RESULTS Mean word recognition scores for participants with and without voice disorders were, respectively, 68.6% and 91.9% for Apple iPhone 6S™ (P < .001), 71.2% and 93.7% for Apple iPhone 11 Pro™ (P < .001), and 68.7% and 93.8% for Google Voice™ (P < .001). There were strong, approximately linear associations between CAPE-V ratings of overall severity of dysphonia and word recognition score, with correlation coefficients (R2 ) of 0.609 (iPhone 6S™), 0.670 (iPhone 11 Pro™), and 0.619 (Google Voice™). These relationships persisted when controlling for diagnosis, age, gender, fundamental frequency, and speech rate (P < .001 for all systems). CONCLUSION Common voice recognition systems function well with nondysphonic voices but are poor at accurately transcribing dysphonic voices. There was a strong negative correlation with word recognition scores and perceptual voice evaluation.

They arise from non-branching sites on the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) and are suspected to originate from a dissection. Our aim is to describe the BBA cases seen in our center and to present a systematic review of the literature on BBAs. We analyzed the eleven cases of BBA admitted to our center from 2003 to 2012. We assessed the medical history, treatment modality (endovascular and/or surgery), complications and clinical outcome. The cohort included 8 women and 4 men with a mean age of 53.16 years. Treatment of the BBA consisted of stenting and coiling in 5 patients, stenting only in 4 patients, coiling and clipping in 1 patient, clipping only in 1 patient, and conservative treatment in 1 patient. A good outcome was found in 10 patients, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) less than or equal to two at three months. A systematic review of the literature was performed, and 314 reported patients were found: 221 patients were treated with a primarily surgical approach, and 87 patients were treated with a primarily endovascular approach. A rescue or second treatment was required in 46 patients (21%). The overall estimated treatment morbidity rate was 17%, and the mortality rate was 15%. BBAs exhibit more aggressive behavior compared to saccular aneurysms, and more intra-operative complications occur with BBAs, independent of the treatment type offered. They are also significantly more likely to relapse and rebleed after treatment. Endovascular treatment offers a lower morbidity-mortality compared with surgical approaches. Multilayer flow-diverting stents appear to be a promising strategy.","Gonzalez, Ana Marcos; Narata, Ana Paula; Yilmaz, Hasan; Bijlenga, Philippe; Radovanovic, Ivan; Schaller, Karl; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Pereira, Vitor Mendes",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2013.09.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24231267/,242

Several toxins have been implicated in disease, including the pore-forming toxins hemolysin BL (HBL) and nonhemolytic enterotoxin (NHE). Recent work revealed that HBL binds to the mammalian surface receptors LITAF and CDIP1 and that both HBL and NHE induce potassium efflux and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to pyroptosis. These mammalian receptors, in part, contribute to inflammation and pathology. Other putative virulence factors of B. cereus include cytotoxin K, cereulide, metalloproteases, sphingomyelinase, and phospholipases.

Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a serious global health emergency and spread from a person to another who has the virus. But the scope of an intermediate host is not known. Population at higher risk includes individuals in higher age group (>60 years) or with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and weaker immune system. Many unknown and underestimate risk factors could be responsible for adverse outcomes in COVID-19. These risk factors should be appropriately identified, addressed and necessary actions should be taken to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Bhopal gas tragedy was one of the world's worst industrial chemical leak disaster. The survivors of this incident still suffer from the various complications such as increased rate of cancers, chronic illness like tuberculosis, respiratory diseases, birth defects, nerve injury, growth retardations, gynecological illness and many more. The survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy are at higher risk of developing COVID-19 related adverse outcome. One of the possible explanations can be long term effect of methyl isocyanate (MIC). MIC exposure can lead to possible toxic effect on genetic, epigenetic and non-genetic factors. In this review, we aim to establish the scientific basis for adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients who are also victims of Bhopal gas tragedy.","Malviya, Anushree; Ahirwar, Ashok Kumar; Chandra Tripathi, Satyendra; Asia, Priyanka; Gopal, Niranjan; Kaim, Kirti",Hormone molecular biology and clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1515/hmbci-2020-0070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600673/,242

Occasionally, elevated CBF is also evident on the contralateral side, but this phenomenon is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE To analyze retrospectively the relationship between a contralateral CBF increase and several clinical and radiologic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients with unilateral cervical carotid stenosis treated by carotid artery stenting (CAS). Using 123I-iodamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); we compared pre- and postoperative hemispheric CBF on both sides. We investigated the influence of the following five factors on the increase of the contralateral hemispheric CBF: stenosis grade (≥50% or <50%, according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial criteria); age; the presence of anterior and posterior communicating arteries; postoperative hyperperfusion on the stenotic side; and the presence of cerebral steal phenomenon during preoperative acetazolamide-challenge SPECT. RESULTS Following unilateral CAS, mean hemispheric CBF increased significantly on both sides: from 33.4±5.6 (mean ± SD) to 38.7±7.8 mL/min on the operated side (paired t test, p<0.001) and f35.4±5.4 to 39.2±7.2 mL/min on the contralateral side (p<0.001). In a general linear model, stenosis grade (≥50%) alone was significantly correlated with the increase of the CBF on the contralateral side (p=0.03). CONCLUSION Revascularization by CAS for unilateral carotid stenosis can increase hemispheric CBF on both sides. Increase of the contralateral CBF is correlated with stenosis grade (≥50%).","Sadato, Akiyo; Maeda, Shingo; Hayakawa, Motoharu; Adachi, Kazuhide; Toyama, Hiroshi; Nakahara, Ichiro; Hirose, Yuichi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701298/,242

Furthermore, brief overview of its pharmacology, drug interactions, use in pregnancy and lactation has been discussed. Despite of its common adverse effects like nephrotoxicity and hypertension, cyclosporine offers good safety profile when used in skin diseases. Decision to start cyclosporine therapy is individualized and it should be based on analysis of risk versus benefit.

In many critically ill patients afflicted with COVID-19, treatment often involves prolonged periods of proning that, along with other interventions, can lead to improved oxygenation. However, sustaining this position predisposed patients to increased complications. We present a case of an older patient with respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 who developed rapidly forming facial and knee wounds and a brachial plexus injury from proning. The pressure injuries were unresponsive to standard wound care treatments and resulted in full-thickness wounds. During outpatient posthospital follow-up, a facial eschar was debrided, and weakness of the left shoulder and arm secondary to a brachial plexus injury was identified. This case highlights various complications associated with prolonged proning and the importance of close attention to follow-up by both inpatient and outpatient providers.","Ayala, Kelly; Redding, Jill; Lynch, Whitney; MacKinney, Theodore",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000654; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34636344/,242

In this study, we explored the spectrum of causes of fever in African children. METHODS We recruited children younger than 10 years of age with a temperature of 38°C or higher at two outpatient clinics--one rural and one urban--in Tanzania. Medical histories were obtained and clinical examinations conducted by means of systematic procedures. Blood and nasopharyngeal specimens were collected to perform rapid diagnostic tests, serologic tests, culture, and molecular tests for potential pathogens causing acute fever. Final diagnoses were determined with the use of algorithms and a set of prespecified criteria. RESULTS Analyses of data derived from clinical presentation and from 25,743 laboratory investigations yielded 1232 diagnoses. Of 1005 children (22.6% of whom had multiple diagnoses), 62.2% had an acute respiratory infection; 5.0% of these infections were radiologically confirmed pneumonia. A systemic bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection other than malaria or typhoid fever was found in 13.3% of children, nasopharyngeal viral infection (without respiratory symptoms or signs) in 11.9%, malaria in 10.5%, gastroenteritis in 10.3%, urinary tract infection in 5.9%, typhoid fever in 3.7%, skin or mucosal infection in 1.5%, and meningitis in 0.2%. The cause of fever was undetermined in 3.2% of the children. A total of 70.5% of the children had viral disease, 22.0% had bacterial disease, and 10.9% had parasitic disease.

Limited data exist on its use in immediate breast reconstruction. We present our experience of day-case management of mastectomy with immediate pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction (IBR). METHODS Data were collected on 47 patients who underwent day-case skin-sparing (SSM) or nipple-sparing (NSM) mastectomy with pre-pectoral IBR between October 2017 and September 2019. Clinicopathological data were collected, including postoperative complications, re-admission and re-operation. The data were compared to published national standards. RESULTS Median age was 52 years (range 37-74). Thirty-two patients (68%) had an SSM and 15 (32%) had an NSM. Two patients (4%) had risk-reducing mastectomies and 45 had treatment for invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Mean tumour size was 33.3mm (range 7-85mm). Forty-two (89%) patients went home on the day of surgery. No patients required re-operation in the first 48 hours. The median postoperative follow-up time was 11.4 months (range 1.8-22.7 months). During the first 90-day postoperative period, eight patients (17%) developed superficial skin necrosis, five patients (10.6%) developed postoperative infections and five patients (10.6%) suffered an implant loss. Eight patients (17%) were readmitted for re-operation. Compared to UK national standards set in the iBRA study, our cohort has demonstrated comparable postoperative infection, implant loss and re-operation and re-admission rates. CONCLUSION We have demonstrated close to 90% day-case success rate for mastectomy with IBR. These early data suggest that immediate IBR can be carried out in a manner that is cost-efficient without impacting surgical outcomes.","Shaker, H; Leena, Nar; Mayers, V; Koussa, F; Deshpande, A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2020.7152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34058121/,242

However, robot-assisted approach for sleeve gastrectomy is increasing in number among bariatric surgeons. The aim of our study is to compare perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted (RA-LSG) and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). METHODS Between June 2008 and December 2014, 647 patients underwent LSG and RA-LSG at our institution. A retrospective review was performed for 379 LSG and 268 R-LSG patients, noting the outcomes and complications of the procedure. RESULTS The first 100 LSG and RA-LSG cases were separated to reflect the influence of learning curve. Mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was longer in RA-LSG patients at 1.3 ± 0.6 days (range, 1-4), while it was 1.1 ± 0.3 days (range, 1-2) in LSG patients. Thirty-day readmission rate was similar in both groups, 5.0 % in LSG and 6.0 % in RA-LSG group. One mortality (1.0 %) occurred in the RA-LSG group. In patients after 100 cases, mean LOS was still longer in RA-LSG patients at 1.7 ± 1.8 days (range, 1-21), while it was 1.2 ± 0.5 days (range, 1-5) LSG patients. Thirty-day readmission rate and 30-day reoperation rate did not show a significant difference between the two groups. Overall leak rate was 3.2 % (n = 9) in LSG group, and 1.9 % (n = 5) in RA-LSG group, and the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed similar 30-day readmission and reoperation rate between LSG and RA-LSG during the learning curve and after the proficiency has been achieved.","Moon, Rena C; Stephenson, Derek; Royall, Nelson A; Teixeira, Andre F; Jawad, Muhammad A",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-016-2131-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992896/,242

127599,Hematologic parameters in patients with COVID-19 infection.,2020-03-04,"Alkyl and alkoxy phenols are desirable products from the catalytic depolymerisation of lignin. In this work, ex-situ catalytic pyrolysis of Etek lignin in presence of Na, Ce, NiCe, MgCe, Fe and FePd on ZrO2 was studied. The largest combined yield of monomeric phenolics and alkylphenols was produced by Na/ZrO2 catalysts. A parametric study of the most promising Na/ZrO2 then resulted in using a catalyst:lignin ratio of 3:1 at 500 °C as the best option, enhancing at 17.5 wt% the recovery of total phenolics including 6 wt% alkyl phenols, which is equivalent to 27.8 wt% and 9.5 wt% of the starting lignin in Etek lignin waste. The study of the catalyst basicity indicates that the mild basicity of Na/ZrO2 was mostly responsible for the enhanced mono phenols recovery. Due to formation of thermally stable Na2CO3 during pyrolysis, successful Na/ZrO2 regeneration requires temperature of 900 °C or higher.","Hendry, Abbie; Åhlén, Michelle; Fernandes, Tony; Cheung, Ocean; Sanna, Aimaro",Bioresource technology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.124008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818909/,242

129162,Increased ACE2 Levels and Mortality Risk of Patients With COVID-19 on Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy.,2021-05-27,"Background Therapeutic pneumoperitoneum (TP) is one alternative to manage pleural space problems. We describe our technique and experience. Materials and Methods Medical records of all patients who underwent TP from January 1, 2007, to January 1, 2015, were reviewed after Institutional Review Board approval. We report indication, preprocedure pulmonary function tests, volume of insufflated air, time to chest tube removal, and complications. We place a red rubber catheter into the peritoneal space through the diaphragm or a small abdominal incision, insufflate with room air, record volume (liters), intraperitoneal pressure (goal 9-10 mm Hg), and monitor vital signs, airway pressures, and urine output. Results We performed TP in 32 patients. Follow-up was available for 31 patients. Indications were prevention of pleural space problems in bilobectomy patients (n = 11), following decortication for empyema (n = 11), prevention of prolonged air leak (n = 3), prevention of postresection space (n = 4), and spontaneous chylothorax (n = 2). TP was done postoperatively in three patients. Median air volume used was 3.5 L (3-6 L). Time to chest tube removal overall was 7.8 days (3-20 days) and to discharge 10.2 days (4-32 days). No patient developed respiratory failure, renal failure, or required evacuation of TP. Conclusion TP is a simple, safe, and effective technique to manage pleural space problems. Proper patient selection and meticulous technique are imperative for the successful clinical application of TP. We believe that TP is an underutilized tool for the management of pleural space problems and merits wider application in thoracic surgical practice.","Podgaetz, Eitan; Berger, Jonathan; Small, Joe; Garza, Rafael; Andrade, Rafael",The Thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0035-1571140; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26757212/,242

In polyomavirus central nervous system infection, brain CXCR5hi PD-1hi CD4 T cells produce interleukin-21 (IL-21), and CD8 T cells lacking IL-21 receptors (IL21R-/-) fail to become bTRM IL-21+ CD4 T cells exhibit elevated T cell receptor (TCR) affinity and higher TCR density. IL21R-/- brain CD8 T cells do not express CD103, depend on vascular CD8 T cells for maintenance, are antigen recall defective, and lack TRM core signature genes. CD4 T cell-deficient and IL21R-/- brain CD8 T cells show similar deficiencies in expression of genes for oxidative metabolism, and intrathecal delivery of IL-21 to CD4 T cell-depleted mice restores expression of electron transport genes in CD8 T cells to wild-type levels. Thus, high-affinity CXCR5hi PD-1hi CD4 T cells in the brain produce IL-21, which drives CD8 bTRM differentiation in response to a persistent viral infection.","Ren, Heather M; Kolawole, Elizabeth M; Ren, Mingqiang; Jin, Ge; Netherby-Winslow, Colleen S; Wade, Quinn; Shwetank,; Rahman, Ziaur S M; Evavold, Brian D; Lukacher, Aron E",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abb5590; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948671/,242
129789,Thirty years of mirena: A story of innovation and change in women's healthcare.,2021-02-05,"BACKGROUND Many surgical instruments have been replaced with powered devices in open gastrointestinal and laparoscopic surgery. The production of smoke as a result of vaporization of surgical tissue is inevitable, and exposure to surgical smoke is a long-standing concern. These vapours are potentially hazardous to patients and surgical teams. The present research was designed to compare various surgical devices to determine whether viable cells exist in their surgical smoke. METHODS The search for viable cells in surgical smoke was conducted using both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Various cancers were cauterized with electrocautery, radiofrequency ablation and ultrasonic scalpels, and the resulting surgical smoke was aspirated with Transwell(®) membrane; viable cells were sought in the surgical smoke. In an in vivo experiment, samples of SCC7 were cauterized with an ultrasonic scalpel and the sediment from the rinsed Transwell(®) membrane liquid after centrifugation was injected subcutaneously into the lower back of mice. RESULTS Viable cells were found only in the smoke from ultrasonic scalpels (in all 25 samples taken 5 cm from the cautery; 2 of 25 samples at 10 cm). Viable cells in the surgical smoke from ultrasonic scalpels implanted in mice grew in 16 of 40 injection sites. Histological and biochemical analyses revealed that these cancer cells were identical to the cancer cells cauterized by the ultrasonic scalpel. CONCLUSION Viable tumour cells are produced in the surgical smoke from tumour dissection by ultrasonic scalpel. Surgical relevance Surgical smoke is a byproduct of dissection using a number of powered devices. Hazards to operating room personnel and patients are unclear. This study has shown that use of an ultrasonic dissection device can produce smoke that contains viable tumour cells. Although the model is somewhat artificial, a theoretical risk exists, and measures to evacuate surgical smoke efficiently are important.","In, S M; Park, D-Y; Sohn, I K; Kim, C-H; Lim, H L; Hong, S-A; Jung, D Y; Jeong, S-Y; Han, J H; Kim, H J",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.9910; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331459/,242
130850,Darunavir/cobicistat is associated with negative outcomes in HIV-negative patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.,2021-02-23,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Endovascular therapy with liquid embolic agents is a common treatment strategy for cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of transarterial Onyx as the single embolic agent for curative embolization of noncavernous cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 40 consecutive patients with 41 cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas treated between March 2006 and June 2012 by using transarterial Onyx embolization with intent to cure. The mean age was 57 years; one-third presented with intracranial hemorrhage. Most (85%) had cortical venous drainage. Once angiographic cure was achieved, long-term treatment effectiveness was assessed with DSA and clinical follow-up. RESULTS Forty-nine embolization sessions were performed; 85% of cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas were treated in a single session. The immediate angiographic cure rate was 95%. The permanent neurologic complication rate was 2% (mild facial palsy). Thirty-five of the 38 patients with initial cure underwent short-term follow-up DSA (median, 4 months). The short-term recurrence rate was only 6% (2/35). All patients with occlusion at short-term DSA undergoing long-term DSA (median, 28 months) had durable occlusion. No patient with long-term clinical follow-up (total, 117 patient-years; median, 45 months) experienced hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Transarterial embolization with Onyx as the single embolic agent results in durable long-term cure of noncavernous cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Recurrence rates are low on short-term follow-up, and all patients with angiographic occlusion on short-term DSA follow-up have experienced a durable long-term cure. Thus, angiographic cure should be defined at short-term follow-up angiography instead of at the end of the final embolization session. Finally, long-term DSA follow-up may not be necessary if occlusion is demonstrated on short-term angiographic follow-up.","Chandra, R V; Leslie-Mazwi, T M; Mehta, B P; Yoo, A J; Rabinov, J D; Pryor, J C; Hirsch, J A; Nogueira, R G",AJNR.

To the best of our knowledge, our case is the first in which mesh that had migrated into the esophagogastric junction was removed by a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic procedure, although the cases of 17 patients in which mesh migrated into the stomach after mesh hiatoplasty have previously been reported in the literature.","Oguri, Yohei; Cho, Haruhiko; Yajima, Kazuhito; Oohinata, Ryouki; Iwasaki, Yoshiaki",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29361648/,242
132350,Mean Platelet Volume Predicts Severe COVID-19 Illness.,2021-04-23,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the learning curve for performing extended pelvic lymphadenectomy (ePLND) during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) in patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS In all, 500 patients underwent ePLND for intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer by one surgeon during a 48-month period. A transperitoneal laparoscopic approach was used in all patients to allow adequate access to the internal iliac vessels. The variables chosen as being the most important discriminators of the quality of ePLND were operating time, complication rate and lymph node (LN) yield. The learning curves for ePLND were calculated using the cumulative sum and cumulative average methods and the number of procedures performed until attainment of acceptable failure rates (competence levels) was calculated. LN parameters were compared with the results from the preceding 311 cases where limited PLND was undertaken. RESULTS The median (range) preoperative PSA level was 8.0(1-62.5) ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score was 7(6-10). In all, 64% of patients had intermediate-risk and 36% had high-risk prostate cancer. There were no intraoperative blood transfusions and no conversions to open surgery. The median (range) blood loss was 200(10-1400) mL and the postoperative transfusion rate was 1.6%. The operating time fell at a steady rate of 2.7% after the 15th case and plateaued after 130 patients. At competence levels of 5% and 10%, the learning curve for all complications ended after 346 and 136 patients, respectively. At a 5% competence level the learning curve for PLND-specific complications was 40 cases and there was no learning curve at a 10% competence level. The overall complication rate was 7.2% of which almost half (47%) were deemed to be PLND-specific. The cumulative average of the LN counts plateaued after 150 procedures. Furthermore, the median LN count after ePLND was more than double that of the authors' historical standard PLND controls (14 vs 6, P < 0.001) and increased with experience up to the end of the series (9 to 20). The likelihood of LN involvement (LNI) correlated with biopsy and pathological Gleason grade, clinical and pathological stage and d'Amico risk group. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests a learning curve of ≈130 cases for operating time, 136 cases for all complications, 40 cases for PLND-specific complications and 150 cases for LN yield. The risk of LNI for patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer was 8.4% and 19.4%, respectively, which suggests that a significant proportion would benefit from ePLND. It also shows that ePLND can be safely incorporated into LRP, and therefore also into robot-assisted RP, in a high-volume setting.","Eden, Christopher G; Zacharakis, Evangelos; Bott, Simon",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2012.11671.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23419154/,242
132599,Is venous thromboembolism a predictable marker in older patients with COVID-19 infection? A single-center observational study.,2021-05-31,"South Asia, encompassing many populous countries including India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, is home to a wide variety of infectious diseases several of which are disproportionately prevalent, endemic or distinctive to the region. These result in considerable morbidity and mortality, which can be greatly reduced through public-health measures, timely diagnosis and treatment. Some of these infectious diseases have neurological manifestations including movement disorders either due to the pathogen being neuroinvasive or via an immune-mediated response. For diseases such as Japanese encephalitis, movement disorders are the primary manifestation while for others, they can be a presenting feature. Thus, recognizing these movement disorders is often crucial to the diagnosis of the particular infection, and/or to exclude infection as a cause and arrive at the correct alternate diagnosis. Once diagnosed, the infection-related movement disorders are treated by targeting the infectious agent, or symptomatically. In this article, we describe and illustrate a variety of movement disorders that are seen in patients infected by viruses, bacteria and parasites in South Asia. This would be of value to neurologists practicing in the region and, with the increasing ease in movement of people and pathogens, those practicing elsewhere.","Aggarwal, Annu; Adukia, Sachin; Bhatt, Mohit",Movement disorders clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1002/mdc3.13275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34405094/,242

METHODS Psoas muscle and femoral nerve sampled from 35 consecutive autopsies of patients who died following SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 SARS-CoV-2-negative controls were examined under light microscopy. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained by chart review. RESULTS In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, mean age at death was 67.8 years (range 43-96 years) and the duration of symptom onset to death ranged from 1-49 days. Four patients had neuromuscular symptoms. Peak creatine kinase was elevated in 74% (mean 959 U/L, range 29-8413 U/L). Muscle showed type 2 atrophy in 32 patients, necrotizing myopathy in 9, and myositis in 7. Neuritis was seen in 9. Major histocompatibility complex-1 (MHC-1) expression was observed in all cases of necrotizing myopathy and myositis and 8 additional patients. Abnormal expression of myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) was present on capillaries in muscle in 9 patients and in nerve in 7. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was negative in muscle and nerve in all patients. In the 10 controls, muscle showed type 2 atrophy in all patients, necrotic muscle fibers in 1, MHC-1 expression in non-necrotic/non-regenerating fibers in 3, MxA expression on capillaries in 2, and inflammatory cells in none, and nerves showed no inflammatory cells or MxA expression. CONCLUSION Muscle and nerve tissue demonstrated inflammatory/immune-mediated damage likely related to release of cytokines. There was no evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 invasion of these tissues.

We aimed to compare short- and long-term efficacy of CsA and IFX by analysing colectomy rates and failure of remission-induction treatment as outcome parameters for treatment success. METHODS We retrospectively studied hospitalised UC patients who received CsA or IFX for moderate-to-severe UC, between January 2000 and April 2014. The primary endpoint was time to colectomy, and treatment failure [defined as colectomy or another remission-induction treatment with corticosteroids, CsA, or IFX] was used as secondary endpoint. Variables possibly affecting colectomy outcomes were analysed. RESULTS A total of 55 patients were studied for colectomy outcome and 58 patients for treatment failure. A significantly longer follow-up duration was available for CsA-treated patients [p < 0.001, both subcohorts]. Patients showed comparable patient- and disease-specific characteristics. Colectomy rates did not differ significantly at 3, 12, and 36 months: 36% versus 29%, 58% versus 48%, and 64% versus 67% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed the lowest hazard ratio [HR] for colectomy in patients concomitantly using thiopurines: HR 0.28 (confidence interval [CI] 0.13-0.64), p = 0.002. Treatment failure rates were not significantly different at 3, 12 and 36 months: 35% versus 48%, 51% versus 68%, and 62% versus 83% for CsA- and IFX-treated patients, respectively.

METHODS We compared the outcomes of patients who received first- (n = 81) with those who received second-generation (n = 166) DES in SVG lesions at our institution between 2006 and 2013. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were defined as the composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. RESULTS Mean age was 66.0 ± 8.1 years and 97.6% of the patients were men. Mean SVG age was 11.1 ± 0.4 years. First-generation DES were sirolimus-eluting (n = 17) and paclitaxel-eluting (n = 64) stents. Second-generation DES were everolimus-eluting (n = 115) and zotarolimus-eluting (n = 51) stents. Median follow-up was 41 months. At 2-years post-procedure, patients with first- and second-generation DES had similar rates of death (20.91% vs. 20.27%, P = 0.916), target lesion revascularization (16.39% vs. 20.00%, P = 0.572), target vessel revascularization (20.97% vs. 23.16%, P = 0.747), myocardial infarction (26.15% vs. 23.00%, P = 0.644), and MACE (43.5% vs. 40.87%, P = 0.707), respectively.

OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of COVID-19 and pandemic regulations on current and future PPRI. METHODS Cross-sectional survey-based study that analyzed data from 400 surveyed dermatologists using a pre-validated questionnaire sent via email. Data regarding PPRI were collected over 1 week in July 2020 to compare demographics and practice standards from April 2019, April 2020, July 2020, and predictions for 2021. RESULTS Virtual-only PPRI increased from 7.8% in April 2019 to 26.5% during April 2020 (mean difference, 18.8%; 95% confidence interval, 13.6%–23.9%). Virtual-only PPRI remained elevated at 24.5% while hybrid PPRI increased, eventually surpassing the April 2019 mark (27.0%). These trends persisted among all studied practice types and levels of experience. Practices predicted no significant percent differences in participation in PPRI (87.3% vs 90.3%; P=0.0834), but a significant shift in method of delivery where the odds ratio of incorporating a virtual component into PPRI in 2021 increased by a factor of 3. LIMITATIONS Relatively small sample size, especially among subgroups. Responses may have been retrospective estimates. There may also be selection bias given slightly increased representation of more experienced dermatologists. CONCLUSION PPRI materially decreased during the initial COVID-19 peak but will likely return to baseline volume moving forward with a significant component being hybrid PPRI. Further studies may better elucidate the economic and clinical impact associated with these changes and their effect on dermatologists’ ability to provide patients with samples and educational materials.

Materials and Methods We used the ""best fit"" framework synthesis approach. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts, and Engineering Village. Two authors reviewed articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data abstraction and content analysis of 443 published papers were used to create a model in which every element was supported by empirical research. Results The CIIM documents how primary care clinicians interact with information as they make point-of-care clinical decisions. The model highlights 3 major process components: (1) context, (2) activity (usual and contingent), and (3) influence. Usual activities include information processing, source-user interaction, information evaluation, selection of information, information use, clinical reasoning, and clinical decisions. Clinician characteristics, patient behaviors, and other professionals influence the process. Discussion The CIIM depicts the complete process of information interaction, enabling a grasp of relationships previously difficult to discern. The CIIM suggests potentially helpful functionality for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support primary care, including a greater focus on information processing and use. The CIIM also documents the role of influence in clinical information interaction; influencers may affect the success of CDSS implementations.

Analyses of survey data from 824 sexually active 16-year-olds (505 women and 319 men) tested three hypotheses. Firstly, social structure measures will correlate with behaviour-specific cognitions that predict condom use. Secondly, cognition measures will not fully mediate the effects of social structural indices and thirdly, the effects of cognitions on condom use will be moderated by social structure indices. All three hypotheses were supported. SES, gender and aspirations accounted for between 2 and 7% of the variance in behaviour-specific cognitions predicting condom use. Aspirations explained a further 4% of the variance in condom use, controlling for cognition effects. Mother's SES and gender added an additional 5%, controlling for aspirations. Overall, including significant moderation effects, of social structure indices increased the variance explained from 20.5% (for cognition measures alone) to 31%. These data indicate that social structure measures should to be investigated in addition to cognitions when modelling antecedents of behaviour, including condom use.","Abraham, Charles; Sheeran, Paschal; Henderson, Marion",Health education research,https://doi.org/10.1093/her/cyr018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21459763/,242

138592,A risk-stratified approach toward safely resuming OnabotulinumtoxinA injections based on dosing and ambulatory status in pediatric patients with cerebral palsy during the Coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19).,2020,"BACKGROUND The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence, proportion of encapsulated strains and antibiotic susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae isolated from young children. METHODS Children, 6 months to 30 months old, were prospectively enrolled from September 2019 to September 2020 at Rochester, NY, pediatric clinics. H. influenzae isolates from nasopharynx (NP) at healthy visits and disease isolates from NP and middle ear fluid (MEF) at onset of acute otitis media (AOM) were characterized by capsular typing, β-lactamase production and antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS Samples from 565 healthy visits and 130 AOM visits were collected. H. influenzae was detected 5.9% and 27% in the NP from healthy and AOM visits, respectively. In the MEF, H. influenzae was isolated in 43% of samples. Eight percent of H. influenzae isolates were encapsulated, 88% type f. Overall 39.7% of isolates were β-lactamase producing; 43% for MEF isolates. Ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin nonsusceptibility were found in more than 25% of isolates. None of the encapsulated H. influenzae isolates were positive for β-lactamase production or ampicillin nonsusceptibility. 9.2% of isolates were β-lactamase negative, ampicillin resistant (β-lactamase negative, ampicillin resistant + β-lactamase negative, ampicillin intermediate). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of H. influenzae in the NP of young children is very low at times of health, but H. influenzae is highly prevalent in MEF at onset of AOM. Nontypeable H. influenzae accounts for >90% of all H. influenzae isolates. Type f predominated among encapsulated strains. β-lactamase production and antibiotic nonsusceptibility among H. influenzae strains isolated from the NP and MEF are common.","Fuji, Naoko; Pichichero, Michael; Kaur, Ravinder",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321442/,242

141668,Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 Pneumonia. Reply.,2021-03-03,"SARS-CoV-2 has created a global crisis. COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, is characterized by pneumonia, respiratory distress and hypercoagulation and can be fatal. An early sign of infection is loss of smell, taste and chemesthesis - loss of chemical sensation. Other neurological effects of the disease have been described, but not explained. It is now apparent that many of these neurological effects (for instance joint pain and headache) can persist for at least months after infection, suggesting a sensory neuronal involvement in persistent disease. We show that human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2 at the RNA and protein level. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus-associated factors and receptors (SCARFs) are broadly expressed in human DRG at the lumbar and thoracic level as assessed by bulk RNA sequencing. ACE2 mRNA is expressed by a subset of nociceptors that express MRGPRD mRNA suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may gain access to the nervous system through entry into neurons that form free-nerve endings at the outermost layers of skin and luminal organs. Therefore, DRG sensory neurons are a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the peripheral nervous system and viral infection of human nociceptors may cause some of the persistent neurological effects seen in COVID-19.","Shiers, Stephanie; Ray, Pradipta R; Wangzhou, Andi; Sankaranarayanan, Ishwarya; Tatsui, Claudio Esteves; Rhines, Laurence D; Li, Yan; Uhelski, Megan L; Dougherty, Patrick M; Price, Theodore J",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32826754/,242
141999,Prespecified dose-response analysis for A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial (AVERT).,2016,"BACKGROUND Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) is a technology that might contribute to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs as a filter test between fecal immunological test and standard colonoscopies (SC). The aim was to systematically review the literature for studies investigating the diagnostic yield of 2nd generation CCE compared to SC. METHODS A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Study characteristics including quality of bowel preparation and completeness of CCE transits were extracted. Per-patient sensitivity and specificity were extracted for polyps (any size; ≥ 10mm, ≥6 mm) and lesion characteristics. Meta-analyses of diagnostic yield were performed. RESULTS The literature search revealed 1077 unique papers and 12 studies were included. These included 2199 in total of which 1898 patients were available for analyses. The rate of patients with adequate quality of the bowel preparation varied from 40% to 100%. The rates of complete CCE transits varied from 57% to 100%. Our meta-analyses demonstrated that mean [95% confidence interval] sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio was 0.85 [0.73;0.92], 0.85 [0.70;0.93] and 30.5 [16.2;57.2], respectively for polyps of any size, 0.87 [0.82;0.90], 0.95 [0.92;0.97] and 136.0 [70.6;262.1], respectively for polyps ≥ 10mm and 0.87 [0.83;0.90], 0.88 [0.75;0.95] and 51.1 [19.8;131.8], respectively for polyps ≥ 6mm. No serious adverse events were reported for CCE. CONCLUSION In conclusion, CCE has a high sensitivity and specificity for per-patient polyps compared to SC.

142084,Risk factors for being a victim of online grooming in adolescents.,2020-02-01,"Central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are not easily treated, and many catheters (e.g., hemodialysis catheters) are not easily replaced. Biofilms (the source of infection) on catheter surfaces are notoriously difficult to eradicate. We have recently demonstrated that modest elevations of temperature lead to increased staphylococcal susceptibility to vancomycin and significantly soften the biofilm matrix. In this study, using a combination of microbiological, computational, and experimental studies, we demonstrate the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of using heat as an adjuvant treatment for infected hemodialysis catheters. Specifically, we show that treating with heat in the presence of antibiotics led to additive killing of Staphylococcus epidermidis with similar trends seen for Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The magnitude of temperature elevation required is relatively modest (45-50°C) and similar to that used as an adjuvant to traditional cancer therapy. Using a custom-designed benchtop model of a hemodialysis catheter, positioned with tip in the human vena cava as well as computational fluid dynamic simulations, we demonstrate that these temperature elevations are likely achievable in situ with minimal increased in overall blood temperature.","Richardson, Ian P; Sturtevant, Rachael; Heung, Michael; Solomon, Michael J; Younger, John G; VanEpps, J Scott",ASAIO journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000000300; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26501916/,242
142237,Haemostatic devices in parotid surgery: a systematic review.,2021-08-23,"AIMS This study was aimed to investigate whether electroacupuncture (EA) would increase the secretion of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) from injured spinal cord tissue, and, if so, whether the increased NT-3 would promote the survival, differentiation, and migration of grafted tyrosine kinase C (TrkC)-modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived neural network cells. We next sought to determine if the latter would integrate with the host spinal cord neural circuit to improve the neurological function of injured spinal cord. METHODS After NT-3-modified Schwann cells (SCs) and TrkC-modified MSCs were co-cultured in a gelatin sponge scaffold for 14 days, the MSCs differentiated into neuron-like cells that formed a MSC-derived neural network (MN) implant. On this basis, we combined the MN implantation with EA in a rat model of spinal cord injury (SCI) and performed immunohistochemical staining, neural tracing, electrophysiology, and behavioral testing after 8 weeks. RESULTS Electroacupuncture application enhanced the production of endogenous NT-3 in damaged spinal cord tissues. The increase in local NT-3 production promoted the survival, migration, and maintenance of the grafted MN, which expressed NT-3 high-affinity TrkC. The combination of MN implantation and EA application improved cortical motor-evoked potential relay and facilitated the locomotor performance of the paralyzed hindlimb compared with those of controls. These results suggest that the MN was better integrated into the host spinal cord neural network after EA treatment compared with control treatment. CONCLUSIONS Electroacupuncture as an adjuvant therapy for TrkC-modified MSC-derived MN, acted by increasing the local production of NT-3, which accelerated neural network reconstruction and restoration of spinal cord function following SCI.","Yang, Yang; Xu, Hao-Yu; Deng, Qing-Wen; Wu, Guo-Hui; Zeng, Xiang; Jin, Hui; Wang, Lai-Jian; Lai, Bi-Qin; Li, Ge; Ma, Yuan-Huan; Jiang, Bin; Ruan, Jing-Wen; Wang, Ya-Qiong; Ding, Ying; Zeng, Yuan-Shan",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.13638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763978/,242

In some infected cats, virulent virus mutants induce feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic disease that can develop in association with viraemia. Persistently infected, healthy carriers are believed to be important in the epidemiology of FIP, as they represent a constant source of FCoV, shed either persistently or intermittently in faeces. So far, the sites of virus persistence have not been determined definitely. The purpose of this study was to examine virus distribution and viral load in organs and gut compartments of specified-pathogen-free cats, orally infected with non-virulent type I FCoV, over different time periods and with or without detectable viraemia. The colon was identified as the major site of FCoV persistence and probable source for recurrent shedding, but the virus was shown also to persist in several other organs, mainly in tissue macrophages. These might represent additional sources for recurrent viraemia.","Kipar, Anja; Meli, Marina L; Baptiste, Keith E; Bowker, Laurel J; Lutz, Hans",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.020214-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20237226/,242

DESIGN Evaluation study. ANIMALS 135 healthy domestic cats aged 0.5 to 12.8 years. PROCEDURES Each test was performed once in 120 cats and repeated in 40. Pearson correlation was used to assess correlation among tests. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were used to evaluate test-retest repeatability. RESULTS Median (95% central range) values were 18 mm/min (9 to 34 mm/min) for STT-1, 29 mm/15 s (15 to 37 mm/15 s) for PRTT, 12.4 seconds (9.1 to 17.7 seconds) for TFBUT, 322 mOsm/L (297 to 364 mOsm/L) for osmolarity, and 32 meibometry units (MU; 11 to 114 MU) for peak meibometry value. The STT-1 and PRTT values were positively correlated. Age was weakly associated with TFBUT and osmolarity. Meibometry measurements were higher for strips that contacted the tear film (285 MU) than for those that touched the eyelid margin only (32 MU). All ICCs were < 0.75, and 95% LOA were wide. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Tear deficiency should be suspected in cats with STT-1 < 9 mm/min, PRTT < 15 mm/15 s, or TFBUT < 9 to 10 seconds. Generally poor correlation among tests suggested that thorough tear film analysis requires performance of multiple tests in concert. Relatively poor test-retest repeatability should be considered when repeated tests are used to monitor tear film dysfunction and response to treatment.","Sebbag, Lionel; Kass, Philip H; Maggs, David J",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.246.4.426; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25632817/,242

However, as compared to traditional sets, the effect of cluster sets on muscular and neuromuscular adaptations remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of RT programs implementing cluster and traditional set configurations on muscular and neuromuscular adaptations. METHODS Systematic searches of Embase, Scopus, Medline and SPORTDiscus were conducted. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized or non-randomized comparative studies; (2) publication in English; (3) participants of all age groups; (4) participants free of any medical condition or injury; (5) cluster set intervention; (6) comparison intervention utilizing a traditional set configuration; (7) intervention length ≥ three weeks and (8) at least one measure of changes in strength/force/torque, power, velocity, hypertrophy or muscular endurance. Raw data (mean ± SD or range) were extracted from included studies. Hedges' g effect sizes (ES) ± standard error of the mean (SEM) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. RESULTS Twenty-nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. No differences between cluster and traditional set configurations were found for strength (ES = - 0.05 ± 0.10, 95% CI - 0.21 to 0.11, p = 0.56), power output (ES = 0.02 ± 0.10, 95% CI - 0.17 to 0.20, p = 0.86), velocity (ES = 0.15 ± 0.13, 95% CI - 0.10 to 0.41, p = 0.24), hypertrophy (ES = - 0.05 ± 0.14, 95% CI - 0.32 to 0.23, p = 0.73) or endurance (ES = - 0.07 ± 0.18, 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.29, p = 0.70) adaptations. Moreover, no differences were observed when training volume, cluster set model, training status, body parts trained or exercise type were considered. CONCLUSION Collectively, both cluster and traditional set configurations demonstrate equal effectiveness to positively induce muscular and neuromuscular adaptation(s). However, cluster set configurations may achieve such adaptations with less fatigue development during RT which may be an important consideration across various exercise settings and stages of periodized RT programs.","Davies, Timothy B; Tran, Derek L; Hogan, Clorinda M; Haff, G Gregory; Latella, Christopher",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-020-01408-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475986/,242
144512,Trousseau sign and syndrome: Erroneous terms.,2020-10-01,"PURPOSE To study changing emergency department (ED) brain imaging utilization in patients with primary brain cancers. METHODS Using 2006-2014 data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS), we identified all patients with primary brain cancers visiting EDs and evaluated trends of head CT and brain MRI utilization. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine patient- and hospital-specific factors associated with brain imaging utilization. RESULTS A weighted cohort of 40,862 ED visits were included (mean age 55; 54% male), increasing from 3932 in 2006 to 5625 in 2014 (+ 43%). A total of 14.4% underwent brain imaging, with 13.2% undergoing CT, 2.3% undergoing MRI, and 1.1% undergoing both modalities. Between 2006 and 2014, there was a 104% increase in the rate of ED brain imaging (from 9.7% in 2006 to 19.8% in 2014). Factors associated with higher utilization of ED brain imaging in adults were non-teaching hospital status and Midwest and Northeast hospital regions (compared with the West). In pediatric patients, higher utilization was associated with older age, higher median household income of patient's ZIP code, and visits in rural, non-teaching hospitals located in the Midwest, South, and Northeast (compared with the West). CONCLUSION In US patients with primary brain cancer, the number of ED visits increased annually, and the utilization of ED head imaging examinations doubled in a recent 9-year period. A variety of sociodemographic characteristics are associated with a higher likelihood of imaging in both adult and pediatric patients.","Elchoufi, Deema; Duszak, Richard; Balthazar, Patricia; Hanna, Tarek N; Sadigh, Gelareh",Emergency radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-020-01836-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803458/,242

145691,Clinical Features Predicting Mortality Risk in Older Patients with COVID-19.,2020-09-18,"OBJECTIVE Cerebral oxygenation monitoring via near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is increasingly becoming an accepted and valued component of intraoperative monitoring. In recent years, new devices have become available which all make different claims. The purpose of this study is to examine the research on these individual devices to establish the levels of evidence for each and formulate a research path for further evaluation of this technology in cardiac surgery. METHODS This study is a systematic review of published research on cerebral oximetry. We searched PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus for full-length, peer-reviewed articles containing original data resulting from the study of patient neurologic outcomes based on the use of FDA-approved near-infrared spectroscopy devices. The studies were then grouped and classified based on the device used and the levels of evidence each study provided. RESULTS Only a very limited number of high-level clinical evidence research papers are currently available, with nearly all of those papers based on the INVOS system. This is likely due to the different lengths of time each device has been on the market and its availability for use in clinical trials. Challenges to testing include the expense of testing various devices, the lack of a globally accepted gold standard for cerebral oxygenation saturation, the limited availability of patient frontal surface area and the gradual adoption of this technology. Despite these limitations, significant results have been identified in relation to patient outcomes. CONCLUSION At this time, there is limited high-level evidence available for all of the NIRS devices on the market despite significant outcomes found in these studies. Additional prospective randomized studies should be conducted in order to establish the potential role NIRS may play in patient monitoring as well as assessing the efficacy of the multiple devices on the market.","Douds, M T; Straub, E J; Kent, A C; Bistrick, C H; Sistino, J J",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659114544713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25079033/,242

METHODS Respiratory samples were collected from 2468 children hospitalized with SARI at a university and research hospital in Milan (September 1, 2014 to August 31, 2017). EV and EV-D68 RNA were detected using a commercial multiplex and a specific real-time RT-PCR assay, respectively. The EV-D68-negative samples were then characterized by partial sequencing of the VP1 gene. RESULTS EV-RNA was detected in 9% (222/2468) of SARI cases, 77% were children ≤3 years, almost 13% of whom required intensive care. EVs circulated all-year-round in 2 distinct epidemic waves (May-August and November-December). An EV-D68 outbreak, responsible for 14.8% of EV-positive-SARIs, occurred in 2016 and 5 newly emerging EV types were identified. Twenty-two EV types were detected and remarkable heterogeneity was observed in species distribution and between different pediatric age groups. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that EV-positivity rate for our SARI series was 9%. The molecular detection and characterization of EVs allowed for the rapid detection of an EV-D68 outbreak and revealed the presence of emerging EV types that may pose a public health threat. The lack of routine screening and EV characterization in respiratory tract infections hampers the assessment of their epidemiologic and molecular features.","Pellegrinelli, Laura; Uceda Reinteria, Sara Colonia; Galli, Cristina; Greco, Letizia; Primache, Valeria; Lunghi, Giovanna; Binda, Sandro; Pariani, Elena",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31469780/,242

These have not been included in prior economic studies. METHODS PHOENIX ECONOMICS was a substudy of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, evaluating cangrelor during PCI. Hospital bills were reviewed from 1,171 patients enrolled at 22 of 63 US sites. Costs were estimated using standard methods including resource-based accounting, hospital billing data, and the Medicare fee schedule. Bleeding and IPTE, defined as abrupt vessel closure (transient or sustained), new/suspected thrombus, new clot on wire/catheter, no reflow, side-branch occlusion, procedural stent thrombosis or urgent need for CABG were identified. Costs were calculated according to whether a complication occurred and type of event. Multivariate analyses were used to estimate the incremental costs of IPTE and postprocedural events. RESULTS IPTE occurred in 4.3% and were associated with higher catheterization laboratory and overall index hospitalization costs by $2,734 (95%CI $1,117, $4,351; P = 0.001) and $6,354 (95% CI $4,122, $8,586; P < 0.001), respectively.

By comparison, ACUITY minor bleeding increased hospitalization cost by $1,416 (95%CI = 312, $2,519; P = 0.012). ACUITY major bleeding increased cost of hospitalization by $7,894 (95%CI $4,154, $11,635; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS IPTE and bleeding complications, though infrequent, are associated with substantial increased cost. These complications should be collected in economic assessments of PCI.","Tamez, Hector; Généreux, Philip; Yeh, Robert W; Amin, Amit P; Fan, Weihong; White, Harvey D; Kirtane, Ajay J; Stone, Gregg W; Gibson, C Michael; Harrington, Robert A; Bhatt, Deepak L; Pinto, Duane S",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.27638; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29726596/,242

The negative perceptions often portrayed by medical-surgical nurses towards SMI patients with comorbid medical-surgical disorders must be addressed in order to ameliorate treatment gaps. Current concepts, issues, and challenges associated with the perceptions of nurses who care for patients with (SMI) in medical-surgical settings can prove overwhelming to both nurses and patients, and can result in concerning practice gaps. In accordance with a contemporary model of patient-centered care, it is imperative that medical-surgical nurses acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary to work with this high-risk population. Cultivating an environment that promotes apposite attitudes along with effective training programs for medical-surgical nurses, may shift negative perceptions and ultimately meet best practice standards and improve outcomes for patients with SMI.","Alexander, Vinette; Ellis, Horace; Barrett, Barbara",Archives of psychiatric nursing,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2015.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992881/,242
149422,Impact of Preoperative and Incident Musculoskeletal Problematic Areas on Postoperative Outcomes after Total Knee Replacement.,2021-07-28,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is frequently performed for treating patients with gastric cancer; however, the absence of anastomotic techniques with greater superiority has impaired its popularization. We have compared two types of anastomotic techniques with regard to technical perspectives and clinical outcomes. METHODS We reviewed 43 patients with gastric cancer who underwent LTG. Two types of anastomotic techniques have been applied after LTG-the trans-orally inserted anvil (OrVil™) and the reverse puncture device (RPD). Data on the type of anastomosis, blood loss, operation time, anastomosis time, location of tumors, distance between the top border of tumors and top resection margin, diameter of tumor, length of postoperative hospital stay, early and late postoperative complications, and total cost of surgical consumables were obtained by reviewing patient medical records and analyzed thereafter. RESULTS We included 32 men and 11 women (mean age 61 years). The loss to follow-up rate was 13.2%. The median survival time for the OrVil™ and RPD groups was 23 and 22 months, respectively. The total rate of complications was 9.3%. The difference in the anastomosis times between the groups was statistically significant. OrVil™ required more time than RPD and cost more than RPD. CONCLUSIONS Both the OrVil™ and RPD techniques showed good safety and applicability in LTG. RPD showed an advantage with regard to lesser operative complexity and lower cost.","Li, Xi; Hong, Liang; Ding, Dan; Liu, Yaping; Niu, Gengming; Li, Liang; Wang, Xin; Li, Xiaomei; Ke, Chongwei",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5554-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28409368/,242

The aims of this study included: measurement of adhesion formation with Dynamesh IPOM after laparoscopic intraperitoneal implantation, and assessment of the occurrence of isolated adhesions at the fastening sites of slowly absorbable sutures. MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve healthy pigs underwent laparoscopic implantation of 2 Dynamesh IPOM mesh fragments each, one was fastened with PDSII, and the other with Maxon sutures. An assessment of adhesion formation was carried out after 6 weeks and included an evaluation of surface area, hardness according to the Zhulke scale, and index values. The occurrence of isolated adhesions at slowly absorbable suture fixation points was also analyzed. RESULTS Adhesions were noted in 83.3% of Dynamesh IPOM meshes. Adhesions covered on average 37.7% of the mesh surface with mean hardness 1.46 and index value 78.8. In groups fixed with PDS in comparison to Maxon sutures adhesions covered mean 31.6% vs. 42.5% (p = 0.62) of the mesh surface, mean hardness was 1.67 vs.1.25 (p = 0.34) and index 85.42 vs. 72.02 (p = 0.95). CONCLUSIONS The Dynamesh IPOM mesh, in spite of its anti-adhesive layer of PVDF, does not prevent the formation of adhesions. Adhesion hardness, surface area, and index values of the Dynamesh IPOM mesh are close to the mean values of these parameters for other commercially available 2-layer meshes. Slowly absorbable sutures used for fastening did not increase the risk of adhesion formation.","Jamry, Andrzej; Jałyński, Marek; Piskorz, Lukasz; Brocki, Marian",Archives of medical science : AMS,https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2013.35345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23847671/,242
150657,Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients in Himachal Pradesh (India) and the absence of dengue false positive tests: Insights for patient management.,2020-07-30,"BACKGROUND Inferior angle of scapula (IAS) fractures are rare, with very few cases reported. They typically present with pain, loss of shoulder motion, and scapula winging. Operative and nonoperative treatments have been trialed with varying success. The aim of this study was to gather data relating to IAS fractures to develop evidence-based treatment guidelines as none are currently available. METHODS A search was conducted of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases to identify cases of IAS fractures. Data collected about each case included age and gender of the patient, mechanism of injury, fracture displacement, treatment, and outcome. The authors report 2 additional IAS fracture cases. RESULTS Ten cases were identified for inclusion in this study, 8 from the literature and 2 described by the authors. Of the 10 cases, 7 described displaced IAS fractures and 3 described undisplaced fractures. All displaced fractures treated nonoperatively resulted in a painful nonunion. All that underwent operative fixation, whether acutely or after failed nonoperative treatment, had resolution of pain and a good functional outcome. All undisplaced fractures were treated nonoperatively; 1 had persisting pain. Surgical exploration identified the fracture fragment attached to serratus anterior in 2 cases and attached to both serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi in 2 cases. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS There are limited data available about IAS factures. From the cases reviewed, treatment recommendations include the following: (1) displaced IAS fractures should undergo operative fixation to prevent the development of a painful nonunion; (2) suture repair provides adequate fixation; and (3) undisplaced fractures have a variable outcome when treated nonoperatively.","Chang, Angela C; Phadnis, Joideep; Eardley-Harris, Nathan; Ranawat, Vijai S; Bain, Gregory I",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jse.2015.11.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895597/,242

However, emerging evidence indicates that some non-enveloped viruses exit cells without inducing cell lysis, while others engage both lytic and non-lytic egress mechanisms. Enteric viruses are transmitted via the faecal-oral route and are important causes of a wide range of human infections, both gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal. Virus cellular egress, when fully understood, may be a relevant target for antiviral therapies, which could minimize the public health impact of these infections. In this review, we outline lytic and non-lytic cell egress mechanisms of non-enveloped enteric RNA viruses belonging to five families: Picornaviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Astroviridae and Hepeviridae. We discuss factors that contribute to egress mechanisms and the relevance of these mechanisms to virion stability, infectivity and transmission. Since most data were obtained in traditional two-dimensional cell cultures, we will further attempt to place them into the context of polarized cultures and in vivo pathogenesis. Throughout the review, we highlight numerous knowledge gaps to stimulate future research into the egress mechanisms of these highly prevalent but largely understudied viruses.","Owusu, Irene A; Quaye, Osbourne; Passalacqua, Karla D; Wobus, Christiane E",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001557; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33560198/,242
151131,Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and its comparison with influenza pneumonia.,2020-07-29,"AIM AND OBJECTIVE Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been reported in humans to be most likely induced by gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), namely by gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, and gadoversetamide, rarely by other GBCA. The pathogenesis of NSF remains unclear; different hypotheses are under discussion. The objective of the study is to assess if in the animal model human-like NSF changes can be induced by high-dose, intraperitoneal GBCA injections over four weeks. MATERIALS AND METHODS After approval by the institutional animal ethics committee, six rats each were randomly assigned to groups, and treated with seven different GBCA. Intraperitoneal (IP) injections - proven in the animal model to be effective - were chosen to prolong the animals' exposure to the respective GBCA. GBCA doses of previous intravenous (IV) animal studies were applied. After five weeks all rats were sacrificed. Sham controls were treated with IP saline injections, employing the same regimen. RESULTS No findings comparable with human NSF were observed in all animals after IP treatment with all seven GBCA at daily doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mmol/kg body weight (BW). No histopathological abnormalities of all examined organs were noted. Weight loss was stated in weeks three and four with GBCA injections at doses of 5.0 mmol/kg BW, but rats regained weight after cessation of GBCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS NSF-comparable pathological findings could not be induced by high dose intraperitoneal injection of seven GBCA.","Langer, R D; Lorke, D E; Neidl van Gorkom, K F; Petroianu, G; Azimullah, S; Nurulain, S M; Singh, S; Fuchsjäger, M",European journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrad.2011.10.032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22304979/,242

In order to fully appraise the available data, we performed a meta-analysis of 18 published studies. METHODS A thorough systematic search was conducted. The studies enrolling critically ill patients receiving thiamine supplementation was compared with the standard of care (SOC) group. Data was analyzed using RevMan 5.4. Clinical outcomes were pooled using Odds Ratio (OR) and mean differences. RESULT Eighteen studies (8 RCTs and 10 cohort studies) met the criteria for quantitative synthesis. In the analysis of RCTs, thiamine supplementation showed 42% lower odds of developing ICU delirium (OR 0.58, 95% CI, 0.34-0.98). A reduction in mortaliy was observed on performing fixed effect model analysis however, a level of statistical significance could not be reached on performing randon effect model analysis (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.04). Further sub-group analysis of 13 studies in patients with sepsis, there was no difference in mortality between the two groups (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.63 to 1.09). CONCLUSION Thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients showed a reduction in the incidence of ICU delirium among RCTs. However, there was no significant benefit in terms of overall mortality, and mortality in patients with sepsis. Further, large scale randomized prospective studies are warranted to investigate the role of thiamine supplementation in critically ill patients.","Sedhai, Yub Raj; Shrestha, Dhan Bahadur; Budhathoki, Pravash; Jha, Vivek; Mandal, Sujit Kumar; Karki, Saurab; Baniya, Ramkaji; Cable, Casey A; Kashiouris, Markos G",Journal of critical care,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcrc.2021.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118501/,242

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS An observational evaluation from a self-reported questionnaire on behavioral changes and glycemic information from flash glucose monitoring (FGM) during the lockdown in 1,378 individuals living with type 1 diabetes who used a French dedicated nationwide web application (CoviDIAB). RESULTS The main outcome was the change of the mean glucose level 2 months before and 1 month after the lockdown. We found that mean glucose improved from 9.1 ± 1.7 mmol/L to 8.7 ± 1.7 mmol/L (P < 0.001). Factors associated with better glycemic control were a decrease of alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] 1.75 [95% CI 1.04-2.94]), an increase in the frequency of FGM scans (OR 1.48 [1.04-2.10]) and in the number of hypoglycemia events (OR 1.67 [1.13-2.46]), and an easier diabetes control perception (OR 1.71 [1.18-2.49]).

IUGR results in significant perinatal and long-term complications, including the development of insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis holds that intrauterine malnutrition leads to an adaptive response that alters the fetal metabolic and hormonal milieu designed for intrauterine survival. This fetal programming predisposes to an increased susceptibility for chronic diseases. Although the mechanisms controlling intrauterine growth are poorly understood, adipose tissue may play an important role in linking poor fetal growth to the subsequent development of adult diseases. Adipose tissue secretes a number of hormones, called adipocytokines, important in modulating metabolism and recently involved in intrauterine growth. This review aims to summarize reported findings concerning the role of adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL6), visfatin, resistin, apelin) in early life, while attempting to speculate mechanisms through which differential regulation of adipocytokines in IUGR may influence the risk for development of chronic diseases in later life.","Briana, Despina D; Malamitsi-Puchner, Ariadne",European journal of endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1530/eje-08-0621; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19095781/,242

Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction. METHODS In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n=21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n=54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). RESULTS PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR= 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p<0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r= 0.59 p<0.001), LDH (r=0.52, p<0.001) and PCT (r=0.72, p<0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay. In fact patients showing PSP values higher than 250 ng/L (cut-off for risk stratification) did stay in ICU for a significantly longer time (median 17 days, IQR 12-31; p<0.001) than those exhibiting lower values (median 10 days, IQR 7-18). CONCLUSIONS The data obtained seems to demonstrate the role of PSP in providing prognostic information in COVID-19 patients, allowing to identify, during the early phase of the monitoring, the patients suffering from a more severe disease which will be hospitalized for a more long time.","Zaninotto, Martina; Maria Mion, Monica; Cosma, Chiara; Rinaldi, Daniela; Plebani, Mario",Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2020.04.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333860/,242

Early research highlights these disparities, but we do not yet know the full impact of this pandemic on PWD. Over the last 20 years, many medical schools have attempted to develop disability competency trainings, but discrimination and inequities remain, resulting in a pervasive distrust of medicine by the disability community at large. In this commentary, we suggest that disability competency is insufficient because the healthcare disparities experienced by PWD are not simply a matter of individual biases, but structural and systemic factors requiring a culture shift in the healthcare professions. Recognizing that disability is a form of diversity that is experienced alongside other systemic disadvantages like social class, race, age, sex, gender identity, and geographic location, we explore the transformative potential of disability conscious medical education, training, and practice that draws on insights from intersectional disability justice activism. Disability conscious medicine is a novel approach, which improves upon competency programs by utilizing disability studies and the principles of disability justice to guide us in the critique of norms, traditions, and institutions to more fully promote the respect, beneficence, and justice that patients deserve.","Doebrich, Adrienne; Quirici, Marion; Lunsford, Christopher",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/prm-200763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252100/,242

METHODS A hospital-based retrospective case-control study was conducted on 194 type 2 diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery in Rajavithi Hospital from January 2007 to December 2015. Fifteen patients with PCE were included as the case group and 179 patients without PCE were included as the control group. Potential factors associated with PCE among both groups including demographics, pre-operative characteristics, surgical settings and complications, were statistically analyzed using Chi-square testing and a logistic regression model. RESULTS Within the case group, 53% were females and the median age was 68y. Univariate analysis of pre-operative characteristics, surgical settings and complications revealed that recent pre-operative fasting plasma glucose, insulin therapy, presence of diabetic retinopathy, and severe non-proliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with PCE. In a multivariate analysis adjusting for blood glucose level, insulin treatment was the only significant factor associated with an increased risk of PCE (OR 3.9, 95%CI 1.0-15.0, P=0.04) compared to patients without insulin treatment. The most common causative organisms were gram-positive bacteria (89%). Staphylococcus species represented the most common group (67%). Median best corrected visual acuity at 1-month and 3-month follow-up was equal at 0.7 logMAR (20/100). CONCLUSION The authors identify insulin treatment as the only risk factor associated with endophthalmitis after cataract surgery in type 2 diabetic patients.

This clinical observation indicates the resistance of the body and its cells to androgens like testosterone. At the molecular level, this hormone resistance is caused by hemizygous loss of function mutations in the X-chromosomal androgen receptor (AR) gene. Partial forms of androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) show different degrees of virilisation largely depending on the remaining activity of the AR. Nevertheless, the phenotypic outcome can be variable even in presence of the same mutation and in the same kindred indicating the presence of further influencing factors. Importantly, the majority of clinically diagnosed PAIS individuals do not bear a mutation in their AR gene. A recent assay using the androgen regulated gene apolipoprotein D as biomarker is able to detect androgen insensitivity on the cellular level even in absence of an AR gene mutation. Using this assay a class of AIS without an AR-gene mutation was defined as AIS type II and suggests that unidentified cofactors of the AR are responsible for the PAIS phenotype. Here we outline the scientific progress made from the first clinical definition of AIS over biochemical and molecular characterizations to the concept of AIS type II.

The present study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between HTx of traumatically brain-injured (TBI) and non-TBI donors, as well as to establish a risk-prediction model of mortality. METHODS All patients undergoing HTx at our institute between January 1st, 2015 and December 31st, 2018 were dichotomized according to cause of donor death, and outcomes between the two groups were compared based on propensity score matching (PSM). The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included cardiac allograft vasculopathy and other postoperative complications. RESULTS 342 eligible HTx recipients were included. TBI grafts accounted for 62.87% (215/342). 121 pairs of candidates were generated from PSM. Actuarial and risk-adjusted survival were similar between TBI and non-TBI groups. Risk factors associated with all-cause mortality included recipient age>60y (HR = 2.781, p = .002), history of cardiac surgery (HR = 2.186, p = .032), chronic kidney disease (HR = 2.948, p = .033) and smoking (HR = 0.465, p = .041), as well as donor age>45y (HR = 2.701, p = .003) and BMI>25 kg/m2 (HR = 2.025, p = .045). The risk-prediction model was established successfully based on specific preoperative variables and high-risk group with a score>10 had nearly fourfold increase in mortality (HR = 3.726, p<0.001) compared to the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS In this largest single-center cohort from China, we found similar survival and rates of complications between HTx recipients with TBI and non-TBI donors.

Pilat is a white rot fungus belonging to the family Hymenochaetaceae in the Basidiomycota. In nature, this fungus rarely forms a fruiting body but usually an irregular shape of sclerotial conk called 'Chaga'. Characteristically, I. obliquus produces massive melanins released to the surface of Chaga. As early as in the sixteenth century, Chaga was used as an effective folk medicine in Russia and Northern Europe to treat several human malicious tumors and other diseases in the absence of any unacceptable toxic side effects. Chemical investigations show that I. obliquus produces a diverse range of secondary metabolites including phenolic compounds, melanins, and lanostane-type triterpenoids. Among these are the active components for antioxidant, antitumoral, and antiviral activities and for improving human immunity against infection of pathogenic microbes. Geographically, however, this fungus is restricted to very cold habitats and grows very slowly, suggesting that Chaga is not a reliable source of these bioactive compounds. Attempts for culturing this fungus axenically all resulted in a reduced production of bioactive metabolites. This review examines the current progress in the discovery of chemical diversity of Chaga and their biological activities and the strategies to modulate the expression of desired pathways to diversify and up-regulate the production of bioactive metabolites by the fungus grown in submerged cultures for possible drug discovery.","Zheng, Weifa; Miao, Kangjie; Liu, Yubing; Zhao, Yanxia; Zhang, Meimei; Pan, Shenyuan; Dai, Yucheng",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2682-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20532760/,242
157985,Diagnosing nontuberculous mycobacterial cervicofacial lymphadenitis in children: A systematic review.,2018,"BACKGROUND COVID-19 infection poses a serious risk to patients and - due to its contagious nature - to those healthcare workers (HCWs) treating them. If the mouth and nose of HCWs are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may help reduce the risk of active infection being passed from infected patients to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves, or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. Understanding these possible side effects is particularly important when the HCWs are otherwise fit and well. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays used by healthcare workers (HCWs) to protect themselves when treating patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. SEARCH METHODS Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: RCTs; quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to HCWs, with or without the same intervention being given to the patients with COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) viral content of aerosol, when present (if intervention administered to patients); 4) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 5) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS We found no completed studies to include in this review. We identified three ongoing studies (including two RCTs), which aim to enrol nearly 700 participants. The interventions included in these trials are povidone iodine, nitric oxide and GLS-1200 oral spray (the constituent of this spray is unclear and may not be antimicrobial in nature). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review. This is not surprising given the relatively recent emergence of COVID-19 infection. It is promising that the question posed in this review is being addressed by two RCTs and a non-randomised study. We are concerned that only one of the ongoing studies specifically states that it will evaluate adverse events and it is not clear if this will include changes in the sense of smell or to the oral and nasal microbiota, and any consequences thereof. Very few interventions have large and dramatic effect sizes. If a positive treatment effect is demonstrated when studies are available for inclusion in this review, it may not be large. In these circumstances in particular, where those receiving the intervention are otherwise fit and well, it may be a challenge to weigh up the benefits against the harms if the latter are of uncertain frequency and severity.","Burton, Martin J; Clarkson, Janet E; Goulao, Beatriz; Glenny, Anne-Marie; McBain, Andrew J; Schilder, Anne Gm; Webster, Katie E; Worthington, Helen V",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013626.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32936949/,242

METHODS In this study, focus groups were conducted with pediatric clerkship students after completion of a debrief interview. The constant comparative method was used with Mezirow's transformative learning theory as a lens to explore perceptions of the benefits and challenges of performing the interview. RESULTS Focus groups revealed five benefits and two challenges. The benefits were that the debrief interviews helped students (1) humanize patients and appreciate social and environmental influences on patient health, (2) assess caregiver/patient understanding about care to correct misunderstandings, (3) actively involve caregivers/patients in treatment plan development, (4) engage patients in active expression of questions/concerns, and (5) recognize the value of their own role on the healthcare team. The challenges were that students felt (1) a lack of knowledge to answer caregivers'/patients' questions about diagnoses and (2) discomfort responding to caregiver/patient frustration, anxiety, or sadness. Student feedback on feasibility and implementation led to guidelines for selecting patients and conducting small group discussions after the debrief interviews. CONCLUSIONS Debrief interviews offer a unique approach for learners to explore patient perspectives during hospitalization through direct patient engagement and dialogue, contributing to professional development, empathy, and potentially more positive patient care experiences.","Chua, Ian S; Bogetz, Alyssa L; Long, Michele; Kind, Terry; Ottolini, Mary; Lineberry, Matthew; Bhansali, Priti",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1854707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33290120/,242

159438,Creation of the ideal gastric tube: Comparison of three methods: A prospective cohort study.,2016,"BACKGROUND Herpes zoster may significantly impact quality of life (QoL) in older adults. The recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) is efficacious in adults aged ≥50 and older and is associated with increased reactogenicity compared to placebo. We report here on the impact of reactogenicity of the second RZV dose on the QoL and physical functioning (PF) of vaccine recipients, and summarize findings following both doses. METHOD In this single-arm study, 401 adults aged ≥50 and older were enrolled to receive two RZV doses 2 months apart. Change in mean Short Form Survey-36 (SF-36) PF and EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) scores, reactogenicity, safety, productivity loss, and healthcare resource utilization were evaluated. RESULTS In total, 391 (97.5%) participants received dose 2. Post-dose 2, the most common solicited local symptoms were injection site pain (75.1%), erythema (22.4%), and swelling (13.9%), and the most common systemic symptoms were fatigue (46.3%), headache (37.5%), and myalgia (32.9%). Grade 3 solicited (local and systemic) adverse events were reported by 61 (15.6%) participants and were associated with a transient clinically significant decrease in SF-36 PF score on Days 1-2 post-dose 2 that recovered by Day 3. Overall, no clinically important reduction in mean SF-36 PF scores was observed from baseline to post-dose 2 (mean change -0.4), and no quality-adjusted-life-year loss was recorded. CONCLUSIONS Overall, QoL and PF of RZV vaccinees were not affected by vaccine-related reactogenicity. A transient reduction was observed in the first 2 days after RZV vaccination in individuals with Grade 3 adverse events. No safety concerns were identified.","Schmader, Kenneth E; Levin, Myron J; Chen, Michael; Matthews, Sean; Riley, Megan E; Woo, Wayne; Hervé, Caroline; Grupping, Katrijn; Schuind, Anne E; Oostvogels, Lidia; Curran, Desmond","The journals of gerontology.

DUBs (deubiquitinating enzymes) constitute one of the largest classes of human proteases and are key effectors of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This pathway regulating cellular protein turnover has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, viral diseases and cancer. The therapeutic efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor Velcade (bortezomib) for treating multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma establishes this system as a valid target for cancer treatment. A promising alternative to targeting the proteasome itself would be to target the upstream, ubiquitin conjugation/deconjugation system, to generate more specific, less toxic anticancer agents. Advances in small molecule-based inhibitors specifically targeting DUBs are presented in this review.","Colland, Frédéric",Biochemical Society transactions,https://doi.org/10.1042/bst0380137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20074048/,242

The purpose of this roadmap was to focus on the role of imaging in future research and clinical trials. METHODS This forum brought together stroke neurologists, neuroradiologists, neuroimaging research scientists, members of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), industry representatives, and members of the US Food and Drug Administration to discuss STIR priorities in the light of an unprecedented series of positive acute stroke endovascular therapy clinical trials. RESULTS The imaging session summarized and compared the imaging components of the recent positive endovascular trials and proposed opportunities for pooled analyses. The imaging workshop developed consensus recommendations for optimal imaging methods for the acquisition and analysis of core, mismatch, and collaterals across multiple modalities, and also a standardized approach for measuring the final infarct volume in prospective clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS Recent positive acute stroke endovascular clinical trials have demonstrated the added value of neurovascular imaging. The optimal imaging profile for endovascular treatment includes large vessel occlusion, smaller core, good collaterals, and large penumbra. However, equivalent definitions for the imaging profile parameters across modalities are needed, and a standardization effort is warranted, potentially leveraging the pooled data resulting from the recent positive endovascular trials.","Warach, Steven J; Luby, Marie; Albers, Gregory W; Bammer, Roland; Bivard, Andrew; Campbell, Bruce C V; Derdeyn, Colin; Heit, Jeremy J; Khatri, Pooja; Lansberg, Maarten G; Liebeskind, David S; Majoie, Charles B L M; Marks, Michael P; Menon, Bijoy K; Muir, Keith W; Parsons, Mark W; Vagal, Achala; Yoo, Albert J; Alexandrov, Andrei V; Baron, Jean-Claude; Fiorella, David J; Furlan, Anthony J; Puig, Josep; Schellinger, Peter D; Wintermark, Max",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.012364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27073243/,242
159743,Management of tracheostomy-related tracheomegaly in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonitis.,2020,"BACKGROUND Targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro method are two of the many methods that have been used to study the microbiome. The two methods target different regions of the 16 S rRNA gene. The aim of this study was to compare targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods for the ability to discern the microbial composition of the lung microbiome of COPD patients. METHODS Spontaneously expectorated sputum specimens were collected from COPD patients. Bacterial DNA was extracted and used for targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro method. The analysis was performed using QIIME2 (targeted metagenomics) and IS-Pro software (IS-Pro method). Additionally, a laboratory cost per isolate and time analysis was performed for each method. RESULTS Statistically significant differences were observed in alpha diversity when targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods' data were compared using the Shannon diversity measure (p-value = 0.0006) but not with the Simpson diversity measure (p-value = 0.84). Distinct clusters with no overlap between the two technologies were observed for beta diversity. Targeted metagenomics had a lower relative abundance of phyla, such as the Proteobacteria, and higher relative abundance of phyla, such as Firmicutes when compared to the IS-Pro method. Haemophilus, Prevotella and Streptococcus were most prevalent genera across both methods. Targeted metagenomics classified 23 % (144/631) of OTUs to a species level, whereas IS-Pro method classified 86 % (55/64) of OTUs to a species level. However, unclassified OTUs accounted for a higher relative abundance when using the IS-Pro method (35 %) compared to targeted metagenomics (5 %). The two methods performed comparably in terms of cost and time; however, the IS-Pro method was more user-friendly. CONCLUSIONS It is essential to understand the value of different methods for characterisation of the microbiome. Targeted metagenomics and IS-Pro methods showed differences in ability in identifying and characterising OTUs, diversity and microbial composition of the lung microbiome. The IS-Pro method might miss relevant species and could inflate the abundance of Proteobacteria. However, the IS-Pro kit identified most of the important lung pathogens, such as Burkholderia and Pseudomonas and may work in a more diagnostics-orientated setting. Both methods were comparable in terms of cost and time; however, the IS-Pro method was easier to use.","Goolam Mahomed, T; Peters, Rph; Pretorius, Ghj; Goolam Mahomed, A; Ueckermann, V; Kock, M M; Ehlers, M M",BMC microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-021-02288-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407769/,242

MATERIAL AND METHODS The present study was performed by using the previous study data that was conducted before the pandemic to detect female sexual function by using questionnaires. Comparison of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in women during and before the pandemic. Participants were asked to fill questionnaire forms again. RESULTS FSFI scores of the participants were higher before the pandemic, however, this finding was not statistically significant (21.8 vs 21.0, p = 0.27). BAI and BDI scores with high scores accompanied by anxiety and depression were found statistically significantly higher in the study (11.2 vs 13.3, p < 0.01; 10.0 vs 13.7, p < 0.01; respectively). BAI scores had a negative correlation with FSFI scores, however, BDI scores had not a significant correlation with FSFI scores in the present study (p < 0.01, correlation coefficient = -0.302; p = 0.07; correlation coefficient = -0.183; respectively).

In this study, we aimed to assess the proficiency of dentists in general practice in the outpatient dental care of these patients. A total of 119 dentists from private practices in Lower Saxony, Germany, participated in this study. Concerning treatment of patients with dementia, they provided details about (1) practice equipment/consultation, (2) training/ expertise, and (3) special circumstances of dental treatment. Participating dentists predominantly reported to use medical aids (e.g., positioning cushions) to improve the treatment situation for patients with dementia. Over two thirds (68.6%) offered consultations in nursing homes, and at the patients' homes (47.0%). The training rate was remarkably low in the field of gerodontology for dentists and their practice staff (< 10%), however, 54.5% expressed interest in such training. The majority of dentists reportedly adapted their treatment strategy to the needs of patients with dementia (e.g., communication, inclusion of caregivers, time management). Furthermore, most participants adapted dental treatment adequately (e.g., strict indication for tooth extraction, simple design of dental prostheses). In summary, even though training in the field of gerodontology must be considered insufficient, most dentists in this study showed an adequate adaptation of their treatment strategy as well as consideration of dental characteristics in patients with dementia, along with interest in trainings. We conclude that dementia-specific training should be expanded in the field of dentistry, preferably already at university level.","Schaper, S.; Meyer-RoÌtz, S.; Bartels, C.; Wiltfang, J.; RoÌdig, T.; Schott, B.

Various engineered point spread functions (PSFs) have been introduced for measuring the orientation and rotational diffusion of dipole-like emitters, but the widely used Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) only evaluates performance for one specific orientation at a time. Here, we report a performance metric, termed variance upper bound (VUB), that yields a global maximum CRB for all possible molecular orientations, thereby enabling the measurement performance of any PSF to be computed efficiently (~1000× faster than calculating average CRB). Our VUB reveals that the simple polarized standard PSF provides robust and precise orientation measurements if emitters are near a refractive index interface.

170192,Risk of Covid-19 Mortality Among Patients With Preexisting Cerebrovascular Disease,2021,"Drawing on the Job Demand-Resource model this paper examines the influence of the social comparison orientation personality trait. It is hypothesized that high social comparison orientation will moderate the negative effect of job demands in the health impairment process on work engagement, mediated by a work-nonwork conflict. A total of 510 nurses from different healthcare centres participated in this study. PROCESS macro was used to test simple and moderated mediation. Results demonstrate that the negative indirect effect of job demands on work engagement via work-non work conflict appears only with low levels of social comparison orientation. Theoretical insights from social comparison literature and the work-nonwork interface into JD-R theory are integrated. The strengths of social comparison orientation employees are highlighted to reduce the depletion of resources needed to cope with non-work demands and promote work engagement.Alternate abstract: A partir de la teoría de las demandas y recursos (JD-R) se analiza el efecto del rasgo de personalidad de la orientación a la comparación social. Se postula que las personas con una gran orientación a la comparación social gestionarán mejor las exigencias laborales, de modo que su repercusión en el conflicto trabajo-no trabajo será menor, lo cual contribuirá a reducir también la repercusión negativa del conflicto en la implicación en el trabajo. Participaron en el estudio 510 profesionales de enfermería de diferentes centros de salud. Se utilizó la macro PROCESS para probar la mediación simple y moderada. Los resultados demuestran que el efecto indirecto negativo de las exigencias laborales en la implicación en el trabajo a través del conflicto trabajo-no trabajo aparece solo con un bajo nivel de orientación de comparación social. Este trabajo integra los conocimientos teóricos sobre comparación social y la interacción trabajo-no trabajo en la teoría JD-R. Se destaca la orientación a la comparación social de los empleados como un aspecto positivo para reducir el impacto negativo del agotamiento de los recursos en las exigencias no laborales e impulsar la implicación en el trabajo.","Martínez-Corts, Inés Manzanares Sandra Medina Francisco J.",Revista de Psicología del Trabajo y de las Organizaciones,https://doi.org/10.5093/jwop2021a3,242

Many people have turned to online social media platforms to share what they think and how they feel about the sudden impact the pandemic has brought upon us. This project aims to study public attitudes toward COVID-19 on Twitter, a popular social network platform. In particular, it focuses on discovering what issues around COVID-19 people are discussing, why they are interested in such topics, and how their emotions have evolved over time. The study further seeks to reveal potential associations between the breakout and any hidden idea previously unknown to the general public. The dataset was created by collecting approximately 150,000 tweets with keywords or hashtags related to COVID-19 over a course of four weeks with Python and Twitter API. A comprehensive analysis of the tweets was performed using natural language processing methodologies including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word embedding. The results suggest that many people may be failing to practice appropriate safety measures to stop the spread, despite their high interests in the COVID-19 crisis.

The first cases of MIS-C were diagnosed in Poland in May 2020. Since October 2020, a significant increase in the incidence of this new disease has been observed in Poland, reflecting the increased incidence of COVID-19 in the paediatric population. MIS-C develops as a result of dysregulation of the immune system occurring 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diagnosis is based on the following criteria: a set of clinical features (including fever and signs of multiple organ damage) and elevated inflammatory markers, with exclusion of other causes. The most common complications involve the cardiovascular system: acute myocardial damage with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, shock, and coronary artery abnormalities and arrhythmias. Mortality in Western Europe and the United States is around 1-2%. Appropriate management, including vital function support and immunomodulatory treatment, allows for a quick recovery in the vast majority of patients. This document is an updated guideline for the diagnostic and therapeutic management of children with suspected MIS-C in Poland.

Scientists around the world are looking for an effective vaccine against this virus.ObjectivesThe objective of our study was to assess the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine by paramedics.MethodsDescriptive and cross-sectional study including paramedics (nurses, orderlies) from the military hospital of Tunis. Data collection was carried out by a clinical psychologist. We studied the associations between the different characteristics of our population and the decision to accept or refuse vaccination against COVID-19.ResultsA total of 161 paramedics agreed to answer our questionnaire. The average age was 37.73 years. The average number of years worked was 14.95 years. There were 85 women (52.8%) and 76 men (47.2%). The rapid discovery of the vaccine was hoped for by 94.4%. Vaccination was considered a means of collective protection by 84.5%. However, only 52.8% agreed to be vaccinated by the COVID-19 vaccine. The main factors significantly associated with refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine were previous refusal of influenza vaccination (p = 0.006).ConclusionsApprehension about vaccination does not appear to be sparing the future COVID-19 vaccine.

171374,History of Plasma Therapy: a Currently Used Treatment Option for Covid-19,2021,"Objective: Various recommendations are being offered in order of priority in the diagnosis and treatment of urological diseases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) period. Since it may not be possible to provide information to all patients through telemedicine, additional methods are needed to reach all patients. This study aimed to determine the reliability and quality of YouTube videos that provide information on urological disorders during the COVID-19 period. Another aim was to assess the most shared and most viewed videos on urological disorders on YouTube and their usability as an additional resource in telemedicine during the pandemic. Materials and Methods: From 17 February 2020, to 31 July 2020, the following keywords were used to search videos on YouTube: “covid urology”, “covid andrology”, “covid fertility”, “covid male infertility”, “covid prostate”, “covid bladder”, “covid kidney”, “covid renal”, “covid testis”, “covid cancer”, “covid coitus”, “covid sex”, “covid sperm” and “covid erectile”;“coronavirus” was also used instead of “covid”. In total, 232 videos were evaluated by two urologists according to video characteristics. The number of total views, views per day, likes, dislikes, comments, video length, date of video upload and duration on YouTube was recorded. Finally, a total of 136 relevant English videos were included in the study. A 5-point modified DISCERN tool was used to assess reliability, whereas a 5-point Global Quality score (GQS) was used to evaluate quality. Cohen's kappa score was used to determine inter-rater agreement, while the intraclass correlation coefficient was used to evaluate inter-observer reliability. Results: All videos had a high DISCERN score [4, interquartile range (IQR) (3-5)] and GQS [5, IQR (4-5)] in general. Moreover, 20 (14.7%) videos containing information about “sexual life” and “effects of COVID-19 on sperm” were described as debated. Videos uploaded by “universities/ professional organisations/non-profit physician/physician groups” had higher scores (p<0.001). However, their rates of “number of views per day” (p=0.036) and “likes” (p<0.001) were lower. The majority of videos related to urology (63.9%) included conversations about andrological disorders. The median number of total views and number of views per day were also highest for videos related to andrology. Conclusion: Although andrological disorders are classified as a non-essential issue and andrological consultations are postponed during the COVID-19 period, the results show that the rate of YouTube videos related to andrology is even higher than uro-oncological diseases during this period. Therefore, it is important to share accurate and reliable information in this field. Our analysis shows that informative, easy-to-understand YouTube videos uploaded by “universities/professional organisations/non-profit physicians/physician groups” can be used as an additional method to telemedicine, especially for andrological disorders that do not require follow-up.","Selvi, Iacute; Baydilli, N.",Journal of Urological Surgery,https://doi.org/10.4274/jus.galenos.2020.0007,242

172222,Descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 deaths during the first wave of pandemic in India - a single center experience,2021-09-06,"Abstract To stay competitive in the marketplace, manufacturing firms that rely on high product variety should involve the customer in the product design process. However, customer interaction with the product at the design level could compromise the product functionality and the operational arrangement of the manufacturing system. To address these challenges, we aim to align the preferences of the design and manufacturing teams within a manufacturing firm in the context of mass customization. The preference of the design team is in terms of product modularity, associated with product upgradeability and flexibility. In the manufacturing team, complexity is a preference associated with cost and quality. In our research, the motivation for selecting these attributes is that product modularity is used to deal with product variety, and complexity is related to the uncertainty of product manufacturing. These two perspectives could support the manufacturing firm decision of selecting which product architecture is more convenient for a given operational arrangement and vice versa. We use a Multi-Attribute Utility function to assess the preferences of the design and manufacturing teams in terms of modularity and manufacturing complexity. We analyze the functional requirements of the product and then their mapping into the product architecture. Finally, we study the relationship of the product components to the operational arrangement of the manufacturing system. In addition, we include a case study in which we analyze two products and their relationship to a single manufacturing system, where the highest utility produces the best relationship between product design and manufacturing configuration complexity. By using this integrated approach, a manufacturer can decide to update the product design, the related operational configuration, or both.","Rincon-Guevara, Oscar; Samayoa, Jorge; Deshmukh, Abhijit",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314694; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314694,242

Aim: To investigate socio-demographic factors and professional practice associated with the risk of COVID-19 among HCWs in health establishments in Normandy, France Methods: A cross-sectional and 3 case-control studies were conducted in order to explore the possible risk factors that lead to SARS-CoV2 transmission within HCWs, based on an online questionnaire. The case-control studies focused on risk factors associated with care of COVID-19 patients, care of non COVID-19 patients and contacts between colleagues. Findings: Among 2,058 respondents, respectively 1,363 (66.2%) and 695 (33.8%) in medical and medico-social establishments, 301 (14.6%) reported having been infected by SARS-CoV2. When caring for COVID-19 patients, HCWs who declared wearing respirators, either for all patient care (ORa 0.39; 95% CI: 0.29-0.51) or only when exposed to aerosol-generating procedures (ORa 0.56; 95% CI: 0.43-0.70), had a lower risk of infection compared with HCWs who declared wearing mainly surgical masks. During care of non COVID-19 patients, wearing mainly a respirator was associated with a higher risk of infection (ORa 1.84; 95% CI: 1.06-3.37). An increased risk was also found for HCWs who changed uniform in workplace changing rooms (ORa 1.93; 95% CI: 1.63-2.29).

177752,Images of the month 2: A target sign in COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"Abstract In the age of digital manufacturing there is a need to elicit and transfer procedural knowledge between humans and machines. Having proper knowledge is essential in decision-making. The more the knowledge, the better decisions are made. To capture experiences and turn them into knowledge is fundamental in learning processes and knowledge development. Knowledge engineering and knowledge management have been subject for research for decades and several concepts about knowledge and knowledge transfer have been introduced, but a functional approach to exploit knowledge efficiently in manufacturing is still missing. In the era of Industry 4.0, humans and machines must be able to collaborate in such way that both can exploit the best abilities of each other in a manufacturing process. This paper introduces a procedural knowledge process (PKP) approach to capturing and defining unexpected events, while a process step is able to perform its required functions and transfer that information as machine-understandable knowledge about a failure mode. Function blocks (FBs), as per the IEC-61499 standard, have been proposed as a way to achieve distributed process planning in which the manufacturing process can adapt itself to runtime conditions, e.g. machine availability, etc. However, FBs are event-driven systems and the approach is limited to work under well-known runtime conditions, e.g. machine configurations and states, or deviations which are impossible to foresee in advance, for instance the outcome of a process failure mode effects analysis (PFMEA). The PKP introduced in this paper, aims at bridging this gap by integrating at runtime an expert operator’s solution based on root cause analysis (RCA) in an FB architecture, making the FB knowledge-driven systems, for further executions of the same without redesigning it. Natural language representations of procedural knowledge blocks (PKBs) allow to transfer procedural knowledge to human operators, i.e. explain the process flow of a machine decision, while machine representations of PKBs allow to embed procedural knowledge that is elicited from expert operators upon unexpected events into the FBs process. The resulting PKP enhances the FBs for smart industrial applications, such as the process planning use case described in this paper.","de Giorgio, Andrea; Lundgren, Magnus; Wang, Lihui",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316000; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316000,242
177887,Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19,,"Background People with liver disease are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, there has yet been an investigation of incidence burden, risk, and premature mortality across a wide range of liver conditions and cardiovascular outcomes. Methods We employed population-wide electronic health records (EHRs; from 1998-2020) consisting of almost 4 million adults to assess regional variations in disease burden of five liver conditions, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), autoimmune liver disease, chronic hepatitis B infection (HBV), chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV) and NAFLD, in England. We analysed regional differences in incidence rates for 17 manifestations of CVD in people with or without liver disease. The associations between biomarkers and comorbidities and risk of CVD in patients with liver disease were estimated using Cox models. For each liver condition, we estimated excess years of life lost (YLL) attributable to CVD (i.e., difference in YLL between people with or without CVD). Results The age-standardised incidence rate for any liver disease was 114.5 per 100,000 person years. The highest incidence was observed in NAFLD (85.5), followed by ALD (24.7), HCV (6.0), HBV (4.1) and autoimmune liver disease (3.7). Regionally, the North West and North East regions consistently exhibited high incidence burden. Age-specific incidence rate analyses revealed that the peak incidence for liver disease of non-viral aetiology is reached in individuals aged 50-59 years. Patients with liver disease had a 2-fold higher incidence burden of CVD (2,634.6 per 100,000 persons) compared to individuals without liver disease (1,339.7 per 100,000 persons). When comparing across liver diseases, atrial fibrillation was the most common initial CVD presentation while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was the least common. We noted strong positive associations between body mass index and current smoking and risk of CVD. Patients who also had diabetes, hypertension, proteinuric kidney disease, chronic kidney disease, diverticular disease and gastro-oesophageal reflex disorders had a higher risk of CVD, as do patients with low albumin, raised C-reactive protein and raised International Normalized Ratio levels. All types of CVD were associated with shorter life expectancies. When evaluating excess YLLs by age of CVD onset and by liver disease type, differences in YLLs, when comparing across CVD types, were more pronounced at younger ages. Conclusions We developed a public online app (https://lailab.shinyapps.io/cvd_in_liver_disease/) to showcase results interactively. We provide a blueprint that revealed previously underappreciated clinical factors related to the risk of CVD, which differed in the magnitude of effects across liver diseases. We found significant geographical variations in the burden of liver disease and CVD, highlighting the need to devise local solutions. Targeted policies and regional initiatives addressing underserved communities might help improve equity of access to CVD screening and treatment.","Chang, W. H.; Mueller, S.; Chung, S.-C.; Foster, G.

Creative approaches are therefore required to resolve the surging facemask waste disposal issue in an economical and environmentally friendly manner. In an attempt to resolve the evolving global waste challenge, the present study has assessed the economic and environmental performances of converting N95 facemasks to steam and electricity via a combined heat and power plant, to ethanol via a syngas fermentation process, and to an energy-dense gasoline-like oil product via a hydrothermal liquefaction process. These processes were assessed using ""conceptual"" process models developed using ASPEN plus as the process simulation tool. Economic and environment assessments were undertaken using net present values (NPVs) and the rate of potential environmental impacts (PEIs) respectively, as sufficient performance measures. Therefore, the present study was able to establish that the conversion of waste N95 facemask to syngas prior to a fermentation process for ethanol production constituted the least economical and least environmental friendly process with a negative NPV and the highest rate of PEI (1.59 PEI/h) value calculated. The NPV values calculated for N95 facemask waste conversion to steam and electricity and energy-dense oil processes were US$ 36.6 x 10(6) and US$ 53 x 10(6) respectively, suggesting the preference for the production of a valuable energy-dense oil product. Furthermore, it was observed that when the environmental performance of both processes was considered, rates of PEIs of 1.20 and 0.28 PEI/h were estimated for the energy-dense oil production process and the steam and electricity generation process, respectively. Therefore, the study was able to establish that the utilisation of waste N95 facemask for steam and electricity generation and for generating an energy-dense oil product are both promising approaches that could aid in the resolution of the waste issue if both environmental and economic performances constitute crucial considerations.","Okoro, O.

When the concept of NBS for societal challenges was first defined by the EC in 2017, financing was recognised as one of the major challenges to its mainstreaming. The complexity of NBS finance has its origin in the multiple benefits/stakeholders involved, which obscures the argument for both public and private sector investment. Since 2017, subsequent waves of EU research- and innovation-funded projects have substantially contributed to the knowledge base of funding and business models for NBS, particularly in the urban context.

This disease is a health emergency due to its high level of infectiousness and due to the non-availability of any specific treatment. COVID 19 is a health emergency due to its high infectiousness, as currently, there is no treatment available Objectives: To determine the significance of physiological and haematological parameters in the diagnosis of COVID 19 infection and compare these parameters according to comorbid conditions during the disease progression among mild COVID 19 patients. Methodology: This retrospective, observational study was carried out in a designated tertiary care hospital to address COVID19 patients in the Pune district. Various parameters like age, height, weight, BMI, various physiological variables, haematological parameters, and CRP levels were assessed among 202 COVID 19 diagnosed patients on day one and on day 10 of the hospital stay. Results: Out of the total study participants, 112 were male, and 90 were females with an average age of (43.43 +/- 15.07) and (51.8 +/- 16.35) respectively. Conclusion: Study of physiological and haematological parameters and their interrelation will help in understanding the impact of COVID 19 infection on the reactive inflammatory responses and will help in understanding the prognosis of the disease.","Palve, S.

They can indicate the fixed patterns or conserved motifs in a batch of DNA or protein sequences. However, most of the popular sequence logo generators can only draw logos for sequences of the same length, let alone for groups of sequences with different characteristics besides lengths. To solve these problems, we developed MetaLogo, which can draw sequence logos for sequences of different lengths or from different groups in one single plot and align multiple logos to highlight the sequence pattern dynamics across groups, thus allowing users to investigate functional motifs in a more delicate and dynamic perspective. We provide users a public MetaLogo web server (http://metalogo.omicsnet.org), a standalone Python package (https://github.com/labomics/MetaLogo), and also a built-in web server available for local deployment. Using MetaLogo, users can draw informative, customized, aesthetic, and publishable sequence logos without any programming experience.","Chen, Yaowen; He, Zhen; Men, Yahui; Dong, Guohua; Hu, Shuofeng; Ying, Xiaomin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456038,242

However, established methodologies for national freight transport emission assessments do not consider such international perspectives sufficiently. This research aims to show how logistic responsibility may be used in ex post transport CO2 emission assessments, for macrologistic or supply chain levels. We propose an original approach to estimate and allocate CO2 emissions generated by international freight transport between trade countries. The proposed method relies on the applied Incoterms® rules in sales contracts. A new indicator, the index of responsibility for transport emissions (RTE-index), is introduced to allocate bilateral trade-related transport CO2 emissions. This is the first time that the Incoterms® clauses are used for macrologistic assessments of international trade-related transport CO2 emissions. Our approach is exemplified using bilateral trade-related transport flows between Serbia and other European countries. The introduced RTE-index is expected to help visualise average national trade-related transport CO2 emission responsibilities;increase awareness regarding environmental considerations among trade parties, logistics companies, and national organisations;and provide new perspectives for environmental transport policy actions.","Stojanović, Đurđica Veličković Marko",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031138,242

Design: Observational cohort study Setting: Nationwide cohort of patients receiving care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, a large integrated US national healthcare system Participants: 9,058 patients admitted to a Veterans Affairs Medical Center between June 7, 2020-December 5, 2020 within 14-days after SARS-CoV-2 positive test; exclusion criteria include less than a 48 hour stay, receipt of prior systemic corticosteroids, and no indication of acute medical care for COVID-19. Main outcome measure: 90-day all-cause mortality Results: Of 9,058 total patients (95% men, median age 71 years, 27% black), 6,825 (75%) were not on IRS within 48 hours. Among the 3,025 patients on no oxygen, 598 (20%) received corticosteroids and 283 (9%) died; of 3,800 patients on low-flow nasal cannula oxygen (NC), 2,808 (74%) received corticosteroids and 514 (13%) died. In stratified, inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazards models comparing those who did and did not receive corticosteroids, patients on no oxygen experienced an 89% increased risk for 90-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33 to 2.68); there was weak evidence of increased mortality among patients on NC (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.57). Results were robust in subgroup analyses including restricting corticosteroids to dexamethasone, and in sensitivity analyses employing different modeling approaches. Conclusions: In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, we found no evidence of a mortality benefit associated with early initiation of corticosteroids among those on no oxygen or NC in the first 48 hours, though there was evidence of potential harm. These real-world findings support that clinicians should consider withholding corticosteroids in these populations and further clinical trials may be warranted.","Crothers, K.; DeFaccio, R.; Tate, J.; Alba, P.

The major barrier between pig and human is mainly cellular heterogeneity and immune incompatibilities. Myriad scRNA-seq data of human has been reported, but the counterpart in pig is scarce. Here, we applied scRNA-seq technology to study the cellular heterogeneity of 3 months old pig lungs, generating the single-cell atlas of 13,580 cells covering 16 major cell types. Based on this data, we systematically characterized transcription factor regulatory networks, cell-cell communications in each cell type, and comparison of them and those in human lung. We first presented a comprehensive and openly accessible online platform, ScdbLung, which was composed of three functional modules (Marker, Cluster, and Download) and dedicated to exploiting the valuable resources of lung scRNA-seq data across four mammalian species. Overall, our scRNA-seq atlas of domestic pig lung, conserved transcription factor regulatory networks and cell-cell communications between domestic pig and human, and ScdbLung could provide guidance for porcine lung research and clinical applicability.","Zhang, Lijing; Zhu, Jiacheng; Wang, Haoyu; Xia, Jun; Liu, Ping; Chen, Fang; Jiang, Hui; Wu, Weiying; Luo, Lihua; Chen, Dongsheng; Zhang, Xingliang",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.20.423716,242

We conducted a prospective qualitative study at a large tertiary care hospital in Germany where RDTs are used to screen incoming patients. We relied on semi-structured observations of the screening situation, as well as on 30 in-depth interviews with hospital staff (members of the regulatory body, department heads, staff working on the wards, staff training providers on how to perform RDTs, and providers performing RDTs as part of the screening) and patients being screened with RDTs. Despite some initial reservations, RDTs were rapidly accepted and adopted as the best available tool for accessible and reliable screening. Decentralized implementation efforts resulted in different procedures being operationalized across departments. Procedures were continuously refined based on initial experiences (e.g., infrastructural or scheduling constraints), pandemic dynamics (growing infection rates), and changing regulations (e.g., screening of all external personnel). To reduce interdepartmental tension, stakeholders recommended high-level, consistently communicated and enforced regulations. Despite challenges, RDT-based screening for all incoming patients was observed to be feasible and acceptable among implementers and patients, and merits continued consideration in the context of rising infections and stagnating vaccination rates.","Wachinger, J.; McMahon, S.

Recent whole antibody-based investigations have shown significant distal effects between the variable (V) and constant (C)-regions that can be mitigated by the different hinge regions of the human IgA subtypes A1 and A2. Diving deeper into the mechanisms underlying this, systematic VH manipulations retaining the CDRs were performed on a panel of 28 IgA1s and A2s across the Trastuzumab and Pertuzumab models, revealed distal effects on FcαRI binding. Further insights from structural modelling showed these effects to also be mitigated by the differing glycosylation patterns in IgA1 and 2 to explain reversal of trends of IgA1s and 2s effected by slight changes in the CDRs. IgAs bound at the Fc showed similar trends but magnitudes better binding to Her2 with that bound by ppL, showing that ppL can sterically hinder Her2 antigen binding. Contrary to canonical knowledge, we found strong evidence of IgAs binding SpG that was narrowed to be at the CH2-3 region, and that the likely binding with SpA was beyond VH3 FWR and most likely at the CH1. VH1 was found to be the most suitable framework (FWRs) for CDR-grafting for both IgA1 and 2. With relevance to interactions with the microbiome at mucosal surfaces, mechanistic insight of how these IgAs can interact bacterial superantigens proteins G, A, and L are also discovered for potential future interventions.

Overall, our findings show that government restrictions are associated with negative market returns, possibly due to the anticipated adverse effect to the economy. The adverse effect is more evident when closures are imposed. The market response to economic stimulus is mild but varies depending on the type of intervention imposed, much as with the health measures. Public campaigns may raise public awareness about COVID-19, but they can also increase the public's fear of the pandemic, reflected in the negative response in capital markets.

A better knowledge of their epidemiology could help to improve the outcome of these diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Although the clinical criteria of the American-European Consensus Conference definitions for ALI and ARDS are simple, there is a risk of misclassification due to a poor reliability. Except for new emerging infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, the etiology of ALI/ARDS has remained the same for several years. The only recent innovation is the hypothesis that pulmonary ARDS and extrapulmonary ARDS could be different clinical entities. In recent years, there has been a special interest in the study of genetic predisposition to development ALI/ARDS. Recent studies have estimated the incidence of these diseases to be between 15 and 34 cases per 100,000 inhabitants per year. This wide range could stem from differences in the methodology used to calculate the incidence or could be a true variation due to regional differences. Mortality rate of ALI/ARDS have remained steady for several years. Respiratory failure is the cause of the death in less than 20% of the patients. SUMMARY The epidemiology of ALI and ARDS has some issues to improve, such as the accuracy of the clinical criteria of ALI/ARDS. Future research must to include study of genetic polymorphisms of the mediators involve in the development of ALI/ARDS. Studies to define better the population at risk are necessary to estimate better their true incidence.","Frutos-Vivar, Fernando; Nin, Nicolás; Esteban, Andrés",Current opinion in critical care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15166842/,242

The virus can affect the upper respiratory tract and the reproductive tract, and some strains can cause a nephritis. Different serotypes and genetic types of the virus have been identified worldwide and for the most part do not cross-protect. In addition, new types of the virus continue to arise due to mutations and recombination events in the viral genome, making this virus difficult to identify and extremely difficult to control. Surveillance and identification of IBV types is extremely important for control of the disease and the advancement of molecular methods have aided in this pursuit. Genetic typing of IBV, which involves reverse transcription-PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the S1 glycoprotein gene, has revolutionized diagnosis and identification of this virus by making it possible to type and compare the relatedness of a large number of virus isolates in a short period of time. The purpose of this review is to give an update on the strains of IBV currently circulating in commercial chickens worldwide and hopefully to present a clear picture of the relationship between many of these viruses. The information on IBV types presented herein is from published manuscripts, submissions to GenBank, our own unpublished data, and personal communications with scientists and diagnosticians working with IBV worldwide.","Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23397833/,242

METHODS Experimental units were 14 healthy pups of Boxer breed, aged 60 days. The animals were divided into three groups. One animal from each litter was included in a control group and the remaining animals were divided into two groups: one inoculated with strain 4083, and another one inoculated with strain SPA14. Gelatinous capsules coated with enteric-coating solution were used for the inoculation of strains. E. coli isolation from feces was performed for all tested animals, and the extracted DNA was subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). RESULTS All infected animals presented diarrhea and had the gene eae amplified by PCR. CONCLUSION The efficiency of PCR for the studied strains indicates that this technique can be recommended for the diagnosis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli as a differential from other pathogens causing diarrhea. It may also be used in the future to verify whether other virulence factors (bfpA gene and EAF plasmid) persist after infection and to assess the pathogenicity of these bacteria.","Gouveia, Eliana Maria Ferreira; Silva, Iandara Schettert; Nakazato, Gerson; Araujo, Flábio Ribeiro de; Chang, Marilene Rodrigues",Acta cirurgica brasileira,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21445479/,242

Binding of TGEV to villous enterocytes from the jejuna of newborn pigs is saturable and at a higher level than that of binding of virus to newborn cryptal enterocytes or to enterocytes from older piglets (H. M. Weingartl and J. B. Derbyshire, Vet. Microbiol. 35:23-32, 1993). The distribution of APN in enterocytes in the jejuna of neonatal and 3 week-old-piglets, as determined by the measurement of enzymatic activity and by labeling of the cells with an anti-APN monoclonal antibody, did not correspond with the reported distribution of saturable binding sites on enterocytes. Monoclonal antibodies, which were prepared against plasma membranes derived from enterocytes harvested from the upper villi of newborn pigs, blocked the replication of TGEV, but not the porcine respiratory coronavirus, in ST cells and immunoprecipitated a 200-kDa protein in ST cell lysates. This protein was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and by fluorescence-activated cell scanning to be present on the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs but to be lacking on the cryptal enterocytes of newborn pigs and on the villous and cryptal enterocytes of 3-week-old piglets. Since this distribution of the protein corresponds to the previously demonstrated distribution of saturable binding sites, we conclude that the 200-kDa protein may be an additional receptor for TGEV which is restricted to the villous enterocytes of newborn pigs and which contributes to the age sensitivity of these animals to the virus.","Weingartl, H M; Derbyshire, J B",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7933108/,242

METHODS Data from 961 patients in two 1-year double-blind, multicenter, pediatric studies of similar design were analyzed: 250 infants (aged 3-23 months) were randomized 4 : 1 and 711 children (aged 2-17 years) were randomized 2 : 1 to receive pimecrolimus cream 1% or vehicle, respectively. Emollients were used by all patients to alleviate dry skin and, at the first signs or symptoms of AD, pimecrolimus or vehicle was applied twice daily to prevent progression to flares. If flares occurred in either group, moderately potent topical corticosteroids were mandated. RESULTS Pimecrolimus was applied for 68.4% (infants) and 53.8% (children) of study days, and frequency of use of pimecrolimus decreased over time, reflecting improvement in disease control. The mean total body surface area affected decreased continuously over time. Significantly more patients in the pimecrolimus than control groups were maintained without corticosteroid therapy (infants: 63.7% vs. 34.8%, P < 0.001; children: 57.4% vs. 31.6%, P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION The need for pimecrolimus therapy decreases over time as the patients' disease improves. Hence, once long-term management of AD with pimecrolimus is established, the burden of disease for both the patient and the caregiver decreases significantly and disease-free periods become more frequent.","Papp, Kim; Staab, Doris; Harper, John; Potter, Paul; Puig, Lluis; Ortonne, J-P; Molloy, Stephen; Barbier, Nathalie; Paul, Carle",International journal of dermatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15569038/,242

In contrast, Dengue virus infection is enhanced in cells expressing either attachment factor. The West Nile virus envelope (E) protein contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at residue 154, whereas Dengue virus E contains sites at residues 153 and 67. We introduced a glycosylation site at position 67 into West Nile virus E. Reporter virus particles pseudotyped with this E protein infected cells using either CD209 or CD209L. We also introduced glycosylation sites at several novel positions. All sites allowed CD209L-mediated infection, but only a subset promoted CD209 use. As seen for other viruses, mannose-rich glycans on West Nile virus were required for its interactions with CD209. Surprisingly, however, mannose-rich glycans were not required for CD209L-mediated infection. Complex glycans, particularly N-acetylglucosamine-terminated structures, were able to mediate reporter virus particle interactions with CD209L. We propose that CD209L recognizes glycosylated flaviviruses with broad specificity, whereas CD209 is selective for flaviviruses bearing mannose-rich glycans. The location of the N-linked glycosylation sites on a virion determines the types of glycans incorporated, thus controlling viral tropism for CD209-expressing cells.","Davis, Carl W; Mattei, Lisa M; Nguyen, Hai-Yen; Ansarah-Sobrinho, Camilo; Doms, Robert W; Pierson, Theodore C",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17001080/,242

China's response culminated in legislation to control HIV/AIDS-the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations. Three major initiatives are being scaled up concurrently. First, the government has prioritised interventions to control the epidemic in injection drug users, sex workers, men who have sex with men, and plasma donors. Second, routine HIV testing is being implemented in populations at high risk of infection. Third, the government is providing treatment for infected individuals. These bold programmes have emerged from a process of gradual and prolonged dialogue and collaboration between officials at every level of government, researchers, service providers, policymakers, and politicians, and have led to decisive action.","Wu, Zunyou; Sullivan, Sheena G; Wang, Yu; Rotheram-Borus, Mary Jane; Detels, Roger",Lancet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17321313/,242
198528,Breastfeeding and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Vaccination: Position Statement of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics/Advisory Committee on Vaccination and Immunization Practices.,2021-05-28,"AIM The restoration of the digestive tract by performing an esophago-jejunal anastomosis (EJA) is a crucial step of the total gastric and distal esophagus surgical resection for esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) cancer. We have already ideated and tested on a cadaver model an innovative technique which could be useful to minimize the risk of complications related to the phase of securing the anvil of the circular stapler prior to perform the EJA. This surgical technique was derived from the well-known ""double-stapling Knight and Griffen"" one that was described for the rectal resection. We used the following described technique in 20 patients with EGJ cancer and it is efficient, reliable, safe, easy to learn and easy to perform. MATERIALS AND METHODS From August 2014 to May 2015, 20 patients (14 male and 6 female) underwent surgery for esophagogastric junction cancer: In all patients a distal esophageal resection and total gastrectomy was performed. Through the trans-hiatal access, the free margins of the esophageal stump were suspended and the anvil of a circular stapler on a new dedicated and registered support bar was inserted into the lumen. Subsequently, the linear suturing stapler is closed over the bar and then fired to suture the distal stump of the esophagus; after the confirmation of a negative margin, the bar is retracted and the push-rod of the anvil is pulled out through the linear suture. Finally, the anastomosis is performed with the classic technique by using a circular stapler. RESULTS No postoperative mortality occurred; postoperative course has been uneventful for 18 patients. One patient developed anastomotic fistula that has been treated conservatively with endoscopic prothesis, removed after 20 days. One patient developed in 3 POD myocardial infarction Mean Hospital stay has been 14 days (range 7-20 days). CONCLUSIONS The aim of our new procedure is the insertion the anvil of a common circular stapler without handsewn securing; this is to reduce the technical difficulties related to the hand-sewn securing into a deep and narrow anatomic location, typical of the trans-hiatal approach.

199609,Des-Arg9 bradykinin and bradykinin potentially trigger cytokine storm in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is caused by preterm neonatal lung injury and results in oxygen dependency and pulmonary hypertension. Current clinical management fails to reduce the incidence of BPD, which calls for novel therapies. Fetal rabbits have a lung development that mimics humans and can be used as a translational model to test novel treatment options. In preterm rabbits, exposure to hyperoxia leads to parenchymal changes, yet vascular damage has not been studied in this model. In this study we document the early functional and structural changes of the lung vasculature in preterm rabbits that are induced by hyperoxia after birth. Pulmonary artery Doppler measurements, micro-CT barium angiograms and media thickness of peripheral pulmonary arteries were affected after seven days of hyperoxia when compared to controls. The parenchyma was also affected both at the functional and structural level. Lung function testing showed higher tissue resistance and elastance, with a decreased lung compliance and lung capacity. Histologically hyperoxia leads to fewer and larger alveoli with thicker walls, less developed distal airways and more inflammation than normoxia. In conclusion, we show that the rabbit model develops pulmonary hypertension and developmental lung arrest after preterm lung injury, which parallel the early changes in human BPD. Thus it enables the testing of pharmaceutical agents that target the cardiovascular compartment of the lung for further translation towards the clinic.","Jiménez, Julio; Richter, Jute; Nagatomo, Taro; Salaets, Thomas; Quarck, Rozenn; Wagennar, Allard; Wang, Hongmei; Vanoirbeek, Jeroen; Deprest, Jan; Toelen, Jaan",International journal of molecular sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27783043/,242

VAP prevention will probably be most effective via a multifaceted approach, which includes meticulous attention to basic infection-control methods during patient care, proper patient positioning, oral hygiene, and removal of the ETT as soon as indicated. Modification of the ETT to reduce microaspiration and/or biofilm formation may also play an important role in VAP prevention. However, despite numerous studies of various such interventions, there is insufficient evidence upon which to base strong recommendations, and important safety concerns remain regarding the use of some devices. Most importantly, cost-effectiveness data are lacking for modified ETTs designed to prevent VAP. It is critical that future studies of ETTs designed to prevent VAP be adequately powered to demonstrate efficacy on important patient outcomes and safety, in addition to cost-effectiveness.","Deem, Steven; Treggiari, Miriam M",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20667152/,242
200399,C-Reactive protein as a prognostic indicator in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family Arteriviridae of the order Nidovirales. Four envelope proteins have hitherto been identified in EAV particles: the predominant membrane proteins M and G(L), the unglycosylated small envelope protein E, and the nonabundant membrane glycoprotein G(S). In this study, we established that the products of EAV open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and ORF4 (designated GP(3) and GP(4), respectively) are also minor structural glycoproteins. The proteins were first characterized by various analyses after in vitro translation of RNA transcripts in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes. We subsequently expressed ORF3 and -4 in baby hamster kidney cells by using the vaccinia virus expression system and, finally, analyzed the GP(3) and GP(4) proteins synthesized in EAV-infected cells. The results showed that GP(4) is a class I integral membrane protein of 28 kDa with three functional N-glycosylation sites and with little, if any, of its carboxy terminus exposed. Both after independent expression and in EAV-infected cells, the protein localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as demonstrated biochemically by analysis of its oligosaccharide side chains and as visualized directly by immunofluorescence studies. GP(3), on the other hand, is a heavily glycosylated protein whose hydrophobic amino terminus is not cleaved off. It is an integral membrane protein anchored by either or both of its hydrophobic terminal domains and with no parts detectably exposed cytoplasmically. Also, GP(3) localizes in the ER when expressed independently and in the context of an EAV infection. Only a small fraction of the GP(3) and GP(4) proteins synthesized in infected cells ends up in virions. Most, but not all, of the oligosaccharides of these virion glycoproteins are biochemically mature. Our results bring the number of EAV envelope proteins to six.","Wieringa, Roeland; de Vries, Antoine A F; Raamsman, Martin J B; Rottier, Peter J M",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12368326/,242
200489,RE: Immediate Shockwave Lithotripsy vs Delayed Shockwave Lithotripsy After Urgent Ureteral Stenting in Patients with Ureteral or Pyeloureteral Urolithiasis: A Matched-Pair Analysis,2021,"Atopic eczema (AE) has a lifetime prevalence of between 15 and 20% in industrialized countries, but a very low prevalence in rural Africa. The 'atopic eczema epidemic' has developed in industrialized countries within the last four decades. The disease has a strong genetic influence, so environmental factors must be responsible for the dramatic increase in disease prevalence. It is therefore fair to consider what interventions may change its prevalence. In this article, several factors are considered: the increased number of doctors in industrialized countries, the development of drugs like topical steroids and emollients, the 'demanding parents' and 'old mother' syndromes, introduction of vaccination programmes, allergen exposure, breastfeeding and the possible beneficial effects of probiotics. In 90% of children with AE, onset is before the age of 5. Its course runs over years. Approximately two out of three outgrow the disease between 7 and 12 years of age. Although its cause is unknown, type I allergic reactions are common and allergen avoidance has been attempted in many studies as a preventive measure in atopic dermatitis. However, results are rather disappointing. The use of probiotics, i.e. daily intake of Lactobacillus, has proven effective in preventing, or at least delaying, the development of atopic eczema. So has breastfeeding, although some studies cannot confirm its beneficial effect. Therapeutic interventions using antihistamines, desensitisation and control of skin inflammation using topical steroids have not proven successful in shortening the course of atopic eczema, although controlled studies are lacking. The use of emollients has, however, a documented effect in up to one of three children with mild atopic eczema. It will be interesting to observe if the new topical immuno-modulators, tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, may be able to shorten the natural course of the disease.","Thestrup-Pedersen, K",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17163931/,242

In the COVID-19 pandemic the vulnerability of older people has been highlighted. Not only has the pandemic taken the lives of many older people, it has also exposed ageism in different settings-e.g., discrimination in access to health care, inadequate protection of older people in care homes and of young people's mental health, and stereotypical media portrayals that pit generations against each other. Consensus on the meaning of ageism has remained elusive and there is insufficient evidence on the topic. The social determinants of health are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes and include the conditions in which people are born, grow up, and live and the wider set of forces and systems that shape the conditions of daily life. Globally, ageism affects billions of people: at least one in two people hold ageist attitudes against older adults, with rates much higher in lower-income countries. Ageism impacts all aspects of older people's health. For instance, it shortens their lifespan, worsens their physical and mental health, hinders recovery from disability, and accelerates cognitive decline. Ageism also exacerbates social isolation and loneliness and reduces access to employment, education, and health care, all of which impact health.

The disease has created a system wide worsening shortage of N95, medical masks, and other personal protective equipment (PPE) that is regularly used by healthcare personnel and emergency service providers for their protection. AIM: Considering the number of infected patients and the stressed supplies of PPE, reuse of PPE can serve as an efficient contingency plan. Multiple studies have investigated the effect of different decontamination methods. METHODS: We chose the most user-friendly, easily scalable viral decontamination methods, including ultraviolet irradiation and heat treatment. In this paper, we investigated a unique approach to reuse the mask by creating a hybrid model that efficiently sanitizes the infected mask. RESULTS: The advantages of the proposed hybrid model as compared to the respective single arms is its decontamination efficacy, operational speed, as well as the number of reuse cycles as verified by mathematical analysis and simulation. This model is mainly intended for medical PPE but can also be used for other domestic and personal sanitization during the COVID-19 pandemic. As per the situation, the hybrid system can be used as standalone systems also. This sanitization process is not only limited to the elimination of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 but can be extended to any other infectious agents. Thus, our results indicate that the proposed hybrid system is more effective, meets disinfection criterion and time saving for the reuse of respirators and PPE.","Banerjee, Rajib; Roy, Pulakesh; Das, Surajeet; Paul, Manash K",Am. j. infect. control,,242
203522,COVID-19 findings identified in chest computed tomography: a pictorial essay,2020,"Pooling of samples can increase lab capacity when using Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect diseases such as COVID-19. However, pool testing is typically performed via an adaptive testing strategy which requires a feedback loop in the lab and at least two PCR runs to confirm positive results. This can cost precious time. We discuss a non-adaptive testing method where each sample is distributed in a prescribed manner over several pools, and which yields reliable results after one round of testing. More precisely, assuming knowledge about the overall incidence rate, we calculate explicit error bounds on the number of false positives which scale favourably with pool size and sample multiplicity. This allows for hugely streamlined PCR testing and cuts in detection times for a large-scale testing scenario. A viable consequence of this method could be real-time screening of entire communities, frontline healthcare workers and international flight passengers, for example, using the PCR machines currently in operation.","Täufer, Matthias",J Theor Biol,,242

Declines in energy expenditure resulting from canceled physical education classes and reduced physical activity may elevate childhood obesity risk. This study estimated the impact of COVID-19 on childhood obesity. METHODS: A microsimulation model simulated the trajectory of a nationally representative kindergarten cohort's body mass index z-scores and childhood obesity prevalence from April 2020 to March 2021 under the control scenario without COVID-19 and under the 4 alternative scenarios with COVID-19-Scenario 1: 2-month nationwide school closure in April and May 2020; Scenario 2: Scenario 1 followed by a 10% reduction in daily physical activity in the summer from June to August; Scenario 3: Scenario 2 followed by 2-month school closure in September and October; and Scenario 4: Scenario 3 followed by an additional 2-month school closure in November and December. RESULTS: Relative to the control scenario without COVID-19, Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4 were associated with an increase in the mean body mass index z-scores by 0.056 (95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.055-0.056), 0.084 (95%CI: 0.084-0.085), 0.141 (95%CI: 0.140-0.142), and 0.198 (95%CI: 0.197-0.199), respectively, and an increase in childhood obesity prevalence by 0.640 (95%CI: 0.515-0.765), 0.972 (95%CI: 0.819-1.126), 1.676 (95%CI: 1.475-1.877), and 2.373 (95%CI: 2.135-2.612) percentage points, respectively.

With an ultrafine fiber diameter ([~] 200 nm) and a small pore size ([~] 1.5 {micro}m), the optimized membranes caught 99.2% of the aerosols of the murine hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), a coronavirus surrogate for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, rose bengal was used as the photosensitizer for the membranes because of its excellent reactivity in generating virucidal singlet oxygen, and the membranes rapidly inactivated 98.9% of MHV-A59 in virus-laden droplets only after 15 min irradiation of simulated reading light. Singlet oxygen damaged the virus genome and impaired virus binding to host cells, which elucidated the mechanism of disinfection at a molecular level. Membrane robustness was also evaluated, and no efficiency reduction for filtering MHV-A59 aerosols was observed after the membranes being exposed to both indoor light and sunlight for days. Nevertheless, sunlight exposure photobleached the membranes, reduced singlet oxygen production, and compromised the performance of disinfecting MHV-A59 in droplets. In contrast, the membranes after simulated indoor light exposure maintained their excellent disinfection performance. In summary, photosensitized electrospun nanofibrous membranes have been developed to capture and kill airborne environmental pathogens under ambient conditions, and they hold promise for broad applications as personal protective equipment and indoor air filters. SynopsisPhotosensitized electrospun nanofibrous filters with excellent capture-and-kill performance against coronaviruses were designed and implemented to prevent the airborne transmission of COVID-19.

The purpose of our study was to look at the effect of contamination contamination obsession on prehospital delay compared with other measurements during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHOD: A total of 139 patients with acute STEMI admitted to our heart center from 20 March 2020 to 20 June 2020 were included in this study. If the time interval between the estimated onset of symptoms and admission to the emergency room was &gt;120 min, it was considered as a prehospital delay. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Padua Inventory-Washington State University Revision (PI-WSUR) test were used to assess Contamination-Obbsessive compulsive disorder (C-OCD). RESULT: The same period STEMI count compared to the previous year decreased 25%. The duration of symptoms onset to hospital admission was longer in the first month compared to second and third months (180 (120-360), 120 (60-180), and 105 (60-180), respectively;P = 0.012). Multivariable logistic regression (model-2) was used to examine the association between 7 candidate predictors (age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, smoking, pain-onset time, and coronary artery disease (CAD) history), PI-WSUR C-OCD, and admission month with prehospital delay. Among variables, PI-WSUR C-OCD and admission month were independently associated with prehospital delay (OR 5.36 (2.11-13.61) (P = 0.01);0.26 (0.09-0.87) p &lt; 0.001] respectively]. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that contamination obsession was associated with prehospital delay of STEMI patients, however anxiety and depression level was not associated during the pandemic.","Karagoz, A.; Keskin, B.; Kultursay, B.; Ceneli, D.; Akbal, O.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) of dental practitioners regarding the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) pandemic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed among dentists across the globe using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling. The questionnaire was divided into 4 sections: the 1st one contained personal information, whereas the 2nd, 3rd and 4th sections assessed knowledge (11 questions), attitudes (6 questions) and practices (7 questions) of the dentists. The data was subjected to the Shapiro-Wilk test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), multivariate linear regression, and Pearson's correlation; 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated and odds ratio (OR) was obtained. The analysis was done using IBM SPSS for Windows, v. 21.0. RESULTS: The total number of the responses received (860) was divided with regard to various continents (Asia, Americas - North and South, Europe, Africa, and other - Australia and Antarctica). The largest number of dentists came from the Asian continent (264; 30.7%). Most dentists had a degree of MDS (Master of Dental Science) (301; 35.0%), followed by BDS (Bachelor of Dental Surgery) (282; 32.8%) and DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) (226; 26.3%). High/Good knowledge and practice scores were observed among 92.7% and 79.5 % of the dentists, respectively. Good knowledge scores were significantly associated with qualifications (p = 0.04) and years of practice (p = 0.02); good practice scores were associated with qualifications only (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The dentists were found to have good knowledge and practice scores, which is important to combat COVID-19. They are advised to follow the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in their clinics, and sensitize their staff so that no stone is left unturned in defeating this pandemic.","Kamate, Shivalingesh Krishnappa; Sharma, Swati; Thakar, Sahil; Srivastava, Divya; Sengupta, Kaushikee; Hadi, Ahmed Jhurry; Chaudhary, Alankrita; Joshi, Ruby; Dhanker, Kuldeep",Dent Med Probl,,242
212487,Risk of Severe COVID-19 Outcomes Among Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis in the United States,2021,"BACKGROUND: The role of portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters for supplemental aerosol mitigation during exercise testing is unknown and might be relevant during COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 minutes plus 5 minutes of pretest quiet breathing and 3 minutes of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722 ± 1,484/L vs 96 ± 124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 µm), 1,339 ± 1,281/L vs 76 ± 104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 µm), and 333 ± 209/L vs 17 ± 19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 µm) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96% ± 2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Garzona-Navas, Andres; Sajgalik, Pavol; Csecs, Ibolya; Askew, J Wells; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Niven, Alexander S; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G",Chest,,242

Specifically, we focus on the strategies utilities have used to keep employees safe from the virus and plans for workforce shortages. One important strategy we identify is reliance on mutual aid agreements, where utilities agree to send staff and equipment to other utilities in times of crisis. We also explore the role of a municipal utility association in coordinating response.

216637,Concurrent COVID-19 infection in children with acute appendicitis: a report of three cases,2021,"Many meta-analyses have been published about the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19. Most of them included observational studies, and few have assessed HCQ as a prophylaxis or evaluated its safety profile. We searched multiple databases and preprint servers for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed HCQ for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. We summarized the effect of HCQ on mortality, viral clearance, and other clinical outcomes. Out of 768 papers screened, 21 RCTs with a total of 14,138 patients were included. A total of 9 inpatient and 3 outpatient RCTs assessed mortality in 8,596 patients with a pooled risk difference of 0.01 [95% CI 0.00, 0.03, I2= 1%, P=0.07]. Six studies assessed viral clearance at 7 days with a pooled risk ratio (RR) of 1.11 [95% CI 0.86, 1.42, I2= 61%, P=0.44] and 5 studies at 14 days with a pooled RR of 0.96 [95% CI 0.89, 1.04, I2= 0%, P=0.34]. Several trials showed no significant effect of HCQ on other clinical outcomes and. Five prevention RCTs with 5012 patients found no effect of HCQ on the risk of acquiring COVID-19. Thirteen trials showed that HCQ was associated with increased risk of adverse events. We observed, with high level of certainty of evidence, that HCQ is not effective in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients. Lower certainty evidence also suggests that HCQ neither improves viral clearance and other clinical outcomes, nor prevents COVID-19 infection in patients with high-risk exposure. HCQ is associated with an increased rate of adverse events.","Kashour, Zakariya; Kashour, Tarek; Gerberi, Danielle; Tleyjeh, Imad M",Clinical and translational science (Online),,242

A candidate vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a full-length and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS: In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2a trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years (cohort 1) and those 65 years of age or older (cohort 3) to receive the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 5×1010 viral particles (low dose) or 1×1011 viral particles (high dose) per milliliter or placebo in a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule. RESULTS: After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354) and reached 100% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488), regardless of vaccine dose or age group. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower in cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS: The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further development of this vaccine candidate.

217226,Hospital-based use of thromboprophylaxis in patients with COVID-19,2020,"In 75% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), insulin action is impaired. In obesity, visceral adipose tissue becomes dysfunctional: Chronic inflammation is favored over storage, contributing to the development of metabolic complications. PCOS, metabolic syndrome (MetSy) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) apparently share common pathogenic factors;these include abdominal adiposity, excess body weight and insulin resistance. Alterations in the gut microbiome have been noted in women with PCOS compared to controls;these may lead to deterioration of the intestinal barrier, increased gut mucosal permeability and immune system activation, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance, which hamper normal ovarian function and follicular development (all being hallmarks of PCOS). It has been proposed that PCOS may entail higher susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) via its associated comorbidities (NAFLD, obesity, MetSy and alterations in the gut microbiome). Studies have found an association between acute respiratory distress syndrome (seen in severe cases of COVID-19) and the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, apparently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can gain entry to the gastrointestinal tract via locally-expressed angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptors. Excess body weight is associated with more severe COVID-19 and increased mortality. Although robust links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and PCOS/NAFLD/gut microbiome/metabolic consequences are yet to be confirmed, it seems that strategies for adapting the intestinal microbiome could help reduce the severity of COVID-19 in women with PCOS with or without NAFLD, MetSy or obesity.","Ilias, I.; Goulas, S.; Zabuliene, L.",World Journal of Clinical Cases,,242

Besides endothelial cells, thrombin and platelets, also neutrophil granulocytes appear to play an important role. Neutrophils extrude extracellular nets which are histone- and protease-coated web-like DNA structures, activate coagulation and platelets, and release radicals and proteases such as elastase. The unique phylogenetically ancient and ""versatile"" inhibitor &#945;2 -M contributes particularly during childhood to the antithrombin activity of plasma, binds a broad spectrum of proteases and interacts with other mediators of inflammation such as cytokines. It is suggested that the scope of basic research and clinical studies would include the potential role of &#945;2 -M in COVID-19.","Seitz, Rainer; Gürtler, Lutz; Schramm, Wolfgang",J. thromb. haemost,,242

METHODS: Seventy-seven hospitalized patients <18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection received remdesivir through a compassionate-use program between March 21 and April 22, 2020. The intended remdesivir treatment course was 10 days (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg daily subsequently for children &#8805;40 kg and 5 mg/kg on day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg daily subsequently for children <40 kg, given intravenously). Clinical data through 28 days of follow-up were collected. RESULTS: Median age was 14 years (interquartile range 7-16, range <2 months to 17 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients had &#8805;1 comorbid condition. At baseline, 90% of children required supplemental oxygen and 51% required invasive ventilation. By day 28 of follow-up, 88% of patients had a decreased oxygen-support requirement, 83% recovered, and 73% were discharged. Among children requiring invasive ventilation at baseline, 90% were extubated, 80% recovered, and 67% were discharged. There were 4 deaths, of which 3 were attributed to COVID-19. Remdesivir was well tolerated, with a low incidence of serious adverse events (16%). Most adverse events were related to COVID-19 or comorbid conditions. Laboratory abnormalities, including elevations in transaminase levels, were common; 61% were grades 1 or 2.

How SARS-CoV-2 regulates cellular responses to escape clearance by host cells is unknown. Autophagy is an intracellular lysosomal degradation pathway for the clearance of various cargoes, including viruses. Here, we systematically screened 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and identified that ORF3a strongly inhibited autophagic flux by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. ORF3a colocalized with lysosomes and interacted with VPS39, a component of the homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) complex. The ORF3a-VPS39 interaction prohibited the binding of HOPS with RAB7, which prevented the assembly of fusion machinery, leading to the accumulation of unfused autophagosomes. These results indicated the potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 escapes degradation;that is, the virus interferes with autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, our findings will facilitate strategies targeting autophagy for conferring potential protection against the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Zhang, Y.; Sun, H.; Pei, R.; Mao, B.; Zhao, Z.; Li, H.; Lin, Y.; Lu, K.",Cell Discovery,,242

218196,Prognostic value of serum amyloid A in patients with COVID-19,2020,"Because tics are the defining clinical feature of Tourette syndrome, it is conceptualized predominantly as a motor disorder. There is some evidence though suggesting that the neural basis of Tourette syndrome is related to perception-action processing and binding between perception and action. However, binding processes have not been examined in the motor domain in these patients. If it is particularly perception-action binding but not binding processes within the motor system, this would further corroborate that Tourette syndrome it is not predominantly, or solely, a motor disorder. Here, we studied N = 22 Tourette patients and N = 24 healthy controls using an established action coding paradigm derived from the Theory of Event Coding framework and concomitant EEG-recording addressing binding between a planned but postponed, and an interleaved immediate reaction with different levels of overlap of action elements. Behavioral performance during interleaved action coding was normal in Tourette syndrome. Response locked lateralized readiness potentials reflecting processes related to motor execution were larger in Tourette syndrome, but only in simple conditions. However, pre-motor processes including response preparation and configuration reflected by stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potentials were normal. This was supported by a Bayesian data analysis providing evidence for the null hypothesis. The finding that processes integrating different action-related elements prior to motor execution are normal in Tourette syndrome suggests that Tourette it is not solely a motor disorder. Considering other recent evidence, the data show that changes in ""binding"" in Tourette syndrome are specific for perception-action integration but not for action coding.","Mielke, Emily; Takacs, Adam; Kleimaker, Maximilian; Schappert, Ronja; Conte, Giulia; Onken, Rebecca; Künemund, Till; Verrel, Julius; Bäumer, Tobias; Beste, Christian; Münchau, Alexander",Neuroimage Clin,,242

The virus is transmitted from an infected person to another person through close contact and droplets. Frontline health care workers are the most at risk of infection, and so a WHO interim guidance document was issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) which underscores the importance of proper sanitation and waste management practices for COVID- 19 in health-care settings. This study aimed at assessing knowledge and preventive practices towards Covid-19 among health care providers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno Bedele zones, Southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020 among 330 health workers in selected health facilities of Illu Aba Bor and Buno-Bedelle Zones, Southwest Ethiopia. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data were entered into Epidata version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of preventive practices towards Covid-19. Statistical significance was declared at a p-value of < 0.05. RESULT: The majority of respondents (93.3%) demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19, and the mean (SD) knowledge score was 9.04 ± 1.06. Nearly two-thirds (64.2%) of the study participants had good infection prevention practices. Being male (AOR = 3.65, 95% CI: (1.96, 6.80)), education level (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI (1.02, 3.22)), profession (AOR = 3.17, 95% CI (1.08, 9.33)), service year (5-10 years) (AOR = 2.00 (1.02, 3.92)) and more than 10 years (AOR = 3.14 (1.51, 6.52)), availability of personal protective equipment (AOR = 1.96 (1.06, 3.61)) and Knowledge level (AOR = 2.61 (1.48, 4.62)) were independent predictors of COVID-19 preventive practices. CONCLUSION: The overall level of knowledge of HCWs was good. However, the practice was relatively low. Gender, educational status, profession, year of service, knowledge towards COVID-19, and availability of personal protective equipment were independent predictors of good infection prevention practices. Optimizing the infection prevention and control loop of the health facilities is recommended.","Tsegaye, Dereje; Shuremu, Muluneh; Oljira, Dereje; Dubale, Sileshi; Befekadu, Getachew; Bidira, Kebebe",BMC Infect Dis,,242
219781,Clinical and CT features in pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection: Different points from adults,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, measures were taken to protect healthcare staff from infection, to prevent infection of patients admitted to the hospital and to distribute PPE according to need. To assure the proper protection without overuse of limited supply of these equipments, screening of patients before surgical or diagnostic procedure was implemented. This study evaluates the results of this screening. METHOD: All patients screened for COVID-19 before procedure warranting either general, locoregional anaesthesia or sedation were included. Screening included a symptom questionnaire by phone, PCR and HRCT chest testing. Surgical or procedural details were registered together with actions taken based on screening results. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight screenings were performed on 386 patients. The symptom questionnaire was completed in 72% of screenings. In 371 screenings, PCR testing was performed and negative. HRCT chest found 18 cases where COVID-19 could not be excluded, with negative PCR testing. Three patients had their surgery postponed due to inconclusive screening, and additional measures were taken in three other patients. There were incidental findings in 14% of HRCT chest scans. DISCUSSION: Pre-operative screening will differentiate if PPE is needed for procedures and which patients can safely have elective surgery during this COVID-19 pandemic and in the times to come. HRCT chest has no additional value in the pre-operative screening of asymptomatic patients. Screening can be performed with a symptom questionnaire, and additional screening with PCR testing in high-risk patient groups should be considered.","Huybens, E M; Bus, M P A; Massaad, R A; Wijers, L; van der Voet, J A; Delfos, N M; van der Feltz, M; Heemstra, K A; Koch, S M P",World J Surg,,242

The research is based on an analysis of the situation in B2B implementation during the period of the 2008-2009 economic crisis, where-on a sample of 229 logistic companies based in the Czech Republic-it ascertains whether the extent of B2B implementation changed over this period. This is done in a short-time (2006 vs. 2010) as well as long-time (extended with 2014 vs. 2018) horizon. Although some conclusions are in contradiction with other authors, they state a high extent of B2B implementation, which even further increased over the above economic crisis and even continued in a longer time horizon following the crisis. The conclusions are then analogically transferred to the present 2020 ""coronavirus economic recession""and practicable recommendations are formulated.

Central to this model is the advent of a fractional exponent $\gamma$, typically fitted to the data. While various motivations for this non-analytical form have been proposed, it is still considered foremost an empirical fitting procedure. Here, we find that Richards-like growth laws emerge naturally from generic analytical growth rules in a distributed population, upon inclusion of {\bf (i)} migration (spatial diffusion) amongst different locales, and {\bf (ii)} stochasticity in the growth rate, also known as""seascape noise.""The latter leads to a wide (power-law) distribution in local population number that, while smoothened through the former, can still result in a fractional growth law for the overall population.

220482,Mechanistic basis and therapeutic relevance of hypocalcemia during severe COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: When the COVID-19 epidemic occurred for the first time in December 2019, the governments worldwide took some restriction measures for slowing the spread of novel coronavirus. Eventually, there was a considerable decrease in volunteer blood donations. Regular transfusions and follow-up of patients with thalassemia major (TM) should be maintained during this period. It is possible that the treatment of the patients with TM may hinder due to the difficulty of reaching the treatment center and the difficulty of blood supply. Thus, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether there were any differences in the follow-up and treatment of the patients with TM during the outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with TM who were followed up in our center without COVID-19 contact history and symptoms were included in this study. The demographic features and red blood cell volume per kilogram they received, pretransfusion hemoglobin, serum ferritin (SF) level, biochemical parameters, and transfusion interval were recorded. The difference between the arithmetic mean of the data before and during the pandemic was evaluated. RESULTS: In this study, 61 patients with TM (32 males/29 females, mean age 13.9±6.8 y) were evaluated. The mean pretransfusion hemoglobin value was 9.14±0.77 g/dL and 8.87± 0.80 g/dL before and during the pandemic, respectively (P=0.023). There was no difference between before and during the pandemic concerning transfusion interval and transfusion volume. However, SF levels increased above 1000 ng/mL in 16.6% of patients. CONCLUSION: Although blood donation decreased significantly during the pandemic, it was observed in this study that the blood needs of patients with TM could be provided. The results of the SF level showed that the management of chelation therapy should be more meticulous. However, we should be ready for the challenges in the transfusion practice of patients with TM due to fluctuations in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oymak, Yesim; Karapinar, Tuba H",J. pediatr. hematol. oncol,,242
220733,A real-world study of glucocorticoid treatment in COVID-19 patients with different disease severities,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nasal High Flow (NHF) therapy delivers flows of heated humidified gases up to 60 LPM (litres per minute) via a nasal cannula. Particles of oral/nasal fluid released by patients undergoing NHF therapy may pose a cross-infection risk, which is a potential concern for treating COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Liquid particles within the exhaled breath of healthy participants were measured with two protocols: (1) high speed camera imaging and counting exhaled particles under high magnification (6 participants) and (2) measuring the deposition of a chemical marker (riboflavin-5-monophosphate) at a distance of 100 and 500 mm on filter papers through which air was drawn (10 participants). The filter papers were assayed with HPLC. Breathing conditions tested included quiet (resting) breathing and vigorous breathing (which here means nasal snorting, voluntary coughing and voluntary sneezing). Unsupported (natural) breathing and NHF at 30 and 60 LPM were compared. RESULTS: Imaging: During quiet breathing, no particles were recorded with unsupported breathing or 30 LPM NHF (detection limit for single particles 33 µm). Particles were detected from 2 of 6 participants at 60 LPM quiet breathing at approximately 10% of the rate caused by unsupported vigorous breathing. Unsupported vigorous breathing released the greatest numbers of particles. Vigorous breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, released half the number of particles compared to vigorous breathing without NHF.Chemical marker tests: No oral/nasal fluid was detected in quiet breathing without NHF (detection limit 0.28 µL/m3). In quiet breathing with NHF at 60 LPM, small quantities were detected in 4 out of 29 quiet breathing tests, not exceeding 17 µL/m3. Vigorous breathing released 200-1000 times more fluid than the quiet breathing with NHF. The quantities detected in vigorous breathing were similar whether using NHF or not. CONCLUSION: During quiet breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy may cause oral/nasal fluid to be released as particles, at levels of tens of µL per cubic metre of air. Vigorous breathing (snort, cough or sneeze) releases 200 to 1000 times more oral/nasal fluid than quiet breathing (p < 0.001 with both imaging and chemical marker methods). During vigorous breathing, 60 LPM NHF therapy caused no statistically significant difference in the quantity of oral/nasal fluid released compared to unsupported breathing. NHF use does not increase the risk of dispersing infectious aerosols above the risk of unsupported vigorous breathing. Standard infection prevention and control measures should apply when dealing with a patient who has an acute respiratory infection, independent of which, if any, respiratory support is being used.

In responding to the government’s call for mosques not to hold Friday prayers to contain the transmission of COVID-19, the group of Muhammadiyah mosques made persuasive, cautious and rational approaches to convey the message of the call to the congregation. On the other hand, the message of the call conveyed by the group of NU mosques to the congregation is coercive and tends to cause fatal or radical attitude. This study recommends that the group of NU mosques be united to manage an organization functioning as a basis, umbrella, and command. This way more effective and controllable communication among NU mosques can be created to resolve internal differences while conveying communication messages. The conclusion and recommendation are based on the results of the research conducted through qualitative approaches using data collection techniques covering observation and unstructured interviews to obtain indepth and pure data.

221861,Asymmetric impact of COVID-19 induced uncertainty on inbound Chinese tourists in Australia: insights from nonlinear ARDL model,2020,"The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide. To meet the urgent and massive demand for the screening and diagnosis of infected individuals, many in vitro diagnostic assays using nucleic acid tests (NATs) have been urgently authorized by regulators worldwide. A reference standard with a well-characterized concentration or titer is of the utmost importance for the study of limit of detection (LoD), which is a crucial feature for a diagnostic assay. Although several reference standards of plasmids or synthetic RNA have already been announced, a reference standard for inactivated virus particles with an accurate concentration is still needed to evaluate the complete procedure. Here, we performed a collaborative study to estimate the NAT-detectable units as a viral genomic equivalent quantity (GEQ) of an inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 reference standard candidate using digital PCR (dPCR) on multiple commercialized platforms. The median of the quantification results (4.6 × 105 ± 6.5 × 104 GEQ/mL) was treated as the consensus true value of GEQ of virus particles in the reference standard. This reference standard was then used to challenge the LoDs of six officially approved diagnostic assays. Our study demonstrates that an inactivated whole virus quantified by dPCR can serve as a reference standard and provides a unified solution for assay development, quality control, and regulatory surveillance.","Zhou, Haiwei; Liu, Donglai; Ma, Liang; Ma, Tingting; Xu, Tingying; Ren, Lili; Li, Liang; Xu, Sihong",Anal. chem,,242

In addition, analysis of humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 has an important role in viral diagnostics and seroprevalence estimates. METHODS: We developed and optimized an enzyme immunoassays (EIA) using SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N), S1 and receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein, and N proteins from SARS, MERS, and four low-pathogenic human CoVs. Neutralizing antibody activity was compared with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM EIA results. RESULTS: The sensitivity of EIA for detecting immune response in COVID-19 patients (n=101) was 77 % in the acute phase and 100 % in the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection when N and RBD were used as antigens in IgG and IgA specific EIAs. SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly increased humoral immune responses against the 229E and NL63 N proteins. S1 and RBD-based EIA results had a strong correlation with microneutralization test (MNT) results. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that a combination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 or RBD and N proteins and analysis of sera in IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes provide an excellent basis for specific and sensitive serological diagnostics of COVID-19.","Jalkanen, Pinja; Pasternack, Arja; Maljanen, Sari; Melén, Krister; Kolehmainen, Pekka; Huttunen, Moona; Lundberg, Rickard; Tripathi, Lav; Khan, Hira; Ritvos, Mikael A; Naves, Rauno; Haveri, Anu; Österlund, Pamela; Kuivanen, Suvi; Jääskeläinen, Anne J; Kurkela, Satu; Lappalainen, Maija; Rantasärkkä, Kaisa; Vuorinen, Tytti; Hytönen, Jukka; Waris, Matti; Tauriainen, Sisko; Ritvos, Olli; Kakkola, Laura; Julkunen, Ilkka",J. infect. dis,,242
223334,Chest CT features analysis of 69 patients with COVID-19,2021,"In the past twenty years several events disrupted global economies and social well-being and generally shook the confidence in the stability of western societies such as during the 2008 financial crisis and its economic aftermath. Here, we aim to identify and illustrate underlying drivers of such societal instability or even consequential collapse. For this purpose we propose a low-dimensional and stylised model of two classes of networked agents (termed""labourers""and""administrators""hereafter) that is inspired by Joseph Tainter's theory of collapse of complex societies. We numerically model the dynamics of societal complexity, measured as the share of""administrators"", which is assumed to affect the productivity of energy-producing `labourers"". We show that collapse becomes increasingly likely if the model society's complexity continuously increases in response to external stresses that emulate Tainter's abstract notion of problems that societies need to solve. We additionally provide an analytical approximation of the system's dominant dynamics which matches well with the numerical experiments, thus, allowing for a precise estimate of tipping points beyond which societal collapse is triggered. The administration's ability for increasing productivity of labour shows to be the most influential parameter for longer survival times which is additionally fostered by a minimum level of social connectivity. Finally, we show that agents' stochastic transitions between labour force and administration, i.e. social mobility, can increase the survival time of the modeled society even further. Our work fosters the understanding of socio-ecological collapse and illustrates its potentially direct link to an ever increasing complexity in response to external shocks or stress via a self-reinforcing feedback.","Schunck, Florian; Wiedermann, Marc; Heitzig, Jobst; Donges, Jonathan F.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06698v2.pdf,242

223599,Malnutrition risk in hospitalised COVID-19 patients receiving CPAP,2021,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a serious pregnancy complication, affecting about 5-7% of pregnancies worldwide and is characterized by hypertension and damage to multiple maternal organs, primarily the liver and kidneys. PE usually begins after 20 weeks' gestation and, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications and lifelong disabilities-even death-in both the mother and the infant. As delivery is the only cure for the disease, treatment is primarily focused on the management of blood pressure and other clinical symptoms. The pathogenesis of PE is still not clear. Abnormal spiral artery remodeling, placental ischemia and a resulting increase in the circulating levels of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1), also called soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), are believed to be among the primary pathologies associated with PE. sFlt-1 is produced mainly in the placenta during pregnancy and acts as a decoy receptor, binding to free VEGF (VEGF-A) and placental growth factor (PlGF), resulting in the decreased bioavailability of each to target cells. Despite the pathogenic effects of increased sFlt-1 on the maternal vasculature, recent studies from our laboratory and others have strongly indicated that the increase in sFlt-1 in PE may fulfill critical protective functions in preeclamptic pregnancies. Thus, further studies on the roles of sFlt-1 in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies are warranted for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting VEGF signaling for the treatment of PE. Another impediment to the treatment of PE is the lack of suitable methods for delivery of cargo to placental cells, as PE is believed to be of placental origin and most available therapies for PE adversely impact both the mother and the fetus. The present review discusses the pathogenesis of PE, the complex role of sFlt-1 in maternal disease and fetal protection, and the recently developed placenta-targeted drug delivery system for the potential treatment of PE with candidate therapeutic agents.","Jena, Manoj Kumar; Sharma, Neeta Raj; Petitt, Matthew; Maulik, Devika; Nayak, Nihar Ranjan",Biomolecules,,242

Here we re-examine these published datasets. We report that only a few pangolin samples were found to contain coronavirus reads, and even then in low abundance, while other non-pangolin hosted viruses were present in higher abundance. We also discovered extensive contamination with human, rodent, and other mammalian gene sequences, which was a surprising finding. Finally, we uncovered a number of pangolin CoV sequences embedded in standard laboratory cloning vectors, which suggests the pangolin specimens could have been contaminated with sequences derived from synthetic biology experiments. For these reasons, we find it unlikely that the pangolins in question had a coronavirus infection while alive and all current versions of the cited papers claiming a zoonotic infection of pangolins with a SARS-r CoV should be considered unreliable, and either substantial corrections and clarifications should be provided or the papers in question should be retracted.","Jones, Adrian; Zhang, Daoyu; Deigin, Yuri; Quay, Steven C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08163v2.pdf,242
226208,Stroke management pathway during COVID-19 pandemic scientific statement by the Saudi Stroke Society,2020,"The zebrafish Danio rerio is a valuable and common model for scientists in the fields of genetics and developmental biology. Since zebrafish are also amenable to genetic manipulation, modelling of human diseases or behavioral experiments have moved into the focus of zebrafish research. Consequently, gene expression data beyond embryonic and larval stages become more important, yet there is a dramatic knowledge gap of gene expression beyond day four of development. Like in other model organisms, the visualization of spatial and temporal gene expression by whole mount in situ hybridization (ISH) becomes increasingly difficult when zebrafish embryos develop further and hence the growing tissues become dense and less permeable. Here we introduce a modified method for whole mount ISH, which overcomes these penetration and detection problem. The method is an all in one solution that enables the detection and visualization of gene expression patterns up to the late larval stage in a 3D manner without the need for tissue sectioning and offers a valuable extension for whole mount ISH by immunohistochemistry in the zebrafish field.","Vauti, Franz; Stegemann, Luisa A; Vögele, Viktoria; Köster, Reinhard W",PLoS One,,242

Older adults and people living with these comorbidities are at a greater risk for complications during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we discuss the negative impact of physical inactivity on immune function and showcase evidence that regular physical activity may be an effective strategy to counter some of the deleterious effects of social isolation. Furthermore, we briefly highlight key research questions in exercise immunology, with a focus on older adults in the context of COVID-19.

As children stayed at home with no physical activities, their weight may have increased. The purpose of this study was to examine the link between fast food, sugars, or soft drinks and the ongoing domestic lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. This phenomenon was studied in three different cities from three different countries (Saudi Arabia, Britain, and Turkey) from the perspective of children's parents. The study sought to address three research questions regarding children's well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown period. First, was children's nutrition affected during this period? Second, did children's weight increase? Third, were there any statistically significant differences in children's dietary patterns based on their gender and nationality? A questionnaire was administered to 330 parents of children aged four to seven years in the three targeted countries. The study found that most parents cared about their children's nutrition and prepared food at home (96.1%) during the lockdown. Sixty-three percent of parents indicated that children did not gain weight. Additionally, differences in children's nutritional systems were found between Saudi and Turkish children; the nutritional system of the Turkish children was better than that of Saudi children during the lockdown. Additionally, there were statistically significant differences in children's nutrition due to gender, with better nutrition for boys than for girls.","Bahatheg, Raja Omar",Early Child Educ J,,242

232512,CT findings of 795 COVID-19 positive cases: a multicenter study in Egypt,2020,"RATIONALE: The precision of reference materials (RMs) standard measurements is critical to normalize the raw Î´15 N values of samples to the international scale. Since the measurement configuration is requested to moderate the properties of both RMs and samples for obtaining an ideal measurement precision, therefore it is of importance to determine the appropriate measurement configurations of RMs to achieve accurate nitrogen isotope compositions of samples. Therefore, it is urgent to systematically examine RMs for optimizing the configurations and further improve the measurement precision. METHODS: Gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) coupled with an online elemental analyzer (EA) equipped with a single quartz reactor was performed to analyze the nitrogen isotope compositions. Some adjustments were executed as follows: (1) as the in-house working standard, urea was used to investigate the influences of the combustion through moderating the different oxygen injections (0~20 mL) and sample delay times (10~12 s), and optimize the combustion conditions in order to enhance the oxidation ability; (2) CO2 from the sample gas stream was removed to prevent interferences between CO2 and N2 ; (3) international RMs including USGS40 (L-glutamic), IAEA600 (caffeine), and soil standard (B2153) with a low organic content, were systematically analyzed under the optimized configurations, and their precisions of the Î´15 N values were furthermore examined. RESULTS: Our results showed that sufficient oxygen should be injected to improve the sample combustion when analyzing Î´15 N in natural samples such as soil or marine sediment with low organic content. In addition, the measurement precision of Î´15 N was affected by the tailing of the CO2 peak from the GC column into the subsequent sample measurement if the EA is equipped with a single quartz reactor column. Our adjustments can produce an optimized repeatability and accuracy of the Î´15 N value, especially for RMs with low organic content, and the uncertainty of the measurements is improved better than 0.1 under optimized configurations. CONCLUSIONS: The analytical conditions such as the oxygen flow rate and injection time or sample introduction time into EA, need to be adjusted depending on the combustion conditions of the RMs and samples to obtain a reliable accuracy of measurement. We recommend that when analyzing Î´15 N of natural samples such as soil or marine sediment samples with low organic content, more oxygen should be injected to improve the combustion of the samples. In addition, CO2 should be removed from the sample gas stream before introducing into the IRMS when EA is equipped with a single quartz reactor.","Wang, Nan; Liu, Jingyu; Zhang, Yang; Xia, Cuimei; Lin, Deju; Che, Yangli; Wu, Jianzheng; Bao, Rui",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom,,242
232600,PO-21 Incidence of venous thromboembolism events in outpatients with cancer and COVID-19,2021,"World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. It was temporarily named as 2019-nCoV then subsequently named as COVID-19 virus. A coronavirus is a group of viruses, known to be zoonotic, causing illness ranging from acute to mild respiratory infections. These are spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particles containing positive sense RNA. The virus enters host cells, its uncoated genetic material transcribes, and translates. Since it has started spreading rapidly, protective measures have been taken all over the world. However, its transmission has been proved to be unstoppable and the absence of an effective drug makes the situation worse. The scientific community has gone all-out to discover and develop a possible vaccine or a competent antiviral drug. Other domains of biological sciences that promise effective results and target somewhat stable entities that are proteins, could be very useful in this time of crisis. Proteomics and metabolomics are the vast fields that are equipped with sufficient technologies to face this challenge. Various protein separation and identification techniques are available which facilitates the analysis of various types of interactions among proteins and their evolutionary lineages. The presented review aims at confronting the question: 'how proteomics can help in tackling SARS-CoV-2?' It deals with the role of upcoming proteome technology in these pandemic situations and discusses the proteomics approach towards the COVID-19 dilemma.","Rana, Rashmi; Rathi, Vaishnavi; Ganguly, Nirmal Kumar",J Proteins Proteom,,242

A 17-year male patient with severe crush and degloving injury over the thigh, gluteal, sacral, and perineum areas was admitted to our Department on the 16th of March 2020. The patient presented soft tissue skin and muscle loss. A double Latissimus Dorsi and Anterolateral Thigh free flaps were indicated. However, due to the particular circumstance of the COVID-19 crisis, we applied domestic negative wound therapy (NPWT) using gauzes and wall suction. We obtained suitable granulation tissue after 17 consecutive days with this treatment. The raw area was then covered with an expanded split-thickness skin graft. The wound healed at 95%, and the patient was discharged on 25th of April 2020. He was followed up in an outpatient setting with wound care and physiotherapy. This case showed that in a limited-resource setting, with available wall suction, the domestic NPWT is a versatile tool to promote granulation tissue.","Harti, Amine El; Amouzou, Komla Séna; Jacques, Mokako Lisenga; Alaoui, Mehdi Rizk; Diouri, Mounia",Pan Afr Med J,,242

The present study was conducted to report the clinical characteristics of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, a city outside of Wuhan. All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by April 28, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34-59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]). One hundred and forty-four (71.6%) enrolled patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored. Previous reports focused on the clinical features of patients from Wuhan, China. With the global epidemic of COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan.","Zhou, Jian; Sun, Jingjing; Cao, Ziqin; Wang, Wanchun; Huang, Kang; Zheng, Fang; Xie, Yuanlin; Jiang, Dixuan; Zhou, Zhiguo",Medicine (Baltimore),,242

METHODS: We set up emergency management and sensing control teams. The team formulated various measures: reconfiguration of the radiology department, personal protection and training of staff, examination procedures for patients suspected of or confirmed with COVID-19 as well as patients without an exposure history or symptoms. Those with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were scanned in the designated fever-CT unit. RESULTS: From January 21, 2020, to March 9, 2020, 3,083 people suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 underwent fever-CT examinations. Including initial examinations and re-examinations, the total number of fever-CT examinations numbered 3,340. As a result of our precautions, none of the staff of the radiology department were infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Strategic planning and adequate protections can help protect patients and staff against a highly infectious disease while maintaining function at a high-volume capacity.","Huang, Zixing; Zhao, Shuang; Li, Zhenlin; Chen, Weixia; Zhao, Lihong; Deng, Lipeng; Song, Bin",J Am Coll Radiol,,242
233184,Echocardiographic Comparison of COVID-19 Patients with or without Prior Biochemical Evidence of Cardiac Injury after Recovery,2020,"We consider the control of the COVID-19 pandemic through a standard SIR compartmental model. This control is induced by the aggregation of individuals' decisions to limit their social interactions: when the epidemic is ongoing, an individual can diminish his/her contact rate in order to avoid getting infected, but this effort comes at a social cost. If each individual lowers his/her contact rate, the epidemic vanishes faster, but the effort cost may be high. A Mean Field Nash equilibrium at the population level is formed, resulting in a lower effective transmission rate of the virus. We prove theoretically that equilibrium exists and compute it numerically. However, this equilibrium selects a sub-optimal solution in comparison to the societal optimum (a centralized decision respected fully by all individuals), meaning that the cost of anarchy is strictly positive. We provide numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis, as well as an extension to a SEIR compartmental model to account for the relatively long latent phase of the COVID-19 disease. In all the scenarii considered, the divergence between the individual and societal strategies happens both before the peak of the epidemic, due to individuals' fears, and after, when a significant propagation is still underway.","Elie, Romuald; Hubert, Emma; Turinici, Gabriel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08221v2.pdf,242

We have developed a set of DHS for digital innovation (DHS10). There are numerous studies on DHS impacts/outcomes in the recent years. However, little research has been conducted to identify whether DHS has lasting benefits on designers’ ideation performance. This paper explores whether DHS10 can help designers achieve more creative ideas based on different design briefs, and if DHS has lasting impacts on or benefits for students. An empirical study was conducted with two groups (i.e., 32 students who learned DHS10 five weeks ago, and 24 students who studied DHS10 instantly). They were asked to address an open-ended design brief on COVID-19 and generate as many innovative ideas as possible. The results suggest DHS has impacts on students who learned DHS just now and five weeks ago. The effect is stronger on those who just learned DHS10. We suggest that DHS10 be provided for ideation as it provides texts and visual stimuli for designers. DHS10 also has the potential to help students understand digital innovation and generate ideas accordingly.","Jin, Xiaoneng Dong Hua Evans Mark",Sustainability,,242

Marital satisfaction in the pandemic phase showed low values that may be associated with the social, economic, and political context experienced by the pandemic situation. Future research must be carried out in order to identify, prevent, and intervene in situations of violence. In addition, future research should explore not only marital satisfaction during the current pandemic but a more systemic assessment of marital relations during crises, expanding the impact of marital satisfaction in family functioning.","Fernandes, Carla Sílvia Magalhães Bruno Silva Sílvia Edra Beatriz",The Family Journal,,242

Design: We did a cross-sectional, observational study design in a mass-screening program in the enrolment to the Norwegian military during April 19-28th 2020 (COVID-NOR-MIL). Subjects: 1170 presumptively healthy young Norwegian conscripts. Setting: A structured interview encouraged the coming conscripts to a self-imposed preventive quarantine the last two weeks before enrolment. Main outcome measures: All conscripts underwent a PCR-based test with nasopharyngeal swabs at the day of enrolment. Results: Only two tested positive. The study discusses the predictive value of the RT-PCR test and the risk of false positive and false negative results, particularly when using the test in a low-prevalent cohort, even if the test properties of sensitivity and specificity is almost 100%. Further, the study discusses the challenge of whether a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test represent viable and contagious virus or only viral remnants. Conclusion: The adherence to self-imposed preventive quarantine is a challenge and is a subject to further research. Implications: We want to draw the attention to the potential value of a thorough pre-screening processes and self-imposed preventive quarantine to minimize the potential spread of SARS-Cov-2.","Norheim, Arne J; Borud, Einar K; Lind, Andreas; Fadum, Elin A; Taxt, Arne; Steens, Anneke; Bragstad, Karoline; Rein, Erling; Nakstad, Espen",Scand J Prim Health Care,,242

Outpatients who had recently been diagnosed with COVID-19 or were presenting with suspected COVID-19 were asked to have a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab collected and provide at least one self-collected sample type. Participants were also asked about sample acceptability using a five-point Likert scale. For those previously diagnosed with COVID-19, all samples underwent real-time PCR testing using a lab-developed assay, and the majority were also tested using an FDA-authorized assay. For those presenting with suspected COVID-19, only those with a positive nasopharyngeal swab sample went on to have other samples tested. Saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples were tested daily at time zero, day 1, and day 2 to assess nucleic acid stability at room temperature. Fifty participants (aged 4 to 71 years) were included; of these, 40 had at least one positive sample and were included in the primary sample yield analysis. Saline mouth rinse/gargle samples had a sensitivity of 98% (39/40), while saliva samples had a sensitivity of 79% (26/33). Both saline mouth rinse/gargle and saliva samples showed stable viral RNA detection after 2 days of room temperature storage. Mouth rinse/gargle samples had the highest (mean, 4.9) and health care worker (HCW)-collected NP swabs had the lowest acceptability scores (mean, 3.1). In conclusion, saline mouth rinse/gargle samples demonstrated higher combined user acceptability ratings and analytical performance than saliva and HCW-collected NP swabs.

The BB leaves extract act as a strong reducing, stabilizing, and capping agent in the synthesis of BB@NiONPs. Further, BB@NiONPs were characterized using Uv-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and average size was calculated ~21.7 nm). Multiple in vitro biological activities were performed to determine their therapeutic potentials. The BB@NiONPs showed strong antioxidant activities in term of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) with scavenging potential of 69.98 and 59.59% at 200 µg/ml, respectively. The antibacterial and antifungal testes were examined using different bacterial and fungal strains and dose-dependent inhibition response was reported. Laterally, cytotoxic and phytotoxic activities were studied using brine shrimp and radish seeds. The result determined potential cytotoxic activity with LD50 value (49.10 µg/ml) and outstanding stimulatory effect of BB@NiONPs on seed germination at lower concentrations as compared to control.

Social distancing is known to weaken incidences and deaths due to COVID-19, however, there are detrimental economic and psychological effects. This motivates us to analyze incidences (and deaths) of COVID-19 along with a measure of the health of the US economy (i.e., the adjusted closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial), and a measure of the public interest in COVID-19 through Google Trends data. The model we implement is developed to be easily adapted to a data scientist's preferred method for continuous data, which is done to aid future analyses of this important dataset. This dataset consists of multiple response types (e.g., continuous-valued, count-valued, binomial counts). Thus, we introduce a reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that""converts""a statistical model for continuous responses (the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for multi-response data sets. To do this, we transform the data such that the continuous-valued transformed data can be reasonably modeled using the preferred model and the transformation itself is treated as unknown. The implementation of our approach involves two steps. The first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data using a latent conjugate multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We refer to our model as the hierarchical generalized transformation (HGT) model. In a simulation, we demonstrate the flexibility of the HGT model by incorporating two different preferred models: Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and the spatial mixed effects (spatio-temporal mixed effects) models.","Bradley, Jonathan R.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.09983v3.pdf,242

The contribution of the EP cannot be ignored also given its unique representative role, its direct democratic legitimacy, and its increasingly relevant role in the Union’s decision-making process. This article has the ambition to identify the key determinants behind the legislators’ voting behaviour and coalition patterns in the EP in the context of the first response to the COVID-19 crisis, by capturing the tension between partisanship and nationality. To do so, it proposes a set of hypotheses addressing legislators’ voting dynamics and patterns of cooperation and conflict in the EP.

238303,Editorial: COVID-19 in older persons: the role of nutrition,2021,"BACKGROUND: Acute exacerbation (AE) is recognized as a life-threatening condition with acute respiratory worsening in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). AE also occurs in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) other than IPF, including other types of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), ILD associated with collagen vascular disease (CVD-ILD) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonia (CHP). However, the clinical impact after AE in those patients is still unclear. METHODS: A retrospective review of 174 consecutive first-episodes with AE of ILD in our institution from 2002 to 2016 was performed. AE was defined according to the revised definition and diagnostic criteria proposed by an international working group in 2016. Clinical characteristics, 90-day survival, and the requirement of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) after AE were evaluated in each underlying ILD. RESULTS: There were 102 patients with AE of IPF (AE-IPF) and 72 with AE of ILD other than IPF, including non-IPF IIPs (n=29) and secondary ILD (n=43) [CVD-ILD (n=39), CHP (n=4)]. In CVD-ILD, rheumatoid arthritis (n=17) was most common. The 90-day mortality after AE was 57% in IPF, 29% in non-IPF IIPs, and 33% in secondary ILD. After AE, ILD other than IPF had a significantly better survival rate than IPF (P<0.001). Among survivors, the rates of patients requiring LTOT after AE were 63% in IPF, 35% in non-IPF IIPs, and 46% in secondary ILD, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AE of ILD other than IPF might have a better prognosis than AE-IPF, but both are fatal conditions that cause chronic respiratory failure.","Miyashita, Koichi; Kono, Masato; Saito, Go; Koyanagi, Yu; Tsutsumi, Akari; Kobayashi, Takeshi; Miki, Yoshihiro; Hashimoto, Dai; Nakamura, Yutaro; Suda, Takafumi; Nakamura, Hidenori",The clinical respiratory journal (Online),,242
238879,Hysteroscopic treatment of cesarean scar defect,2020,"Conventional vaccines have saved millions of lives, and new vaccines have also been developed;however, an urgent need for an efficient vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 showed us that vaccine development technologies should be improved more to obtain prophylactic agents rapidly during pandemic diseases One of the next-generation vaccine technologies is utilization of mRNA molecules encoding antigens The mRNA vaccines offer many advantages compared to conventional and other subunit vaccines For instance, mRNA vaccines are relatively safe since they do not cause disease and mRNA does not integrate into the genome mRNA vaccines also provide diverse types of immune responses resulting in the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells However, utilization of mRNA molecules also has some drawbacks such as degradation by ubiquitous nucleases in vivo Nanoparticles (NPs) are delivery platforms that carry the desired molecule, a drug or a vaccine agent, to the target cell such as antigen presenting cells in the case of vaccine development NP platforms also protect mRNA molecules from the degradation by nucleases Therefore, efficient mRNA vaccines can be obtained via utilization of NPs in the formulation Although lipid-based NPs are widely preferred in vaccine development due to the nature of cell membrane, there are various types of other NPs used in vaccine formulations, such as virus-like particles (VLPs), polymers, polypeptides, dendrimers or gold NPs Improvements in the NP delivery technologies will contribute to the development of mRNA vaccines with higher efficiency © 2020 the Author(s)","Okay, S.; Özcan, O.

239820,Dynamic monitoring of serum liver function indexes in patients with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a serious public health event and poses a global health threat. To study the specific antibody responses would contribute to a better understanding of COVID-19. METHODS: We collected complete follow-up data from 777 patients with pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 with corresponding immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) testing results. RESULTS: Overall, the positive rates of IgG and IgM in severe patients were slightly higher than those in non-severe patients. In addition, higher IgG levels were detected in severe patients compared to non-severe patients (P = 0.026). Through further analysis, differences in IgG were only significant in serum samples taken in the first 14 days of disease onset (P < 0.001). On the basis of analysis of antibody expression levels at different time points in 74 patients who had undergone more than three detection tests, we found that the differences in IgG levels between the severe/non-severe patients were more pronounced than those of IgM. On multivariate logistic regression, after adjusting for cofactors, the higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) IgG levels observed in the first 14 days of disease onset were independently associated with severe COVID-19 disease (odds ratio (OR) = 1.368, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.138-1.645). CONCLUSION: We observed differences in antibody responses among patients with different severity of COVID-19. A high IgG level in the first 14 days of disease may be positively associated with disease severity.","Lu, Wanrong; Wu, Ping; He, Liang; Meng, Yifan; Wu, Peng; Ding, Wencheng; Liu, Jia",Infect Dis Ther,,242

240306,COVID-19 associated encephalopathy responding to treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins,2020,"We investigated whether countries with higher coverage of childhood live vaccines [BCG or measles-containing-vaccine (MCV)] have reduced risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related mortality, while accounting for known systems differences between countries. In this ecological study of 140 countries using publicly available national-level data, higher vaccine coverage, representing estimated proportion of people vaccinated during the last 14 years, was associated with lower COVID-19 deaths. The associations attenuated for both vaccine variables, and MCV coverage became no longer significant once adjusted for published estimates of the Healthcare access and quality index (HAQI), a validated summary score of healthcare quality indicators. The magnitude of association between BCG coverage and COVID-19 death rate varied according to HAQI, and MCV coverage had little effect on the association between BCG and COVID-19 deaths. While there are associations between live vaccine coverage and COVID-19 outcomes, the vaccine coverage variables themselves were strongly correlated with COVID-19 testing rate, HAQI and life expectancy. This suggests that the population-level associations may be further confounded by differences in structural health systems and policies. Cluster randomised studies of booster vaccines would be ideal to evaluate the efficacy of trained immunity in preventing COVID-19 infections and mortality in vaccinated populations and on community transmission.","Ogimi, Chikara; Qu, Pingping; Boeckh, Michael; Bender Ignacio, Rachel A; Zangeneh, Sahar Z",Epidemiol Infect,,242

241109,"Evaluation of 17 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with anakinra according to HScore, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and Brescia-COVID respiratory severity scale (BCRSS) scoring systems",2021,"BACKGROUND: A new variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, emerged as the dominant cause of COVID-19 disease in the UK from November, 2020. We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), against this variant. METHODS: Volunteers (aged &#8805;18 years) who were enrolled in phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK, and who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease (a cough, a fever of 37·8°C or higher, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs MenACWY groups) derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. FINDINGS: Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13, 2020, and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30, 2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18-55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2-11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4% (95% CI 43·6-84·5) for B.1.1.7 and 81·5% (67·9-89·4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro, but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

Our scholarship program is a bi-directional, 3-month international experiential learning program, including both undergraduate and graduate students, with associated online course focused on community engagement. Students completed a semi-structured narrative report at the conclusion of their funding related to their experience and learning. The Likert questions were analyzed descriptively and student responses to the open-ended questions were utilized for thematic analysis. Also included in this paper is a summary of our lessons learned through program administration. A total of 38 students completed the program between 2016 and 2018, with 95% reporting that they either met or exceeded their goals in the program. Three overarching and inter-related themes emerged in our thematic-analysis of students' narrative reports, including success through relationships and new perspectives, challenges of the unfamiliar, and personal growth through strong emotions. Many students reported personal growth as their greatest success and linked this with new perspectives and awareness of how different contexts shaped their understanding of health issues. Overcoming challenges in their placements contributed to students' confidence in their ability to problem-solve. Overall, students reported value in their experiential learning, which further supports the growing trend to incorporate both experiential learning and formal education in community engagement in public health pedagogy. However, international experiential learning requires considerable financial and human resource commitments to ensure its success.","Riediger, Natalie D; Cyr, Monica; Mignone, Javier",Inquiry,,242

I suggest lines of inquiry into each of these features and their interrelatedness. I then move to present some important insights from the work of Mary Douglas which are especially germane to studying the risk of COVID-19 and, again, I raise possibilities for future research.

Despite this knowledge, differential regulation of adhesiveness in T cell subsets has not been explored yet. In this study, we show that in human T cells, SDF-1&#945;-mediated ß2 integrin activation is driven by a, so far, not-described reactive oxidative species (ROS)-regulated calcium influx. Furthermore, we show that CD4+CD28null T cells represent a highly reactive subset showing 25-fold stronger ß2 integrin activation upon SDF-1&#945; stimulation compared with CD28+ T cells. Interestingly, ROS-dependent Ca release was much more prevalent in the pathogenetically pivotal CD28null subset compared with the CD28+ T cells, whereas the established mediators of the classical pathways for ß2 integrin activation (PKC, PI3K, and PLC) were similarly activated in both T cell subsets. Thus, interference with the calcium flux attenuates spontaneous adhesion of CD28null T cells from acute coronary syndrome patients, and calcium ionophores abolished the observed differences in the adhesion properties between CD28+ and CD28null T cells. Likewise, the adhesion of these T cell subsets was indistinguishable in the presence of exogenous ROS/H2O2 Together, these data provide a molecular explanation of the role of ROS in pathogenesis of plaque destabilization.","Samstag, Yvonne; Bogert, Nicolai V; Wabnitz, Guido H; Din, Shabana; Therre, Markus; Leuschner, Florian; Katus, Hugo A; Konstandin, Mathias H",J Immunol,,242

To further understand the disease pathogenesis and, consequently, to develop an additional tool for clinicians to evaluate patients for presumptive intervention we sought to compare plasma cytokine levels between a range of donor and patient samples grouped by a COVID-19 Severity Score (CSS) based on need for hospitalization and oxygen requirement. Here we utilize a mutual information algorithm that classifies the information gain for CSS prediction provided by cytokine expression levels and clinical variables. Using this methodology, we found that a small number of clinical and cytokine expression variables are predictive of presenting COVID-19 disease severity, raising questions about the mechanism by which COVID-19 creates severe illness. The variables that were the most predictive of CSS included clinical variables such as age and abnormal chest x-ray as well as cytokines such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA). Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a plethora of changes in cytokine profiles and that particularly in severely ill patients, these changes are consistent with the presence of Macrophage Activation Syndrome and could furthermore be used as a biomarker to predict disease severity.","Huntington, Kelsey E; Louie, Anna D; Lee, Chun Geun; Elias, Jack A; Ross, Eric A; El-Deiry, Wafik S",eLife (Cambridge),,242

Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 112 COVID-19 patients with CVD admitted to the western district of Union Hospital in Wuhan, from January 20, 2020 to February 15, 2020. They were divided into critical group (ICU, n=16) and general group (n=96) according to the severity of the disease and patients were followed up to the clinical endpoint. The observation indicators included total blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), arterial blood gas analysis, myocardial injury markers, coagulation function, liver and kidney function, electrolyte, procalcitonin (PCT), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood lipid, pulmonary CT and pathogen detection. Results: Compared with the general group, the lymphocyte count (0.74 (0.34, 0.94)×109/L vs. 0.99 (0.71, 1.29)×109/L, P=0.03) was extremely lower in the critical group, CRP (106.98 (81.57, 135.76) mg/L vs. 34.34 (9.55,76.54) mg/L, P<0.001) and PCT (0.20 (0.15,0.48) µg/L vs. 0.11 (0.06,0.20) µg/L, P<0.001) were significantly higher in the critical group. The BMI of the critical group was significantly higher than that of the general group (25.5 (23.0, 27.5) kg/m2 vs. 22.0 (20.0, 24.0) kg/m2ï¼P=0.003). Patients were further divided into non-survivor group (17, 15.18%) group and survivor group (95, 84.82%). Among the non-survivors, there were 88.24% (15/17) patients with BMI> 25.0 kg/m2, which was significantly higher than that of survivors (18.95% (18/95), P<0.001). Compared with the survived patients, oxygenation index (130 (102, 415) vs. 434 (410, 444), P<0.001) was significantly lower and lactic acid (1.70 (1.30, 3.00) mmol/L vs. 1.20 (1.10, 1.60) mmol/L, P<0.001) was significantly higher in the non-survivors. There was no significant difference in the proportion of ACEI/ARB medication between the critical group and the general group or between non-survivors and survivors ï¼all P>0.05). Conclusion: COVID-19 patients combined with CVD are associated with a higher risk of mortality. Critical patients are characterized with lower lymphocyte counts. Higher BMI are more often seen in critical patients and non-survivor. ACEI/ARB use does not affect the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 combined with CVD. Aggravating causes of death include fulminant inflammation, lactic acid accumulation and thrombotic events.","Peng, Y D; Meng, K; Guan, H Q; Leng, L; Zhu, R R; Wang, B Y; He, M A; Cheng, L X; Huang, K; Zeng, Q T",Zhonghua Xin Xue Guan Bing Za Zhi,,242

Using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the risk factors to COVID-19 RNA shedding was to be established according to demographic information, clinical characteristics, epidemiological history, antiviral medicine and corticosteroid administration. RESULTS: The median duration of COVID-19 RNA shedding from admission was 13.11 ± 0.76 days. There was no significant difference in viral shedding duration in terms of gender, age, history of Hubei province stay, characteristics of chest CT on admission, lymphocytopenia and clinical severity. By Cox proportional hazards model, excessive 200 mg cumulative corticosteroid (HR, 3.425 [95% CI, 1.339-7.143]), time from illness onset to hospitalization (<5 days) (HR, 2.503 [95% CI, 1.433-4.371]) and arbidol-included therapy (HR, 2.073 [95% CI, 1.185-3.626]) were the independent risk factors to delay COVID-19 RNA shedding. Besides of excessive 200 mg of cumulative corticosteroid (HR, 2.825 [95% CI, 1.201-6.649]), admission within 5 days from illness onset (HR, 2.493 [95% CI, 1.393-4.462]) and arbidol-included therapy (HR, 2.102 [95% CI, 1.073-4.120]), lymphocytopenia (HR, 2.153 [95% CI, 1.097-4.225]) was further identified as another unfavorable factor to 10-day viral shedding.

We present here the protocol dedicated to ACS patients adopted in our center since March 13, 2020, and our initial experience in the management of ACS patients during the first 4 weeks of its use. Certainly, the protocol has room for further improvement as everyone's experience grows, but we hope that it could be a starting point, adaptable to different realities and local resources.","Cosentino, Nicola; Assanelli, Emilio; Merlino, Luca; Mazza, Mario; Bartorelli, Antonio L; Marenzi, Giancarlo",Can J Cardiol,,242

248775,Relationships between cardiovascular risk factors and white-coat hypertension diagnosed by home blood pressure recordings in a middle-aged population,2021,"Anthropogenic emissions in China play an important role in altering the global radiation budget Over the past decade, the strong clean-air policies in China have resulted in substantial reductions of anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and primary particulate matter, and air quality in China has consequently improved However, the resultant aerosol radiative forcings have been poorly understood In this study, we used an advanced global climate model integrated with the latest localized emission inventory to quantify the aerosol radiative forcings by the changes of anthropogenic emissions in China between 2008 and 2016 By comparing with multiple observation datasets, our simulations reproduced the considerable reductions of sulfate and black carbon (BC) mass loadings reasonably well over eastern China (the key region subject to stringent emission controls) during the period and accordingly showed a clear decline in both aerosol optical depth and absorption aerosol optical depth The results revealed a regional annual mean positive direct radiative forcing (DRF) of +0 29 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) due to the reduction of SO2 emissions This positive aerosol radiative forcing was comprised of diminished sulfate scattering (+0 58 W m-2), enhanced nitrate radiative effects (-0 29 W m-2), and could be completely offset by the concurrent reduction of BC emissions that induced a negative BC DRF of -0 33 W m-2 Despite the small net aerosol DRF (-0 05 W m-2) at the TOA, aerosol–radiation interactions could explain the surface brightening in China over the past decade The overall reductions in aerosol burdens and associated optical effects mainly from BC and sulfate enhanced the regional annual mean downward solar radiation flux at the surface by +1 0 W m-2 between 2008 and 2016 The enhancement was in general agreement with a long-term observational record of surface energy fluxes in China We also estimated that aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcings may have played a dominant role in the net aerosol radiative forcings at the TOA in China and over the northern Pacific Ocean during the study period This study will facilitate more informed assessment of climate responses to projected emissions in the future as well as to sudden changes in human activities (e g , the COVID-19 lockdown)","Liu, Mingxu Matsui Hitoshi",Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,,242

249112,Clinical impact and predictors of troponin elevation in patients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic caused an abrupt disruption in residency and fellowship training, with most in-person teaching ceasing in March 2020. The AAHKS (American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons) Board of Directors quickly initiated an online lecture series named the Fellows Online COVID-19 AAHKS Learning initiative. The purpose of this study is to illustrate the impact that this educational platform had on residents and adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows. METHODS: Between March 31, 2020 and June 25, 2020 an online educational platform was simultaneously developed and delivered. Adult hip and knee reconstruction fellows and residents were invited to participate in the free, live, online education sessions. Faculty from well-respected institutions from around the United States volunteered their time to host the initiative, choosing topics to present, ranging from hip (13 lectures) and knee (9 lectures), to practice management/miscellaneous (12 lectures). Attendee registrations were tracked via the online platform and the maximum number of attendees per session was recorded. A survey was administered to attendees for feedback. RESULTS: Thirty-four, 1-hour virtual lectures were delivered in real time by 79 different faculty members from 20 different institutions. A total of 4746 registrations for the 34 lectures were received, with 2768 registrants (58.3%) attending. The average attendance was 81 viewers per session (range 21-143), with attendance peaking mid-April 2020. A survey administered to lecture participants showed that 104/109 (95.4%) attended live lectures and 93/109 (85.3%) watched recorded sessions. About 92.5% of attendees responded that they wanted the lectures to continue after clinical responsibilities resumed. CONCLUSION: Amid a pandemic with cessation of in-person training, AAHKS delivered a robust virtual training alternative, exposing residents and fellows to a variety of renowned faculty and topics. Attendance with the program was very high, along with continued interest to continue this initiative. These worldwide lectures may lead to future opportunities in virtual residency and fellowship education.","Hamilton, William G; Loper, Natalie R; Abdel, Matthew P; Springer, Bryan D; Chen, Antonia F",J. arthroplasty,,242

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses and employ a complicated pattern of virus genome length RNA replication as well as transcription of genome length and leader containing subgenomic RNAs. Although not fully understood, both replication and transcription are thought to take place in so-called double-membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Here we show detection of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNAs in diagnostic samples up to 17 days after initial detection of infection and provide evidence for their nuclease resistance and protection by cellular membranes suggesting that detection of subgenomic RNAs in such samples may not be a suitable indicator of active coronavirus replication/infection.","Alexandersen, Soren; Chamings, Anthony; Bhatta, Tarka Raj",Nat Commun,,242

For three-quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 ?g·m?3 (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O3) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O3 concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO2 and O3 toward more O3. The level of total oxidant (Ox = O3?+?NO2) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe. The results illustrate the complexity of the atmospheric response to the unprecedented reduction in the emission of primary pollutants.","Deroubaix, Adrien Brasseur Guy Gaubert Benjamin Labuhn Inga Menut Laurent Siour Guillaume Tuccella Paolo",Meteorological Applications,,242

251158,International Impact of COVID-19 on the Diagnosis of Heart Disease,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Patient activation, or level of engagement in one's medical care is linked to hospital readmissions and worse outcomes in a number of diseases. Patients with higher levels of activation are typically guiding their care rather than acting as passive observers of care. This study aims to determine if either patient demographics or type of vascular disease can predict patient activation. METHODS: All patients presenting over a 4-month period to an outpatient vascular clinic were asked to complete the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) survey. 257 completed surveys were collected. Survey responses were scored on a Likert scale with anchors. Responses are tallied with a score of 1-100 and converted to summary levels 1-4 in accordance with the previously validated scoring system. Level 1 patients are considered disengaged and overwhelmed. Patients in level 2 are becoming aware of their health care, but still struggle. Level 3 patients are taking action, while level 4 represents patients that are maintaining healthy behaviors and pushing further. Chi-square and multivariable regression were then performed to determine if patient characteristics or type of disease correlated with activation levels. RESULTS: 257 patients completed the survey. The mean participant age was 67 years (± 15). 16% of patients lived alone, 58% were married, and in 39% mean household income was <$50,000. Overall, 21 patients (8.2%) were classified as level 1, 65 (25%) level 2, 94 (37%) as level 3, and 77 (30%) level 4. The group comprised 32% PAD, 20% carotid, 18% aortic/aneurysm, 14% venous, and 16% were various other vascular diseases. Over each disease group there was a wide range of activation, but no significant difference between the type of vascular disease and activation level. Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) patients comprised 35% (n= 29) of the PAD group, and 66% of these patients reported an activation level of 3 (n=10) or 4 (n=9). There was no difference in the levels of activation reported by the CLTI patients compared to the general PAD cohort (p = 0.99). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that age, level of education, household income, and type of vascular disease correlated with PAM score, but there was no correlation between length of symptoms or race and gender. CONCLUSION: Patient activation is unpredictable using patient characteristics or type of vascular disease, and CLTI patients report high activation levels. Quality databases that collect only patient demographics may not fully capture patient predictors of poor outcomes. Use of the PAM survey should be further explored in vascular patients to correlate activation level with vascular specific outcomes.","Humphries, Misty D; Welch, Pierce; Hasegawa, Jason; Mell, Matthew W",Ann. vasc. surg,,242

The purpose of this systematic review was to describe and evaluate participant, intervention, methodological, and outcome characteristics of SDM intervention studies conducted within this population. METHODS: Systematic searches of the literature through April 2020 were conducted and supplemented by hand searching of reference lists of identified studies. A total of 53 independent studies of SDM interventions that were conducted with service users with serious mental illnesses and that included a quantitative or qualitative measure of the intervention were included in the review. Data were independently extracted by at least two authors. RESULTS: Most studies were conducted with middle-age, male, White individuals from Western countries. Interventions fell into the following categories: decision support tools only, multicomponent interventions involving decision support tools, multicomponent interventions not involving decision support tools, and shared care planning and preference elicitation interventions. Most studies were randomized controlled trials with sufficient sample sizes. Outcomes assessed were diverse, spanning decision-making constructs, clinical and functional, treatment engagement or adherence, and other constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest important future directions for research, including the need to evaluate the impact of SDM in special populations (e.g., young adults and racial-ethnic minority groups); to expand interventions to a broader array of decisions, users, and contexts; and to establish consensus measures to assess intervention effectiveness.","Thomas, Elizabeth C; Ben-David, Shelly; Treichler, Emily; Roth, Stephanie; Dixon, Lisa B; Salzer, Mark; Zisman-Ilani, Yaara",Psychiatr Serv,,242

Observation: We report the observation of a 30-year-old patient, with no particular pathological history, who presented with appendicular syndrome without extra-digestive signs, and especially, without respiratory syndrome. The CRP was at 35mg/l. A thoracoabdominal CT scan was requested to detect an eventual appendicitis. With three straight frosted glass areas on the thoracic area suggesting COVID 19 infectious pneumopathy, a PCR was requested to detect a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA, then the patient was appendectomized. Post-operative follow-up was simple and the patient was transferred to a department dedicated to covid-19-positive patients for further management. Conclusion: CT scan is necessary before considering emergency surgery for acute appendicitis because it can change the patient's management circuit.","Elbakouri, Abdelilah; El Azhary, Abdessamad; Bouali, Mounir; Bensardi, Fatimazahra; Elhattabi, Khalid; Fadil, Abdelaziz",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,242

254989,"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics analysis of COVID-19 in the surrounding areas of Wuhan, Hubei Province in 2020",2020,"Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms hold promise to reduce inequalities across race and socioeconomic status. One of the most important domains of racial and economic inequalities is medical outcomes;Black and low-income people are more likely to die from many diseases. Algorithms can help reduce these inequalities because they are less likely than human doctors to make biased decisions. Unfortunately, people are generally averse to algorithms making important moral decisions—including in medicine—undermining the adoption of AI in healthcare. Here we use the COVID-19 pandemic to examine whether the threat of racial and economic inequality increases the preference for algorithm decision-making. Four studies (N = 2819) conducted in the United States and Singapore show that emphasizing inequality in medical outcomes increases the preference for algorithm decision-making for triage decisions. These studies suggest that one way to increase the acceptance of AI in healthcare is to emphasize the threat of inequality and its negative outcomes associated with human decision-making. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bigman, Y.

258797,"Colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients: efficacy, safety, and model informed dosage regimens",2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate variations in nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to evaluate whether the presence of potential risk factors influenced these symptoms over time. METHODS: This prospective cohort study surveyed nurses three times - surveying personal factors, working conditions, family dynamics, and attitude towards COVID-19 - between March 31 and May 4, 2020. Nurses' mental health was assessed through Depression Anxiety Stress Scales - short version (DASS-21); their sleep quality was assessed through a 5-point Likert scale question. RESULTS: Nurses' sleep quality and symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress presented a positive variation over the COVID-19 outbreak. The only factors which are directly related to the COVID-19 outbreak and that were associated with the positive variation in nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were the fear to infect others and the fear to be infected (higher fear of being infected or to infect someone corresponded to increased symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress). CONCLUSIONS: Although the COVID-19 outbreak seems to have had an immediate impact on nurses' mental health, a psychological adaptation phenomenon was also observed. Future research should focus on assessing nurses' symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, after the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to compare and contrast the findings with the results of our study.","Sampaio, Francisco; Sequeira, Carlos; Teixeira, Laetitia",Environ Res,,242

As COVID-19, takes thousands of lives all around the world, it seems that the medicinal resources would not be enough to supply billions of peoples, currently living on the planet earth. Thus, this pandemic and its subsequent impacts on the natural order of our life, would be one of the most important threats against the entire human race. Aims & Objective: Due to this, in this project, we have made attempts to find an operative approach for synthesizing this compound as an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), which showed it could be effective in inhibiting the newly emerged coronavirus. RESULTS: The designed scheme uses relatively cheap precursors, and contains one pot stages, instead of seven time consuming, and more costly, linear steps. Also, it is tried to use safe and cheap solvents like water, and ethanol, instead of toxic ones like methanol, and pyridine which could cause rejection of the API in the organic volatile impurities (OVI) test of pharmacopeia analysis, as well as increasing the concern of inflammability, explosive, and carcinogenic properties of those common solvents. CONCLUSION: The most important pharmaceutical analytical methods containing OVI test (mainly ethanol (about 171 ppm) much lower than the limits, by gas chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) instrument), Assay content (about 99.6% by potentiometric titration), and related purity analysis (by High performance liquid chromatography-Ultraviolet Detector (HPLC-UV)) (about 99.8%) were performed and described to give a more clear industrial scheme.","Dadras, Akbar; Rezvanfar, Mohammad Amin; Beheshti, Abolghasem; Naeimi, Sedigheh Sadat; Siadati, Seyyed Amir",Combinatorial chemistry &amp; high throughput screening (Online),,242

Protein ACE2 expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry from paraffin sections. RESULTS: The therapy with RAAS blockers was not associated with increased ACE2, ACE, or ATGR1 expression in kidney allografts and also ACE2 protein immunohistochemistry did not reveal differences among groups. CONCLUSIONS: ACEis or ARBs in kidney transplant recipients do not affect local ACE2 expression. This observation supports long-term RAAS treatment in kidney transplant recipients, despite acute complications such as COVID-19 where ACE2 serves as the entry protein for infection.","Cahova, Monika; Kveton, Martin; Petr, Vojtech; Funda, David; Dankova, Helena; Viklicky, Ondrej; Hruba, Petra",Kidney Blood Press Res,,242

Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which however is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of 5 or 9 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and 1 positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool viral transport medium (VTM) of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.

265621,How can we better predict pulmonary blood clots in patients hospitalised for COVID-19?,2020,"Introduction: Bronchopleural fistulas (BPF) with persistent air leak (PAL) are associated with significant morbidity, including longer ICU and hospital stays and increased incidence of pneumonia. Some PAL are managed conservatively with chest tube placement and ventilator adjustments, while some require chemical/blood patch pleurodesis or surgical intervention. Endobronchial valves (EBVs) and intrabronchial valves (IBVs) have been proposed as nonsurgical options for PAL and have been effective in select cases. This case reports the bilateral placement of IBVs to address large bilateral PAL in a patient with e-cigarette or vaping product use-induced lung injury (EVALI) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Case Description: Patient is a 19-yearold male with history of marijuana abuse (smoking and “heavy” vaping) who presented with progressive shortness of breath. Imaging demonstrated extensive bilateral alveolar consolidations with air bronchograms and groundglass opacities with areas of reticulation and cystic changes. Respiratory viral PCR testing including COVID-19 were negative, and patient was initiated on broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose steroids for presumed EVALI. He was intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and developed bilateral pneumothoraces requiring placement of bilateral large-bore thoracostomy tubes. Large bilateral PALs with residual pneumothoraces did not resolve after placement of additional bilateral thoracostomy tubes. Venovenous ECMO was initiated due to hypercapnia and hypoxia on maximal ventilator settings. To promote pleurodesis with continued large bilateral PAL, Spiration IBVs were deployed to RB 1, RB 2, RB 3, LB 1-3, and LB 4-5. Blood patch pleurodesis was also performed bilaterally. IBVs at RB 3 and LB 4-5 were subsequently found to have migrated and were replaced. The bilateral PALs nearly resolved with these interventions, and ventilator air leak diminished. Patient ultimately developed diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and was transferred on ECMO for lung transplant evaluation due to severe irreversible pulmonary parenchymal disease. Discussion: Endobronchial and intrabronchial valve use for treatment of bronchopleural fistulas has been reported in the literature since 2002, but have generally been used for postoperative PAL or spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL. This patient had severe parenchymal lung disease secondary to EVALI and developed bilateral pneumothoraces with large PALs while ventilated, requiring ECMO for adequate oxygenation. Spiration IBVs were deployed to the right upper lobe and left upper lobe/lingula with near resolution of air leaks. Although this patient's severe parenchymal disease did not permit discontinuation of ECMO despite improved ventilation, the use of endobronchial and intrabronchial valves provides a less invasive intervention for persistent BPF in the unstable patient.","Riggle, J.; Pitts, L.

However, strict adherence to precautionary measures can be demanding. METHODS: This cluster randomised controlled trial done among 1517 undergraduate dental students tested the effectiveness of 'dissonance induction' (DI) and 'assessment reactivity' (AR) in improving adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) measures as compared to a control group. At baseline, participants in the DI group were tested for their knowledge of precautionary measures, immediately followed by assessment of their adherence to them. This methodology was adapted to systematically reveal the poor adherence of the participants in their self-held cognitions, should there be any. The magnitude of dissonance was measured as the proportion of such dissonant cognitions held by an individual. In the AR group, at baseline, participants were asked about their attitudes alone toward measures. The control group was neither assessed for knowledge and adherence nor for attitudes toward the measures at baseline. Two weeks after the administration of these interventions in the DI and AR groups, the 3 study groups were assessed for adherence. RESULTS: The follow-up adherence scores in the DI group were found to be significantly higher (15.11 ± 4.1) compared to the AR (13.13 ± 2.01) and control (12.87 ± 2.97) groups as analysed by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (Hâ¯=â¯243.5; P < .001). Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that the adherence scores significantly improved in the DI group from baseline to follow-up (zâ¯=â¯-8.84; P < .001). Magnitude of dissonance at baseline was found to be a significant predictor of follow-up adherence scores (R2â¯=â¯0.255). CONCLUSION: This study found that DI is an easy intervention to bring an immediate and significant change in adherence to precautionary measures.","Chandu, Viswa Chaitanya; Lingamaneni, Krishna Prasad; Pachava, Srinivas; Baddam, Venkat Ramana Reddy; Marella, Yamuna",Int. dent. j,,242

The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support. The rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will certainly lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months. Performing tracheostomy in the setting of active SARS-CoV-2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers.

266812,"Testing the feasibility of operationalizing a prospective, randomized trial with remote cardiac safety EKG monitoring during a pandemic",2021,"The new coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a major public health concern, with a high burden and risk for infection among patients and healthcare workers. Saliva droplets containing SARS-COV-2 are a major vector for COVID-19 infection, making saliva a promising alternative for COVID-19 testing using nasopharyngeal swab samples. To diagnose COVID-19 patients in the field, a point-of-care test (POCT) using saliva was conceptualized. We have developed a simple method for extracting RNA from saliva samples using semi-alkaline proteinase, a sputum homogenizer typically used for preparing samples for tuberculosis testing, and a subsequent simple heating step with no need for centrifugation or RNA extraction. Further, we newly developed a triplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification approach (RT-LAMP) which utilizes colorimetric readout using a heat block, with results evaluated with the unaided eye. In 44 clinical patients suspected of having COVID-19 infection, the test took 45 min, and resulted in a diagnostic sensitivity of 82.6% (19/23) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (21/21), compared to the reference standard. The limit of detection was 250 copies/reaction (25,000 copies/mL). Our newly developed POCT approach achieved simple RNA extraction and constant RT-LAMP detection. This POCT has the potential to be used for simple inspection stations in a field setting, helping reduce the risk of infection by simplifying and accelerating testing for COVID-19.","Yamazaki, Wataru; Matsumura, Yasufumi; Thongchankaew-Seo, Uraiwan; Yamazaki, Yasuko; Nagao, Miki",J Clin Virol,,242

Views: COVID-19, caused by SARS-COV-2, is a new, highly contagious pandemic disease transmitted mainly by way of respiratory droplets. The virus mostly attacks the respiratory system, although in some cases, the nervous system is also affected. Either right at the outset of the disease or in its later stages, patients with COVID-19 may develop neurological symptoms. Smell and/or taste problems and myopathy are the initial symptoms observed even without the coexistence of respiratory complaints. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may also experience acute cerebrovascular events. Hypertension and diabetes stand out as the most common comorbidities but many patients also have coexisting neurological disorders. Neurologists may come into contact with infected patients while working in outpatient clinics, emergency rooms or hospital wards. Conclusions: The awareness of SARS-COV-2 s neurotropism helps neurologists make a correct diagnosis early in a course of disease and apply isolation in order to prevent the deterioration of clinical symptoms and prevent further transmission of the virus. Close cooperation between neurologists and specialists in infectious diseases is the basic form of care for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with concomitant neurological diseases. NeuroCovid units that provide care for such patients might be coming in our near future.","Bucior, Ewelina; Sienkiewicz-Jarosz, Halina; Konopko, Magdalena",Postepy Psychiatri. Neurol.,,242

DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of national surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in: 2016 American Community Survey, the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the 2016 National Health Interview Survey, the 1999-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. METHODS: We estimated VI and blindness prevalence rates and confidence intervals for each survey measure and age-group using the Clopper-Pearson method. We then estimated weighted self-reported VI and blindness prevalence rates across survey measures by age-group using inverse variance weighting, fitted trend lines to age-group estimates, and used the trend-line equations to estimate the number of U.S. persons with VI and blindness in 2016. We compared these self-report estimates to those generated from NHANES physical evaluations of presenting VI and blindness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The variability of prevalence estimates of VI and blindness RESULTS: Survey response estimates of blindness varied between 0.1% and 5.6% for age-groups <65 years and between 0.6% to 16.6% for ages >=65. Estimates of VI varied between 1.6% and 24.8% for age-groups <65 years and between 2.2% and 26.6% for age-groups >=65. For summarized survey results and NHANES physical evaluation, prevalence rates for VI increased significantly with age-group. Blindness prevalence increased significantly with age-group for summarized survey responses but not for NHANES physical examination. Based on extrapolations of NHANES physical examination data to all ages, we estimated that in 2016, 23.4 million persons in the U.S. (7.2%) had VI or blindness, an evaluated visual acuity of 20/40 or worse in the better-seeing eye before correction; based on weighted self-reported surveys, we estimated 24.8 million persons (7.7%) had presenting VI or blindness. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence rates of VI and blindness obtained from national survey measures varied widely across surveys and age-groups. Additional research is needed to validate the ability of survey self-report measures of VI and blindness to replicate results obtained through clinical exam by an eye health professional.","Rein, David B; Lamuda, Phoebe A; Wittenborn, John S; Okeke, Nnenna; Davidson, Clare E; Swenor, Bonnielin K; Saaddine, Jinan; Lundeen, Elizabeth A",Ophthalmology,,242

A total of 24 lambs, aged 6 months weighing 8.0 ± 0.5 kg were randomly allocated to one of two dietary treatments: (1) CL diet-roadside grass and concentrate mixture; (2) PL diet-CL diet + 5% fresh plantain supplementation on a DM basis. The PL diet group exhibited 23% higher (P = 0.01) average daily gain and 15% improved (P = 0.03) feed conversion efficiency. Circulating cholesterol concentrations were suppressed by 9% (P = 0.03), and liver enzyme activity was improved by 5-25% (P < 0.05) in the lamb fed PL diet, compared with CL diet only. The inclusion of plantain in the diet was highly effective at suppressing the parasites, Paramphistomum spp. (P = 0.003) and coccidial parasites (P = 0.04), but not stomach worms. Moreover, plantain supplementation increased growth hormone and insulin concentrations in plasma level, whereas decreased carcass fat by 32.7%. Therefore, supplementation of the lambs' diet with plantain showed some beneficial effects on productivity and parasitic infection, while it led to a leaner carcass.","Reza, M M; Redoy, M R A; Rahman, M A; Ety, S; Alim, M A; Cheng, L; Al-Mamun, M",Trop Anim Health Prod,,242

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. PARTICIPANTS: The participants in this study are cases identified by epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province, as of February 27, 2020, and were followed until March 7, 2020. In total, 1,989 HCWs and 41,137 other occupational cases were included for analysis. METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to summarize patient characteristics. RESULTS: Of 1,989 laboratory-confirmed HCWs, 297 (14.93%) had severe or critical cases, 73 (3.67%) had asymptomatic infections, and 18 died of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The case fatality rate was 0.9%. The proportion of severe or critical cases decreased from the beginning to the end of the outbreak (from 21.29% to 3.52%), and the proportion of asymptomatic cases increased from 0.0% to 47.18%. Nearly half of HCWs with confirmed COVID-19 reported no known contact with COVID-19 patients (969, 48.72%). Fever and cough were the most common symptoms at disease onset in both HCWs and other occupational cases; however, HCWs had higher rates of fatigue (30.90% vs 25.02%; P < .001) and myalgia (19.15% vs 13.43%; P < .001). Additionally, compared with other occupational groups, HCWs were associated with a lower risk of death after adjustment for potential confounders (odd ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with COVID-19 cases in other occupational groups, HCWs with COVID-19 have half the risk of death, although they have been shown to have higher rates of fatigue and myalgia.","Wu, Mingyang; Xie, Cong; Wu, Ran; Shu, Yanling; Wang, Lulin; Li, Mingyan; Wang, Youjie",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,242

There is no firm consensus on transfer predictors from the RICU to the ICU. METHODS: In this retrospective observational single center study, we evaluated 96 COVID-19 patients referred to the RICU for acute respiratory failure (ARF) according to their transferal to the ICU or their stay at the RICU. We compared demographic data, baseline laboratory profile, and final clinical outcomes to identify early risk factors for transfer. RESULTS: The best predictors for transfer to the ICU were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphopenia. The mortality rate was lower in the RICU than in the ICU, where transferred patients who died were mostly younger men and with less comorbidities than those in the RICU. CONCLUSIONS: Few inflammatory markers can predict the need for transfer from the RICU to the ICU. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we urge better clinical stratification by early and meaningful profiles in patients admitted to the RICU who are at risk of transferal to the ICU.","Buonamico, Enrico; Quaranta, Vitaliano Nicola; Boniello, Esterina; Dimitri, Michela; Di Lecce, Valentina; Labate, Luciana; Pierucci, Paola; Capozza, Elena; Carpagnano, Giovanna Elisiana; Resta, Onofrio",Respiratory investigation (Online),,242

A solid communication strategy is needed to increase the reach of valid information to health professionals, reduce misinformation, and efficiently implement recommended measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to describe the utilization of a dedicated mobile health (mHealth) platform to disseminate up-to-date and validated information about SARS-CoV-2 to all medical staff of the Children's Hospital at the University Hospitals of Geneva. METHODS: Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. Using a third-party statistics tool, we anonymously monitored user activity as well as content utilization patterns since the diagnosis of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland on February 25, 2020. RESULTS: From February 25, 2020, to March 13, 2020 (18 days), information documents on SARS-CoV-2 were viewed 859 times, which accounted for 35.6% of the total content views (total views=332). User activity increased significantly with 50.8 (SD 14.4) users per day in this period as compared to the previous weeks (mean 26.4, SD 9.8; P<.001). In addition, session numbers per day more than doubled during the aforementioned period (P<.001). In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app. On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The use of an mHealth solution to disseminate novel coronavirus-related information seemed to be an effective and time-saving communication channel within our institution during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Medical staff felt reassured and informed in daily practice. More research should be done on the clinical impact and outcomes of the integration of mHealth solutions as a communication channel of validated information within health institutions.","Zamberg, Ido; Manzano, Sergio; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Windisch, Olivier; Agoritsas, Thomas; Schiffer, Eduardo",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,242

The. SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which is having a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, and, above all, human health. The disease is characterized by dry cough, fever, fatigue, myalgia, and dyspnea. Other symptoms include headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and gastrointestinal disorders. Pneumonia appears to be the most common and severe manifestation of the infection. Currently, there is no vaccine or specific drug for COVID-19. Further, the development of new antiviral requires a considerable length of time and effort for drug design and validation. Therefore, repurposing the use of natural compounds can provide alternatives and can support therapy against COVID-19.

Equally important, understanding the impact of the virus on the host system in convalescent patients, healthy otherwise or with co-morbidities, is expected to aid in developing effective strategies in the management of patients afflicted with the disease. Viruses possess the uncanny ability to redirect host metabolism to serve their needs and also limit host immune response to ensure their survival. An ever-increasingly powerful approach uses metabolomics to uncover diverse molecular signatures that influence a wide array of host signalling networks in different viral infections. This would also help integrate experimental findings from individual studies to yield robust evidence. In addition, unravelling the molecular mechanisms harnessed by both viruses and tumours in their host metabolism will help broaden the repertoire of therapeutic tools available to combat viral disease.","Ganesh, Goutham V; Mohanram, Ramkumar K",Rev Med Virol,,242

Around 30% of patients with COVID-19 experience severe respiratory distress and are admitted to the intensive care unit for comprehensive critical care. Patients with COVID-19 often present an enhanced immune response with a hyperinflammatory state characterized by a “cytokine storm,” which may reflect changes in the microbiota composition. Moreover, the evolution to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may increase the severity of COVID-19 and related dysbiosis. During critical illness, the multitude of therapies administered, including antibiotics, sedatives, analgesics, body position, invasive mechanical ventilation, and nutritional support, may enhance the inflammatory response and alter the balance of patients' microbiota. This status of dysbiosis may lead to hyper vulnerability in patients and an inappropriate response to critical circumstances. In this context, the aim of our narrative review is to provide an overview of possible interaction between patients' microbiota dysbiosis and clinical status of severe COVID-19 with ARDS, taking into consideration the characteristic hyperinflammatory state of this condition, respiratory distress, and provide an overview on possible nutritional strategies for critically ill patients with COVID-19-ARDS.","Battaglini, D.; Robba, C.; Fedele, A.; Trancǎ, S.; Sukkar, S.

Its relationship with chronic comorbidities is still unclear. We aimed to determine the effects of chronic comorbidities on clinical outcomes of patients with and without COVID-19. This was an analysis of 65,535 patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease (38,324 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 27,211 SARS-CoV-2 negative) from January 01 to May 12, 2020 using the national administrative healthcare open data of Mexico. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. General characteristics and chronic comorbidities were explored. Clinical outcomes of interest were hospital admission, pneumonia, intensive care unit admission, endotracheal intubation and mortality. Prevalence of chronic comorbidities was 49.4%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the effect of age, male sex, bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease on clinical outcomes was similar for both SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients. Adverse clinical outcomes were associated with the time from symptoms onset to medical contact, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension and obesity in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, but with cardiovascular disease in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (p value < 0.01 for all comparisons). Chronic comorbidities are commonly found in patients with suspicion of viral respiratory disease. The knowledge of the impact of comorbidities on adverse clinical outcomes can better define those COVID-19 patients at higher risk. The different impact of the specific type of chronic comorbidity on clinical outcomes in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection requires further researches. These findings need confirmation using other data sources.","Martos-Benítez, Frank Daniel; Soler-Morejón, Caridad Dios; García-Del Barco, Diana",Intern. emerg. med,,242

273687,Research and Clinical Practice- the Soul and Breath of Internal Medicine,2021,"COVID-19 is reducing the ability to perform surgical procedures worldwide, giving rise to a multitude of ethical, practical and medical dilemmas. Adapting to crisis conditions requires a rethink of traditional best practices in surgical management, delving into an area of unknown risk profiles. Key challenging areas include cancelling elective operations, modifying procedures to adapt local services and updating the consenting process. We aim to provide an ethical rationale to support change in practice and guide future decision-making. Using the four principles approach as a structure, Medline was searched for existing ethical frameworks aimed at resolving conflicting moral duties. Where insufficient data were available, best guidance was sought from educational institutions: National Health Service England and The Royal College of Surgeons. Multiple papers presenting high-quality, reasoned, ethical theory and practice guidance were collected. Using this as a basis to assess current practice, multiple requirements were generated to ensure preservation of ethical integrity when making management decisions. Careful consideration of ethical principles must guide production of local guidance ensuring consistent patient selection thus preserving equality as well as quality of clinical services. A critical issue is balancing the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19 and its associated complications. As such, the need for surgery must be sufficiently pressing to proceed with conventional or non-conventional operative management; otherwise, delaying intervention is justified. For delayed operations, it is our duty to quantify the long-term impact on patients' outcome within the constraints of pandemic management and its long-term outlook.","Macleod, Jack; Mezher, Sermed; Hasan, Ragheb",J. med. ethics,,242

274465,Noteworthy Neurological Manifestations Associated With COVID-19 Infection,2020,"As with other countries globally, Rwanda has faced a recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) against a backdrop of an HIV epidemic. At present, there is no successful cure or vaccine for both COVID-19 and HIV. People with underlying conditions, including HIV, are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 manifestations. This underscores the need to enhance the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of people living with HIV (PLWH) to protect this population against COVID-19. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from August 31 to September 18, 2020 among 376 participants who were selected by a simple random sampling technique. A pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Quality scores were calculated as a measure of the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) levels. The student t-test was used to compare continuous variables between low (<65%) and high (&#8805;65%) KAP scores. The chi-square test was used to determine the association between KAP scores and categorical variables. All decisions on statistical tests were concluded at 5% level of significance. All statistical analysis was performed using STATA statistical package version 11.2 (STATA Corp., Texas, USA). Of the 376 participants, 363 (97%) obtained a high knowledge score, while more than a quarter of the participants (26%) had a poor attitude score, and the majority (90%) having a high practice score. There was no association between gender, age, place of residence, employment, or duration on ART and knowledge score. Employment status and duration on antiretroviral treatment (ART) were significantly associated with attitude scores (p = 0.004 and p = 0.013, respectively). Gender and duration on ART were significantly associated with practice scores (p = 0.02 and p = 0.012, respectively). There was a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.57) between knowledge and attitude scores, and knowledge and practice scores (r = 0.55). There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.67) between attitude scores and practice scores. Health education programs tailored for PLWH and aimed at mobilizing and improving COVID-19-related knowledge, attitude, and practice should be prioritized in the Rwandan COVID-19 response.","Iradukunda, Patrick Gad; Pierre, Gashema; Muhozi, Valens; Denhere, Knowledge; Dzinamarira, Tafadzwa",J. community health,,242

276422,Pregnancy and delivery considerations during COVID-19,2021,"Mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants can compromise the effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies. Most clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies target the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), but variants often have multiple mutations in several spike regions. To help predict antibody potency against emerging variants, we evaluated 25 clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies for neutralization activity against 60 pseudoviruses bearing spikes with single or multiple substitutions in several spike domains, including the full set of substitutions in B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.429 (Epsilon), B.1.526 (Iota), A.23.1 and R.1 variants. We found that 14 of 15 single antibodies were vulnerable to at least one RBD substitution, but most combination and polyclonal therapeutic antibodies remained potent. Key substitutions in variants with multiple spike substitutions predicted resistance, but the degree of resistance could be modified in unpredictable ways by other spike substitutions that may reside outside of the RBD. These findings highlight the importance of assessing antibody potency in the context of all substitutions in a variant and show that epistatic interactions in spike can modify virus susceptibility to therapeutic antibodies. ImportanceTherapeutic antibodies are effective in preventing severe disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), but their effectiveness may be reduced by virus variants with mutations affecting the spike protein. To help predict resistance to therapeutic antibodies in emerging variants, we profiled resistance patterns of 25 antibody products in late stages of clinical development against a large panel of variants that include single and multiple substitutions found in the spike protein. We found that the presence of a key substitution in variants with multiple spike substitutions can predict resistance against a variant, but that other substitutions can affect the degree of resistance in unpredictable ways. These finding highlight complex interactions among substitutions in the spike protein affecting virus neutralization and potentially virus entry into cells.","Lusvarghi, Sabrina; Wang, Wei; Herrup, Rachel; Neerukonda, Sabari Nath; Vassell, Russell; Bentley, Lisa; Eakin, Ann E.; Weiss, Carol D.",,,242

OBJECTIVES: We elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which the cyclophilin inhibitors Cyclosporin A (CsA) and Alisporivir (ALV) restrict MERS-CoV to validate their suitability as readily-available therapy in MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Calu-3 cells and primary human alveolar epithelial cells (hAEC) were infected with MERS-CoV and treated with CsA or ALV or inhibitors targeting cyclophilin inhibitor-regulated molecules including Calcineurin, NFAT, or MAP kinases. Novel CsA-induced pathways were identified by RNA sequencing and manipulated by gene knockdown or neutralising antibodies. Viral replication was quantified by qRT-PCR and TCID50. Data were validated in a murine MERS-CoV infection model. RESULTS: CsA and ALV both reduced MERS-CoV titers and viral RNA replication in Calu-3 and hAEC improving epithelial integrity. While neither Calcineurin nor NFAT inhibition reduced MERS-CoV propagation, blockade of c-Jun N-terminal kinase diminished infectious viral particle release but not RNA accumulation. Importantly, CsA induced interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), a pronounced type-III-interferon (IFN&#955;) response and expression of antiviral genes. Down-regulation of IRF1 or IFN&#955; increased MERS-CoV propagation in presence of CsA. Importantly, oral application of CsA reduced MERS-CoV replication in vivo, correlating with elevated lung IFN&#955; levels and improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that cyclophilin inhibitors efficiently decrease MERS-CoV replication in vitro and in vivo via upregulation of inflammatory, antiviral cell responses, in particular IFN&#955;. CsA might therefore represent a promising candidate to treat MERS-CoV infection.","Sauerhering, Lucie; Kupke, Alexandra; Meier, Lars; Dietzel, Erik; Hoppe, Judith; Gruber, Achim D; Gattenloehner, Stefan; Witte, Biruta; Fink, Ludger; Hofmann, Nina; Zimmermann, Tobias; Goesmann, Alexander; Nist, Andrea; Stiewe, Thorsten; Becker, Stephan; Herold, Susanne; Peteranderl, Christin",Eur. respir. j,,242

In older adults, however vaccines are generally less efficacious and the molecular mechanisms that underpin this remain largely unknown. Autophagy, a process known to prevent aging, is critical for the maintenance of immune memory in mice. Here, we show that autophagy is specifically induced in vaccine-induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy human volunteers. In addition, reduced IFNÎ³ secretion by RSV-induced T cells in older vaccinees correlates with low autophagy levels. We demonstrate that levels of the endogenous autophagy-inducing metabolite spermidine fall in human T cells with age. Spermidine supplementation in T cells from old donors recovers their autophagy level and function, similar to young donors' cells, in which spermidine biosynthesis has been inhibited. Finally, our data show that endogenous spermidine maintains autophagy via the translation factor eIF5A and transcription factor TFEB. In summary, we have provided evidence for the importance of autophagy in vaccine immunogenicity in older humans and uncovered two novel drug targets that may increase vaccination efficiency in the aging context.","Alsaleh, Ghada; Panse, Isabel; Swadling, Leo; Zhang, Hanlin; Richter, Felix Clemens; Meyer, Alain; Lord, Janet; Barnes, Eleanor; Klenerman, Paul; Green, Christopher; Simon, Anna Katharina",eLife (Cambridge),,242
279563,Reply - Letter to the editor - Nutritional interventions to modulate haemoglobin-oxygen affinity in COVID-19 patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Compression of the cauda equina can lead to bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction with lower limb pain, numbness and weakness. Urgent surgical decompression aims to prevent progressive neurological deficit. Symptoms of cauda equina syndrome (CES), such as back pain, sciatica and bladder dysfunction are common in the population, but the majority of those investigated do not have radiological cauda equina compression. However, a missed diagnosis can have significant medical, social and legal consequences. We investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on presentation and management of suspected CES. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed referral, investigation and treatment of CES in a regional neurosurgical centre during the initial COVID-19 surge between March and May 2020 compared with March to May 2019. RESULTS: Referrals for suspected CES were similar during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 275) compared with 2019 (n = 261, p = 0.596) despite a significant (19%) decrease in total emergency neurosurgical referrals (1248 in 2020 vs 1544 in 2019, p < 0.001). Nineteen (7%) of the suspected CES referrals underwent decompression in 2020, similar to 16 (6%) in 2019 (p = 0.867). There were no differences in outcomes or complications and no evidence of delays in presentation or treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other emergency neurosurgical conditions, the number of referrals for suspected CES and the percentage of referrals with radiological cauda equina compression were unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The persistence of CES referrals when many people stayed away from hospital highlights the distress and worry caused by suspected CES and its symptoms to both patients and healthcare providers.","Woodfield, J; Brennan, P M; Statham, Pfx; Stone, J; Hoeritzauer, I",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,,242

The central aim of this study was to build, assess, and revise a virtual experience simulation that allows nursing students to observe a standardized clinical situation in an immersive environment and then practice the situation-background-assessment-recommendation communication method. This between-groups experimental study, which was modified in light of COVID-19 concerns, evaluated how well 69 prelicensure nursing students understood a handoff communication report after viewing a virtual human patient and nurse interact during a triage assessment scenario. Results indicate student comprehension levels did not differ based on which of two metacognitive learning strategies was used. Participants in both study groups were able to accurately complete a situation-background-assessment-recommendation instrument based on the virtual experience. Further, they believed that watching a virtual nurse perform a triage assessment would help them perform one themselves in a similar virtual environment. There was also an unexpected study finding related to patient safety within the context of the simulation. This finding warrants further research that will lead to revision of the virtual experience used to train future nurses.","Stuart, Jacob; Aul, Karen; Bumbach, Michael D; Stephen, Anita; Lok, Benjamin",Comput. inform. nurs,,242

DESIGN: Cohort study of women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 1 July 2020. SETTING: London Teaching Hospital. POPULATION: All women delivering between 1 January 2016 and 13 May 2020 and follow up of women screening negative between 1 April 2020 and 13 May 2020. METHODS: Retrospective study of prospectively collected data. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detection rate of gestational diabetes. RESULTS: Using the RCOG guidance, the overall rate of women identified as having gestational diabetes fell from 7.7% (1853/24168) to 4.2% (35/831)(P = 0.0003). Of 230 women who tested negative according to the RCOG criteria from 1 April to 13 May but who subsequently had an oral glucose tolerance test, 47 (20.4%) were diagnosed as having gestational diabetes according to the NICE criteria. CONCLUSIONS: In our setting, the RCOG Covid-19 gestational diabetes screening regime failed to detect 47 of 82 (57%) women subsequently identified as gestational diabetics, and therefore cannot be recommended for general use. TWEETABLE ABSTRACT: Screening for GDM using RCOG Covid criteria reduced detection rates.","van-de-l039,; Isle, Y; Steer, P J; Watt Coote, I; Cauldwell, M",BJOG,,242

282933,COVID-19 in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: an Italian multicentre survey,2021,"Microarray technology is known as one of the most important tools for collecting DNA expression data. This technology allows researchers to investigate and examine types of diseases and their origins. However, microarray data are often associated with challenges such as small sample size, a significant number of genes, imbalanced data, etc. that make classification models inefficient. Thus, a new hybrid solution based on multi-filter and adaptive chaotic multi-objective forest optimization algorithm (AC-MOFOA) is presented to solve the gene selection problem and construct the Ensemble Classifier. In the proposed solution, to reduce the dataset's dimensions, a multi-filter model uses a combination of five filter methods to remove redundant and irrelevant genes. Then, an AC-MOFOA based on the concepts of non-dominated sorting, crowding distance, chaos theory, and adaptive operators is presented. AC-MOFOA as a wrapper method aimed at reducing dataset dimensions, optimizing KELM, and increasing the accuracy of the classification, simultaneously. Next, in this method, an ensemble classifier model is presented using AC-MOFOA results to classify microarray data. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated on nine public microarray datasets, and its results were compared in terms of the number of selected genes, classification efficiency, execution time, time complexity, and hypervolume indicator criterion with five hybrid multi-objective methods. According to the results, the proposed hybrid method could increase the accuracy of the KELM in most datasets by reducing the dataset's dimensions and achieve similar or superior performance compared to other multi-objective methods. Furthermore, the proposed Ensemble Classifier model could provide better classification accuracy and generalizability in microarray data compared to conventional ensemble methods.","Nouri-Moghaddam, Babak; Ghazanfari, Mehdi; Fathian, Mohammad",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00819v1.pdf,242
283105,Body Mass Index and Prognosis of COVID-19 Infection. A Systematic Review,2020,"The novel coronavirus outbreak induces many concerns about the management of pregnancy, as well as rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. The very rapid spread of the infection throughout all inhabited continents leads to a fast-growing number of infected with SARS-CoV-2 and requires answers and special recommendations to the most vulnerable group of people: pregnant woman and patients on immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment. A systematic literature search was performed in Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus database for studies describing COVID-19 infection in pregnant women diagnosed with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. From the 1,115 initially identified articles, we selected 29 publications in the English language, from which 18 were eligible according to the inclusion criteria. Limited number of cases and further researches are required to evaluate the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to her infant as well as clinical features of infection in pregnant women. The conclusions of different authors, despite the small number of cases, suggest that there is no vertical transmission in women diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although the World Health Organization recently reported that pregnant patients do not have a higher risk of infection than the rest of the population, Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists and The Royal College of Midwives for COVID-19 infection in pregnancy published Guidelines for pregnant women with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.Considerations about patients with rheumatic diseases on the immunosuppressive treatment required European League Against Rheumatism, American College of Rheumatology, British Society for Rheumatology, and Australian Rheumatology Association to publish recommendations for patients with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19. These algorithms are very important to the medical society, but many concerns, absence of experience, and many questions are still unanswered and need time to be resolved and proceed successfully in this global pandemic situation.","Boyadzhieva, Vladimira Vasileva; Stoilov, Nikolay Rumenov; Stoilov, Rumen Malinov",Rheumatol Int,,242

This has led to widespread testing that resulted in the interruption of the supply chain for testing materials around the world. A prospective study was conducted to compare cheap and easily sourced 3-dimensionally printed polylactic acid and polyester nasopharyngeal swabs to commercially manufactured swabs, in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During the study period, 287 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized COVID-19 patients, at multiple stages of their illness, were enrolled. The median age for the study population was 47.6 years (IQR: 34.4-56.6 years) and two-thirds (67.6%) of the subjects were male. The median duration of hospitalization, at the time of sampling, was 13 days (IQR 10-16 days). Overall concordance between the prototype and control swabs was 80.8% (Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.61). Most discrepant results were due to prototype-positive control-negative results. When considering all positive results to be true positives, the prototype swab had a higher sensitivity (90.6% vs 80.8%, 95%CI 85.7-94.0% and 74.7-85.7%, respectively, p < 0.015). The cost to produce the prototype swab was estimated to be 0.05 USD per swab. Polylactic acid 3D-printed polyester-tipped swabs were shown to be effective for nasopharyngeal sample collection. We believe that this design can easily be adopted in countries where commercial swabs are not readily available and can play a vital role in public health efforts for disease control in low-income countries.","Alghounaim, Mohammad; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al Youha, Sarah; Papenburg, Jesse; Alowaish, Osama; AbdulHussain, Ghadeer; Al-Shemali, Rawan; Albuloushi, Ahmad; Alzabin, Saud; Al-Wogayan, Khaled; Al-Mutawa, Yousef; Al-Sabah, Salman",J. clin. microbiol,,242

284434,"Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at Hvidovre Hospital, March-April 2020",2020,"PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency department (ED) volumes have fluctuated. We hypothesized that natural language processing (NLP) models could quantify changes in detection of acute abdominal pathology (acute appendicitis (AA), acute diverticulitis (AD), or bowel obstruction (BO)) on CT reports. METHODS: This retrospective study included 22,182 radiology reports from CT abdomen/pelvis studies performed at an urban ED between January 1, 2018 to August 14, 2020. Using a subset of 2448 manually annotated reports, we trained random forest NLP models to classify the presence of AA, AD, and BO in report impressions. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross validation. The NLP classifiers were then applied to all reports. RESULTS: The NLP classifiers for AA, AD, and BO demonstrated cross-validation classification accuracies between 0.97 and 0.99 and F1-scores between 0.86 and 0.91. When applied to all CT reports, the estimated numbers of AA, AD, and BO cases decreased 43-57% in April 2020 (first regional peak of COVID-19 cases) compared to 2018-2019. However, the number of abdominal pathologies detected rebounded in May-July 2020, with increases above historical averages for AD. The proportions of CT studies with these pathologies did not significantly increase during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Dramatic decreases in numbers of acute abdominal pathologies detected by ED CT studies were observed early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, though these numbers rapidly rebounded. The proportions of CT cases with these pathologies did not increase, which suggests patients deferred care during the first pandemic peak. NLP can help automatically track findings in ED radiology reporting.","Li, Matthew D; Wood, Peter A; Alkasab, Tarik K; Lev, Michael H; Kalpathy-Cramer, Jayashree; Succi, Marc D",Am J Emerg Med,,242

AIM: The aim was to evaluate shoulder joint position sense (JPS) following reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) for patients with cuff arthropathy. METHODS: Twenty-nine patients that underwent unilateral rTSA (19 females, 10 males) and 31 healthy volunteers evaluated for JPS of shoulder using a dedicated high accuracy electronic goniometer. Error of active reproduction of joint position (EARJP) was assessed at the following reference positions: 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° for forward flexion and abduction and 15°, 30°, and 45° for internal and external rotation in rTSA, contralateral non-operated, and control shoulders. RESULTS: Results of EPRJP for rTSA, contralateral, and control (respectively) are as follows:Forward flexion: 30° = (8.0 ± 5.7, 9.8 ± 6.1, and 4.9 ± 3.0), 60° = (5.0 ± 2.8, 5.9 ± 2.7, and 5.1 ± 3.2), 90° = (3.1 ± 1.6, 5.5 ± 2.6, and 3.2 ± 1.4), and 120° = (3.4 ± 2.1, 5.6 ± 4.0, and 3.5 ± 1.7)Abduction: 30° = (5.2 ± 2.5, 9.1 ± 6.1, and 4.6 ± 2.3), 60° = (5.2 ± 3.6, 6.6 ± 4.1, and 5.3 ± 3.1), 90° = (3.8 ± 2.0; 7.4 ± 5.5, and 4.1 ± 1.9), and 120° = (5.3 ± 2.9, 7.7 ± 5.3, and 4.2 ± 1.9)Internal rotation: 15° = (4.3 ± 3.1, 6.2 ± 4.4, and 2.8 ± 1.2), 30° = (3.2 ± 1.9, 4.5 ± 2.3, and 3.3 ± 1.4), and 45° = (3.5 ± 2.0, 4.1 ± 1.8, and 2.8 ± 1.0)External rotation: 15° = (3.0 ± 1.7, 4.2 ± 2.2, and 3.6 ± 1.4) and 30° = (3.1 ± 1.5, 3.8 ± 2.6, and 3.4 ± 1.6)The results showed significantly better JPS (lower EPRJP) in shoulders following rTSA and normal control shoulders comparing with the patient's contralateral shoulder. The explanation can be that rTSA improves joint kinematics and stability, which allows better muscular performance and proprioception feedback. CONCLUSION: Shoulders following rTSA show JPS superior to non-operated contralateral shoulders and comparable with healthy population shoulders. It seems that rTSA restores shoulder proprioception.","Walecka, Joanna; Lubiatowski, Przemyslaw; Consigliere, Paolo; Atoun, Ehud; Levy, Ofer",Int. orthop,,242

Its risk factors with death were still not known. White blood cells (WBC) count as a reflection of inflammation has played a vital role in COVID-19, however its level with death is not yet investigated. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-center study, all confirmed patients with COVID-19 at West Branch of Union Hospital from Jan 29 to Feb 28, 2020 were collected and analyzed. Demographic and clinical data including laboratory examinations were analyzed and compared between recovery and death patients. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients including 33 death cases were included in this study. Significant association was found between WBC count and death (HR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.09-1.20, p < 0.001). The regression analysis results showed there was a significant association between WBC count and death (HR = 5.72, 95%CI: 2.21-14.82, p < 0.001) when use the second quartile as a cutoff value (> 6.16 × 10^9/L). The difference was still exist after adjusting for confounding factors (HR = 6.26, 95%CI: 1.72-22.77, p = 0.005). In addition, Kaplan-meier survival analysis showed that there was a significant decline of the cumulative survival rate (p < 0.001) in those with WBC count &#8805;6.16 × 10^9/L. CONCLUSION: WBC count at admission is significantly corelated with death in COVID-19 patients. Higher level of WBC count should be given more attention in the treatment of COVID-19.","Zhu, Bin; Feng, Xiaokai; Jiang, Chunguo; Mi, Song; Yang, Liya; Zhao, Zhigang; Zhang, Yong; Zhang, Liming",BMC Infect Dis,,242
287880,Clinical course and management of 73 hospitalized moderate patients with COVID-19 outside Wuhan,2021,"Importance: COVID-19 has decreased colorectal cancer screenings. Objective: To estimate the degree to which expanding fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A previously developed simulation model was adopted to estimate how much COVID-19 may have contributed to colorectal cancer outcomes. The model included the US population estimated to have completed colorectal cancer screening pre-COVID-19 according the American Cancer Society. The model was designed to estimate colorectal cancer outcomes between 2020 and 2023. This analysis was completed between July and December 2020. Exposures: Adults screened for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer cases detected by stage. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimates of colorectal cancer outcomes across 4 scenarios: (1) 9 months of 50% colorectal cancer screenings followed by 21 months of 75% colorectal cancer screenings; (2) 18 months of 50% screening followed by 12 months of 75% screening; (3) scenario 1 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests; and (4) scenario 2 with increased use of fecal immunochemical tests. Results: In our simulation model, COVID-19-related reductions in care utilization resulted in an estimated 1â¯176â¯942 to 2â¯014â¯164 fewer colorectal cancer screenings, 8346 to 12â¯894 fewer colorectal cancer diagnoses, and 6113 to 9301 fewer early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses between 2020 and 2023. With an abbreviated period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 588â¯844 colorectal cancer screenings and 2836 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1953 (68.9%) were early stage. In the event of a prolonged period of reduced colorectal cancer screenings, increasing fecal immunochemical test use was associated with an estimated additional 655â¯825 colorectal cancer screenings and 2715 colorectal cancer diagnoses, of which 1944 (71.6%) were early stage. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that the increased use of fecal immunochemical tests during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased colorectal cancer screening participation and more colorectal cancer diagnoses at earlier stages. If our estimates are borne out in real-world clinical practice, increasing fecal immunochemical test-based colorectal cancer screening participation during the COVID-19 pandemic could mitigate the consequences of reduced screening rates during the pandemic for colorectal cancer outcomes.","Issaka, Rachel B; Taylor, Preston; Baxi, Anand; Inadomi, John M; Ramsey, Scott D; Roth, Joshua",JAMA Netw Open,,242

288178,Postoperative In-Hospital Morbidity and Mortality of Patients With COVID-19 Infection Compared With Patients Without COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Most patients with COVID-19 lack antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in the first 10 days of illness while the virus drives disease pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 antibody deficiency in the setting of a tissue viral burden suggests that using an antibody as a therapeutic agent would augment the antiviral immune response. In this issue of the JCI, Wang and collaborators describe the kinetics of viral load and the antibody responses of 23 individuals with COVID-19 experiencing mild and severe disease. The researchers found that (a) individuals with mild and severe disease produced neutralizing IgG to SARS-CoV-2 10 days after disease onset, (b) SARS-CoV-2 persisted longer in those with severe disease, and (c) there was cross-reactivity between antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, but only antibodies from patients with COVID-19 neutralized SARS-CoV-2. These observations provide important information on the serological response to SARS-CoV-2 of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 that can inform the use of convalescent plasma therapy.","Casadevall, Arturo; Joyner, Michael J; Pirofski, Liise-Anne",J Clin Invest,,242
288295,Cardiac injury in severe COVID-19 is similar to pneumonias of other origin in a multicenter study,2020,"CONTEXTO: El paciente con diagnóstico de COVID19 puede desarrollar dentro de sus complicaciones, compromiso pulmonar y neumonía, esto se traduce en síntomas como dificultad para respirar (distress respiratorio);de confirmarse el diagnóstico se debe realizar el manejo del cuadro causado por el virus SARS-CoV-2 En ese contexto se aplican medicamentos como los broncodilatadores Gracias a su acción beta-2- agonista, llegan por vía inhalada a los pulmones y al músculo liso bronquial donde incrementa el diámetro del bronquio, lo que mejora la ventilación pulmonar La vía de administración del medicamento puede realizarse mediante: (a) nebulización, utilizando una mascarilla que cubra la región de nariz y boca conectada a una solución que contenga el broncodilatador, donde la solución se convierte en aerosol lo que es impulsado hacia los pulmones con ayuda de un pequeño motor eléctrico o a baterías;(b) aerocámara, es un dispositivo que por un extremo cubre la región de nariz y boca, que tiene en el otro extremo una desembocadura que encaja en la boquilla de un inhalador (producto que contiene el medicamento precargado y dosificado en puffs) Ante el escenario de administrar un broncodilatador por vía inhalada mediante nebulización versus aerocámara en pacientes con COVID19, es que nos planteamos los siguientes escenarios: (a) determinar si existen diferencias en la eficacia de la administración de medicamento (como el broncodilatador) mediante nebulización versus aerocámara, en pacientes con diagnostico de COVID19 que se encuentren estables y (b) determinar si la nebulización del paciente con diagnóstico de COVID19 con medicamentos tipo broncodilatadores, incrementan el riesgo de contagio al personal de salud EFICACIA DE LA ADMINISTRACIÓN DE MEDICAMENTO (COMO EL BRONCODILATADOR) MEDIANTE NEBULIZACIÓN VERSUS AEROCÁMARA, EN PACIENTES CON DIAGNÓSTICO DE COVID19 QUE SE ENCUENTREN ESTABLES: Encontramos que a la fecha (21 marzo 2020), no existen estudios comparativos que evalúen la eficacia de la administración de medicamento (como el broncodilatador) mediante nebulización versus aerocámara, en pacientes con diagnóstico de COVID19 que se encuentren estables Sin embargo, como antecedente tomamos información de una revisión sistemática (RS) donde se hace la misma comparación en pacientes con diagnóstico de asma (Cates, Welsh, and Rowe 2013) En dicha RS, se tuvo como objetivo evaluar la efectividad comparada de las aerocámaras vs nebulizadores para administración de broncodilatadores (beta-2-agonistas) en pacientes con asma aguda No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre la cantidad de hospitalizaciones en los pacientes atendidos con broncodilatador mediante aerocámara comparada con nebulización en niños (RR=0 71 IC95% 0 47 a 1 08) ni en adultos (RR=0 94 IC95% 0 61 a 1 43) con asma (que no llegaba a comprometer la vida del paciente) En el grupo de pacientes pediátricos, los que recibieron broncodilatador mediante aerocámara permanecieron en la emergencia durante menos tiempo (media tiempo de permanencia=33 minutos), comparado con los niños que recibieron el broncodilatador mediante nebulizador (media de tiempo= 103 minutos), (IC95% -43 a -24 minutos) Por ello, los autores concluyeron de manera indirecta, que la recuperación de la crisis asmática en el paciente pediátrico con el uso de aerocámara fue más rápida que cuando se utilizó el nebulizador LA NEBULIZACIÓN DEL PACIENTE CON

recomendaciones sobre el manejo de aerosoles por parte del personal de salud y del uso de equipo de protección personal (EPP) La guía recomienda el uso de equipo de protección personal (EPP) contra infecciones trasmitidas por aerosoles como precaución en la atención de pacientes hospitalizados en la UCI, con diagnóstico de COVID19 Recomienda aplicar la mínima cantidad de procedimien os que generen aerosoles en el paciente con COVID19 en la UCI, como la intubación, extubación, broncoscopía, uso de oxígeno de alto flujo, ventilación no invasiva (con pobre sello hermético), realizar procedimientos en niños en llanto, traqueostomía, resucitación cardiopulmonar antes de la intubación;en habitaciones a presión negativa (de preferencia) o en habitaciones con aire ambiental Manifiestan una recomendación en contra de la nebulización de medicamentos como broncodilatadores o solución salina Además, se manifiestan en contra de utilizar el EPP que no cumpla con las recomendaciones señaladas REPORTE DE CASO: Este es el reporte de un paciente en China que ejemplifica que, si se utiliza adecuadamente la EPP, los contagios a personal de salud se pueden minimizar En este reporte se presenta un paciente con neumonía severa inicialmente con sospecha de COVID19, en quien se realizó los siguientes procedimientos: administración de oxígeno por presentar dificultad respiratoria, intubación endotraqueal, laringoscopía y ventilación mecánica (VM) en la UCI El paciente mejoró y a los 3 días salió de VM La confirmación de que el paciente tenía COVID19 se obtuvo cuando se extubó al paciente El punto de interés es que 41 profesionales de la salud estuvieron en contacto con el paciente durante procedimientos que generaron aerosoles, por lo menos durante 10 minutos y a una distancia de menos de 2 metros del paciente Todos los trabajadores fueron aislados por dos semanas, tuvieron monitorización cercana de los síntomas, con realización de PCR para determinar infección Sin embargo, ninguno de los 41 trabajadores de salud desarrolló síntomas y todos los PCR fueron negativos Este reporte no pretende determinar que no existen contagios de pacientes con COVID19 a profesionales de la salud, sino ser un ejemplo, de que cuando se tienen las medidas de protección adecuada (EPP), el riesgo de contagio puede llegar a ser muy bajo CONCLUSIONES: No se han encontrado estudios que evalúen si hay diferencias respecto a usar nebulizadores o aerocámaras en aliviar la dificultad respiratoria en pacientes con COVID-19 No obstante, se tiene evidencia científica proveniente de estudios en asma que muestra que, para el desenlace clínico de cantidad de hospitalizaciones en el contexto de pacientes con asma aguda, no existen diferencias entre usar nebulizadores o aerocámaras Lo que sugiere que, desde la perspectiva del paciente, podría ser igual de beneficioso usar uno u otro método para mejorar los síntomas de dificultad respiratoria Sin embargo, al ser el SARS-CoV-2 un agente infeccioso con alto índice de transmisión existiría un riesgo de infección para los trabajadores de salud si se nebuliza a estos pacientes debido a la alta dispersión de aerosol exhalado, por lo que sería recomendable preferir administrar el broncodilatador por aerocámara","Peru.

288406,Clinical characteristics and disease progression in early-stage covid-19 patients in south korea,2020,"Using Galileo theory and method of multidimensional scaling (MDS), we compared the psychological distances between concepts related to two pandemic viruses, Zika and COVID-19. Surveys (Zika, N = 410; COVID-19, N = 291) were used to investigate the role of media use and interpersonal communication on the relationship between 10 concepts in multidimensional spaces. We asked these four research questions: Do the two spaces represent the two pandemics similarly? What is the relationship of me and of people to each pandemic? What is the effect of virus-related media use and interpersonal talk on the pandemic space? What are optimal messages for moving me closer to Zika and to COVID-19? Media use influenced the distances for both pandemics: With greater media use, the concepts were closer in the Zika space and further apart in the COVID-19 space. Interpersonal communication was associated with few differences in the spaces. Based on the psychological distances between concepts, optimal messages were identified: For Zika, a message with two concepts, people and women, is predicted to be most effective to move Zika to the concept me, whereas for COVID-19, a message with people is predicted to be most effective to move COVID-19 to me.","Fink, Edward L; Smith, Rachel A; Cai, Deborah A; Jung, Heeyoung Jenni; Woelfel, Joseph",Health Commun,,242

288582,Impact of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors in hospitalised COVID-19 patients,2021,"We here investigate the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition by one of the most promising families of inhibitors, those containing an aldehyde group as a warhead. These compounds are covalent inhibitors that inactivate the protease, forming a stable hemithioacetal complex. Inhibitor 11a is a potent inhibitor that has been already tested in vitro and in animals. Using a combination of classical and QM/MM simulations, we determined the binding mode of the inhibitor into the active site and the preferred rotameric state of the catalytic histidine. In the noncovalent complex, the aldehyde group is accommodated into the oxyanion hole formed by the NH main-chain groups of residues 143 to 145. In this pose, P1-P3 groups of the inhibitor mimic the interactions established by the natural peptide substrate. The reaction is initiated with the formation of the catalytic dyad ion pair after a proton transfer from Cys145 to His41. From this activated state, covalent inhibition proceeds with the nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated S. atom of Cys145 to the aldehyde carbon atom and a water-mediated proton transfer from the Ne atom of His41 to the aldehyde oxygen atom. Our proposed reaction transition-state structure is validated by comparison with X-ray data of recently reported inhibitors, while the activation free energy obtained from our simulations agrees with the experimentally derived value, supporting the validity of our findings. Our study stresses the interplay between the conformational dynamics of the inhibitor and the protein with the inhibition mechanism and the importance of including conformational diversity for accurate predictions about the inhibition of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The conclusions derived from our work can also be used to rationalize the behavior of other recently proposed inhibitor compounds, including aldehydes and ketones with high inhibitory potency.","Ramos-Guzman, C.

288823,Imaging of COVID-19 simulators,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is higher among people with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are used in the majority of people with DM and CVD. This mini-review discusses the current understanding of benefit-risk ratio of use of statins in COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using specific keywords related to our aims till June 12, 2020. Full text of relevant articles published in English language were retrieved and reviewed. RESULTS: Statins, with their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and anti-oxidant properties, have the potential to reduce severity of lung injury in, and mortality from, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infections. Statin-induced upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has the potential to reduce lung injury from excess angiotensin II. By disrupting lipid rafts, statins have the potential to reduce viral entry into cells. However, benefit-risk ratio of its complex interaction with MYD88 gene expression on outcomes in COVID-19, and the putative role of low serum LDL cholesterol in increasing severity of SARS-CoV2 infection need further clarification. CONCLUSIONS: People with COVID-19, who are already on statins for an underlying co-morbid condition, should continue on it unless there are specific contraindications. De-novo use of statins in people with COVID-19 with no underlying co-morbidity might be beneficial but awaits substantiation in clinical trials; till that time, de novo use of statins in COVID 19 should be limited to a clinical trial setting.","Subir, Ray; Jagat J, Mukherjee; Kalyan K, Gangopadhyay",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,242

288965,Low Sensitivity of Admission Lung US Compared to Chest CT for Diagnosis of Lung Involvement in a Cohort of 82 Patients with COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021,"In multi-agent environments in which coordination is desirable, the history of play often causes lock-in at sub-optimal outcomes. Notoriously, technologies with a significant environmental footprint or high social cost persist despite the successful development of more environmentally friendly and/or socially efficient alternatives. The displacement of the status quo is hindered by entrenched economic interests and network effects. To exacerbate matters, the standard mechanism design approaches based on centralized authorities with the capacity to use preferential subsidies to effectively dictate system outcomes are not always applicable to modern decentralized economies. What other types of mechanisms are feasible? In this paper, we develop and analyze a mechanism that induces transitions from inefficient lock-ins to superior alternatives. This mechanism does not exogenously favor one option over another -- instead, the phase transition emerges endogenously via a standard evolutionary learning model, Q-learning, where agents trade-off exploration and exploitation. Exerting the same transient influence to both the efficient and inefficient technologies encourages exploration and results in irreversible phase transitions and permanent stabilization of the efficient one. On a technical level, our work is based on bifurcation and catastrophe theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with changes in the number and stability properties of equilibria. Critically, our analysis is shown to be structurally robust to significant and even adversarially chosen perturbations to the parameters of both our game and our behavioral model.","Leonardos, Stefanos; Sakos, Iosif; Courcoubetis, Costas; Piliouras, Georgios",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12877v1.pdf,242

289340,"Clinical characteristics of 134 convalescent patients with COVID-19 in Guizhou, China",2020,"The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is associated with elevated rates of anxiety and relatively lower compliance with public health guidelines in younger adults. To develop strategies for reducing anxiety and increasing adherence with health guidelines, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to anxiety and health compliance in the context of COVID-19. Earlier research has shown that greater perceived risk of negative events and their costs are associated with increased anxiety and compliance with health behaviors, but it is unclear what role they play in a novel pandemic surrounded by uncertainty. In the present study we measured (1) perceived risk as the self-reported probability of being infected and experiencing serious symptoms due to COVID-19 and (2) perceived cost as financial, real-world, physical, social, and emotional consequences of being infected with COVID-19. Worry was assessed using the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PWSQ) and health compliance was measured as endorsement of the World Health Organization (WHO) health directives for COVID-19. Our results showed that greater perceived risk and costs of contracting the COVID-19 virus were associated with greater worry and while only costs were associated with greater compliance with health behaviors. Neither self-reported worry nor its interaction with cost estimates was associated with increased engagement in health behaviors. Our results provide important insight into decision making mechanisms involved in both increased anxiety and health compliance in COVID-19 and have implications for developing psychoeducational and psychotherapeutic strategies to target both domains.","Imbriano, Gabriella; Larsen, Emmett M; Mackin, Daniel M; An, Akaisha Kaixuan; Luhmann, Christian C; Mohanty, Aprajita; Jin, Jingwen",Front Public Health,,242

Our objective is to determine seroprevalence of COVID-19 among workers in a monographic pediatric hospital. METHODS: Between April13th and 30th, 1.523 health workers were recruited to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology screening (All Test®) and they answered a questionnaire with demographic, epidemiological and clinical information and previous exposure to COVID-19. FINDINGS: One thousand two hundred ninety two (84.8%) were tested. Positive serology (IgM and/or IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 was found in 17.2% (222/1.292), in 15.5% (201/1.292) if only IgG was considered. Median age was 44±13 years, 73% were female. The 33.8% (75/222) were asymptomatic. Eighty one had a previous positive rRT-PCR. The 14% (32/222) referred a family contact. CONCLUSION: Serology prevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in workers of a pediatric hospital was higher than in general population. Many of them had an unnoticed infection.","Escribano Ceruelo, Eva; Espinel Ruíz, Marco Antonio; Ortega López-Peláez, Marta; Fernández Garoz, Bárbara; Asensio Antón, Julia; Jiménez García, Raquel",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

289999,A Risk Prediction Model for Evaluating the Disease Progression of COVID-19 Pneumonia Based on Meta-Analysis and 214 Clinical Cases,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a public health emergency of major international concern. Real-time RT-PCR assays are recommended for diagnosis of COVID-19. Here we report a rare case of COVID-19 with multiple negative results for PCR assays outside Wuhan, China. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year old male was admitted to our hospital because of 6 days of unexplained fever on January 29, 2020. He had come from Wuhan city 10 days before admission. Five days before admission, no abnormality was noted in laboratory test, chest radiography, and nasopharyngeal swab test for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. The patient was treated with ibuprofen for alleviating fever. On admission, chest computed tomography showed multiple ground-glass opacities in right lower lung field. COVID-19 was suspected. Three times of nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected after admission. However, none of the specimens were positive. The patient was confirmed with COVID-19 after fifth SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. He was treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant human interferon alfa-2b inhalation, methylprednisolone. After 18 days of treatment, he was discharged with improved symptoms, lung lesions and negative results of nasopharyngeal swab. CONCLUSION: This case reminds clinician that a patient with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but multiple negative RT-PCR result should not be taken out of isolation. A combination of patient's exposure history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and typical imaging findings plays a vital role in making preliminary diagnosis and guide early isolation and treatment. Repeat swab tests are helpful in diagnosis for this kind of patients.","Chen, Li-Da; Li, Hao; Ye, Yu-Ming; Wu, Zhi; Huang, Ya-Ping; Zhang, Wei-Liang; Lin, Li",BMC Infect Dis,,242

295942,Collicular Hyperactivation in Patients with COVID-19: A New Finding on Brain MRI and PET/CT,2021,"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being regarded as regulators of glioma development. Notably, some studies report that GNG12-AS1 plays important functions and molecular mechanism in breast cancer, but there are no existing studies in glioma. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the biological functions and potential mechanisms of GNG12-AS1 in glioma. METHODS: We detected the expression of GNG12-AS1 in glioma tissues through analyzing TCGA data as well as our clinical samples. We then evaluated cell proliferation through MTT assay and colony formation and cell migration by transwell assay, wound healing assay and single cell tracking assay. After, we analyzed the effects of the AKT/GSK-3ß/ß-catenin through western blotting and utilized the ß-catenin agonist SKL2001 for the rescue experiment. RESULTS: GNG12-AS1 was highly expressed in glioma tissues. The silence of GNG12-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of glioma cells, and reduced the activity of the AKT/GSK-3ß/ß-catenin pathway. Notably, SKL2001 could reverse cell migration as well as ß-catenin expression in glioma cells with lower GNG12-AS1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: GNG12-AS1 regulates proliferation and migration of glioma cells through the AKT/GSK-3ß/ß-catenin signaling and can perhaps be a new target for the treatment of glioma.","Xiang, Zijin; Lv, Qiaoli; Chen, Xueru; Zhu, Xiuting; Liu, Shikun; Li, Dangchi; Peng, Xiangdong",Biosci. rep,,242

296607,The serum metabolome of COVID-19 patients is distinctive and predictive,2021,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread across the world. As of April 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 140,000,000 and caused more than 3,000,000 deaths globally. In November 2020, the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab was approved by the FDA for non-hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) who possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19. This provided a treatment option that may help prevent hospitalization. METHODS: Patients who regularly received ambulatory care at a military treatment facility and who were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and possessed risk factors for progression to severe COVID-19 were treated with a single, intravenous infusion (700 mg) of the virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab. The primary outcome was improvement of self-reported symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of receiving the infusion. The secondary outcome was prevention of disease progression requiring emergency department (ED) utilization or hospitalization related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion. Bamlanivimab was administered in accordance with the FDA's approval and Defense Health Agency's guidance, including follow-up within 72 hours of administration. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was obtained. RESULTS: Of the COVID-19 patients who were given the option of a bamlanivimab infusion, 40 accepted and 6 did not (40/46, 86.9%). Thirty-six of 40 patients in the treatment group were contacted within 72 hours. ED/hospitalization information was available for all 46 patients. In the treatment group, 94.4% (34/36) reported global improvement. Three of 40 (7.5%) patients in the treatment group required inpatient admission, and 2 of 40 patients (5%) required ED evaluation within 30 days of infusion. Therefore, 5 of 40 (12.5%) patients required evaluation shortly after infusion, while 2 of 6 (33.3%) patients who declined treatment required hospital evaluation or admission related to COVID-19 within 30 days of infusion (P = .15). CONCLUSIONS: Global improvement of symptoms within 24 to 72 hours of infusion was reported by 94.4% of patients receiving bamlanivimab; however, statistical significance could not be determined due to the small sample size and lack of placebo group due to study design. Furthermore, ED visits and hospital admissions were analyzed, but with only six patients in the comparison group, the relative risk was not statistically significant and could not be precisely estimated. In the future, this study can be replicated with both larger control/treatment arms to validate the initial results of this small, retrospective, cohort study.","Karr, Eric; Chung, Theodore; Burtson, Kathryn; Markert, Ronald; Kelly, Devin",Mil. med,,242

We investigated pain, catastrophizing, and psychological status in UCPP patients during SARS-CoV-2 by means of Skype telephone calls. METHODS: A total of 28 UCPP patients underwent Skype video consultations. Pain intensity was assessed with Pain Numerical Rating Scale (PNRS). Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) were used to assess catastrophizing and psychological status. RESULTS: During SARS-CoV-2, UCPP patients showed higher intensity of pain than before (mean ± SD PNRS score: 7.25 ± 0.9 vs. 5.4 ± 0.7; p < .0001), with pain exacerbation in 75%; they showed higher PCS and DASS-21 scores as compared to before the pandemic (mean ± SD PCS total score: 32.4 ± 1.2 vs. 23.7 ± 3.5; mean ± SD DASS-21 total score: 42.03 ± 4.5 vs. 34.4 ± 2.2; p < .001 and p < .001, respectively). CONCLUSION: During SARS-CoV-2 pandemic UCPP patients presented with high intensity of pain, marked catastrophizing thoughts and severe alteration of the psychological status. These observations impose the need not to postpone assessment and treatment of these patients during the pandemic. Remote visits with video telephone calls are a simple way of continuing care in UCPP patients.","Giannantoni, Antonella; Rubilotta, Emanuele; Balzarro, Matteo; Gubbiotti, Marilena",Neurourol. urodyn,,242

Scientifically evaluating the community's work is necessary for prevention in the normal period of the epidemic and can provide a reference for the management of different countries. Methods-Based on data envelopment analysis (DEA), this article used community worker data to evaluate the matching of service supply and demand during the epidemic period and used co-word analysis to analyze the content and the residents' demands for community service from the threshold period to the normal period of the epidemic. Results-According to the results of the DEA model, early in the epidemic, 13 of the 15 districts' DEA values were invalid, indicating that there was a shortage in community workers in Wuhan. The results of public opinion analysis showed that from the threshold to the normal period of the epidemic, the emphasis on community service gradually transformed from epidemic prevention to an integrated service, which effectively met the composite service needs of community residents for both prevention and life. Conclusions-In the face of public health emergencies, the government should ensure an adequate number of service personnel, mobilize the service resources, refine the service content, and adjust the incentive policy, which can help to improve the quality of residents' lives and the coordination degree of the prevention and control as part of the epidemic control in the emergency period and the social and economic recovery after the epidemic.","Zhang, Yuxiao; Cao, Peiyu; Meng, Jiejie; Qiu, Jiuyun; Hu, Qiwen; Cheng, Lei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

The objective is to evaluate vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in COVID-19 patients, and compare the findings with healthy controls. The secondary objective is to evaluate if there are differences in OCTA parameters between COVID-19 patients with and without associated TE. METHODS: Cross-sectional case-control study that included patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 with and without TE related to the infection and age-matched healthy controls. Ophthalmological examination and OCTA were performed 12 weeks after diagnosis. Demographic data and medical history were collected. Macular OCTA parameters in the superficial retinal plexus were analyzed according to ETDRS sectors. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included, 19 (20%) COVID-19 patients with associated TE, 47 (49.5%) COVID-19 patients without TE, and 29 (30.5%) healthy controls. Fifty-three (55.7%) were male, mean age 54.4 (SD 10.2) years. COVID-19 patients presented significantly lower VD than healthy controls: central (p = 0.003), inner ring (p = 0.026), outer ring (p = 0.001). PD was also significantly decreased: outer ring (p = 0.003), full area (p = 0.001). No differences in OCTA parameters were found between COVID-19 patients with and without TE. CONCLUSIONS: OCTA represents a promising tool for the in vivo assessment of microvascular changes in COVID-19. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection show lower VD and PD compared to healthy controls. However, no differences were found between COVID-19 when considering TE. Prospective studies are required to further evaluate the retinal microvascular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the vasculature of other organs.","Guemes-Villahoz, Noemi; Burgos-Blasco, Barbara; Vidal-Villegas, Beatriz; Donate-López, Juan; de la Muela, María Herrera; López-Guajardo, Lorenzo; Martín-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; García-Feijoó, Julián",Graefes arch. clin. exp. ophthalmol,,242

The illness can have long-term consequences for patients, affecting their functional capacity and, consequently, their occupational performance. This study analyzed the effects of COVID-19 on occupational health, with a focus on the importance of physical therapy in rehabilitation. An integrative literature review was conducted based on articles retrieved from the PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS databases using the following keywords: COVID-19, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and occupational health. The search retrieved 1,308 studies, 15 of which met inclusion criteria for the review. A thorough assessment of the articles revealed four topics that corresponded to the results of this study: 1) effects of COVID-19 on occupational health;2) physical therapy in mild and moderate cases without hospitalization;3) physical therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19;4) physical therapy in post-intensive care unit (ICU) recovery and after hospital discharge. The findings showed that COVID-19 can affect several physiological systems and have both short- and long-term effects on patients, including physical and psychological impairments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who had an isolated lesion on the first positive CT were enrolled in this study. The following parameters were recorded for each lesion: sites, sizes, location (peripheral or central), attenuation (ground-glass opacity or consolidation), and other abnormalities (supply pulmonary artery dilation, air bronchogram, interstitial thickening, etc.). The follow-up CT images were compared with the previous CT scans, and the development of the lesions was evaluated. RESULTS: The lesions tended to be peripheral and subpleural. All the lesions exhibited ground-glass opacity with or without consolidation. A higher proportion of supply pulmonary artery dilation (89.13 % [41/46]) and air bronchogram (69.57 % [32/46]) were found. Other ï¬ndings included thickening of the intralobular interstitium and a halo sign of ground glass around a solid nodule. Cavitation, calciï¬cation or lymphadelopathy were not observed. The reticular patterns were noted from the 14 days after symptoms onset in 7 of 20 patients (45 %). At 22-31 days, the lesions were completely absorbed only in 2 of 7 patients (28.57 %). CONCLUSION: The typical early CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are ground-glass opacity, and located peripheral or subpleural location, and with supply pulmonary artery dilation. Reticulation was evident after the 2nd week and persisted in half of patients evaluated in 4 weeks after the onset. Long-term follow-up is required to determine whether the reticulation represents irreversible ï¬brosis.","Hu, Qiongjie; Guan, Hanxiong; Sun, Ziyan; Huang, Lu; Chen, Chong; Ai, Tao; Pan, Yueying; Xia, Liming",Eur J Radiol,,242

305635,COVID-19 and Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Report of Eight Cases,2021,"Introduction As researchers and academics around the world scramble ahead to dissect and analyse every aspect of the SARS-CoV2 virus, one such study explored the various underlying electrolyte abnormalities that were precipitated in patients suffering from a confirmed COVID-19 infection A significant proportion of such patients were noted to be hypokalemic Hypokalemia can be life threatening as it is known to cause cardiac arrhythmia Case presentation Our encounter with said presentation was incidental The on-call medical team was involved in a cardiac arrest call for a 74-year -old gentleman who developed torsades de pointes, Retrospective analysis of the clinical picture pointed out the fact that he was found to be persistently hypokalemic and bradycardic solely triggered as a result of COVID-19 Conclusion Although initially thought to be a pulmonary disease but along with time extra-pulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 has demonstrated significant consequences Electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction are examples of such extra-pulmonary pathologies Therefore, it is important to keep close monitoring for such abnormalities otherwise could lead into life threatening arrythmias","Navid Siddiqui, Saquib Memon Muhammad Tshering Sonam Hasan Tanveer Jawed Asheer Kumar Jha Pranav Jayasekhar Roland",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,,242
305735,Facial nerve palsy: an atypical clinical manifestation of COVID-19 infection in a family cluster,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to externally validate the predictive performance of two recently developed COVID-19-specific prognostic tools, the COVID-GRAM and CALL scores, and prior prognostic scores for community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65), viral pneumonia (MuBLSTA) and H1N1 influenza pneumonia (Influenza risk score) in a contemporary US cohort. METHODS: We included 257 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia from three teaching hospitals in Rhode Island. We extracted data from within the first 24 hours of admission. Variables were excluded if values were missing in >20% of cases, otherwise missing values were imputed. 115 patients with complete data after imputation were used for primary analysis. Sensitivity analysis was done after exclusion of one variable (LDH) in the complete dataset (n=257). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and critical illness (mechanical ventilation or death), respectively. RESULTS: Only the areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (RO-AUC) of COVID-GRAM (0.775, 95%CI 0.525-0.915) for in-hospital death, and CURB65 for in-hospital death (RO-AUC 0.842, 95%CI 0.674-0.932) or critical illness (RO-AUC=0.766, 95%CI 0.584-0.884) were significantly better than random. Sensitivity analysis yielded similar trends. Calibration plots showed better agreement between estimated and observed probability of in-hospital death for CURB65, compared to COVID-GRAM. The negative predictive value (NPV) of CURB65&#8805;2 was 97.2% for in-hospital death and 88.1% for critical illness. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-GRAM score demonstrated acceptable predictive performance for in-hospital death. The CURB65 score had better prognostic utility for in-hospital death and critical illness. The high NPV of CURB65 values &#8805;2, may be useful in triaging and allocation of resources.","Shi, Yiyun; Pandita, Aakriti; Hardesty, Anna; McCarthy, Meghan; Aridi, Jad; Weiss, Zoe F; Beckwith, Curt G; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios",Int J Clin Pract,,242
306001,Fear of Сoronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Basic Personality Beliefs,2020,"The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has brought tremendous crisis on global health care systems and industrial operations that dramatically affect the economic and social life of numerous individuals worldwide. Understanding anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune responses in population with different genetic backgrounds and tracking the viral evolution are crucial for successful vaccine design. In this study, we reported the generation of CD8 T cell epitopes by a total of 80 alleles of three major class I HLAs using NetMHC 4.0 algorithm for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which can be targeted by both B cells and T cells. We found diverse capacities of S protein specific epitope presentation by different HLA alleles with very limited number of predicted epitopes for HLA-B*2705, HLA-B*4402 and HLA-B*4403 and as high as 132 epitopes for HLA-A*6601. Our analysis of 1000 S protein sequences from field isolates collected globally over the past few months identified three recurrent point mutations including L5F, D614G and G1124V. Differential effects of these mutations on CD8 T cell epitope generation by corresponding HLA alleles were observed. Finally, our multiple alignment analysis indicated the absence of seasonal CoV induced cross-reactive CD8 T cells to drive these mutations. Our findings suggested that individuals with certain HLA alleles, such as B*44 are more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studying anti-S protein specific CD8 T cell immunity in diverse genetic background is critical for better control and prevention of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Guo, Elisa; Guo, Hailong",PLoS One,,242

306227,Clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing decompensated cirrhosis: initial report from China,2020,"Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging and rapidly evolving disease, with no recommended effective anti-coronavirus drug treatment. Traditional Chinese Patent Medicines (CPMs) have, however, been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China, and a number of clinical practice results have shown them to have a significant role in its treatment. Consequently, numerous guidelines and expert consensus have recommended the use of CPMs to treat COVID-19. Aim of the Study: The objectives of this review are to provide up-to-date information on the pharmacology and clinical research on CPMs in the treatment of COVID-19, discuss the research findings, and to better guide clinical application and scientific research on CPMs in the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: The frequencies of CPM recommendations by guidelines and expert consensus for treatment of COVID-19 in China were ranked. This report identifies the top 10 CPMs, which include Huoxiang Zhengqi capsule (HXZQC), Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LHQWC), Jinhua Qinggan granule (JHQGG), Shufeng Jiedu capsule (SFJDC), Tanreqing injection (TRQI), Xiyanping injection (XYPI), Xuebijing injection (XBJI), Shenfu injection (SFI), Shengmai injection (SMI), and Angong Niuhuang pill (AGNHP). Relevant studies from 2000 to 2020 on these top 10 CPMs, covering usage, dosage, mechanism, curative effect, and precautions, were collected from pharmacopoeia, reports, and theses via library and digital databases (including PubMed, CNKI, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Elsevier). Results: The properties of the top 10 CPMs included antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic, anti-acute lung injury, anti-shock, immune regulation, and enhancement of pulmonary function. In addition, clinical research results and Chinese treatment data showed that the CPMs had good therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19, and adverse reactions were minimal. Conclusions: Knowledge of the characteristics of the top 10 CPMs and precautions that should be taken may help clinicians to rationally improve therapeutic efficacy, and promote the role of Chinese Medicine in the control of the COVID-19 global epidemic.","Zhuang, Wei; Fan, Zheng; Chu, Yanqi; Wang, Haizheng; Yang, Ying; Wu, Li; Sun, Nan; Sun, Ge; Shen, Yuqiao; Lin, Xiaolan; Guo, Guiming; Xi, Shengyan",Front.

306899,"Spectrum of CT appearance and CT severity index of COVID-19 pulmonary infection in correlation with age, sex, and PCR test: an Iraqi experience",2021,"Vagal afferents form the primary gut-to-brain neural axis, communicating signals that regulate gastrointestinal (GI) function and promote satiation, appetition and reward. Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) is essential for the survival of vagal smooth muscle afferents of the small intestine, but not the stomach. Here we took advantage of near-complete labeling of GI vagal mucosal afferents in Nav1.8cre-Rosa26tdTomato transgenic mice to determine whether these afferents depend on NT-4 for survival. We quantified the density and distribution of vagal afferent terminals in the stomach and small intestine mucosa and their central terminals in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) and area postrema in NT-4 knockout (KO) and control mice. NT-4KO mice exhibited a 75% reduction in vagal afferent terminals in proximal duodenal villi and a 55% decrease in the distal ileum, whereas, those in the stomach glands remained intact. Vagal crypt afferents were also reduced in some regions of the small intestine, but to a lesser degree. Surprisingly, NT-4KO mice exhibited an increase in labeled terminals in the medial NTS. These findings, combined with previous results, suggest NT-4 is essential for survival of a large proportion of all classes of vagal afferents that innervate the small intestine, but not those that supply the stomach. Thus, NT-4KO mice could be valuable for distinguishing gastric and intestinal vagal afferent regulation of GI function and feeding. The apparent plasticity of central vagal afferent terminals - an increase in their density - could have compensated for loss of peripheral terminals by maintaining near-normal levels of satiety signaling.","Serlin, Hannah K; Fox, Edward A",Auton Neurosci,,242
307963,Mast Cells in Alveolar Septa of COVID-19 Patients: A Pathogenic Pathway That May Link Interstitial Edema to Immunothrombosis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The clinical course of COVID-19 may vary significantly. The presence of comorbidities prolongs the recovery time. The recovery in patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms might take 10 days, while in those with a critical illness or immunocompromised status could take 15 days. Considering the lack of data about predictors that could affect the recovery time, we conducted this study to identify them. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was implemented in the COVID-19 clinic of a teaching and referral university hospital in Tehran. Patients with the highly suggestive symptoms who had computed tomography (CT) imaging results with typical findings of COVID-19 or positive results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were enrolled in the study. Inpatient and outpatient COVID-19 participants were followed up by regular visits or phone calls, and the recovery period was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 478 patients were enrolled. The mean age of patients was 54.11 ± 5.65 years, and 44.2% were female. The median time to recovery was 13.5 days (IQR: 9). Although in the bivariate analysis, multiple factors, including hypertension, fever, diabetes mellitus, gender, and admission location, significantly contributed to prolonging the recovery period, in multivariate analysis, only dyspnea had a significant association with this variable (p = 0.02, the adjusted OR of 2.05; 95% CI 1.12-3.75). CONCLUSION: This study supports that dyspnea is a predictor of recovery time. It seems like optimal management of the comorbidities plays the most crucial role in recovery from COVID-19.","SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Abbasian, Ladan; Solduzian, Mohammad; Ayoobi Yazdi, Niloofar; Jafari, Fatemeh; Adibimehr, Alireza; Farahani, Aazam; Salami Khaneshan, Arezoo; Ebrahimi Alavijeh, Parvaneh; Jahani, Zahra; Karimian, Elnaz; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Khalili, Hossein; Seifi, Arash; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh; Ghaderkhani, Sara; Rasoolinejad, Mehrnaz",Eur J Med Res,,242

As of March 8, 2020, more than 90,000 cases were reported worldwide, resulting in a shortage of global medical resources. The purpose of this study was to understand the working experience of triage nurses in the emergency department (ED) of a large teaching general hospital in Shenzhen (Guangdong province, China) during the COVID-19 epidemic. This will provide a basis for improving the emergency nursing strategies and the epidemic response capabilities of triage nurse. METHODS: Ten triage nurses were selected as subjects by objective sampling for in- depth interviews, and the data were analyzed by the Colaizzi seven-step analysis method. RESULTS: There were four themes in the working experience of triage nurses, including fear of infection and transmission, job stress, gratitude, and expectations of managers. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19, the work experience of triage nurses mainly included the fear of infection and transmission, the high work pressure, the sense of team strength and the care of leaders. It was suggested that nursing managers should ensure the human resources of triage nurses, increase training, strengthen emergency drills, improve emergency nursing countermeasures, and improve the response capability of triage nurses during the epidemic.","Xu, Shihai; Yang, Qiaohong; Xie, Manying; Wang, Jin; Shan, Aijun; Shi, Fei",Int Emerg Nurs,,242

The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequences of COVID-19 on the IBD Unit's activity and provide information on restructuring with available resources. METHODS: an observational study was performed in a referral hospital in Madrid (Spain). Type of appointment, loss of follow-up, hospital admission, treatment changes, endoscopic activity, surgeries and blood tests were evaluated between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. This data was compared with the usual activity a year before. RESULTS: among the 510 patients included, 476 (93.33 %) received had a remote consultation, representing an increase of 92.38 % compared with the previous year (0.95 %). There was a loss of follow-up in 26 patients (5.1 %) vs 15 (3.58 %) the previous year. A total of 60 (35.09 %) blood tests, 64 (76.19 %) endoscopies and all scheduled surgeries were suspended. Besides, 484 (94.9 %) patients remained adherent vs 417/419 (99.5 %) in the pre-pandemic period and 48 (9.41 %) reported symptoms of an IBD flare. Thirty-nine (7.6 %) patients developed symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: a large number of tests and on-site outpatient visit consultations were suspended. However, a rapid adaptation to telemedicine allowed these patients to be closely followed up. Although it was possible to maintain therapeutic compliance, with a loss to follow-up slightly higher than the previous year, suspensions and delays of tests could have significant negative consequences in the long term.","El Hajra, Ismael; Calvo, Marta; Santos Pérez, Elena; Blanco Rey, Santiago; González Partida, Irene; Matallana, Virginia; González-Lama, Yago; Vera, María Isbel",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,,242
309851,Severe and treatment-resistant hypocalcemia in patient with bilateral COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic indirectly impacts HIV epidemiology in Central/West Africa. We estimated the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to HIV prevention/treatment services and sexual partnerships on HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths among key populations including female sex workers (FSW), their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM), and overall. SETTING: Yaoundé (Cameroon) and Cotonou (Benin). METHODS: We used mathematical models of HIV calibrated to city- and risk-population-specific demographic/behavioural/epidemic data. We estimated the relative change in 1-year HIV incidence and HIV-related deaths for various disruption scenarios of HIV prevention/treatment services and decreased casual/commercial partnerships, compared to a scenario without COVID-19. RESULTS: A 50% reduction in condom use in all partnerships over 6 months would increase 1-year HIV incidence by 39%, 42%, 31% and 23% among MSM, FSW, clients, and overall in Yaoundé respectively, and 69%, 49% and 23% among FSW, clients and overall respectively in Cotonou. Combining a 6-month interruption of ART initiation and 50% reduction in HIV prevention/treatment use would increase HIV incidence by 50% and HIV-related deaths by 20%. This increase in HIV infections would be halved by a simultaneous 50% reduction in casual and commercial partnerships. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in condom use following COVID-19 would increase infections among key populations disproportionately, particularly FSW in Cotonou, who need uninterrupted condom provision. Disruptions in HIV prevention/treatment services have the biggest impacts on HIV infections and deaths overall, only partially mitigated by equal reductions in casual/commercial sexual partnerships. Maintaining ART provision must be prioritised to minimise short-term excess HIV-related deaths.","Silhol, Romain; Geidelberg, Lily; Mitchell, Kate M; Mishra, Sharmistha; Dimitrov, Dobromir; Bowring, Anna; Béhanzin, Luc; Guédou, Fernand; Diabaté, Souleymane; Schwartz, Sheree; Billong, Serge C; Njindam, Iliassou Mfochive; Levitt, Daniel; Mukandavire, Christinah; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu; Rönn, Minttu M; Dalal, Shona; Vickerman, Peter; Baral, Stefan; Alary, Michel; Boily, Marie-Claude",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,242

311761,Lupus Anticoagulant in Patients with Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the proposed intervention is that Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has profound effects on antiviral immunity, and can provide the stimulus to restore immune homeostasis in the lung with acute lung injury post COVID-19, and can promote lung repair mechanisms, that lead to a 25% improvement in lung oxygenation parameters. Sargramostim is a man-made form of the naturally-occurring protein GM-CSF. TRIAL DESIGN: A phase 4 academic, prospective, 2 arm (1:1 ratio), randomized, open-label, controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged 18-80 years admitted to specialized COVID-19 wards in 5 Belgian hospitals with recent (< 2 weeks prior to randomization) confirmed COVID-19 infection and acute respiratory failure defined as a PaO2/FiO2 below 350 mmHg or SpO2 below 93% on minimal 2 L/min supplemental oxygen. Patients were excluded from the trial in case of (1) known serious allergic reactions to yeast-derived products, (2) lithium carbonate therapy, (3) mechanical ventilation prior to randomization, (4) peripheral white blood cell count above 25.000/µL and/or active myeloid malignancy, (5) high dose systemic steroid therapy (> 20 mg methylprednisolone or equivalent), (6) enrolment in another investigational study, (7) pregnant or breastfeeding or (8) ferritin levels > 2000 µg/mL. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Inhaled sargramostim 125 µg twice daily for 5 days in addition to standard care. Upon progression of disease requiring mechanical ventilation or to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and initiation of mechanical ventilator support within the 5 day period, inhaled sargramostim will be replaced by intravenous sargramostim 125 µg/m2 body surface area once daily until the 5 day period is reached. From day 6 onwards, progressive patients in the active group will have the option to receive an additional 5 days of IV sargramostim, based on the treating physician's assessment. Intervention will be compared to standard of care. Subjects progressing to ARDS and requiring invasive mechanical ventilatory support, from day 6 onwards in the standard of care group will have the option (clinician's decision) to initiate IV sargramostim 125m µg/m2 body surface area once daily for 5 days. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint of this intervention is measuring oxygenation after 5 days of inhaled (and intravenous) treatment through assessment of a change in pretreatment and post-treatment ratio of PaO2/FiO2 and through measurement of the P(A-a)O2 gradient (PAO2= Partial alveolar pressure of oxygen, PaO2=Partial arterial pressure of oxygen; FiO2= Fraction of inspired oxygen). RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be done using REDCap (electronic IWRS system). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 80 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and acute hypoxic respiratory failure will be enrolled, 40 in the active and 40 in the control group. TRIAL STATUS: SARPAC protocol Version 2.0 (April 15 2020). Participant recruitment is ongoing in 5 Belgian Hospitals (i.e. University Hospital Ghent, AZ Sint-Jan Bruges, AZ Delta Roeselare, University Hospital Brussels and ZNA Middelheim Antwerp).

314238,Laboratory indicators in COVID-19 and other pneumonias: Analysis for differential diagnosis and comparison of dynamic changes during 400-day follow-up,2021,"PURPOSE: Among patients with anal cancer, chemoradiotherapy is often associated with toxicities that diminish quality of life. We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication. METHODS: We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times. RESULTS: The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025). The patients' median overall summary score at baseline and at 3 months did not differ (P = .919). Three months after radiotherapy, most patients reported minimal adverse effects compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: The GI-related PROs of patients with anal cancer tend to fluctuate during radiotherapy but return to baseline by 3 months, at which time most patients report few or no residual adverse effects. We provide a clear timeline of GI acute toxicity using sequential PRO measurements that will improve patient-physician communication regarding expectations for cancer treatment.","Kouzy, Ramez; Abi Jaoude, Joseph; Lin, Daniel; El Alam, Molly B; Minsky, Bruce D; Koay, Eugene J; Das, Prajnan; Holliday, Emma B; Klopp, Ann H; Colbert, Lauren E; Taniguchi, Cullen M",JCO Oncol Pract,,242
314305,Risk Stratification for ECMO Requirement in COVID-19 ICU Patients Using Quantitative Imaging Features in CT Scans on Admission,2021,"Background: Acute respiratory failure occurs frequently in hospitalized patients and often begins outside the ICU, associated with increased length of stay, cost, and mortality. Delays in decompensation recognition are associated with worse outcomes. Objectives: The objective of this study is to predict acute respiratory failure requiring any advanced respiratory support (including noninvasive ventilation). With the advent of the coronavirus disease pandemic, concern regarding acute respiratory failure has increased. Derivation Cohort: All admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from three hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network (82,699). Validation Cohort: External validation cohort: all admission encounters from January 2014 to June 2017 from a fourth hospital in the Emory Healthcare network (40,143). Temporal validation cohort: all admission encounters from February to April 2020 from four hospitals in the Emory Healthcare network coronavirus disease tested (2,564) and coronavirus disease positive (389). Prediction Model: All admission encounters had vital signs, laboratory, and demographic data extracted. Exclusion criteria included invasive mechanical ventilation started within the operating room or advanced respiratory support within the first 8 hours of admission. Encounters were discretized into hour intervals from 8 hours after admission to discharge or advanced respiratory support initiation and binary labeled for advanced respiratory support. Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment, our eXtreme Gradient Boosting-based algorithm, was compared against Modified Early Warning Score. Results: Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment had significantly better discrimination than Modified Early Warning Score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.85 vs 0.57 [test], 0.84 vs 0.61 [external validation]). Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment maintained a positive predictive value (0.31-0.21) similar to that of Modified Early Warning Score greater than 4 (0.29-0.25) while identifying 6.62 (validation) to 9.58 (test) times more true positives. Furthermore, Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment performed more effectively in temporal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.86 [coronavirus disease tested], 0.93 [coronavirus disease positive]), while achieving identifying 4.25-4.51x more true positives. Conclusions: Prediction of Acute Respiratory Failure requiring advanced respiratory support in Advance of Interventions and Treatment is more effective than Modified Early Warning Score in predicting respiratory failure requiring advanced respiratory support at external validation and in coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

314458,Histo-blood group A is a risk factor for severe COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: In order to reduce distress associated with working with COVID-19 patients, several psychological intervention programs for healthcare workers have been developed in Spain. We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programs for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programs for healthcare workers during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programs offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programs during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention. The planning and development of interventions for healthcare workers during pandemics merits greater attention by national and regional authorities and institutions.","Priede, Amador; López-Álvarez, Inés; Carracedo-Sanchidrián, Diego; González-Blanch, César","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

314554,Analysis of blood index characteristics in COVID-19 patients and their associations with different outcomes,2021,"Dravet Syndrome (DS) is a genetic neurodevelopmental disease. Recurrent severe seizures begin in infancy and co-morbidities follow, including developmental delay, cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. A majority of DS patients have an SCN1A heterozygous gene mutation. This mutation causes a loss-of-function in inhibitory neurons, initiating seizure onset. We have investigated whether the sodium channelopathy may result in structural changes in the DS model independent of seizures. Morphometric analyses of axons within the corpus callosum were completed at P16 and P50 in Scn1a heterozygote KO male mice and their age-matched wild-type littermates. Trainable machine learning algorithms were used to examine electron microscopy images of â¼400 myelinated axons per animal, per genotype, including myelinated axon cross-section area, frequency distribution and g-ratios. Pilot data for Scn1a heterozygote KO mice demonstrate the average axon caliber was reduced in developing and adult mice. Qualitative analysis also shows micro-features marking altered myelination at P16 in the DS model, with myelin out-folding and myelin debris within phagocytic cells. The data has indicated, in the absence of behavioral seizures, factors that governed a shift toward small calibre axons at P16 have persisted in adult Scn1a heterozygote KO corpus callosum. The pilot study provides a basis for future meta-analysis that will enable robust estimates of the effects of the sodium channelopathy on axon architecture. We propose that early therapeutic strategies in DS could help minimize the effect of sodium channelopathies, beyond the impact of overt seizures, and therefore achieve better long-term treatment outcomes.","Richards, Kay; Jancovski, Nikola; Hanssen, Eric; Connelly, Alan; Petrou, Steve",Brain Res,,242

315382,Gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel beta-coronavirus that is responsible for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Acute infections should be diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based tests, but serology tests can demonstrate previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: We compared the performance of the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays using 179 negative participants to determine negative percentage agreement (NPA) and in 60 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed positive patients to determine positive percentage agreement (PPA) at 3 different time frames following a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result. RESULTS: At &#8805;15 days, the PPA (95% CI) was 100 (86.3-100)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 96.0 (79.7-99.9)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 100 (86.3-100)% for the Abbott IgG assay. The NPA (95% CI) was 98.3 (95.2-99.7)% for the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel, 99.4 (96.9-100)% for the Roche total Ig assay, and 98.9 (96.0-99.9)% for the Abbott IgG assay. When the Roche total Ig assay was combined with either the Diazyme IgM/IgG panel or the Abbott IgG assay, the positive predictive value was 100% while the negative predictive value remained greater than 99%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that the Diazyme, Roche, and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 serology assays have similar clinical performances. We demonstrated a low false-positive rate across all 3 platforms and observed that false positives observed on the Roche platform are unique compared to those observed on the Diazyme or Abbott assays. Using multiple platforms in tandem increases the PPVs, which is important when screening populations with low disease prevalence.","Suhandynata, Raymond T; Hoffman, Melissa A; Kelner, Michael J; McLawhon, Ronald W; Reed, Sharon L; Fitzgerald, Robert L",J Appl Lab Med,,242

Moreover, the development of aesthetics, within the broader context of literary systems, is of significant importance. Chinese Literature (which in essence differs from that of English Literature) expresses beauty using its unique ways, especially with the employment of fuzzy language (also known as ""vague language""). By including a certain degree of ""fuzziness"", Chinese Literature grants read ers room fir imagination. However, the process of translating Chinese fuzzy language into other languages is not an easy feat to accomplish. Such translations can, to a large extent, seriously affect the original meaning of the text. To explore proper ways of ""fuzzy language"" translation, this paper ventures to analyze the processing methods used in the translated work ""Dr. Zha's Diary of Fighting the COVID-19"". Categorizing vague language into three perspectives, namely, semantic vagueness, cultural vagueness and rhetorical vagueness, the paper analyzes the way to tackle fuzzy language with 16 detailed cases. Based on the case analyses, the paper proposes that the proper translation of fuzzy language in literature will be more conducive for readers to appreciate the works and helps to improve the translation quality. By exploring the ways of processing fuzzy language, this paper hopes to bring some suggestions and inspiration to other researchers.","Yang, Aijun",Theory and Practice in Language Studies,,242

319020,The Electro-Anatomical Pathway for Normal and Abnormal ECGs in COVID Patients,2020,"This paper discusses the use of stochastic modeling in the prognosis of Corona Virus-Infected Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. COVID-19 is a new disease that is highly infectious and dangerous. It has deeply shaken the world, claiming the lives of over a million people and bringing the world to a lockdown. So, the early detection of COVID is essential for the patients' timely treatment and preventive measures. A filtering technique with time-varying parameters is presented to predict the stochastic volatility (SV) of COVID-19 cases. The time-varying parameters are estimated using the Kalman filtering technique based on the stochastic component of data volatility. Kalman filtering is essential as it removes insignificant information from the data. We forecast one-step-ahead predicted volatility with ± 3 standard prediction errors, which is implemented by Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We conclude that Kalman filtering in conjunction with the SV model is a reliable predictive model for COVID-19 since it is less constrained by the past autoregressive information.","Masum Bhuiyan, Md Al; Mahmud, Suhail; Islam, Md Romyull; Tasnim, Nishat",Results Phys,,242

320579,Use of Methotrexate in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis in France: A Practice Survey,2021,"The development of new methods for direct viral detection using streamlined and ideally reagent-free assays is a timely and important, but challenging, problem. The challenge of combatting the COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated by the lack of rapid and effective methods to identify viral pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 on-demand. Existing gold standard nucleic acid-based approaches require enzymatic amplification to achieve clinically relevant levels of sensitivity and are not typically used outside of a laboratory setting. Here, we report reagent-free viral sensing that directly reads out the presence of viral particles in 5 minutes using only a sensor-modified electrode chip. The approach relies on a class of electrode-tethered sensors bearing an analyte-binding antibody displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker that also features a tethered redox probe. When a positive potential is applied, the sensor is transported to the electrode surface. Using chronoamperometry, the presence of viral particles and proteins can be detected as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag on the sensor. This report is the first virus-detecting assay that uses the kinetic response of a probe/virus complex to analyze the complexation state of the antibody. We demonstrate the performance of this sensing approach as a means to detect, within 5 min, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its associated spike protein in test samples and in unprocessed patient saliva.","Yousefi, Hanie; Mahmud, Alam; Chang, Dingran; Das, Jagotamoy; Gomis, Surath; Chen, Jenise B; Wang, Hansen; Been, Terek; Yip, Lily; Coomes, Eric; Li, Zhijie; Mubareka, Samira; McGeer, Allison; Christie, Natasha; Gray-Owen, Scott; Cochrane, Alan; Rini, James M; Sargent, Edward H; Kelley, Shana O",J Am Chem Soc,,242
320870,Which Complication is More Important in the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19? Rhabdomyolysis or Myocardial Injury,2021,"In late 2019, an outbreak of respiratory disease named COVID-19 started in the world. To date, thousands of cases of infection are reported worldwide. Most researchers focused on epidemiology and clinical features of COVID-19, and a small part of studies was performed to evaluate the genetic characteristics of this virus. Regarding the high price and low availability of sequencing techniques in developing countries, here we describe a rapid and inexpensive method for the detection of D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2. Using bioinformatics databases and software, we designed the PCR-RFLP method for D614G mutation detection. We evaluated 144 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples isolated in six months in Northeastern Iran. Our results showed that the prevalent type is S-D in our isolates, and a small number of isolated belongs to the S-G type. Of 144 samples, 127 (88.2%) samples have belonged to type S-D, and 13 (9%) samples typed S-G. The first S-G type was detected on 2020 June 10. We have little information about the prevalence of D614G mutation, and it seems that the reason is the lack of cheap and fast methods. We hope that this method will provide more information on the prevalence and epidemiology of D614G mutations worldwide.","Hashemi, Seyed Ahmad; Khoshi, Amirhosein; Ghasemzadeh-Moghaddam, Hamed; Ghafouri, Majid; Taghavi, Mohammadreza; Namdar-Ahmadabad, Hasan; Azimian, Amir",Infect Genet Evol,,242

322419,Cerebrovascular events and outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19: The SVIN COVID-19 Multinational Registry,2020,"OBJECTIVES: While vascular alterations in solid tumor malignancies are known to decrease therapeutic delivery, the effects of leukemia-induced bone marrow vasculature (BMV) alterations on therapeutic delivery are not well known. Additionally, functional quantitative measurements of the leukemic BMV during chemotherapy and radiotherapy are limited largely due to a lack of high-resolution imaging techniques available preclinically. This study develops a murine model using compartmental modeling for quantitative multiphoton microscopy (QMPM) to characterize the malignant BMV before and during treatment. METHODS: Using QMPM, live time-lapsed images of dextran leakage from the local BMV to the surrounding bone marrow of mice bearing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were taken, and fit to a two-compartment model to measure the transfer rate (Ktrans), fractional extracellular extravascular space (&#957;ec), and vascular permeability parameters as well as functional single-vessel characteristics. In response to leukemia-induced BMV alterations, the effects of 2-4Gy low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) on the BMV, drug delivery, and mouse survival were assessed post-treatment to determine if neo-adjuvant LDRT prior to chemotherapy improves treatment outcome. RESULTS: Mice bearing ALL had significantly altered Ktrans, increased &#957;ec, and increased permeability compared to healthy mice. Angiogenesis, decreased single-vessel perfusion and decreased vessel diameter were observed. BMV alterations resulted in disease-dependent reductions in cellular uptake of Hoechst dye. LDRT to mice bearing ALL dilated BMV, increased single-vessel perfusion, and increased daunorubicin uptake by ALL cells. Consequently, LDRT administered to mice before receiving Nilotinib significantly increased survival compared to mice receiving LDRT after Nilotinib, demonstrating the importance of LDRT conditioning before therapeutic administration. CONCLUSION: Developed QMPM enables single-platform assessments of the pharmacokinetics of fluorescent agents and characterization of the BMV. Initial results suggest BMV alterations after neo-adjuvant LDRT may contribute to enhanced drug delivery and increased treatment efficacy for ALL. Developed QMPM enables observations of the BMV for use in ALL treatment optimization.","Brooks, Jamison; Kumar, Bijender; Zuro, Darren M; Raybuck, Jonathon D; Madabushi, Srideshikan Sargur; Vishwasrao, Paresh; Parra, Liliana Echavarria; Kortylewski, Marcin; Armstrong, Brian; Froelich, Jerry; Hui, Susanta K",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,242
322561,High Dose Intravenous Vitamin C for Preventing The Disease Aggravation of Moderate COVID-19 Pneumonia. A Retrospective Propensity Matched Before-After Study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical characteristics of febrile infants younger than 90 days with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, to investigate the prevalence of serious bacterial infections (SBIs) in these infants, and to compare the risk of SBI in SARS-CoV-2-positive febrile infants with sex- and age-matched SARS-CoV- 2-negative febrile infants. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from March to November 2020 in a tertiary children's hospital. Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes and included if age was younger than 90 days, a SARS-CoV-2 test was performed, and at least 1 bacterial culture was collected. Positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 were age- and sex-matched to negative controls for analysis. Serious bacterial infection was defined as a urinary tract infection, bacterial enteritis, bacteremia, and/or bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Fifty-three SARS-CoV-2-positive infants were identified with a higher rate of respiratory symptoms and lower white blood cell and C-reactive protein values than their SARS-CoV-2 matched controls. The rate of SBI in the SARS-CoV-2-positive infants was 8% compared with 34% in the controls; the most common infections were urinary tract infections (6% vs 23%). There were no cases of bacteremia or bacterial meningitis in the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) infants and 2 (4%) cases of bacteremia in the controls. The relative risk of any SBI between the 2 groups was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.6; P &#8804; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that febrile infants younger than 90 days with COVID-19 have lower rates of SBI than their matched SARS-CoV-2-negative controls. These data are consistent with previous studies describing lower risks of SBI in febrile infants with concomitant viral respiratory tract infections.","Payson, Alison; Etinger, Veronica; Napky, Pablo; Montarroyos, Stephanie; Ruiz-Castaneda, Ana; Mestre, Marcos",Pediatr Emerg Care,,242

We examined associations between parental exposures to COVID-19, parental worries about the pandemic, harsh and warm parenting practices, and child CP and CU traits. Although more parental worries were not directly related to parenting practices, more worry about COVID-19 was specifically related to higher levels of child CP, particularly parental worries about themselves or family members contracting the virus. Our findings add to a growing literature demonstrating the burden that the pandemic has placed on families and its implications for children's mental health.","Waller, Rebecca; Powell, Tralucia; Rodriguez, Yuheiry; Corbett, Natalie; Perlstein, Samantha; White, Lauren K; Barzilay, Ran; Wagner, Nicholas J",Child psychiatry hum. dev,,242

BACKGROUND: Health inequity is a systemic and longstanding concern with dire consequences that can have marked effects on the lives of minority patients. As a result of the unequal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the magnitude of the outcomes from health inequity in all spheres of American health care is being brought to the fore. The discourse within athletic training practice and policy must shift to intentionally creating strategies that acknowledge and account for systemic health inequities in order to facilitate an informed, evidence-based, and safe return to sport within the new normal. CONCLUSIONS: To continue to evolve the profession and solidify athletic trainers' role in public health spaces post-COVID-19, professionals at all levels of athletic training practice and policy must intentionally create strategies that acknowledge and account for not only the social determinants of health but also the effects of racism and childhood trauma on overall health and well-being.","Noel-London, Kemba Ceronne; Grimsley, Crystal; Porter, Jessie; Breitbach, Anthony P",J. athl. train,,242

Immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange, for those treated outside of the home, expose patients to the hazards of hospital or outpatient infusion centers. Steroid therapy initiation and continuation pose increased infectious risk. Immunosuppressant therapy similarly becomes highly problematic, with the risks of treatment continuation enhanced by uncertainties regarding duration of the pandemic. The required processes necessitate considerable time and effort especially as resources and staff are re-deployed to face the pandemic, but are essential for protecting this group of patients and as an integral part of wider public health actions.","Rajabally, Yusuf A; Goedee, H Stephan; Attarian, Shahram; Hartung, Hans-Peter",Muscle Nerve,,242

Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study and retrieved data of 79 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients at admission from three designated hospitals in Wuhan, China. The asymptomatic patients could happen at any age, ranged from 9 to 96 years. These patients also had lower levels of alanine aminotransferase and C-reactive protein. Patchy shadowing was the most common manifestation in computed tomography scan. Some asymptomatic carriers developed mild or moderate symptoms during hospitalization. Age and comorbidities, especially hypertension, may be predictive factors for symptom development in the initially asymptomatic carriers at admission. Early detection and treatment for these presymptomatic patients before symptom onset can shorten the communicable period for the coronavirus and reduce the occurrence of severe cases.","Yu, Chao; Zhou, Miao; Liu, Yang; Guo, Tinglin; Ou, Chongyang; Yang, Liye; Li, Yan; Li, Dongliang; Hu, Xinyu; Shuai, Li; Wang, Bin; Zou, Zui",Virulence,,242

327865,Smoking prevalence in Covid-19 patients,2021-07-28,"Motivated by applications that involve setting proper staffing levels for multi-server queueing systems with batch arrivals, we present a thorough study of the queue-length process $\{Q(t); t \geq 0\}$, departure process $\{D(t); t \geq 0\}$, and the workload process $\{W(t); t \geq 0\}$ associated with the M$_{t}^{B_{t}}$/G$_{t}$/$\infty$ queueing system, where arrivals occur in batches, with the batch size distribution varying with time. Notably, we first show that both $Q(t)$ and $D(t)$ are equal in distribution to an infinite sum of independent, scaled Poisson random variables. When the batch size distribution has finite support, this sum becomes finite as well. We then derive the finite-dimensional distributions of both the queue-length process and the departure process, and we use these results to show that these finite-dimensional distributions converge weakly under a certain scaling regime, where the finite-dimensional distributions of the queue-length process converge weakly to a shot-noise process driven by a non-homogeneous Poisson process. Next, we derive an expression for the joint Laplace-Stieltjes transform of $W(t)$, $Q(t)$, and $D(t)$, and we show that these three random variables, under the same scaling regime, converge weakly, where the limit associated with the workload process corresponds to another Poisson-driven shot-noise process.","Daw, Andrew; Fralix, Brian; Pender, Jamol",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00625v2.pdf,242

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator. A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the centre with the largest case volume. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments [40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)]. No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%). The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), P = 0.034. There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis amongst stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the overall incidence of stroke remained the same, but fewer patients presented within the therapeutic time window.

331181,COVID-19 and your rheumatology patients,2020,"In December 2019, a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was recognized in the city of Wuhan, China. Rapidly, it became an epidemic in China and has now spread throughout the world reaching pandemic proportions. High mortality rates characterize SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19), which mainly affects the elderly, causing unrestrained cytokines-storm and subsequent pulmonary shutdown, also suspected micro thromboembolism events. At the present time, no specific and dedicated treatments, nor approved vaccines, are available, though very promising data come from the use of anti-inflammatory, anti-malaria, and anti-coagulant drugs. In addition, it seems that males are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than females, with males 65% more likely to die from the infection than females. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese scientists show that of all cases about 1.7% of women who contract the virus will die compared with 2.8% of men, and data from Hong Kong hospitals state that 32% of male and 15% of female COVID-19 patients required intensive care or died. On the other hand, the long-term fallout of coronavirus may be worse for women than for men due to social and psychosocial reasons. Regardless of sex- or gender-biased data obtained from WHO and those gathered from sometimes controversial scientific journals, some central points should be considered. Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, which plays an essential role in cell entry together with transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); it is interesting to note that the ACE2 gene lays on the X-chromosome, thus allowing females to be potentially heterozygous and differently assorted compared to men who are definitely hemizygous. Secondly, the higher ACE2 expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data. Finally, several genes involved in inflammation are located on the X-chromosome, which also contains high number of immune-related genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses to infection. Other genes, out from the RAS-pathway, might directly or indirectly impact on the ACE1/ACE2 balance by influencing its main actors (e.g., ABO locus, SRY, SOX3, ADAM17). Unexpectedly, the higher levels of ACE2 or ACE1/ACE2 rebalancing might improve the outcome of COVID-19 in both sexes by reducing inflammation, thrombosis, and death. Moreover, X-heterozygous females might also activate a mosaic advantage and show more pronounced sex-related differences resulting in a sex dimorphism, further favoring them in counteracting the progression of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gemmati, Donato; Bramanti, Barbara; Serino, Maria Luisa; Secchiero, Paola; Zauli, Giorgio; Tisato, Veronica",,,242

We calculate an index that measures the possibility of working from home based on the characteristics of the pre-Covid-19 pandemic distribution of occupations and on internet access at home, using microdata for Mexico. Focusing on households with two partners employed in nonessential occupations, we show that there is high within-household correlation in the possibility of working remotely, which is likely to be positively associated with job stability during the pandemic. Poor families, with low access to formal credit and who rely heavily on informal mechanisms for consumption smoothing have lower chances of working remotely than richer families with higher access to formal credit. High within-household correlation in the work-from-home index restricts the likelihood of intra-household risk-sharing and consumption smoothing, and is likely to contribute to an increase in inequality.","Peluffo, Cecilia; Viollaz, Mariana",Rev Econ Househ,,242
333765,Approach to Acute Cardiovascular Complications in COVID-19 Infection,2020,"Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a crucial hazard to global health. The new species share similarities with the two previously emerged entities: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that have caused outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively. Interestingly, all of these coronaviruses can cause potentially fatal respiratory syndromes, though behave differently in patients with cancer compared to patients without cancer. Accordingly, the present chapter aims to, through a systematic investigation, estimate the prevalence of cancer among COVID-19, SARS, and MERS confirmed cases. Our analysis based on data from 78 studies with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 confirmed cases showed that the prevalence of cancer (4.94%) stands at fourth place after hypertension (20.8%), diabetes (11.39%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.46%). According to the findings of the present study, comorbidities are significantly more common in patients with MERS compared to patients with COVID-19 and SARS, and this was the cancer case as well. Further studies need to address whether or not patients with coronaviruses and cancer are different from patients with coronaviruses without cancer in terms of clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, outcomes, and men to women ratio.","Fotouhi, Maryam; Samami, Elham; Mohseni, Sahar; Nasrollahizadeh, Amir; Haddadi, Mohammad; Mirbeyk, Mona; Saghazadeh, Amene; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,,242
334777,PCR Test Is Not an Accurate Predictor of Lung Damage in COVID-19 Patients (preprint),2020,"In 2020 the whole world focused on antivirus drugs towards SARS-CoV-2. Most of the researchers focused on drugs used in other viral infections or malaria. We have not seen such mobilization towards one topic in this century. The whole situation makes clear that progress needs to be made in antiviral drug development. The first step to do it is to characterize the potential antiviral activity of new or already existed drugs on the market. Phenothiazines are antipsychotic agents used previously as antiseptics, anthelminthics, and antimalarials. Up to date, they are tested for a number of other disorders including the broad spectrum of viruses. The goal of this paper was to summarize the current literature on activity toward RNA-viruses of such drugs like chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine. We identified 49 papers, where the use of the phenothiazines for 23 viruses from different families were tested. Chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, perphenazine, prochlorperazine, and thioridazine possess anti-viral activity towards different types of viruses. These drugs inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cell-cell fusion, infection, replication of the virus, decrease viral invasion as well as suppress entry into the host cells. Additionally, since the drugs display activity at nontoxic concentrations they have therapeutic potential for some viruses, still, further research on animal and human subjects are needed in this field to verify cell base research.","Otreba, Michal; Kosmider, Leon; Rzepecka-Stojko, Anna",Eur J Pharmacol,,242

The objectives of this work are: (i) to formulate asymmetric AR models and their estimation and diagnostics;(ii) to assess the performance of the parameters estimators and of the local influence technique for these models;and (iii) to provide a tool to show how data following an asymmetric distribution under an AR structure should be analyzed. We take the advantages of the stochastic representation of the skew-normal distribution to estimate the parameters of the corresponding AR model efficiently with the expectation-maximization algorithm. Diagnostic analytics are conducted by using the local influence technique with four perturbation schemes. By employing Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the statistical behavior of the corresponding estimators and of the local influence technique. An illustration with financial data updated until 2020, analyzed using the methodology introduced in the present work, is presented as an example of effective applications, from where it is possible to explain atypical cases from the COVID-19 pandemic.

336698,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of chronic noninfectious respiratory diseases,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Cross-country comparisons of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have largely been applied to mortality analyses. The goal of this analysis is to explore predictors of COVID-19 testing through cross-country comparisons, to better inform international health policies. METHODS: Testing and case-based data were amassed from Our World in Data, and information regarding predictors was gathered from the World Bank. We investigate Human Development Index (HDI), health expenditure, universal health coverage (UHC), urban population, service industry workers (%), and air pollution as predictors. We explored testing data through July 31, 2020, or most recently available, using case-indexing methods, which involve synchronizing countries by date of first reported COVID-19 case as an index date and normalizing to the cumulative tests 25 days post-index date. Three multivariable linear regression models were built in a stepwise fashion to explore the association between the indexed number of COVID-19 tests and HDI scores. RESULTS: A total of 86 countries were included in the final analytical sample, excluding countries with missing data. HDI and urban population were found to be significantly associated with testing levels. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that social conditions and government capacity remain consistently salient in the consideration of testing rates. International efforts to assist low-HDI countries are needed to support the global COVID-19 response.","Marziali, Megan E; Hogg, Robert S; Oduwole, Oluwamayowa A; Card, Kiffer G",Int J Infect Dis,,242

The city's public safety is an important part of the high-quality development and the construction of a liveable city. To understand whether and how factors at different levels affect the public security of particular group of people in a city. This study uses data from an extensive questionnaire survey by the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of the People's Republic of China (MOHURD) in 11 cities. This study uses the descriptive statistical method and Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) to study the perception of urban public safety (PUPS) and its influencing factors of floating population with higher education background (FPHEB) from the three levels of city-district-individual. The study finds that (1) when FPHEB is placed in a district and a city at the same time, the influence of the city on PUPS is greater than that of the district; (2) the urban's infrastructure security and economic development security positively affect the floating population; (3) the GDP and the number of stadiums and hospitals of the district are significantly positively correlated with the PUPS of the FPHEB, whereas the increase of population density and road density have negative effects; (4) FPHEB with distinct attributes will make their PUPS also different. This study is not only a reflection on the construction of urban public security after the COVID-19 outbreak but can also be used as a theoretical reference for the government in constructing urban public security. This study also enriches the research on the floating population and makes good scientific suggestions for the city's PUPS of the FPHEB.

341988,COVID-19 and Acute Myocardial Injury and Infarction: Related Mechanisms and Emerging Challenges,2021,"Background: Transmission in healthcare settings can result in significant infections in healthcare workers and patients. Understanding infection dynamics has important implications for methods employed in hospitals to prevent nosocomial transmission events. Methods: In this case series report we describe a cluster of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in a tertiary care university hospital, in the early phases of the epidemic, after hospital visiting had been stopped and when the UK lockdown was in place. Findings: A 48 year old patient developed COVID-19 31 days post-admission and four days after admission to a medical ward from ITU. Infection was likely acquired from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare worker (HCW). Subsequent investigation over a 14 day period revealed symptoms in 23 staff members and five linked cases in patients on the same ward. Nine of the 23 affected staff members provided care for and had direct exposure with the index case. Four staff reported caring for the index case without use of personal protective equipment. One was coughed on directly by the patient 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion: SARS CoV2 infection can be introduced to a ward area by asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic healthcare workers. Staff members and patients can act as Trojan horses carrying infection into and around the hospital, setting up unexpected transmission events. Transmission of infection from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic individuals means that universal use of measures to prevent transmission is required for successful reduction of transmission events in the hospital setting.","Asad, H.; Johnston, C.; Blyth, I.; Holborow, A.; Bone, A.; Porter, L.; Tidswell, P.; Healy, B.",Infect.

342035,Postdischarge venous thromboembolism following hospital admission with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Internet technologies can create advanced and rich web-based apps that allow radiologists to easily access teleradiology systems and remotely view medical images. However, each technology has its own drawbacks. It is difficult to balance the advantages and disadvantages of these internet technologies and identify an optimal solution for the development of medical imaging apps. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare different internet platform technologies for remotely viewing radiological images and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. METHODS: Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 were each used to develop a comprehensive web-based medical imaging app that connected to a medical image server and provided several required functions for radiological interpretation (eg, navigation, magnification, windowing, and fly-through). Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based medical imaging apps were tested on different operating systems over a local area network and a wide area network. Three computed tomography colonography data sets and 2 ordinary personal computers were used in the experiment. RESULTS: The experimental results demonstrated that Java-, Flash-, and HTML5-based apps had the ability to provide real-time 2D functions. However, for 3D, performances differed between the 3 apps. The Java-based app had the highest frame rate of volume rendering. However, it required the longest time for surface rendering and failed to run surface rendering in macOS. The HTML5-based app had the fastest surface rendering and the highest speed for fly-through without platform dependence. Volume rendering, surface rendering, and fly-through performances of the Flash-based app were significantly worse than those of the other 2 apps. CONCLUSIONS: Oracle Java, Adobe Flash, and HTML5 have individual strengths in the development of remote access medical imaging apps. However, HTML5 is a promising technology for remote viewing of radiological images and can provide excellent performance without requiring any plug-ins.","Min, Qiusha; Wang, Xin; Huang, Bo; Xu, Liangzhou",J Med Internet Res,,242

Our objectives were to investigate (1) experiences of social isolation and loneliness during shelter-in-place orders, and (2) unmet health needs related to changes in social interactions. DESIGN: Mixed-methods longitudinal phone-based survey administered every 2 weeks. SETTING: Two community sites and an academic geriatrics outpatient clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 151 community-dwelling older adults. MEASUREMENTS: We measured social isolation using a six-item modified Duke Social Support Index, social interaction subscale, that included assessments of video-based and Internet-based socializing. Measures of loneliness included self-reported worsened loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and loneliness severity based on the three-item University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale. Participants were invited to share open-ended comments about their social experiences. RESULTS: Participants were on average aged 75 years (standard deviation = 10), 50% had hearing or vision impairment, 64% lived alone, and 26% had difficulty bathing. Participants reported social isolation in 40% of interviews, 76% reported minimal video-based socializing, and 42% minimal Internet-based socializing. Socially isolated participants reported difficulty finding help with functional needs including bathing (20% vs 55%; P = .04). More than half (54%) of the participants reported worsened loneliness due to COVID-19 that was associated with worsened depression (62% vs 9%; P < .001) and anxiety (57% vs 9%; P < .001). Rates of loneliness improved on average by time since shelter-in-place orders (4-6 weeks: 46% vs 13-15 weeks: 27%; P = .009), however, loneliness persisted or worsened for a subgroup of participants. Open-ended responses revealed challenges faced by the subgroup experiencing persistent loneliness including poor emotional coping and discomfort with new technologies. CONCLUSION: Many older adults are adjusting to COVID-19 restrictions since the start of shelter-in-place orders. Additional steps are critically needed to address the psychological suffering and unmet medical needs of those with persistent loneliness or barriers to technology-based social interaction.","Kotwal, Ashwin A; Holt-Lunstad, Julianne; Newmark, Rebecca L; Cenzer, Irena; Smith, Alexander K; Covinsky, Kenneth E; Escueta, Danielle P; Lee, Jina M; Perissinotto, Carla M",J. am. geriatr. soc,,242
342839,Radiological and Laboratory Findings of Patients with COVID-19 Infection at the Time of Admission,2021,"Current literature has focused on testing saliva in symptomatic patients, and little information is available regarding saliva performance in asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We compared paired saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) collected from 33 symptomatic and 12 asymptomatic known SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Saliva had an overall sensitivity of 59%, a specificity of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 98%. Saliva demonstrated higher sensitivity in symptomatic (80%) vs. asymptomatic individuals (36%) (P = 0.006), and in high-risk (symptomatic, febrile and/or with comorbidities) (82%) vs. low-risk (asymptomatic, afebrile, and no comorbidities) (22%) patients (P = 0.0002). Cycle threshold (Ct) values in NPS specimens were higher in saliva-negative vs. saliva-positive cases (P = 0.02 and <0.001). Overall, these findings show that despite saliva's low sensitivity in asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, it can detect infections with lower Ct values and a potentially higher chance of viral transmission. Additional studies are warranted to fully evaluate saliva as a screening test for coronavirus disease-2019.","Alkhateeb, Khaled J; Cahill, Meredith N; Ross, Adam S; Arnold, Forest W; Snyder, James W",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,,242

When confronted with new pathogens, individuals generate several beliefs about the epidemic phenomenon. Many studies have shown that individual protective behaviors largely depend on these beliefs. Due to the absence of treatment and vaccine against these emerging pathogens, the relation between these beliefs and these behaviors represents a crucial issue for public health policies. In the premises of the Covid-19 pandemic, several preliminary studies have highlighted a delay in the perception of risk by individuals, which potentially holds back the implementing of the necessary precautionary measures: people underestimated the risks associated with the virus, and therefore also the importance of complying with sanitary guidelines. During the peak of the pandemic, the salience of the threat and of the risk of mortality could then have transformed the way people generate their beliefs. This potentially leads to upheavals in the way they understand the world. Here, we propose to explore the evolution of beliefs and behaviors during the Covid-19 crisis, using the theory of predictive coding and the theory of terror management, two influential frameworks in cognitive science and in social psychology.","Bottemanne, H; Morlaàs, O; Schmidt, L; Fossati, P",Encephale,,242

It is the first study to assess the utility of emergency teleophthalmology with a simple smartphone application or web browser and a webcam to manage emergency eye care in a population with sudden restricted access to ophthalmologists. In this study, every patient who asked for an ophthalmic emergency consultation in a single specialized center in Paris ('SOS Åil') first had to undergo a teleconsultation appointment to evaluate the indication for a physical consultation to preserve lockdown. Under medical advice only, a physical appointment was given within a day (if necessary). The aim of the study was to describe the population and diagnoses and evaluate the main judgment criteria, defined as the 'ability of teleconsultation to properly indicate a physical consultation for fair diagnosis and treatment in eye emergencies'. This organization has permitted physicians and patients to preserve social distancing while avoiding 3 or 4 physical consultations per person. Notably, 27% of teleconsultations were followed by a physical appointment. There was a mean 4.12-day delay between symptom apparition and consultation, and less than 1 day for traumas, superficial corneal foreign body and neuro-ophthalmological emergencies. There was a 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity to properly evaluate the indication of a physical consultation and only 1.0% misdiagnoses that lead to delayed care. Hence, teleconsultation maintained satisfactory healthcare access to patients with severe ophthalmological disorders while preserving social distancing and sanitary precautions. Therefore, teleconsultation may be seriously considered as a way to efficiently regulate ophthalmic emergencies, especially for patients with limited access to a specialist.","Bourdon, H; Jaillant, R; Ballino, A; El Kaim, P; Debillon, L; Bodin, S; N039,; Kosi, L",J Fr Ophtalmol,,242

The biosensor employs cys-kemptide (CLRRASLG) as a substrate peptide which was immobilized on the surface of a gold electrode via the self-assembly of the thiol terminals in cysteine (C) residues. The interaction between protein kinase A (PKA) and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) on the cys-kemptide immobilized electrode can cause the transfer of ATP terminal phosphates to the peptide substrates at serine (S) residues, which alters the surface charge of the electrode, thus enabling monitoring of the PKA activity via measuring the interfacial electron transfer resistance with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The proposed sensor showed reliable, sensitive, and selective detection of PKA activity with a wide dynamic range of 0.1–100 U/mL and a detection limit of 56 mU/mL. The sensor also exhibited high selectivity, rendering it possible to screen PKA inhibitors. Moreover, the sensor can be employed to evaluate the activity and inhibition of PKA in real samples.","Cho, Hyunju Chang-Seuk Lee Kim Tae Hyun",Biomedicines,,242

However, within a short period, the quality sectors start recovering from the bottom. A stock price model has been developed during such crises based on the net-fund-flow ($\Psi_t$) due to institutional investors, and financial antifragility ($\phi$) of a company. We assume that during the crash, the stock price fall is independent of the $\phi$. We study the effects of shock lengths and $\phi$ on the stock price during the crises period using the $\Psi_t$ obtained from synthetic and real fund flow data. We observed that the possibility of recovery of stock with $\phi>0$, termed as quality stock, decreases with an increase in shock-length beyond a specific period. A quality stock with higher $\phi$ shows V-shape recovery and outperform others. The shock length and recovery period of quality stock are almost equal that is seen in the Indian market. Financially stressed stocks, i.e., the stocks with $\phi<0$, show L-shape recovery during the pandemic. The stock data and model analysis shows that the investors, in the uncertainty like COVID-19, invest in the quality stocks to restructure their portfolio to reduce the risk. The study may help the investors to make the right investment decision during a crisis.","Mahata, Ajit; rai, Anish; Prakash, Om; Nurujjaman, Md",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13076v2.pdf,242

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study screened 233 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha, China with COVID-19 from January 17th to February 29th, 2020. After completion of SARS-CoV2-specific immunoglobulins, and T cells tests at 2-week and 3-month follow-up points after discharge, 87 were enrolled. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to assess changes in the values of IgG and IgM, the number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio during the 3-month follow-up. Linear regressions were used to evaluate the associations of immunological changes and medications during hospitalization. RESULTS: The positive rate of IgG decreased from 98.6% (40/41) to 85.4% (35/41) in men and 100% (43/43) to 76.7% (33/43) in women, whereas IgM declined from 34.1% (14/41) to 12.2% (5/41) in men and 37.2% (16/43) to 27.9% (12/43) in women during the follow-up. CD4+ T cells increased from (median (IQR), 484 (384-635)) cells/ul to 543 (414-657) cells/ul (P = 0.01). Antibiotic use was negatively associated with IgG change (mean change [95%CI], 8.08 [0.80-15.37] U, P = 0.03), and glucocorticoid use was positively related to increased CD4+ T cells (100.85 [16.56-185.15] cells/ul, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the positive rates and values of IgG and IgM decreased in COVID-19 patients over a 3-month follow-up, while CD4+ T cells significantly increased. Moreover, we found that antibiotic use during hospitalization was associated with IgG decrease, and glucocorticoid use was associated with increases in CD4+ T cells.","Liu, Chao; Dun, Yaoshan; Liu, Ping; You, Baiyang; Shu, Kongliang; Luo, Huijun; Ripley-Gonzalez, Jeffrey W; Liu, Suixin; Liu, Jiyang; Li, Bo",Int Immunopharmacol,,242

347100,Delayed ct scan of the lungs in patients with covid-19 pneumonia,2021,"BACKGROUND: Spain has one of the highest incidences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, so Spanish health care workers (HCW) are at high risk of exposure. Our objective was to determine severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seroprevalence amongst HCW and factors associated with seropositivity. METHODS: A cross-sectional study evaluating 6190 workers (97.8% of the total workforce of a healthcare-system of 17 hospitals across four regions in Spain) was carried out between April and June 2020, by measuring immunoglobulin G (IgG)-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres and related clinical data. Exposure risk was categorized as high (clinical environment; prolonged/direct contact with patients), moderate (clinical environment; non-intense/no patient contact) and low (non-clinical environment). RESULTS: A total of 6038 employees (mean age 43.8 years; 71% female) were included in the final analysis. A total of 662 (11.0%) were seropositive for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 (39.4% asymptomatic). Adding available PCR-testing, 713 (11.8%) employees showed evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, before antibody testing, 482 of them (67%) had no previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Seroprevalence was higher in high- and moderate-risk exposure (12.1 and 11.4%, respectively) compared with low-grade risk subjects (7.2%), and in Madrid (13.8%) compared with Barcelona (7.6%) and Coruña (2.0%). High-risk [odds ratio (OR): 2.06; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-2.62] and moderate-risk (OR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.32-2.37) exposures were associated with positive IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after adjusting for region, age and sex. Higher antibody titres were observed in moderate-severe disease (median antibody-titre: 13.7 AU/mL) compared with mild (6.4 AU/mL) and asymptomatic (5.1 AU/mL) infection, and also in older (>60 years: 11.8 AU/mL) compared with younger (<30 years: 4.2 AU/mL) people. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence of IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCW is a little higher than in the general population and varies depending on regional COVID-19 incidence. The high rates of subclinical and previously undiagnosed infection observed in this study reinforce the utility of antibody screening. An occupational risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection related to working in a clinical environment was demonstrated in this HCW cohort.","Varona, Jose F; Madurga, Rodrigo; Peñalver, Francisco; Abarca, Elena; Almirall, Cristina; Cruz, Marta; Ramos, Enrique; Castellano Vázquez, Jose María",Int. j. epidemiol,,242
347196,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons for Financially Fragile and Aging Societies,2020,"Entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is expressed in nasal epithelial cells, and nasal delivery pathway can be a key feature of transmission. Here, a possibility of interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with air pollution particulate matter (PM) was considered. It was shown in our recent studies that water-suspended plastic and wood smoke aerosol PM and carbon-containing nanoparticles from burning organics can interact with the plasma membrane of brain nerve terminals presumably due to their lipid components. COVID-19 patients have neurological symptoms, viral particles were found in the brain, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cells via fusion of lipid viral envelope with the plasma membranes of infected cells, and so viral envelop can contain lipid components of the host neuronal membranes. Therefore, interaction of SARS-CoV-2 envelope with PM is possible in water surrounding. After drying, PM can serve as a carrier for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 immobilized at their surface. Moreover, PM and SARS-CoV-2 per se can enter human organism during nasal inhalation, and they both use the same nose-to-brain delivery pathways moving along axons directly to the brain, influencing the nervous system and exocytosis/endocytosis in nerve cells. Thus, PM can aggravate neurological symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and vice versa, due to their identical nose-to-brain delivery mechanism and possible interference of neuronal effects. In addition, different types of PM because of their ability to interact with the plasma membranes of nerve cells can facilitate unspecific SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the cells, and can influence envelope features of SARS-CoV-2. Detailed studies are required to analyze interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with PM.","Borisova, Tatiana; Komisarenko, Serhiy",,,242

348038,A review of significance of Aspergillus detection in airways of ICU COVID-19 patients,2021,"Zimbabwe currently faces several healthcare challenges, most notably HIV and associated infections including tuberculosis (TB), malaria and recently outbreaks of cholera, typhoid fever and COVID-19. Fungal infections, which are also a major public health threat, receive considerably less attention. Consequently, there is dearth of data regarding the burden of fungal diseases in the country. We estimated the burden of fungal diseases in Zimbabwe based on published literature and 'at-risk' populations (HIV/AIDS patients, survivors of pulmonary TB, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and patients receiving critical care) using previously described methods. Where there was no data for Zimbabwe, regional, or international data was used. Our study revealed that approximately 14.9% of Zimbabweans suffer from fungal infections annually, with 80% having tinea capitis. The annual incidence of cryptococcal meningitis and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in HIV/AIDS were estimated at 41/100,000 and 63/100,000, respectively. The estimated prevalence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) was 2,739/100,000. The estimated burden of fungal diseases in Zimbabwe is high in comparison to other African countries, highlighting the urgent need for increased awareness and surveillance to improve diagnosis and management.","Pfavayi, Lorraine T; Denning, David W; Baker, Stephen; Sibanda, Elopy N; Mutapi, Francisca",Sci Rep,,242

350424,Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients With COVID-19: Outcomes With and Without Endoscopic Evaluation,2020,"The regulations implemented by governments in response to COVID-19 to limit the movement of people affected the nature of consumer spending Consumption behaviour change, resulting from disasters or government-enforced regulation, is visible through spending displacement and response to fast-moving changes in circumstances This study examines student spending in the host cities of universities and how a pandemic, such as COVID-19, may reduce or eliminate the spending injections into the economy through displaced spending The value associated with the spending displacement is derived from a pre-Covid student survey conducted at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University, South Africa It reflects on the types of consumer spending that occur and also quantifies the value of spending lost to the city's businesses as a result of the transition to a predominant eLearning model in response to lock-down regulations imposed by Govenment The university campuses in South Africa are known for their important role in both the development of the workforce's skills and the benefit this provides to the economy A university campus attracts students from outside the confines of the city which supports spending injection to the local businesses This benefit is of more value to the host city when it is situated in a rural setting and able to attract students from outside the local area, which has been the case with the Potchefstroom Campus The Campus experienced an increase in the enrolment of on-campus contact learning over the past decade, a trend that has been beneficial to the local business community and led to continued investment in various property markets A student survey provides insight into the spending patterns of students and is used to identify the retail spending benefit thereof, as well as the negative effects of its subsequent displacement, to the local retail industry The introduction of a lockdown and a move to online learning by universities raise the question as to how this might affect the value of student spending and how this displacement in spending will impact the local economy Some researchers indicate that various forms of spending displacement can be associated with COVID-19, while this research paper investigates how such displacement is relevant to the student population and the host economy Three forms of displacement are identified in the literature related to the COVID-19 environment, and the results from the survey are aligned with these displacements Considering the spatial aspect of consumption in the economic process, it was found that the value of student spending is not distributed evenly between retailers in the host economy The survey results highlight the fact that mobility plays a role in spending patterns and that retail spending occurs throughout the host city Within the context of COVID-19, the measures that restrict mobility and enforce social distancing, force trade to occur close to consumers' homes This implies that student spending shifts from the host city to their hometown residence as a result of the change to online studies The pre-Covid-19 student survey spending results revealed that 81 per cent of students' monthly retail spending takes place inside the host city with the rest spent outside The Covid-19 enforced move towards online learning, and the potentially longer-term shifts from contact to online learning, will have a significant spending displacement effect on the host city Concerning the type of consumption that occurs, the research revealed that students tend to spend on a variety of goods and services The largest monthly spending takes place on retail goods, which represents an average monthly value of R3 146 or 46 5 % of their monthly expenses, followed by accommodation at 31% In the case of COVID-19, the government regulations which limited contact education resulted in monthly losses in spending within the local economy on the purchase of retail-related services such as groceries and other goods, clothes and footwear, entertainment nd ospitality services Considering the time aspect of consumption, it was found that spending preferences related to time do exist The results show that students are indifferent to spending during the week or on weekends and that most students are content to stay within the host city during weekends No obvious time preference between the week and weekend for spending was found The results show that student spending represents significant spending in the host city and for the time the COVID-19 restrictions remain in place, the spending displacement and loss of income for local businesses will be significant The loss of student spending amounts to approximately R2 million daily This not only highlights the cost of enforced lockdown measures, but also provides important indicators to university management upon considering replacing the existing tuition model of contact learning with one of online learning Such a decision will lead to a significant negative impact on the economic activity of the Potchefstroom business community with farreaching implications for employment, income generation and wealth disbursement in this university city

ondersoek Die studie is uniek deurdat dit 'n universiteitskampus in 'n landelike omgewing as gevallestudie bestudeer Die tendens is dat studentegetalle, afkomstig van buite die grense van die plaaslike ekonomie, deurentyd styg Dit het 'n positiewe impak op die ekonomiese aktiwiteite van die gasheerstad en bevoordeel ondernemings as gevolg van studente se bestedingspatrone Besteding deur voltydse kontakstudente is besonder voordelig vir die kleinhandelsektor in die gasheerstad Owerheidsinperkings op beweging wat ingestel is om die verspreiding van die koronavirus te verhoed, het hierdie besteding tydelik beëindig en die plaaslike ekonomie nadelig beïnvloed Die beperkings op die beweging van studente lei tot die verplasing van studentebesteding, weg vanaf die gasheerstad, met 'n kosteverlies vir die kleinhandelsektor van gemiddeld nagenoeg R2 miljoen per dag Die lengte van die inperking op die normale werking van die universiteit kan dus oor die langer termyn 'n wesentlike effek op die plaaslike kleinhandelmark van die gasheerstad hê, met verlore werksgeleenthede en die sluit van besighede as 'n realiteit Die onderskeie tipes bestedingsverplasings wat in die literatuur met rampe geassosieer word, word uitgelig Die resultate is nie net van toepassing gedurende die viruspandemie nie, maar toon ook aan wat die negatiewe permanente langtermynimpak op die plaaslike

351910,Emergent Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke During New York City's COVID-19 Outbreak: Clinical Characteristics and Paraclinical Findings,2020,"COVID-19 is a devastating global pandemic around the world. While the majority of infected cases appear mild, in some cases individuals present respiratory complications with possible serious lung damage. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19 as yet, though a number are under evaluation, including experimental antivirals. Sofosbuvir, the clinically approved anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug, is also capable of suppressing other families of positive-strand RNA viruses; Flaviviridae and Togaviridae. Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses with conserved polymerase, so SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is very likely to be effectively inhibited by sofosbuvir. More importantly, sofosbuvir is safe and well tolerated at 400 mg daily in a 24 week therapeutic regimen. Sofosbuvir active metabolite, however, shows an extremely high intracellular stability So, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection could also be susceptible to sofosbuvir and we were convinced to design and run a clinical trial to evaluate the effect of sofosbuvir 400 mg (in combination with velpatasvir 100 mg, as add-on treatment, in addition to standard of care) on the COVID-19. However, we believe that this manuscript/correspondence should be made available to the international scientific community as soon as possible, with the help of this esteemed journal.","Sayad, Babak; Sobhani, Mahsa; Khodarahmi, Reza",Arch Med Res,,242

352576,Delirium: Clinical Presentation and Outcomes in Older COVID-19 Patients,2020,"As of 10 April 2020, New York State had 180,458 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 9,385 reported deaths. Patients with cancer comprised 8.4% of deceased individuals1. Population-based studies from China and Italy suggested a higher coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) death rate in patients with cancer2,3, although there is a knowledge gap as to which aspects of cancer and its treatment confer risk of severe COVID-194. This information is critical to balance the competing safety considerations of reducing SARS-CoV-2 exposure and cancer treatment continuation. From 10 March to 7 April 2020, 423 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were diagnosed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (from a total of 2,035 patients with cancer tested). Of these, 40% were hospitalized for COVID-19, 20% developed severe respiratory illness (including 9% who required mechanical ventilation) and 12% died within 30 d. Age older than 65 years and treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) were predictors for hospitalization and severe disease, whereas receipt of chemotherapy and major surgery were not. Overall, COVID-19 in patients with cancer is marked by substantial rates of hospitalization and severe outcomes. The association observed between ICI and COVID-19 outcomes in our study will need further interrogation in tumor-specific cohorts.","Robilotti, Elizabeth V; Babady, N Esther; Mead, Peter A; Rolling, Thierry; Perez-Johnston, Rocio; Bernardes, Marilia; Bogler, Yael; Caldararo, Mario; Figueroa, Cesar J; Glickman, Michael S; Joanow, Alexa; Kaltsas, Anna; Lee, Yeon Joo; Lucca, Anabella; Mariano, Amanda; Morjaria, Sejal; Nawar, Tamara; Papanicolaou, Genovefa A; Predmore, Jacqueline; Redelman-Sidi, Gil; Schmidt, Elizabeth; Seo, Susan K; Sepkowitz, Kent; Shah, Monika K; Wolchok, Jedd D; Hohl, Tobias M; Taur, Ying; Kamboj, Mini",Nat Med,,242

353084,Immunological Evaluation on Potential Treatment Window for Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2020,"PURPOSE: This report compares COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in the nonmetropolitan areas of the United States with the metropolitan areas across three 11-week periods from March 1 to October 18, 2020. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","Matthews, Kevin A; Ullrich, Fred; Gaglioti, Anne H; Dugan, Susan; Chen, May S; Hall, Diane M",J Rural Health,,242
353184,Cardiovascular manifestations in severe and critical patients with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: The objective was to evaluate ophthalmologists' KAP toward the outbreak of the pandemic COVID-19 disease. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the period of the global outbreak of COVID-19, between April 8 and April 18, 2020. A sample of 120 ophthalmologists was chosen by a stratified method. The online survey was used to obtain information about respondents' KAP toward COVID-19. RESULTS: The study participants included 120 ophthalmologists and ophthalmologists under training out of the targeted 163 ophthalmologists who were invited to participate, giving a response rate of 73.6%. Ophthalmology residents represent 40.8%, whereas consultants represent 32.5% of them. Nearly 40.8% of the participants were aged between 31 and 40 years. Overall, the percentage of COVID-19 knowledge score ranged between 56% and 100% with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 80% (76%-88%). Overall, the percentage score of attitude toward COVID-19 ranged between 13.3% and 100% with a median (IQR) of 73.3% (46.7%-88.0%). Although the safety precaution attitude toward COVID-19 was highest among ophthalmologists aged over 50 years, the difference did not reach a statistical significance. Other studied factors were not significantly associated with the score of percentage of attitude toward COVID-19. CONCLUSION: KAP among ophthalmologists in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia toward COVID-19 are optimal. However, health education campaigns are needed to reinforce the current KAP and improve the level of understanding of the risks and prevention measures that, in turn, improve the confidence of ophthalmologists to provide the right care to their patients and protect themselves as well.","ALBalawi, Hani B; Alali, Naif M",Middle East Afr J Ophthalmol,,242

353904,Tocilizumab and steroid treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Digital health is well-positioned in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) to revolutionize health care due, in part, to increasing mobile phone access and internet connectivity. This paper evaluates the underlying factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify the current digital health projects and studies being carried out in Pakistan, as well as the key stakeholders involved in these initiatives. We aim to follow a mixed-methods strategy and to evaluate these projects and studies through a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis to identify the internal and external factors that can potentially facilitate or hinder the progress of digital health in Pakistan. METHODS: This study aims to evaluate digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan with mixed methods. The qualitative and quantitative data obtained from field surveys were categorized according to the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended building blocks for health systems research, and the data were analyzed using a SWOT analysis strategy. RESULTS: Of the digital health projects carried out in the last 5 years in Pakistan, 51 are studied. Of these projects, 46% (23/51) used technology for conducting research, 30% (15/51) used technology for implementation, and 12% (6/51) used technology for app development. The health domains targeted were general health (23/51, 46%), immunization (13/51, 26%), and diagnostics (5/51, 10%). Smartphones and devices were used in 55% (28/51) of the interventions, and 59% (30/51) of projects included plans for scaling up. Artificial intelligence (AI) or machine learning (ML) was used in 31% (16/51) of projects, and 74% (38/51) of interventions were being evaluated. The barriers faced by developers during the implementation phase included the populations' inability to use the technology or mobile phones in 21% (11/51) of projects, costs in 16% (8/51) of projects, and privacy concerns in 12% (6/51) of projects. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that while digital health has a promising future in Pakistan, it is still in its infancy at the time of this study. However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is an increase in demand for digital health and implementation of health outcomes following global social distancing protocols, especially in LMICs. Hence, there is a need for active involvement by public and private organizations to regulate, mobilize, and expand the digital health sector for the improvement of health care systems in countries.","Kazi, Abdul Momin; Qazi, Saad Ahmed; Ahsan, Nazia; Khawaja, Sadori; Sameen, Fareeha; Saqib, Muhammad; Khan Mughal, Muhammad Ayub; Wajidali, Zabin; Ali, Sikander; Ahmed, Rao Moueed; Kalimuddin, Hussain; Rauf, Yasir; Mahmood, Fatima; Zafar, Saad; Abbasi, Tufail Ahmad; Khoumbati, Khalil-Ur-Rahmen; Abbasi, Munir A; Stergioulas, Lampros K",J Med Internet Res,,242

354975,Effect of low-dose aspirin on mortality and viral duration of the hospitalized adults with COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The collarbone is the only bone that joins the axial skeleton with the appendicular, during the function of the thoracic limb a shortening implies a decrease in strength and function since it acts as a lever, where the greater the shortening, the smaller will be the force produced. Factors such as multifragmentation, bone loss and reabsorption of the edges of the fragments are some limiting to the restitution of the clavicular length. How much might a shortening of the collarbone affect the function of the upper limb? MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective and non-probabilistic cross-sectional study was conducted in surgically treated clavicular fracture patients. Shortening was measured in millimeters on postoperative X-Ray, dash scale was subsequently applied to determine the degree of function. RESULTS: 12 patients, average age 37 ± 17.7 years. 2 women and 10 men. 5 on the right side and 7 left side. Statistical analysis was performed with Pearson correlation coefficient. Average shortening 13.32 ± 9.9 mm. Average scale of DASH 6.0 ± 3. DISCUSSION: Moderate correlation with limitation in function in shortenings 1 cm, as well as clinical significance on the DASH scale from 6 points, 4 less than what the literature marks. With this, it can be determined that patients managed with or without surgery, with a shortening 1 cm will have a considerable limitation in the function of the shoulder and upper limb.","Pantaleón-Fierros, E",Acta Ortop Mex,,242
355399,Tension Pneumomediastinum in a Patient with Covid-19 Pneumonia,2020,"Aims: The primary aim was to assess the rate of patient deferral of elective orthopaedic surgery and whether this changed with time during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The secondary aim was to explore the reasons why patients wanted to defer surgery and what measures/circumstances would enable them to go forward with surgery. Methods: Patients were randomly selected from elective orthopaedic waiting lists at three centres in the UK in April, June, August, and September 2020 and were contacted by telephone. Patients were asked whether they wanted to proceed or defer surgery. Patients who wished to defer were asked seven questions relating to potential barriers to proceeding with surgery and were asked whether there were measures/circumstances that would allow them to go forward with surgery. Results: There was a significant decline in the rate of deferral for surgery from April (n = 38/50, 76%), June (n = 68/233, 29%), to August (n = 6/50, 12%) and September (n = 5/100, 5%) (p < 0.001). Patients wishing to defer were older (68 years (SD 10.1) vs 65 (SD 11.9)), more likely to be female (65% (44/68) vs 53% (88/165)) and waiting for a knee arthroplasty (65% (44/68) vs 41% (67/165); p < 0.001). By September 2020, all patients that deferred in June at one centre had proceeded or wanted to proceed with surgery due to a perceived lower risk of acquiring COVID-19 perioperatively (68%, n = 15) or because their symptoms had progressed (32%, n = 7). The most common reason (n = 14/17, 82%) for patients deferring surgery in September was the perceived risk of acquiring COVID-19 while as an inpatient. When asked what measures or circumstances would enable them to proceed with surgery, the most common (n = 7, 41%) response was reassurance of a COVID-19 free hospital. Conclusion: The rate of deferral fell to 5% by September, which was due to a lower perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 perioperatively or worsening of symptoms while waiting. The potential of a COVID-19-free hospital and communication of mortality risk may improve a patient's willingness to go forward with surgery.Cite this article: Bone Joint Open 2020;1-10:663-668.","Clement, Nicholas D; Oussedik, Sam; Raza, Kamran I; Patton, Robyn F L; Smith, Karen; Deehan, David J",Bone Jt Open,,242
355813,Electrocardiographic Changes and Arrhythmias in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical schools and clinicians to transition swiftly to working online, where possible. During this time, final-year medical students at King's College London, England, have received some of their general practice teachings in the form of virtual tutor groups. The predominant feature of such groups is online patient simulations, which provide students a valuable experience to help gain insight into current clinical practice amid the pandemic and inform how their practices as incoming junior doctors would continue. Even in the absence of face-to-face teaching and clinical placements, students have been able to hone their medical knowledge and soft skills through these virtual, simulated consultations.

In this study, 8 pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 who were admitted into Wuhan Children's Hospital, China from February 1, 2020 to March 30, 2020 and the clinical features, laboratory data, maternal and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. The mean age of the women at the time of admission was 30.6 years. The mean gestational age of the women was 37 weeks+4 days, and one woman presented with dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancy. Except for one woman who was febrile, others had no typical clinical symptoms. For all pregnant women, the count of white blood cells and lymphocytes appeared normal, but 6 had a lower percentage of lymphocytes. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were normal for all the women. One neonate was tested positive for the coronavirus IgG and IgM antibodies. The clinical symptoms of the pregnant women with SARS-COV-2 were mild, and the laboratory data showed similar characteristics to those of non-infected pregnant women. Since one neonate was tested positive for coronavirus, there is a possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Prompt and efficient screening, triage, and isolation of pregnant women are effective management strategies to reduce nosocomial infection during the SARS-COV-2 epidemic.","Chen, Yu; Pang, Xiang-Li; Ding, Wen-Ping; Peng, Xiang-Chi; Yang, Jing; Zhou, Yan",Curr Med Sci,,242

357685,TeleCheck-AF for COVID-19,2020,"We present a case of pediatric ALF, secondary to hepatic HL, who underwent a successful ABOi living donor liver transplant. We believe this is the first such case reported in academic literature. HL with liver involvement is extremely rare and is not considered an indication for transplantation. The 12-year-old, male patient presented with a viral illness prodrome, and parvovirus was detected in pre-transplant laboratory cultures. He received an ABOi living donor liver graft followed by a course of plasma exchange and rituximab after which standard immunosuppression was used. The HL was diagnosed on hepatic biopsy post-transplant. Subsequently, the patient commenced six cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. During chemotherapy, we stopped tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Immunosuppression was maintained with corticosteroids in-between cycles. The patient is alive and reports good quality of life 1-year post-transplant. The HL is in remission. During the post-operative period, the patient experienced four episodes of neutropenia, a bile leak, and gram-negative sepsis. One episode of acute rejection has been treated. Although we did not initially transplant the patient for ALF secondary to HL, its subsequent diagnosis and the patient's response to management raises many issues that warrant consideration. While the findings from a single case cannot be generalized, this could be a ""proof of concept"" for liver transplantation in hepatic HL. We hope it will facilitate discussions and potentially expand therapeutic options available to this very small group patients.","Brannigan, Lliam; Etheredge, Harriet R; Beretta, Marisa; Demopoulos, Despina; Bennett, Kate G; Beringer, Nadia; Reynders, Marelize; Botha, Jean F",Pediatr Transplant,,242

These people may be at serious risk of covid-19. Information about the effects of Covid-19 on people living with HIV, is limited. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 61-year-old man who was a known case of HIV from 6 years ago that was being treated with HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). He also had a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma from 4 years ago who underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) 2 weeks before given referral to our hospital. He complained of weakness, anorexia, and fever. RT-PCR for SARS-COV-2-RNA was positive in his nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection and treated with atazanavir. After one week, the patient discharged in a good general state. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report of COVID-19 infection in an HIV positive patient after BMT in Iran. Despite his immunodeficiency, COVID-19 disease had mild manifestations and he had a good prognosis. We hope that our report and that of others can remain promising to doctors and HIV patients cross fingers for COVID-19 recovery.","Mardani, Masoud; Sharifi-Razavi, Athena; Sheibani, Shirin; Baziboroun, Mana",Current HIV research (Online),,242

In this study, 66 epitopes containing pentapeptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the IEDB database were compared with the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and 66 potentially immune-related peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were obtained. Based on the SNPs analysis of spike protein of 1218 SARS-CoV-2 isolates, 52 easily mutated sites were identified and used for vaccine epitope screening. The best vaccine candidate epitopes in the 66 peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were screened out through mutation and immunoinformatics analysis. The best candidate epitopes were connected by different linkers in silico to obtain vaccine candidate sequences. The results showed that 16 epitopes were relatively conservative, immunological, non-toxic and non-allergenic, could induce the secretion of cytokines and more likely to be exposed on the surface of spike protein. They were both B cell epitopes and T cell epitopes, which could recognize a certain number of HLA molecules and had high coverage rates in different populations. Moreover, epitopes 897-913 were predicted possible cross-immunoprotection for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The results of vaccine candidate sequences screening suggested that sequences (without linker, with linker GGGSGGG, EAAAK, GPGPG and KK, respectively) were the best. The proteins translated by these sequences were relatively stable, with high antigenic index and good biological activity. Our study provided vaccine candidate epitopes and sequences for the research of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. This article is protected by copyright.

Both viruses infect the same host (humans) and the same cell (type-II alveolar cells) causing lower respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia. Molecularly, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter alveolar cells via spike proteins recognizing dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and angiotensin converting enzyme-II, respectively. Intracellularly, both viruses hide in organelles to generate negative RNA strands and initiate replication using very similar mechanisms. At the transcription level, both viruses utilise identical Transcription Regulatory Sequences (TRSs), which are known recombination cross-over points during replication, to transcribe genes. Using whole genome alignments of both viruses, we identify clusters of high sequence homology at ORF1a and ORF1b. Given the high recombination rates detected in SARS-CoV-2, we speculate that in co-infections recombination is feasible via TRS and/or clusters of homologies. Accordingly, here we recommend mitigation measure and testing for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in ME countries.","Sajini, Abdulrahim A; Alkayyal, Almohanad A; Mubaraki, Fathi A",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,242

366176,Impact of a selective use of episiotomy combined with Couder's maneuver for the perineal protection,2020,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in major neutralizing antibody-binding sites can affect humoral immunity induced by infection or vaccination1-6. We analysed the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and T cell responses in previously infected (recovered) or uninfected (naive) individuals that received mRNA vaccines to SARS-CoV-2. While previously infected individuals sustained higher antibody titers than uninfected individuals post-vaccination, the latter reached comparable levels of neutralization responses to the ancestral strain than previously infected individuals 7 days after the second vaccine dose. T cell activation markers measured upon spike or nucleocapsid peptide in vitro stimulation showed a progressive increase after vaccination in the time-points analysed. Comprehensive analysis of plasma neutralization using 16 authentic isolates of distinct locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants revealed a range of reduction in the neutralization capacity associated with specific mutations in the spike gene: lineages with E484K and N501Y/T (e.g., B.1.351 and P.1) had the greatest reduction, followed by lineages with L452R (e.g., B.1.617.2) or with E484K (without N501Y/T). While both groups retained neutralization capacity against all variants, plasma from previously infected vaccinated individuals displayed overall better neutralization capacity when compared to plasma from uninfected individuals that also received two vaccine doses, pointing to vaccine boosters as a relevant future strategy to alleviate the impact of emerging variants on antibody neutralizing activity.","Lucas, Carolina; Vogels, Chantal B.F.; Yildirim, Inci; Rothman, Jessica; Lu, Peiwen; Monteiro, Valter; Jeffrey R, Gelhausen; Campbell, Melissa; Silva, Julio; Tabachikova, Alexandra; Munker, M.

366667,Hydroxychloroquine can potentially interfere with immune function in COVID-19 patients: Mechanisms and insights,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 crisis affecting the whole world. This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways ""atypical"". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life® administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life® is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life®). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life® was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life® has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life® for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","Lupon, Elise; Lellouch, Alexandre G; Zal, Franck; Cetrulo, Curtis L; Lantieri, Laurent A",Med Hypotheses,,242

Africa is particularly predisposed to an escalation of the pandemic and its negative impact given its weak economy and health systems. In addition, inadequate access to the social determinants of health such as water and sanitation and socio-cultural attributes may constrain the implementation of critical preventive measures such as hand washing and social distancing on the continent.Given these facts, the continent needs to focus on targeted and high impact prevention and control strategies and interventions which could break the chain of transmission quickly. We conclude that the available body of scientific evidence on the coronavirus disease 2019 holds the key to the development of such strategies and interventions.Going forward, we recommend that the African research community should scale up research to provide scientific evidence for a better characterization of the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, prevention and control of the virus on the continent.","Olu, Olushayo Oluseun; Waya, Joy Luba Lomole; Maleghemi, Sylvester; Rumunu, John; Ameh, David; Wamala, Joseph Francis",Infect Dis Poverty,,242

Lung CT-scans are effective diagnostic tools, but radiologists can quickly become overwhelmed by the flow of infected patients. Therefore, automated image interpretation needs to be achieved. Deep learning (DL) can support critical medical tasks including diagnostics, and DL algorithms have successfully been applied to the classification and detection of many diseases. This work aims to use deep learning methods that can classify patients between Covid-19 positive and healthy patient. We collected 4 available datasets, and tested our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on different distributions to investigate the generalizability of our models. In order to clearly explain the predictions, Grad-CAM and Fast-CAM visualization methods were used. Our approach reaches more than 92% accuracy on 2 different distributions. In addition, we propose a computer aided diagnosis web application for Covid-19 diagnosis.

368948,"Letter by Finsterer Regarding Article, ""COVID-19-Associated Stress (Takotsubo) Cardiomyopathy""",2020,"Accurate segmentation of lungs in pathological thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans plays an important role in pulmonary disease diagnosis. However, it is still a challenging task due to the variability of pathological lung appearances and shapes. In this paper, we proposed a novel segmentation algorithm based on random forest (RF), deep convolutional network, and multi-scale superpixels for segmenting pathological lungs from thoracic CT images accurately. A pathological thoracic CT image is first segmented based on multi-scale superpixels, and deep features, texture, and intensity features extracted from superpixels are taken as inputs of a group of RF classifiers. With the fusion of classification results of RFs by a fractional-order gray correlation approach, we capture an initial segmentation of pathological lungs. We finally utilize a divide-and-conquer strategy to deal with segmentation refinement combining contour correction of left lungs and region repairing of right lungs. Our algorithm is tested on a group of thoracic CT images affected with interstitial lung diseases. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve a high segmentation accuracy with an average DSC of 96.45% and PPV of 95.07%. Compared with several existing lung segmentation methods, our algorithm exhibits a robust performance on pathological lung segmentation. Our algorithm can be employed reliably for lung field segmentation of pathologic thoracic CT images with a high accuracy, which is helpful to assist radiologists to detect the presence of pulmonary diseases and quantify its shape and size in regular clinical practices.","Liu, Caixia; Zhao, Ruibin; Xie, Wangli; Pang, Mingyong",Neural Process Lett,,242

COVID-19 is known to cause a cytokine release syndrome (CRS) like response, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the cytokines involved. Clinicians are using IL-6 inhibitors to CRS, and researchers are investigating the use of IL-6 inhibitors, namely tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab, in COVID-19 management. AREAS COVERED: In this article, we will discuss the pharmacology of these three inhibitors and summarize available clinical data via literature search on PubMed with keywords of tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab, and COVID-19. While awaiting more data from randomized clinical trials on these drugs, observational studies and clinical reports have demonstrated IL-6 inhibitors showed some benefits in improving clinical outcome and a well-tolerated safety profile. EXPERT OPINION: There is a role for suppressing the immune response with IL-6 inhibitors that will continue to require investigation. These agents are available and have demonstrated a mild safety profile. There may be advantages to a targeted approach to suppressing the hyperinflammatory state of the disease. Timing, the long-term effects, and what cocktail of medications demonstrates the strongest outcomes are all important considerations as IL-6 inhibitors continue to be evaluated in this global pandemic.","Zhou, Zeyun; Price, Christina C",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,,242

The COVID- 19 taskforce within the Ghent University hospital made use of ten-day forecasts on the required number of beds for COVID- 19 patients across different wards. METHODS: The planning tool combined a Poisson model for the number of newly admitted patients on each day with a multistate model for the transitions of admitted patients to the different wards, discharge or death. These models were used to simulate the required capacity of beds by ward type over the next 10 days, along with worst-case and best-case bounds. RESULTS: Overall, the models resulted in good predictions of the required number of beds across different hospital wards. Short-term predictions were especially accurate as these are less sensitive to sudden changes in number of beds on a given ward (e.g. due to referrals). Code snippets and details on the set-up are provided to guide the reader to apply the planning tool on one's own hospital data. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to achieve a fast setup of a planning tool useful within the COVID- 19 pandemic, with a fair prediction on the needed capacity by ward type. This methodology can also be applied for other epidemics.","Deschepper, Mieke; Eeckloo, Kristof; Malfait, Simon; Benoit, Dominique; Callens, Steven; Vansteelandt, Stijn",BMC Health Serv Res,,242

The purpose of this opinion paper is to discuss various situations that could lead to larger epidemics when the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) imposed by the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will no longer be necessary. While NPIs limited the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they also reduced the spread of other pathogens during and after lockdown periods, despite the re-opening of schools since June 2020 in France. This positive collateral effect in the short term is welcome as it prevents additional overload of the healthcare system. The lack of immune stimulation due to the reduced circulation of microbial agents and to the related reduced vaccine uptake induced an ""immunity debt"" which could have negative consequences when the pandemic is under control and NPIs are lifted. The longer these periods of ""viral or bacterial low-exposure"" are, the greater the likelihood of future epidemics. This is due to a growing proportion of ""susceptible"" people and a declined herd immunity in the population. The observed delay in vaccination program without effective catch-up and the decrease in viral and bacterial exposures lead to a rebound risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. With a vaccination schedule that does not include vaccines against rotavirus, varicella, and serogroup B and ACYW Neisseria meningitidis, France could become more vulnerable to some of these rebound effects.","Cohen, Robert; Ashman, Marion; Taha, Muhamed-Kheir; Varon, Emmanuelle; Angoulvant, François; Levy, Corinne; Rybak, Alexis; Ouldali, Naim; Guiso, Nicole; Grimprel, Emmanuel",,,242

This article reflects on the role of continuing education in healthcare as a strategic element in ensuring the occupational health of community healthcare agents faced with combating and managing coronavirus 19 disease (COVID-19). In the current scenario, the work of community healthcare agents is undergoing daily reconstruction of professional practice in order to keep pace with the living territories to which they are assigned. Continuing education in healthcare enables construction of feasible scenarios that make problem solving possible, involving a constant reflective analytical perception of professional practices, permitting (re)construction of social skills such as the capacity to mobilize and motivate other actors to participate in political action. Through problematization, identification of needs, and questioning, continuing education in healthcare leads to (de)construction of the working practices of the very actors who are delivering care. Furthermore, continuing education in healthcare reaffirms the importance of the social, technical, and political training of community healthcare agents, thereby confirming their right to dignified and quality work.

372527,COVID-Net Clinical ICU: Enhanced Prediction of ICU Admission for COVID-19 Patients via Explainability and Trust Quantification,2021-09-14,"Dried blood spot samples (DBS) provide an alternative sample type to venous blood samples for antibody testing. DBS are used by NHS for diagnosing Hepatitis C and by Public Health England for large scale HIV and Hepatitis C serosurveillance; the applicability of DBS based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection is uncertain. The study aimed to compare antibody detection in DBS eluates using the Roche Elecsys ® immunoassay with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay. The study was in one Police and one Fire & Rescue facility in England; it comprised of 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. 18/195 (9.2%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using an experimental cut-off, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0% (95% CI 67.2, 96.9%) and 100.0% (95% CI 97.9, 100%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma. Sample quality impacts on assay performance. Alternatives, including the collection of capillary blood samples, should be considered for screening programs.","Mulchandani, Ranya; Brown, Ben; Brooks, Tim; Semper, Amanda; Machin, Nicholas; Linley, Ezra; Borrow, Ray; Wyllie, David",J Clin Virol,,242
373532,Clinical analysis of a twin pregnancy woman in close contact with a patient with suspected COVID-19,2020,"The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19. Importantly, it has an abundance of structural information solved as a complex with various drug candidate compounds. Collecting these crystal structures (83 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries) together with those of the highly homologous 3CLpro of SARS-CoV (101 PDB entries), we constructed the crystal structure ensemble of 3CLpro to analyze the dynamic regulation of its catalytic function. The structural dynamics of the 3CLpro dimer observed in the ensemble were characterized by the motions of four separate loops (the C-loop, E-loop, H-loop, and Linker) and the C-terminal domain III on the rigid core of the chymotrypsin fold. Among the four moving loops, the C-loop (also known as the oxyanion binding loop) causes the order (active)-disorder (collapsed) transition, which is regulated cooperatively by five hydrogen bonds made with the surrounding residues. The C-loop, E-loop, and Linker constitute the major ligand binding sites, which consist of a limited variety of binding residues including the substrate binding subsites. Ligand binding causes a ligand size dependent conformational change to the E-loop and Linker, which further stabilize the C-loop via the hydrogen bond between the C-loop and E-loop. The T285A mutation from SARS-CoV 3CLpro to SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro significantly closes the interface of the domain III dimer and allosterically stabilizes the active conformation of the C-loop via hydrogen bonds with Ser1 and Gly2; thus, SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro seems to have increased activity relative to that of SARS-CoV 3CLpro.","Kidera, Akinori; Moritsugu, Kei; Ekimoto, Toru; Ikeguchi, Mitsunori",,,242
373559,Successful treatment of plasmapheresis followed by interferon beta-1a in a child with severe COVID-19,2021,"Despite the important contribution of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to the community healthcare sector, the building and maintenance of occupational resilience in community health workers has received little attention. However, it is recognized that employees in this sector are exposed to significant stressors from the high demand work environment which negatively impacts on their well-being. Therefore, this research examined the acceptability, feasibility, and sustainability of a mindful resiliency program by employing a qualitative analysis of participant subjective experience of the program in this cohort. This was the first study to be conducted with senior managers and frontline healthcare providers in the nongovernmental organizations community sector. A 1-month post-delivery qualitative review of the program identified four major themes: applicability, changes to participant's skills, social support, and coping with COVID-19. A major finding was the ability of the participants to immediately recognize their stress levels and then manage them. Additionally, lessons from the program were shown to be usefully applied with colleagues and clients within the work environment, and with family members.","Klockner, Karen; Crawford, Christopher; Craigie, Mark; Tsai, Lily; Hegney, Desley",Nurs. health sci,,242

The goal of this study was to analyze the vitamin D status of a cancer patient cohort from our clinic in the Franconian region, Germany. METHODS: 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were available for 116 patients included in prospective trials in our clinic. Associations of vitamin D with anthropometric and blood parameters were investigated using Kendall's &#964; correlation coefficients and linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (49.1%) were vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL), and 92.2% did not meet the recommended vitamin D level of 40 ng/mL. There was a strong negative association between vitamin D and leukocyte count (&#964; = -0.173, p = 0.007) and C-reactive protein concentration (&#964; = -0.172, p = 0.007). In linear regression, the most important variables for predicting vitamin D levels were (in order of decreasing importance) season, fat mass index, platelet, and leukocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Despite appeals towards medical societies to target widespread vitamin D deficiency in Germany more than 10 years ago, our data indicate that these have been without avail. Low vitamin D levels in cancer patients should be corrected using reasonable sun exposure and supplements.","Klement, Rainer Johannes; Koebrunner, Petra S; Krage, Kelley; Sweeney, Reinhart A",Complement Med Res,,242
375048,Dynamic changes in monocytes subsets in COVID-19 patients,2021,"Medical education has been uniquely affected by the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the pandemic's psychological impacts on medical students remain unclear, this study assessed COVID-19's impacts on undergraduate medical students' stress and anxiety. A nationwide, online survey was administered via email chains between June-August 2020 to first-fourth year medical students in the United States. Demographics, 4-point Perceived Stress Scale that measures stress, 7-point Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale that measures anxiety, and the impacts of social, health, and academic stressors due to COVID-19 were collected. Of the 852 students who participated, 66.1% experienced mild, moderate, or severe anxiety. Mean PSS-4 score was 7.25/16. Stress was highest in second- through fourth-year students. Students with preexisting mental health conditions had significantly higher stress and anxiety scores, and higher percentage of stress attributed to COVID-19. Trust in government institutions during COVID-19 was the highest stressor in first- and second-year students. Delay/availability of standardized exams was the highest stressor for third-year students. Impact on rotations/residencies was the highest stressor for fourth-year students. Understanding how students' anxiety and stress have changed due to COVID-19 will allow educators to identify students in need and guide recommendations on the implementation of psychological interventions and support strategies.","Guo, Alyssa A; Crum, Marissa A; Fowler, Lauren A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242
375194,Impaired Myocardial Function Is Prognostic for Severe Respiratory Failure in the Course of COVID-19 Infection,2021,"Combined theoretical and experimental analysis is utilized in this work to spectroscopically examine nordihydroguaiaretic acid’s (NDGA) biomechanistic structure-function relationships that are related to its efficacy in preventing and treating various diseases or in generating toxicological effects. Although the medicinal and antiviral properties of this chemical extract from the Larrea tridentata plant have been studied in vitro and in vivo, an accurate distinction between its morphological changes had not yet been optically identified and reported. Obvious trends in vibrational signatures of NDGA’s confirmations were successfully elucidated here. Our findings showed that the absence of the Raman feature at 780 ± 5 cm -1is indicative of a fully oxidized NDGA form, which, together with the orthoquinone, is likely to create the compound’s bio-toxicity through accumulation. Other characteristic signatures of these toxic forms are the 1582 ± 1 cm -1and 1698 ± 1 cm -1Raman lines, and the 1680 ± 17 cm -1IR vibrational line. If the development of new drugs and their effective implementation is further envisioned, potentially even for COVID-19 pandemic, this study provides some needed comprehension in optically assessing important morphological changes that occur for this plant-derived compound due to its oxidation and creation of metabolites.","Manciu, Felicia S.; Guerrero, Jose; Rivera, David; Chang, Su-Youne; Bennet, Kevin E.",Biointerface Res.

STUDY DESIGN: We describe our approach to surge-in-place at a children's hospital to meet the local demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of redeploying pediatric providers to work with internist-led teams throughout a medical center, pediatric physicians and nurses organized and staffed a 40-bed adult COVID-19 treatment unit within a children's hospital. We adapted internal medicine protocols, developed screening criteria to select appropriate patients for admission, and reorganized staffing and equipment to accommodate adult patients with COVID-19. We used patient counts and descriptive statistics to report sociodemographic, system, and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The median patient age was 46 years; 69% were male. On admission, 78 (78%) required oxygen supplementation. During hospitalization, 13 (13%) eventually were intubated. Of the first 100 patients, 14 are still admitted to a medical unit, 6 are in the intensive care unit, 74 have been discharged, 4 died after transfer to the intensive care unit, and 2 died on the unit. The median length of stay for discharged or deceased patients was 4 days (IQR 2, 7). CONCLUSIONS: Our pediatric team screened, admitted, and cared for hospitalized adults by leveraging the familiarity of our system, adaptability of our staff, and high-quality infrastructure. This experience may be informative for other healthcare systems that will be redeploying pediatric providers and nurses to address a regional COVID-19 surge elsewhere.","Philips, Kaitlyn; Uong, Audrey; Buckenmyer, Tara; Cabana, Michael D; Hsu, Daphne; Katyal, Chhavi; O039,; Connor, Katherine; Shiminski-Maher, Tania; Hametz, Patricia",J Pediatr,,242

An observational study examining current published literature including three new unpublished cases,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Inform coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection prevention measures by identifying and assessing risk and possible vectors of infection in nursing homes (NHs) using a machine-learning approach. DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study used a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (ie, presence of at least 1 confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The model was trained on outcomes from 1146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20, 2020. Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4 were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11 from 1021 NHs in California. METHODS: Model features, pertaining to facility and community characteristics, were obtained from a self-constructed dataset based on multiple public and private sources. The model was assessed via out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in the training (via 10-fold cross-validation) and validation datasets. RESULTS: The mean AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of the model over 10-fold cross-validation were 0.729 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.690â0.767], 0.670 (95% CI 0.477â0.862), and 0.611 (95% CI 0.412â0.809), respectively. Prospective out-of-sample validation yielded similar performance measures (AUC 0.721; sensitivity 0.622; specificity 0.713). The strongest predictors of COVID-19 infection were identified as the NH's county's infection rate and the number of separate units in the NH; other predictors included the county's population density, historical Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services cited health deficiencies, and the NH's resident density (in persons per 1000 square feet). In addition, the NH's historical percentage of non-Hispanic white residents was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: A machine-learning model can help quantify and predict NH infection risk. The identified risk factors support the early identification and management of presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals (eg, staff) entering the NH from the surrounding community and the development of financially sustainable staff testing initiatives in preventing COVID-19 infection.","Sun, Christopher L F; Zuccarelli, Eugenio; Zerhouni, El Ghali A; Lee, Jason; Muller, James; Scott, Karen M; Lujan, Alida M; Levi, Retsef",J Am Med Dir Assoc,,242

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March, 2020 and since then, it has caused a number of deaths in over 200 countries around the world. Extensive researches have continued in the search of effective vaccines or drug compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and a total of 64 vaccines are currently in clinical trials with 12 currently approved for use by different regulatory bodies, depending on the country. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, many countries have utilised traditional herbal medicines alongside conventional drugs for the treatment of infected patients. In this review, traditional medicines used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection are listed along with the plant parts as used by the traditional healers. Additionally, the possible mechanisms responsible for this preventive or therapeutic outcome are also identified and listed. Our literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and WHO website. Unpublished reports such asdissertations and theses are not included. Plant parts including roots, leaves, flowers, seeds and so on have been used in the treatment of COVID-19. These traditional medicinal herbs may exert their anti-COVID-19 activity by direct inhibition of the virus replication or entry. Some may act by blocking the ACE-2 receptor, SARS-CoV helicase, Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS2) and which are required by SARS-CoV-2 in order to infect human cells. Others act by inhibiting the SARSCoV-2 life-cycle related proteins, namely chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL-pro) and Papain-like protease (PL-pro). Medicinal plants are promising alternative medicines for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further researches, are needed to decipher their active components and structures which may suggest clues for the development of drugs against this novel coronavirus","Ugwah-Oguejiofor, C.

378308,68 Changes in Incidence of COVID-19 Associated AKI Over 2020,2021,"High-throughput tissue barrier models can yield critical insights on how barrier function responds to therapeutics, pathogens, and toxins. However, such models often emphasize multiplexing capability at the expense of physiologic relevance. Particularly, the distal lung's air-blood barrier is typically modeled with epithelial cell monoculture, neglecting the substantial contribution of endothelial cell feedback in the coordination of barrier function. An obstacle to establishing high-throughput coculture models relevant to the epithelium/endothelium interface is the requirement for underside cell seeding, which is difficult to miniaturize and automate. Therefore, this paper describes a scalable, low-cost seeding method that eliminates inversion by optimizing medium density to float cells so they attach under the membrane. This method generates a 96-well model of the distal lung epithelium-endothelium barrier with serum-free, glucocorticoid-free air-liquid differentiation. The polarized epithelial-endothelial coculture exhibits mature barrier function, appropriate intercellular junction staining, and epithelial-to-endothelial transmission of inflammatory stimuli such as polyinosine:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Further, exposure to influenza A virus PR8 and human beta-coronavirus OC43 initiates a dose-dependent inflammatory response that propagates from the epithelium to endothelium. While this model focuses on the air-blood barrier, the underside seeding method is generalizable to various coculture tissue models for scalable, physiologic screening.","Viola, Hannah; Washington, Kendra; Selva, Cauviya; Grunwell, Jocelyn; Tirouvanziam, Rabindra; Takayama, Shuichi",Adv Healthc Mater,,242

METHODS: In this single-center and retrospective study, patients with confirmed COVID-19 infections were enrolled. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to explore the risk factors associated with outcomes. RESULTS: Of 179 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, 12 remained hospitalized at the end of the study and 167 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 153 (91.6%) were discharged and 14 (8.38%) died in hospital. Approximately half (50.9%) of patients suffered from a comorbidity, with diabetes or coronary heart disease being the most common in 20 patients. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, dyspnea, and cough. The mean durations from first symptoms to hospital admission was 8.64 ± 4.14 days, whereas the mean hospitalization time to discharge or death was 5.19 ± 2.42 and 4.35 ± 2.70 days, respectively. There was a significantly higher age in non-survivor patients compared with survivor patients. Multivariate regression showed increasing odds ratio (OR) of in-hospital death associated with respiratory rates >20 breaths/min (OR: 5.14, 95% CI: 1.19-22.15, p = 0.028) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) >19 mg/dL (OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.30-15.85, p = 0.017) on admission. In addition, higher respiratory rate was associated with continuous fever (OR: 4.08, 95% CI: 1.18-14.08, p = 0.026) and other clinical symptoms (OR: 3.52, 95% CI: 1.05-11.87, p = 0.04).

Knowledge translation (KT) platforms, composed of organisations, initiatives and networks supporting evidence-informed policy-making, can play an important role in providing relevant and timely evidence to inform pandemic responses and bridge the gap between science, policy, practice and politics. In this Commentary, we highlight the emerging roles of KT platforms in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also reflect on the lessons learned from the efforts of a KT platform in a middle-income country to inform decision-making and practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lessons learned can be integrated into strengthening the role, structures and mandates of KT platforms as hubs for trustworthy evidence that can inform policies and practice during public health crises and in promoting their integration and institutionalisation within the policy-making processes.","El-Jardali, Fadi; Bou-Karroum, Lama; Fadlallah, Racha",Health Res Policy Syst,,242

Modeling the trend of infection and real-time forecasting of cases can help decision making and control of the disease spread. However, data-driven methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) can perform poorly due to limited daily samples in time. In this work, we develop an integrated spatiotemporal model based on the epidemic differential equations (SIR) and RNN. The former after simplification and discretization is a compact model of temporal infection trend of a region while the latter models the effect of nearest neighboring regions. The latter captures latent spatial information. %that is not publicly reported. We trained and tested our model on COVID-19 data in Italy, and show that it out-performs existing temporal models (fully connected NN, SIR, ARIMA) in 1-day, 3-day, and 1-week ahead forecasting especially in the regime of limited training data.","Li, Zhijian; Zheng, Yunling; Xin, Jack; Zhou, Guofa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10929v1.pdf,242

Despite the importance of hydrogels for therapeutic applications, a contradiction between the size of a hydrogel and the amount of loaded drug has been encountered when using conventional fabrication methods. In this study, biocompatible reservoir microcapsules (diameter â¼100 µm) with a large liquid core and polymeric shell were fabricated via a one-step phase separation of poly(ethylene glycol)diacrylate (PEGDA) and dextran within pre-gel droplets through microfluidics. By controlling the process of phase separation, high drug-loading efficiency (â¼80%) for long-term release (30 days) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was achieved. Drug molecules were dispersed within the liquid core at a concentration above saturation solubility for sustained delivery via regulation of the shells. Effective therapeutic enhancement of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and umbilical artery smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and tube formation in vitro promoted rapid cell proliferation and increased the number of migrated cells by â¼1.7 times. Moreover, in vivo blood vessel regeneration for cardiovascular control induced by sustained dual-drug (VEGF and PDGF) delivery to the rat heart was achieved, showing the effectiveness of long-term protein delivery in improving cardiac function and significantly reducing ventricular wall thickness and fibrosis of the infarct region. The ratio of heart tissue scarring was reduced to 11.2% after microcapsule treatment compared with 21.4% after saline treatment in the rat model. By using these reservoir microcapsules, similar sustained delivery of proteins, mRNAs and biologic drugs could be developed for the treatment of a range of long-term chronic diseases and regenerative medicine.","Dinh, Ngoc-Duy; Kukumberg, Marek; Nguyen, Anh-Tuan; Keramati, Hamed; Guo, Song; Phan, Dinh-Tuan; Ja039,; Afar, Nurdiyana B; Birgersson, Erik; Leo, Hwa Liang; Huang, Ruby Yun-Ju; Kofidis, Theodoros; Rufaihah, Abdul Jalil; Chen, Chia-Hung",,,242

This article reviewed the intervention and control of the pandemic from the perspective of information disclosure with reflections on the experience in China. Furthermore, the authors propose a comprehensive framework demonstrating the overall landscape of information disclosure and voluntary compliance behaviors with highlights on (a) the tensions between privacy and information transparency; (b) the trade-offs between policy rigorousness and compliance behaviors; (c) different sources of information and how they influence public behaviors differently; and most importantly, (d) how the variegated configurations and contextualization of factors result in different influencing and moderating mechanisms between information disclosure and voluntary compliance behaviors. In the end, the authors call for future research and reforms in pandemic control practice to focus on the dynamics of information disclosure, government actions, and public compliance behaviors, which has been largely neglected so far.","Fu, Yang; Ma, Weihong; Wu, Jinjin",Am.

Governments implemented strategies to contain it, most based on lockdowns. Mexico was no exception. The lockdown was initiated in March 2020, and with it, a reduction in the seismic noise level was witnessed by the seismic stations of the national and Valley of Mexico networks. Stations located in municipalities with more than 50 000 people usually experience larger seismic noise levels at frequencies between 1 and 5 Hz, associated with human activity. The largest noise levels are recorded in Mexico City, which has the largest population in the country. The largest drop was observed in Hermosillo, Sonora;however, it was also the city with the fastest return to activities, which seems to correlate with a quick increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mexico initiated a traffic-light system to modulate the re-opening of economic activities for each state. Therefore, since 1 June, noise levels have generally reflected the colour of the state traffic light. Furthermore, the reduction in the noise level at seismic stations has allowed identification of smaller earthquakes without signal processing. Also, people in cities have perceived smaller or more distant quakes.","Pérez-Campos, Xyoli Espíndola Víctor H.; González-Ávila, Daniel Fabila Betty Zanolli Márquez-Ramírez Víctor H.; Raphael S , M.

In order to obtain high-quality clusters of the Twitter hashtags, we also propose a novel multi-view clustering technique that incorporates multiple different data types that can be used to describe how users interact with hashtags. The results of our multi-view clustering show that there are distinct temporal and topical trends present within COVID-19 twitter discussion. In particular, we find that some topical clusters of hashtags shift over the course of the pandemic, while others are persistent throughout, and that there are distinct temporal trends in hashtag usage.

Until stable cell lines are developed to increase the titer of this secreted protein in mammalian cell culture, the low yield of spike protein produced from transient transfection of HEK293 cells will be a limiting factor for these assays. To improve the yield of spike protein and support the high demand for antigens in serology assays, we investigated several recombinant protein expression variables by altering the incubation temperature, harvest time, chromatography strategy, and final protein manipulation. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently yields 5 mg of protein per liter of expression culture for two commonly used forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that these proteins form well-behaved stable trimers and are consistently functional in serology assays across multiple protein production lots.","Esposito, Dominic; Mehalko, Jennifer; Drew, Matthew; Snead, Kelly; Wall, Vanessa; Taylor, Troy; Frank, Peter; Denson, John-Paul; Hong, Min; Gulten, Gulcin; Sadtler, Kaitlyn; Messing, Simon; Gillette, William",Protein Expr Purif,,242

In our study, we also analyzed the association between METTL3 expression and prognosis using Cox proportional hazard regression in 207 ESCC patients. Results: The results of public available datasets and IHC assays showed that METTL3 was upregulated in tumor compared with adjacent nonmalignant esophageal mucosal tissues. The IHC results indicated that higher expression level of METTL3 was associated with worse survival.

High levels of circulating cytokines were reported in severe COVID-19 patients. Neopterin produced by macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma, which is an important cytokine in the antiviral immune response, hence it can be used to predict the severity of disease in COVID-19 cases. In this study, it was aimed to determine the prognostic value of the neopterin for the prediction of severe disease in patients with COVID-19. This single-center, prospective study was conducted in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy volunteers. Severe and mild COVID-19 cases were compared in terms of clinical and laboratory findings as well as serum neopterin levels on hospital admission. To assess the prognostic utility of neopterin between the severe and mild COVID-19 groups, a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. The median serum neopterin level was four times higher in COVID-19 patients than the healthy controls (46 vs. 12 nmol/L; p < .001). The AUC value of serum neopterin was 0.914 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.97).

390240,Clinical Characteristics of 5 COVID-19 Cases With Non-respiratory Symptoms as the First Manifestation in Children,2020,"BACKGROUND: Gender imbalances in academia have been evident historically and persist today. For the past 60 years, we have witnessed the increase of participation of women in biomedical disciplines, showing that the gender gap is shrinking. However, preliminary evidence suggests that women, including female researchers, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of unequal distribution of childcare, elderly care, and other kinds of domestic and emotional labor. Sudden lockdowns and abrupt shifts in daily routines have had disproportionate consequences on their productivity, which is reflected by a sudden drop in research output in biomedical research, consequently affecting the number of female authors of scientific publications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate adverse effect on the productivity of female researchers in the biomedical field in terms of authorship of scientific publications. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational bibliometric study. We investigated the proportion of male and female researchers who published scientific papers during the COVID-19 pandemic, using bibliometric data from biomedical preprint servers and selected Springer-Nature journals. We used the ordinary least squares regression model to estimate the expected proportions over time by correcting for temporal trends. We also used a set of statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and regression discontinuity design, to test the validity of the results. RESULTS: A total of 78,950 papers from the bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories and from 62 selected Springer-Nature journals by 346,354 unique authors were analyzed. The acquired data set consisted of papers that were published between January 1, 2019, and August 2, 2020. The proportion of female first authors publishing in the biomedical field during the pandemic dropped by 9.1%, on average, across disciplines (expected arithmetic mean yest=0.39; observed arithmetic mean y=0.35; standard error of the estimate, Sest=0.007; standard error of the observation, &#963;x=0.004). The impact was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19 research, where the proportion of female scientists in the first author position dropped by 28% (yest=0.39; y=0.28; Sest=0.007; &#963;x=0.007). When looking at the last authors, the proportion of women dropped by 7.9%, on average (yest=0.25; y=0.23; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.003), while the proportion of women writing about COVID-19 as the last author decreased by 18.8% (yest=0.25; y=0.21; Sest=0.005; &#963;x=0.007). Further, by geocoding authors' affiliations, we showed that the gender disparities became even more apparent when disaggregated by country, up to 35% in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings document a decrease in the number of publications by female authors in the biomedical field during the global pandemic. This effect was particularly pronounced for papers related to COVID-19, indicating that women are producing fewer publications related to COVID-19 research. This sudden increase in the gender gap was persistent across the 10 countries with the highest number of researchers. These results should be used to inform the scientific community of this worrying trend in COVID-19 research and the disproportionate effect that the pandemic has had on female academics.","Muric, Goran; Lerman, Kristina; Ferrara, Emilio",J Med Internet Res,,242

Bacterial co-infections/ co-colonisation were identified within 48 h of admission in 14 (5.5â%) patients; the commonest pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (four patients) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (two patients). The proportion of pathogens detected increased with duration of ICU stay, consisting largely of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The co-infection/ co-colonisation rate >48 h after admission was 27/1000 person-days (95â% CI 21.3-34.1). Patients with co-infections/ co-colonisation were more likely to die in ICU (crude OR 1.78,95â% CI 1.03-3.08, P=0.04) compared to those without co-infections/ co-colonisation.Conclusion. We found limited evidence for community-acquired bacterial co-infection in hospitalised adults with COVID-19, but a high rate of Gram-negative infection acquired during ICU stay.","Baskaran, Vadsala; Lawrence, Hannah; Lansbury, Louise E; Webb, Karmel; Safavi, Shahideh; Zainuddin, Nurul I; Huq, Tausif; Eggleston, Charlotte; Ellis, Jayne; Thakker, Clare; Charles, Bethan; Boyd, Sara; Williams, Tom; Phillips, Claire; Redmore, Ethan; Platt, Sarah; Hamilton, Eve; Barr, Andrew; Venyo, Lucy; Wilson, Peter; Bewick, Tom; Daniel, Priya; Dark, Paul; Jeans, Adam R; McCanny, Jamie; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Llewelyn, Martin J; Schmid, Matthias L; McKeever, Tricia M; Beed, Martin; Lim, Wei Shen",J. medical microbiol,,242

METHODS: Based on the existing literature, the infection pathways of new coronavirus(SARS-CoV-2) were systematically summarized by us, and used the SWISSDOCK molecular simulation method to carry out virtual screen systematically for key targets and marketed drugs. RESULTS: TMPRSS2/ACE2 pathway was found to be the most efficient and probably the major pathway for SARS-CoV-2 virus to infect the lung and other tissue by us. Bromhexine, an expectorant, can strongly inhibit TMPRSS2 protease (EC 50:0.75 μmol•L -1) in vitro. Bromhexine has few adverse effects and also has the beneficial effects of promoting the release and maintenance of endogenous active substances in the lung, alveolar function, and promoting sputum excretion, which is suitable for use together with other COVID19 medication and therapies. CONCLUSION: Bromhexine has a unique potential antiviral mechanism, and clinical research should be conducted to play its role in the prevention, treatment and prognosis of COVID19.","Yang, Yong; Shen, Hao; Zhao, Shan-Mei-Zi; Wang, Dong; Wang, Hao-Ran",Chin.

391256,Effect of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,2020,"An intact lung epithelial barrier is essential for lung homeostasis The Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA), primarily serving as an ion transporter, also regulates epithelial barrier function via modulation of tight junctions However, the underlying mechanism is not well-understood Here, we showed that overexpression of the NKA β1 subunit upregulates the expression of tight junction proteins, leading to increased alveolar epithelial barrier function by an ion transport-independent mechanism Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we identified a number of unknown protein interactions of the β1 subunit, including a top candidate, myotonic dystrophy kinase-related cdc42-binding kinase α (MRCKα), a protein kinase known to regulate peripheral actin formation Using a doxycycline-inducible gene expression system, we demonstrated that MRCKα and its downstream activation of myosin light chain is required for the regulation of alveolar barrier function by the NKA β1 subunit Importantly, MRCKα is expressed in both human airways and alveoli and has reduced expression in patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a lung illness that can be caused by multiple direct and indirect insults, including the infection of influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 Our results have elucidated a novel mechanism by which NKA regulates epithelial tight junctions and identified potential drug targets for treating ARDS and other pulmonary diseases that are caused by barrier dysfunction","Bai, H.; Zhou, R.; Barravecchia, M.; Norman, R.; Friedman, A.

392019,Characteristic of COVID-19 pediatric patients: evidence from systematic review,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to dramatic changes in oncology practice. It is currently unknown whether programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade therapy affects severity of illness from COVID-19 in patients with cancer. To address this uncertainty, we examined consecutive patients with lung cancers who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and examined severity on the basis of no or prior receipt of PD-1 blockade. Overall, the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancer was high, including need for hospitalization in more than half of patients and death in nearly a quarter. Prior PD-1 blockade was, as expected, associated with smoking status. After adjustment for smoking status, PD-1 blockade exposure was not associated with increased risk of severity of COVID-19. PD-1 blockade does not appear to affect the severity of COVID-19 in patients with lung cancers. SIGNIFICANCE: A key question in oncology practice amidst the COVID-19 pandemic is whether PD-1 blockade therapy affects COVID-19 severity. Our analysis of patients with lung cancers supports the safety of PD-1 blockade treatment to achieve optimal cancer outcomes.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1079.","Luo, Jia; Rizvi, Hira; Egger, Jacklynn V; Preeshagul, Isabel R; Wolchok, Jedd D; Hellmann, Matthew D",Cancer Discov,,242

395617,Fungal co-infection in COVID-19 patients: Should we be concerned?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available. METHODS: We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital. RESULTS: We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13%), 22 were discharged alive (12%) and 139 (76%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31% (95%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27% (95%CI 17-37%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7% (95%CI 0-8.2%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time > 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time > 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications. CONCLUSION: The 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.","Klok, F A; Kruip, M J H A; van der Meer, N J M; Arbous, M S; Gommers, D A M P J; Kant, K M; Kaptein, F H J; van Paassen, J; Stals, M A M; Huisman, M V; Endeman, H",Thromb Res,,242

In some patients the infection results in moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. High serum levels of IL-6, IL-10 and an immune hyperresponsiveness referred to as a 'cytokine storm' have been associated with poor clinical outcome. Despite the large numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths, information on the phenotype and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells is limited. Here, we studied 10 COVID-19 patients who required admission to an intensive care unit and detected SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 10 out of 10 and 8 out of 10 patients, respectively. We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with 'common cold' coronaviruses. The strongest T-cell responses were directed to the spike (S) surface glycoprotein, and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells predominantly produced effector and Th1 cytokines, although Th2 and Th17 cytokines were also detected. Furthermore, we studied T-cell kinetics and showed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are present relatively early and increase over time. Collectively, these data shed light on the potential variations in T-cell responses as a function of disease severity, an issue that is key to understanding the potential role of immunopathology in the disease, and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.","Weiskopf, Daniela; Schmitz, Katharina S; Raadsen, Matthijs P; Grifoni, Alba; Okba, Nisreen M A; Endeman, Henrik; van den Akker, Johannes P C; Molenkamp, Richard; Koopmans, Marion P G; van Gorp, Eric C M; Haagmans, Bart L; de Swart, Rik L; Sette, Alessandro; de Vries, Rory D",Sci. immunol,,242

This work aims to determine the extent to which socioeconomic and political conditions have shaped community-level distancing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially how these dynamics have evolved over time. METHODS: This study used daily data on physical distancing from 15â17 million cell phone users in 3,037 U.S. counties. County-level changes in the average distance traveled per person were estimated relative to prepandemic weeks as a proxy for physical distancing. Pooled ordinary least squares regressions estimated the association between physical distancing and a variety of county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political characteristics by week from March 9, 2020 to January 17, 2021. Data were collected until January 2021, at which point the analyses were finalized. RESULTS: Lower per capita income and greater Republican orientation were associated with significantly reduced physical distancing throughout nearly all the study period. These associations persisted after adjusting for a variety of county-level demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Other county-level characteristics, such as the shares of Black and Hispanic residents, were associated with reduced distancing at various points during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of dynamic socioeconomic and political gradients in preventive behavior and imply the need for nimble policy responses.","Kavanagh, Nolan M; Goel, Rishi R; Venkataramani, Atheendar S",Am J Prev Med,,242

In many settings, TB resources, facilities and equipment are being redirected towards COVID-19 response.AimWe sought to assess the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on TB services in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region.MethodsThe fifty-three European Region Member States were asked to report qualitative and quantitative data in quarter one and two (Q1 and Q2) 2020. TB notifications were triangulated with the severity score on domestic movement restrictions to assess how they may have influenced TB detection.ResultsTwenty-nine countries reported monthly TB notifications for the first half of 2019 and 2020. TB notifications decreased by 35.5% during Q2 2020 compared with Q2 2019, which is six-fold more than the average annual decrease of 5.1% documented during 2015-2019. The number of patients enrolled in rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB treatment also decreased dramatically in Q2 2020, by 33.5%. The highest movement restriction severity score was observed between April and May 2020, which coincided with the highest observed decrease in TB notifications.ConclusionA decrease in TB detection and enrolment to treatment may cause increases in TB burden and threatens the Region's ability to reach the TB targets of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, still this might be mitigated with rapid restoration of TB services and the implementation of targeted interventions during periods with severe PHSM in place, such as those introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dara, Masoud; Kuchukhidze, Giorgi; Yedilbayev, Askar; Perehinets, Ihor; Schmidt, Tanja; Van Grinsven, W Leif; Boeree, Martin J",Euro surveill,,242

They were referred to the otolaryngology team of assessment of otalgia and subsequently referred to the ophthalmology team for possible Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). Both patients had no jaw claudication, scalp pain or tenderness. RESULTS: Serology testing showed raised C-Reactive Protein (CRP) but normal platelets and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Case 1 was tested for COVID-19 as part of a preoperative workup which returned positive. With a marked similarity in presentation, Case 2 was tested for COVID-19 which also returned positive. CONCLUSION: These two cases highlight another set of symptoms that COVID-19 patients may present with. In the context of a COVID-19 pandemic, if a patient presents symptoms similar to GCA but with isolated CRP, it should prompt consideration for COVID testing.","Au, Benjamin Wai Yin; Ku, Dominic Joey; Shivanand, Sheth",J. neuro-ophthalmol,,242

400525,A preliminary analysis of blood hemogram variation in 45 cases of COVID-19 patients before and after treatment,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess general anxiety levels in endodontists and dental assistants related to different conditions during the pandemic and lockdown and to evaluate hemodynamic changes in endodontists' heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and blood oxygenation during their workday. METHODS: Anxiety levels in endodontists and dental assistants were recorded weekly during the state of alarm declared because of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored using a sphygmomanometer for HR and blood pressure and a pulse oximeter for oxygen saturation. Measurements were taken before and after each root canal treatment as well as on arrival at the clinic and at the end of the working day. Rest data, recorded every Saturday, served as a control. Data analysis was performed using chi-square, paired t, Mann-Whitney, and analysis of variance tests (P < .05). RESULTS: General anxiety decreased over the weeks, with significant differences between weeks 1 and 4 (P < .05). Endodontists perceived higher anxiety levels of anxiety during anesthesia inoculation and dental assistants during the dental unit's disinfection and equipment material (P < .05). There was a significant increase in the cardiovascular response in all endodontists in the clinic registrations compared with rest data (P < .05). Values were higher in the strict confinement period and significant for HR when arriving at the clinic (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of general anxiety were higher during the first weeks. The chief perceived factors related to anxiety in endodontists and dental assistants were the risk of contagion and protection measures. Higher HR and blood pressure levels were registered during the workday, especially when arriving at the clinic.","Olivieri, Juan Gonzalo; de España, Carlota; Encinas, Marc; Ruiz, Xavier-Fructuós; Miró, Queralt; Ortega-Martinez, Jordi; Durán-Sindreu, Fernando",J. endod,,242
400560,COVID-19 Pneumonia or Hypereosinophilic Syndrome?,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is rapidly spreading throughout the world. Hospitals and healthcare providers are preparing for the anticipated surge in critically ill patients, but few are wholly equipped to manage this new disease. The goals of this document are to provide data on what is currently known about COVID-19, and how it may impact hepatologists and liver transplant providers and their patients. Our aim is to provide a template for the development of clinical recommendations and policies to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on liver patients and healthcare providers. APPROACH AND RESULTS: This article discusses what is known about COVID-19 with a focus on its impact on hepatologists, liver transplant providers, patients with liver disease, and liver transplant recipients. We provide clinicians with guidance for how to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their patients' care. CONCLUSIONS: The situation is evolving rapidly, and these recommendations will need to evolve as well. As we learn more about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the care of patients with liver disease, we will update the online document available at https://www.aasld.org/about-aasld/covid-19-and-liver.","Fix, Oren K; Hameed, Bilal; Fontana, Robert J; Kwok, Ryan M; McGuire, Brendan M; Mulligan, David C; Pratt, Daniel S; Russo, Mark W; Schilsky, Michael L; Verna, Elizabeth C; Loomba, Rohit; Cohen, David E; Bezerra, Jorge A; Reddy, K Rajender; Chung, Raymond T",Hepatology,,242
400561,COVID-19 Pneumonia or Hypereosinophilic Syndrome?,2020,"There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a 'health in all policy' approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a 'whole council' approach.","Johnstone, P; Regan, M",Public Health,,242

400755,Changing COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease—are we really getting better at this?,2021,"Research Summary: We administered a survey experiment to a national sample of 1068 U S adults in April 2020 to determine the factors that shape support for various policing tactics in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic Respondents were sharply divided in their views about pandemic policing tactics and were least supportive of policies that might limit public access to officers or reduce crime deterrence Information about the health risks to officers, but not to inmates, significantly increased support for “precautionary” policing, but not for “social distance” policing The information effect was modest, but may be larger if the information came from official sources and/or was communicated on multiple occasions Other factors that are associated with attitudes toward pandemic policing include perceptions of procedural justice, altruistic fear, racial resentment, and authoritarianism Policy Implications: When considered together with other evidence, one clear takeaway from our study is that the public values police patrols and wants officers on call, even during pandemics Another is that people who believe the police are procedurally just are more willing to trust officers in times of crisis and to empower them to enforce new laws, such as social distancing ordinances Our results thus support continued procedural justice training for officers A third takeaway is that agencies must proactively communicate with the public about the risks their officers face when responding to public health crises or natural disasters, in addition to how they propose to mitigate those risks They must also be amenable to adjusting in response to community feedback © 2021 American Society of Criminology","Nix, J.; Ivanov, S.; Pickett, J.

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses have genetic proofreading mechanism that corrects copying mistakes and thus SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity is extremely low. Despite lower mutation rate of the virus, researchers have detected a total of 12,706 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the majority of which were single nucleotide polymorphisms. Sequencing data revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 accumulates two-single nucleotide mutations per month in its genome. Recently, an amino acid aspartate (D) to glycine (G) (D614G) mutation due to an adenine to guanine nucleotide change at position 23,403 at the 614th amino-acid position of the spike protein in the original reference genotype has been identified. The SARS-CoV-2 viruses that carry the spike protein D614G mutation have become dominant variant around the world. The D614G mutation has been found to be associated with 3 other mutations in the spike protein. Clinical and pseudovirus experimental studies have demonstrated that the spike protein D614G mutation alters the virus phenotype. However, the impact of the mutation on the rate of transmission between people, disease severity and the vaccine and therapeutic development remains unclear. Three variants of SARS-CoV-2 have recently been identified. They are B.1.1.7 (UK) variant, B.1.351 (N501Y.V2, South African) variant and B.1.1.28 (Brazilian) variant. Epidemiological data suggest that they have a higher transmissibility than the original variant. There are reports that some vaccines are less efficacious against the B.1.351 variant. This review article discusses the effects of novel mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome on transmission, clinical outcomes and vaccine development.","Akkiz, H.",Frontiers in Medicine,,242

Leveraging the sequence data from more than 140,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we study mutation rates and selective pressures affecting the virus. Understanding the processes and effects of mutation and selection has profound implications for the study of viral evolution, for vaccine design, and for the tracking of viral spread. We highlight and address some common genome sequence analysis pitfalls that can lead to inaccurate inference of mutation rates and selection, such as ignoring skews in the genetic code, not accounting for recurrent mutations, and assuming evolutionary equilibrium. We find that two particular mutation rates, G âU and C âU, are similarly elevated and considerably higher than all other mutation rates, causing the majority of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and are possibly the result of APOBEC and ROS activity. These mutations also tend to occur many times at the same genome positions along the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny (i.e., they are very homoplasic). We observe an effect of genomic context on mutation rates, but the effect of the context is overall limited. Although previous studies have suggested selection acting to decrease U content at synonymous sites, we bring forward evidence suggesting the opposite.","De Maio, Nicola; Walker, Conor R; Turakhia, Yatish; Lanfear, Robert; Corbett-Detig, Russell; Goldman, Nick",Genome biol. evol,,242
402887,A pilot study on right ventricular longitudinal strain as a predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients with evidence of cardiac involvement,2020,"In a number of applications the data will be represented in an interval format. We consider here a nested representation of uncertain information in intervals using Dempster-Shafer evidence approaches. These representations can be used in variety of applications including spatial and temporal reasoning and economic cost valuations. Two representations of nested intervals, RP1 and RP2, are defined and used in the paper. Basically an inner interval represents the more certain data and is nested in the outer less certain interval. We illustrate how the specificity measure could be used to evaluate such nested Dempster-Shafer intervals. We then consider Gini information measures applicable to the RP1 representation. We describe an example using our interval approach to COVID contact tracing in epidemiology. Finally examples of aggregation of intervals are provided. It is seen that an aggregated result can be evaluated and shown to increase the specificity of the result. Additionally, it is not always the case that aggregation increases specificity. An example is given illustrating such a case.","Petry, Fred; Yager, Ronald",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,242

Although several COVID-19 service guidelines have been promulgated, implementation data are yet unavailable. We performed a comprehensive audit of the implementation of services in a clinical oncology department. METHODS: A departmental protocol of priority-based treatment guidance was developed, and a departmental staff rotation policy was implemented. Data were collected for the period of lockdown on outpatient visits, starting, and delivery of RT and systemic therapy. Adherence to protocol was audited, and factors affecting change from pre-COVID standards analyzed by multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Outpatient consults dropped by 58%. Planned RT starts were implemented in 90%, 100%, 92%, 90%, and 75% of priority level 1-5 patients. Although 17% had a deferred start, the median time to start of adjuvant RT and overall treatment times were maintained. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 89% of those eligible. Systemic therapy was administered to 84.5% of planned patients. However, 33% and 57% of curative and palliative patients had modifications in cycle duration or deferrals. The patient's inability to come was the most common reason for RT or ST deviation. Factors independently associated with a change from pre-COVID practice was priority-level allocation for RT and age and palliative intent for systemic therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite significant access limitations, a planned priority-based system of delivery of treatment could be implemented.","Mallick, Indranil; Chakraborty, Santam; Baral, Shweta; Saha, Saheli; Lal, Vishnu H; Sasidharan, Rohit; Santosham, Ritesh J M; Chhatbar, Samarth; Bhusal, Subecha; Goyal, Love; Maulik, Shaurav; Phesao, Vezokhoto; Arora, Siddharth; Bhattacharyya, Tapesh; Mahata, Anurupa; Prasath, Sriram; Balakrishnan, Arun; Mandal, Samar; Arunsingh, Moses A; Achari, Rimpa; Chatterjee, Sanjoy",JCO Glob Oncol,,242
403914,Clinical features of COVID-19 in elderly patients: A comparison with young and middle-aged patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Diabetes has emerged as an important risk factor for mortality from COVID-19. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed glucose-lowering agent, has been proposed to influence susceptibility to and outcomes of COVID-19 via multiple mechanisms. We investigated whether, in patients with diabetes, metformin is associated with susceptibility to COVID-19 and its outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a propensity score-matched cohort study with active comparators using a large UK primary care dataset. Adults with type 2 diabetes patients and a current prescription for metformin and other glucose lowering agents (MF+) were compared to those with a current prescription for glucose-lowering agents that did not include metformin (MF-). Outcomes were confirmed COVID-19, suspected/confirmed COVID-19, and associated mortality. A negative control outcome analysis (back pain) was also performed. RESULTS: There were 29,558 and 10,271 patients in the MF+ and MF- groups respectively who met the inclusion criteria. In the propensity score-matched analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio for suspected/confirmed COVID-19, confirmed COVID-19, and COVID-19 related mortality were 0.85 (95%CI 0.67, 1.08), 0.80 (95%CI 0.49, 1.30), and 0.87 (95%CI 0.34, 2.20) respectively. The negative outcome control analysis did not suggest unobserved confounding. CONCLUSION: Current prescription of metformin was not associated with the risk of COVID-19 or COVID-19 related mortality. It is safe to continue prescribing metformin to improve glycaemic control in patients with diabetes, despite concerns about an impending second wave of COVID-19.","Wang, Jingya; Cooper, Jennifer M; Gokhale, Krishna; Acosta-Mena, Dionisio; Dhalla, Samir; Byne, Nathan; Chandan, Joht Singh; Anand, Astha; Okoth, Kelvin; Subramanian, Anuradhaa; Bangash, Mansoor N; Jackson, Thomas; Zemedikun, Dawit; Taverner, Tom; Hanif, Wasim; Ghosh, Sandip; Narendran, Parth; Toulis, Konstantinos; Tahrani, Abd; Surenthirakumaran, Rajendira; Adderley, Nicola J; Haroon, Shamil; Khunti, Kamlesh; Sainsbury, Christopher; Thomas, G Neil; Nirantharakumar, Krishnarajah",J. clin. endocrinol. metab,,242

The potential of becoming infected can be reduced by a systematic and integrated approach that assesses infection risk. The latter leads to an acceptable choice of materials and techniques for personal protection and prevention of cross-contamination to other patients and staff. The authors have presented a protocolized approach that uses diagnostic criteria to clearly define benchmarks from the medical history along with clinical symptoms and laboratory tests. Patients can then be rapidly assigned into 1 of 3 risk categories that direct the choice of protective materials and/or techniques. Each hospital can adapt this approach to develop a system that fits its individual resources.

METHODS: Patients with clinical and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 that required a neurologic consultation or those who presented with neurological problems on admission that led to a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 2-month period at the peak of the pandemic were included in this study. Demographic and clinical variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were included. The presenting neurologic manifestations on admission led to the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 14 patients (40%). The most common reasons for consultation during the hospitalization period were stroke (11), encephalopathy (7), seizures (6), and neuropathies (5) followed by a miscellaneous of syncope (2), migraine (1), anosmia (1), critical illness myopathy (1), and exacerbation of residual dysarthria (1). The most common neurological disturbances were associated with severe disease except for neuropathies. Patients with encephalopathies and seizures had markedly increased D-dimer and ferritin values, even higher than stroke patients. RT-PCR was performed in 8 CSF samples and was negative in all of them. CONCLUSION: Neurological disturbances represent a significant and severe burden in COVID-19 patients, and they can be the presenting condition that leads to the diagnosis of the viral infection in a high percentage of patients. Evidence of direct viral mechanisms was scarce, but the pathogenesis of the diverse manifestations remains enigmatic.","García-Moncó, Juan Carlos; Cabrera-Muras, Antonio; Collía-Fernández, Alejandra; Erburu-Iriarte, Markel; Rodrigo-Armenteros, Patricia; Oyarzun-Irazu, Iñigo; Martínez-Condor, Daniel; Bilbao-González, Amaia; Carmona-Abellán, Mar; Caballero-Romero, Ivan; Gómez-Beldarrain, Marian",Neurol Sci,,242
405965,"Prognostic Genetic Markers for Thrombosis in COVID-19 Patients: A Focused Analysis on D-Dimer, Homocysteine and Thromboembolism",2020,"BACKGROUND: Compared to adults, there are relatively few studies on COVID-19 infection in children, and even less focusing on the unique features of COVID-19 in children in terms of laboratory findings, locations of computerized tomography (CT) lesions, and the role of CT in evaluating clinical recovery. The objective of this study is to report the results from patients at Wuhan Children's Hospital, located within the initial center of the outbreak. METHODS: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 76 children were collected retrospectively and analyzed with the Fisher exact test and Cox regression statistical methods. RESULTS: Among 50 children with a positive COVID-19 real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR), five had negative PCR results initially but showed positive results in subsequent tests. Eight (16%) patients had lymphopenia, seven (14%) with thrombocytopenia, four (8%) with lymphocytosis, two (4%) with thrombocytosis, ten (20%) with elevated C-reactive protein, four (8%) with hemoglobin above, and six (12%) with below standard reference values. Seven (14%) of the 50 had no radiologic evidence of disease on chest CT. For the 43 patients who had abnormal CT findings, in addition to previously reported patterns of ground-glass opacity (67%), local patchy shadowing (37%), local bilateral patchy shadowing (21%), and lesion location of lower lobes (65%), other CT features include that an overwhelming number of pediatric patients had lesions in the subpleural area (95%) and 22 of the 28 lower lobe lesions were in the posterior segment (78%). Lesions in most of the 15 patients (67%) who received chest CT at discharge were not completely absorbed, and 26% of these pediatric patients had CT lesions that were either unchanged or worse. CONCLUSIONS: There were a few differences between COVID-19 children and COVID-19 adults in terms of laboratory findings and CT characteristics. CT is a powerful tool to detect and characterize COVID-19 pneumonia but has little utility in evaluating clinical recovery for children. These results oppose current COVID-19 hospital discharge criteria in China, as one requirement is that pulmonary imaging must show significant lesion absorption prior to discharge. These differences between pediatric and adult cases of COVID-19 may necessitate pediatric-specific discharge criteria.","Ma, Huijing; Hu, Jiani; Tian, Jie; Zhou, Xi; Li, Hui; Laws, Maxwell Thomas; Wesemann, Luke David; Zhu, Baiqi; Chen, Wei; Ramos, Rafael; Xia, Jun; Shao, Jianbo",BMC Med,,242

This is partly ascribed to diminished CD8+ T-cell responses a result of aging. The phenotypical diversity of the CD8+ T-cell population has made it difficult to identify the impact of aging on CD8+ T-cell subsets associated with diminished CD8+ T-cell responses. Here we identify a novel human CD8+ T-cell subset characterized by expression of Killer-cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIR+ ) and CD45RA (RA+ ). These KIR+ RA+ T cells accumulated with age in the blood of healthy individuals (20-82 years of age, n = 50), expressed high levels of aging-related markers of T-cell regulation, and were functionally capable of suppressing proliferation of other CD8+ T cells. Moreover, KIR+ RA+ T cells were a major T-cell subset becoming activated in older adults suffering from an acute respiratory viral infection (n = 36), including coronavirus and influenza virus infection. In addition, older adults with influenza A infection showed that higher activation status of their KIR+ RA+ T cells associated with longer duration of respiratory symptoms. Together, our data indicate that KIR+ RA+ T cells are a unique human T-cell subset with regulatory properties that may explain susceptibility to viral respiratory disease at old age.","Pieren, Daan K J; Smits, Noortje A M; Hoeboer, Jeroen; Kandiah, Vinitha; Postel, Rimke J; Mariman, Rob; van Beek, Josine; van Baarle, Debbie; de Wit, Jelle; Guichelaar, Teun",Aging Cell,,242

In this study, we explore the potential of using data from Twitter for discovering problems with publications. In this case study, we analyzed tweet texts of three retracted publications about COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019)/SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and their retraction notices. We did not find early warning signs in tweet texts regarding one publication, but we did find tweets that casted doubt on the validity of the two other publications shortly after their publication date. An extension of our current work might lead to an early warning system that makes the scientific community aware of problems with certain publications. Other sources, such as blogs or post-publication peer-review sites, could be included in such an early warning system. The methodology proposed in this case study should be validated using larger publication sets that also include a control group, i.e., publications that were not retracted.","Haunschild, Robin; Bornmann, Lutz",Scientometrics,,242
409219,Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers and the Risk of Severe COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic led many jurisdictions to close in-person school instruction. METHODS: We collected data about COVID-19 cases associated with New York City (NYC) public schools from polymerase chain reaction testing performed in each school on a sample of asymptomatic students and staff and from routine reporting. We compared prevalence from testing done in schools to community prevalence estimates from statistical models. We compared cumulative incidence for school-associated cases to all cases reported to the city. School-based contacts were monitored to estimate the secondary attack rate and possible direction of transmission. RESULTS: To assess prevalence, we analyzed data from 234 132 persons tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in 1594 NYC public schools during October 9 to December 18, 2020; 986 (0.4%) tested positive. COVID-19 prevalence in schools was similar to or less than estimates of prevalence in the community for all weeks. To assess cumulative incidence, we analyzed data for 2231 COVID-19 cases that occurred in students and staff compared with the 86 576 persons in NYC diagnosed with COVID-19 during the same period; the overall incidence was lower for persons in public schools compared with the general community. Of 36 423 school-based close contacts, 191 (0.5%) subsequently tested positive for COVID-19; the likely index case was an adult for 78.0% of secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: We found that in-person learning in NYC public schools was not associated with increased prevalence or incidence overall of COVID-19 infection compared with the general community.","Varma, Jay K; Thamkittikasem, Jeff; Whittemore, Katherine; Alexander, Mariana; Stephens, Daniel H; Arslanian, Kayla; Bray, Jackie; Long, Theodore G",Pediatrics,,242

However, the profile of psychiatric symptoms among COVID-19 patients has been understudied. We performed a meta-analysis of studies assessing psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS patients and survivors by using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), an instrument covering a wide spectrum of psychiatric symptoms. Studies reporting SCL-90-R subscale scores among patients with and survivors of COVID-19 and SARS were retrieved from major English and Chinese literature databases. Patients' pooled SCL-90-R subscale scores were compared to the Chinese normative SCL-90-R data, and Cohen's d values were calculated to indicate the severity of psychiatric symptoms. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data was used to assess the quality of the included studies. The search yielded 25 Chinese studies with 1675 acute COVID-19 and 964 acute SARS patients, 30 COVID-19 and 552 SARS survivors during very early recovery (up to 1 month since discharge), 291 SARS survivors during early recovery (1-6 months after discharge), and 48 SARS survivors during late recovery (12 months after discharge). None of the included studies were rated as good quality. The ten SCL-90-R-defined psychiatric symptoms, which were of medium-to-severe severity (d = 0.68-3.01), were all exhibited in acute COVID-19 patients, and the severity of these symptoms decreased to mild-to-medium during very early recovery (d = 0.17-0.73). SARS patients presented eight psychiatric symptoms with mild-to-severe severity during the acute stage (d =0.43-1.88), and thereafter, the severity of symptoms decreased over the follow-up period. However, somatization (d = 0.30) and anxiety (d = 0.28) remained at mild levels during late recovery. A wide variety of severe psychiatric symptoms have been reported by acute COVID-19 patients, and these symptoms, despite decreasing in severity, persist in very early recovery. The changing trajectory observed with SARS suggests that psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19 may persist for a long time after discharge, and therefore, periodic monitoring of psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial support, and psychiatric treatment (when necessary) may be necessary for COVID-19 patients from the acute to convalescent stages.","Xie, Qin; Liu, Xiao-Bo; Xu, Yan-Min; Zhong, Bao-Liang",Transl Psychiatry,,242

Initial investigations indicate that patients with comorbidities are more fragile to this SARS-CoV-2 infection. They suggested postponing the routine treatment of cancer patients. However, few meta-analyses suggested evidences are not sufficient to hold the claim of the frailty of cancer patients to COVID-19, and they are not in favour of shelving the scheduled procedures. There are recent studies in which medical professionals, according to their competence, are referring to change the routine practices on how to manage the applicable therapeutic resources judiciously to combat this vital infection. This is a different study that reveals the cancer patients' viewpoint about how health care practices have been changed in their opinion during this pandemic year? Are they satisfied with their treatment or not? To serve the purpose, we gathered more than 60000 relevant tweets from Twitter to analyse the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings demonstrate that there is a surge in argument about cancer and its treatment after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the tweets are reasonable (52.6%) compared to the negative ones (24.3). We developed polarity and subjectivity distribution to better recognise the positivity/negativity in the sentiment. Results reveal that the polarity range of positive tweets is within the range of 0 to 0.5. Which means the tendency in the tweets is not so much positive but surely not negative. It is a piece of modest statistical evidence in support of how natural language processing (NLP) can be accepted to better understand the patient's behaviour in real-time, and it may facilitate the medical professional to make better decision to organise the routine management of cancer patients.","Ahmad, Bilal; Jun, Sun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12559v1.pdf,242

Prodynorphin (PDYN) is enriched in a subpopulation of striatal MSNs. Postmortem brains of HD patients and rodent models have been demonstrated to have reduced levels of PDYN transcripts and the neuropeptide dynorphin. METHODS: Given the unmet need for novel pharmacodynamic HD biomarkers in the context of experimental huntingtin (htt)-lowering therapies, we investigated the levels of PDYN-derived peptides and neurofilament light (NfL) chain in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from HD patients (n = 16), matched controls (n = 55), and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders (n = 70). RESULTS: PDYN-derived peptide levels were found to be substantially decreased in HD patients (P < 0.0001 in comparison to controls), whereas the NfL levels were elevated in all neurodegenerative disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests decreased PDYN-derived peptide levels in the CSF as a more specific biomarker for HD in comparison to NfL. © 2020 The Authors.

This article explores how risk for gender-based violence (GBV) has been exacerbated across the social-ecological model (SEM; e.g., by increasing economic stress and decreasing social support) and highlights differential impact across social locations (e.g., considering race, gender, social class). METHOD: Drawing on gender-based violence prevention and response research, considerations for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners are delineated. RESULTS: A comprehensive framework adapting an intersectional lens and the SEM is used to explain the changes in risk and protective factors for GBV. Policy recommendations that serve to augment (not replace) social distancing policies are proposed. CONCLUSION: The pandemic has uprooted life in a way that impacts GBV prevention and response. Yet, this is also an opportunity to define a new way forward rather than return to ""business as usual""; psychologists should strive to improve social services by utilizing the SEM and intersectionality.

It can be argued that a vaccine may be the most efficient way to contain the spread of this disease and prevent its future onset. While many attempts are being made to design and develop a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, pertinent technological hitches do exist. That is perhaps one of the reasons that we don't have vaccine for coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-1 and MERS). Recently developed CRISPR-mediated genome editing approach can be repurposed into a cell-modification endeavor in addition to (and rather than) correcting defective parts of genome. With this premise, B-cells can be engineered into universal donor, antigen specific, perpetually viable, long lasting, non-oncogenic, relatively benign, antibody producing cells which may serve as an effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 and, by the same rationale, other viruses and pathogens.","Faiq, Muneeb A",Med Hypotheses,,242

We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies and natural experiments investigating the relationship between COVID-19 lockdowns and mental health. A total of 25 studies involving 72 004 participants and 58 effect sizes were analyzed. Using a random effects model, we found that lockdowns had small effects on mental health symptoms, g = 0.17, s.e. = 0.05, 95% CI (0.06-0.24), p = 0.001, but the effects on positive psychological functioning, g = -0.12, s.e. = 0.11, 95% CI (-0.33 to 0.09), p = 0.27, were not significant. Multivariate analysis of effect sizes revealed significant and relatively small effect sizes for anxiety and depression, while those for social support, loneliness, general distress, negative affect, and suicide risk were not significant. The results indicated substantial heterogeneity among studies, but meta-regression analyses found no significant moderation effects for mean age, gender, continent, COVID-19 death rate, days of lockdown, publication status or study design. The psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdowns is small in magnitude and highly heterogeneous, suggesting that lockdowns do not have uniformly detrimental effects on mental health and that most people are psychologically resilient to their effects.","Prati, Gabriele; Mancini, Anthony D",Psychol Med,,242

Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths indicate immediately that countries like Italy and Spain had the worst situation as of mid-April, 2020, reported cases alone do not provide a complete picture of the situation. Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain a uniform, unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020. Using this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain Effective Potential Growth updated every day, providing an unbiased assessment of the countries at greater risk of experiencing an uncontrolled situation. The method developed has been and will be used to track possible improvements in the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.","Català, Martí; Pino, David; Marchena, Miquel; Palacios, Pablo; Urdiales, Tomás; Cardona, Pere-Joan; Alonso, Sergio; López-Codina, David; Prats, Clara; Alvarez-Lacalle, Enrique",PLoS One,,242

It is unknown whether anticoagulation can prevent these complications and improve outcome. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients on cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications and clinical outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 17 July 2020. After systematic analysis, eight studies were included. Analysis was stratified for the start of anticoagulation before or during hospital admission. RESULTS: There was insufficient evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation could improve the outcome in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. None of the studies demonstrated improved mortality, except for one very small Italian study. Furthermore, none of the studies showed a positive effect of anticoagulation on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy, except for two studies demonstrating an association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'low' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature showed that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of anticoagulation on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies. Randomised controlled studies are needed to answer this question.","Tieleman, R G; Klok, F A; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Schalkers, I; Jansen, C W; Siebelink, H J",Neth Heart J,,242

However, how SARS-CoV-2 alters the progression of chronic diseases remain unclear. Methods: We used adenovirus to deliver h-ACE2 to lung to enable SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. SARS-CoV-2's impacts on pathogenesis of chronic diseases were studied through histopathological, virologic and molecular biology analysis. Results: Pre-existing CVDs resulted in viral invasion, ROS elevation and activation of apoptosis pathways contribute myocardial injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral infection increased fasting blood glucose and reduced insulin response in DM model. Bone mineral density decreased shortly after infection, which associated with impaired PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Conclusion: We established mouse models mimicked the complex pathological symptoms of COVID-19 patients with chronic diseases. Pre-existing diseases could impair the inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which further aggravated the pre-existing diseases.

We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19-related vascular pathology. METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20-118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37-133]) later. Twenty-three states and New York City experienced excess cerebrovascular mortality during the pandemic height. A 10% increase in time spent at home was associated with a 4.3% increase in stroke deaths (incidence rate ratio, 1.043 [95% CI, 1.001-1.085]) after adjusting for COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Excess US cerebrovascular deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic were observed and associated with decreases in stroke-related EMS calls nationally and mobility at the state level. Public health measures are needed to identify and counter the reticence to seeking medical care for acute stroke during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Richa; Kuohn, Lindsey R; Weinberger, Daniel M; Warren, Joshua L; Sansing, Lauren H; Jasne, Adam; Falcone, Guido; Dhand, Amar; Sheth, Kevin N",Stroke,,242

Immune-mediated tissue damage could result from development of rapid autoimmune responses, characterized by production of self-reactive autoantibodies. In this study, we tested specimens from acutely ill patients hospitalized with COVID-19 for autoantibodies against nuclear, vasculitis-associated, and phospholipid antigens. Detectable autoantibodies were present in 30% of the patients in our cohort, with the majority of reactive specimens demonstrating antibodies to nuclear antigens. However, antinuclear antibodies were only weakly reactive and directed to single antigens, as is often seen during acute infection. We identified strongly reactive antibodies to nuclear antigens only in patients with a prior history of autoimmune disease. In our cohort, the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies was low, and we did not detect any vasculitis-associated autoantibodies. We found similar levels of inflammatory markers and total immunoglobulin levels in autoantibody positive versus negative patients, but anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were increased in autoantibody positive patients. Together, our results suggest that acute COVID-19 is not associated with a high prevalence of clinically significant autoantibody responses of the type usually associated with autoimmune rheumatic disease.","Lerma, L Angelica; Chaudhary, Anu; Bryan, Andrew; Morishima, Chihiro; Wener, Mark H; Fink, Susan L",J Transl Autoimmun,,242

After collection, all samples were transported to the hospital clinical laboratory within 24 h. These samples were tested on all five assays within 3 days of sample receipt. Of the 94 samples, 69 yielded the same result on all platforms, resulting in an agreement of 73.4% (69 of 94). Of these, 14 were the healthy control swabs which all tested negative, demonstrating good specificity across all platforms. The ARIES assay had the lowest detection rate (68.8%), followed by Fortitude (85.0%), RealStar (86.3%), cobas (95.0%), and TaqPath (100%). Statistically significant differences were observed for ARIES, Fortitude, and RealStar when compared against the best performing TaqPath using McNemar's &#967;2 test. A consensus result was established based on the results obtained by the cobas, Fortitude, RealStar, and TaqPath. Six discrepancies had failed to reach a consensus and were adjudicated using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the TaqPath and cobas assays were the most sensitive at detecting their designated SARS-CoV-2 gene targets. On the other hand, the ARIES assay was the least sensitive, thus warranting the need for assay re-optimization before go-live at the testing laboratory.","Lee, Chun Kiat; Tham, Jason Wei Ming; Png, Siyu; Chai, Chean Nee; Ng, Shu Chi; Tan, Eunice Jia Min; Ng, Li Jie; Chua, Rui Ping; Sani, Musa; Seow, Yiqi; Yan, Gabriel; Tang, Julian",J. med. virol,,242

This variant is believed to be more transmissible, with all attention being given to its spike mutations. However, VOC-202012/01 has also a mutation (Q27stop) that truncates the ORF8, a likely immune evasion protein. Removal of ORF8 changes the clinical outset of the disease, which may affect the virus transmissibility. Here I provide a detailed analysis of all reported ORF8-deficient lineages found in the background of relevant spike mutations, identified among 231,433 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. I found 19 ORF8 nonsense mutations, most of them occurring in the 5' half of the gene. The ORF8-deficient lineages were rare, representing 0.67% of sequenced genomes. Nevertheless, I identified two clusters of related sequences that emerged recently and spread in different countries. The widespread D614G spike mutation was found in most ORF-deficient lineages. Although less frequent, HV69-70del and L5F spike mutations occurred in the background of six different ORF8 nonsense mutations. I also confirmed that VOC-202012/01 is the ORF8-deficient variant with more spike mutations reported to date, although other variants could have up to six spike mutations, some of putative biological relevance. Overall, these results suggest that monitoring ORF8-deficient lineages is important for the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when associated with relevant spike mutations.","Pereira, Filipe",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,242
418382,Outcomes of Patients with Sarcoma and COVID-19 Infection: A Single Institution Cohort Analysis,2021,"In much of the developing world, severe malnutrition is the most prevalent cause of immunodeficiency and affects up to 50% of the population in some impoverished communities. As yet, we do not know how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will behave in populations with immunodeficiency caused by malnourishment. Interestingly, researchers are now speculating that, in some instances, a defective cellular immune system could paradoxically be a protective factor against severe disease in certain patients contracting SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This could be linked to the absence of T-cell activation. Based on available information presented here, it is plausible that the hyperimmune response, and subsequent cytokine storm often associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), could be ""counteracted"" by the defective immune response seen in individuals with malnutrition-induced leptin deficiency. In this paper, we proposed a theory that although those with malnutrition-linked leptin deficiency are at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, they are at lower risk of developing severe COVID-19.","Schoeman, Dewald; Fielding, Burtram C",MSphere,,242

Drawing on evidence from neuroscience, physiology, microbiology, and psychology, we articulate how and why exposure to greenspaces could improve pain outcomes and reduce the high global burden of pain. Greenspace exposure potentially provides opportunities to benefit from known or proposed health-enhancing components of nature, such as environmental microbiomes, phytoncides, negative air ions, sunlight, and the sights and sounds of nature itself. We review the established and potential links between these specific exposures and pain outcomes.

With implementation of telehealth, a cystic fibrosis (CF) pharmacist was able to incorporate a virtual medication tour during appointments. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to describe the uptake and impact of pharmacist-led virtual medication tours during telehealth visits in the CF clinic setting. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a CF pharmacist participated in in-person multidisciplinary team visits to complete medication history reconciliation, assess adherence, assess efficacy and address possible adverse effects of medications, and work collaboratively with the CF care team and patient to create therapeutic plans. The virtual medication tour described in this study was completed in addition or as a complement to these pre-existing pharmacist roles and responsibilities. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Patients seen via telehealth visit were asked to provide a virtual tour of their medications. A pharmacist completed medication history and evaluated whether storage conditions were appropriate in regard to temperature, humidity, light exposure, and accessibility to children. EVALUATION METHODS: A pharmacist recorded findings from the virtual medication tours and made interventions when appropriate. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. RESULTS: Of 20 patients seen via telehealth for a quarterly visit during the first 3 months after implementation, 13 were willing to participate in a virtual medication tour. Before the visit, 25% had information missing from their medication list. Virtual medication tour allowed for resolution of this information 80% of the time. Three of the 4 participating patients with a child under 12 years old had medications stored in a location accessible to children. CONCLUSION: A virtual medication tour led by a pharmacist can be successfully incorporated into telehealth visits and was accepted by a majority of patients.

METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective observational clinical trial we examined a cohort of 80 patients with proof of acute respiratory infection and divided them into a COVID-19 cohort (n = 54) and a control cohort (n = 26). KIM-1 and NAG were measured from urine samples collected in the emergency department. We assessed the development of AKI, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and intrahospital death as clinical endpoints. Urinary KIM-1 and NAG were not significantly different between patients with SARS-CoV-2 and those with other respiratory infections (each p = n.s.). Eight patients from the COVID-19 cohort and five of the non-COVID-19-patients suffered from acute kidney injury during their stay. Nine COVID-19 patients and two non-COVID-19 patients were admitted to the ICU. KIM-1 was significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with, compared to those without AKI (p = 0.005), as opposed to NAG and creatinine (each p = n.s.). Furthermore, KIM-1 was significantly elevated in the patients with COVID-19 that had to be transferred to the ICU (p = 0.015), in contrast to NAG and creatinine (each p = n.s.).

This has led to more follow ups being done remotely. Meanwhile, with the development of 4G/5G networks, smartphones, and novel devices, remote programming has become possible. Here, we investigated the demand and utility of remote follow-ups including remote programming for SCS for patients with chronic pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire including questions on demographic characteristics, pain history, postimplantation life quality, standard follow-up experience, remote follow-up, and remote programming experience was sent to patients diagnosed as chronic intractable pain and treated with SCS during January 2019 to January 2020. RESULTS: A total of 64 participants completed the questionnaire. About 70% of participants expressed demands for remote follow-ups due to the inconvenience, high costs, and time consumption of traditional follow-up visits. Nearly 97% of participants have attempted remote follow-ups, and about 81% of participants have further tried remote programming. Approximately, 96% of them recognized the benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The remote programming was in high demand among participants. Most of the participants have tried remote follow-ups or even remote programming. The remote programming appeared to be more efficient, economic and were widely recognized among participants.","Han, Yan; Lu, Yang; Wang, Dengyu; Ran, Mingshan; Ren, Qidong; Xie, Duo; Aziz, Tipu Z; Li, Luming; Wang, James Jin",Neuromodulation,,242

However, it remains challenging to fabricate hand manipulatable cellular polymer nanofilms for use as self-standing structural materials. Herein, we used a sequential planar extension approach to transform low-entanglement ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) gel films dispersed in porogenic polyethylene oligomers into cellular nanofilms consisting of stretch-dominated triangular cells of molecularly anisotropic cell edges. The microstructure afforded the cellular nanofilm, which had a thickness down to 20 nm, with a unique combination of ultratransparency (>98.5%), ultrahigh in-plane tensile strength (1071 MPa.cm^3.g^(-1)), and ultrahigh flexibility: a 43 nm thick film can deflect reversibly up to 8.0 mm in depth (185,000 times) under a spherical indentation load. As an application, we fabricated the nanofilm into a freestanding ultratransparent respiratory face covering. The new polyethylene cellular nanofilms are expected to represent a new class of platform membranes for advancing fundamental and technological development.","Gao, Ping; Gu, Qiao; Li, Jin; Li, Runlai; Zhang, Qinghua; Weng, Lu-tao; Zhao, Tianshou; Yu, T.

424371,The Appropriateness of Invasive Ventilation in COVID-19 Positive Cancer Patients: Proposal of a New Prognostic Score,2021,"Droplet microfluidics has become a powerful tool in precision medicine, green biotechnology, and cell therapy for single-cell analysis and selection by virtue of its ability to effectively confine cells. However, there remains a fundamental trade-off between droplet volume and sorting throughput, limiting the advantages of droplet microfluidics to small droplets (<10 pl) that are incompatible with long-term maintenance and growth of most cells. We present a sequentially addressable dielectrophoretic array (SADA) sorter to overcome this problem. The SADA sorter uses an on-chip array of electrodes activated and deactivated in a sequence synchronized to the speed and position of a passing target droplet to deliver an accumulated dielectrophoretic force and gently pull it in the direction of sorting in a high-speed flow. We use it to demonstrate large-droplet sorting with ~20-fold higher throughputs than conventional techniques and apply it to long-term single-cell analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on their growth rate.","Isozaki, A; Nakagawa, Y; Loo, M H; Shibata, Y; Tanaka, N; Setyaningrum, D L; Park, J-W; Shirasaki, Y; Mikami, H; Huang, D; Tsoi, H; Riche, C T; Ota, T; Miwa, H; Kanda, Y; Ito, T; Yamada, K; Iwata, O; Suzuki, K; Ohnuki, S; Ohya, Y; Kato, Y; Hasunuma, T; Matsusaka, S; Yamagishi, M; Yazawa, M; Uemura, S; Nagasawa, K; Watarai, H; Di Carlo, D; Goda, K",Sci.

425105,Distinct effects of asthma and COPD comorbidity on disease expression and outcome in patients with COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE: Noninvasive image guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) is a novel approach to delivery of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) that may hold advantages over established techniques. NIBB is not invasive but maintains a high level of precision by using breast immobilization via breast compression and image guidance; it therefore does not require large planning tumor volume margins. We present the primary outcomes of this prospective phase 2 study (BrUOG Br-251). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients with early-stage breast cancer underwent NIBB APBI using a dose 34 Gy in 10 fractions delivered daily or twice a day. Treatment was delivered using an Ir-192 high-dose-rate source via specialized applicators. Two orthogonal treatment axes were used for each fraction. The primary endpoints were late toxicity and cosmesis assessed at 2 and 5 years. Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. Cosmesis was assessed using the NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was defined as any recurrence or new primary in the treated breast. RESULTS: Forty patients underwent protocol treatment. Median patient age was 68 years (50-92 years). Mean tumor size was 1.1 cm (0.3-3.0 cm). Among the cohort, 62.5% had invasive carcinoma and 37.5% had ductal carcinoma in situ. Thirty-nine percent elected to receive hormone therapy. No grade &#8805;3 late toxicities were observed at any time point. Grade 2 toxicity was 5% and 10% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Telangiectasia grade 1 and 2 occurred in 27.5% and 5%, respectively. Breast separation of >7 cm was associated with telangiectasia (P < .01). The rate of good to excellent cosmetic outcome was 95% at 2 years and 100% at 5 years. With a median follow-up of 68 months, the actuarial 5-year freedom from ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 93.3% (±4.8%), and overall survival was 93.7% (±4.4%). CONCLUSIONS: NIBB to deliver APBI is well tolerated with a low incidence of significant late toxicity and has favorable cosmetic outcomes. Continued evaluation of the NIBB APBI technique in a larger cohort is warranted.","Hepel, Jaroslaw T; Leonard, Kara L; Sha, Sandra; Graves, Theresa A; Wiggins, Doreen L; Mastras, Dean; Pittier, Ann; Wazer, David E",Int. j. radiat. oncol. biol. phys,,242

425150,Higher viral loads in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients might be the invisible part of the iceberg,2020,"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-associated disease (coronavirus disease 2019) poses a unique challenge to health- care providers due to the risk of viral aerosolization and disease transmission. This has caused some centers to modify existing CPR procedures, limit the duration of CPR, or consider avoiding CPR altogether. In this review, the authors propose a procedure for CPR in the intensive care unit that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protective equipment. Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high-risk patients may prompt patients to decline CPR. The authors recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high-risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow for medication delivery from outside the patients' rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay. The use of a mechanical compression system for CPR further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health- care providers. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be reserved for patients with few comorbidities and a single failing organ system. Reliable teleconferencing tools are essential to facilitate communication between providers inside and outside the patients' rooms. General principles regarding the ethics and peri-resuscitative management of coronavirus 2019 patients also are discussed.","Cheruku, Sreekanth; Dave, Siddharth; Goff, Kristina; Park, Caroline; Ebeling, Callie; Cohen, Leah; Styrvoky, Kim; Choi, Christopher; Anand, Vikram; Kershaw, Corey",J Cardiothorac Vasc Anesth,,242

Testing will remain an important tool to mitigate the effects of this pandemic as early and accurate diagnosis can lead to appropriate countermeasures to reduce mortality and morbidity. However, testing isn't a simple yes/no answer as the target and host are complex, the virus is a moving target, there is a plethora of tests that identify different parts of the virus and have their own limits and range of detection, and when prevalence is low, false positives and negatives can be very high.Areas covered: This article covers all the major questions related to COVID-19 diagnostics, the why, when, where, who, what and how of testing, the different types of tests, interpretation of results and the ideal ASSURED-SQVM diagnostic. A comprehensive literature review using all the publicly available databases and government websites and reports was performed.Expert opinion: Diagnostics that meet the 'ASSURED-SQVM' (Affordable, Selective and Sensitive, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, Equipment-free, Deliverable to end-users and additionally, allows for Self-testing, Quantifiable, detects if pathogens are Viable and can detect Multiple pathogens) would make a major impact in our fight against the current pandemic. While a significant majority of researchers focus on developing novel diagnostics that are highly selective and sensitive, it is the opinion of these authors that other aspects of the ASSURED-SQVM principles also be considered early in the development process for widespread use.","Kumar, Mukesh; Iyer, Suri S",Expert Rev Mol Diagn,,242

Data collected mainly from the survey of 25 industry players on their views on the Malaysian government’s stimulus packages, announcements and reports. Analysis of the findings serves as the basis for deriving the viewpoints and reflections of this paper. The result shows that most interviewees welcome a six-month wage subsidy program, bank loan instalment moratorium and company tax deferment. Respondents commented that tax incentives on certain expenses are not as beneficial as that spending is luxurious. Feedback shows a delay in receiving the subsidies by some respondents and concerns on their ability to pay tax and loan instalments in the future when the government lifted the incentives as they expect a longer time is needed to boost demand. From the positive impacts, respondents viewed optimistically the Malaysian government’s stimulus packages and complimented that as one of the best government strategies. © 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional survey study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the obstetrics and gynecology residency training program in Italy. An online survey with 45 questions was sent and completed anonymously by residents after accepting an informed consent. The invitation to the online survey was sent to all the Italian residents in obstetrics and gynecology. Those on maternity leave at the time of the study were excluded. Residents were asked about their routinely activity before the COVID-19 pandemic, and to report the reduction in their clinical practice. They were also asked about psychological impact of COVID-19 on their clinical practice. RESULTS: 933 Italian residents in obstetrics and gynecology, were invited for this survey study. Four-hundred and seventy-six (51 %) completed the survey and were included in the study. Three-hundred and eighty-seven (81.3 %) were female, and 89 (18.7 %) were male. Residents age ranged from 25 to 42. In 71,8 % (342/476) of the cases residents work in a COVID-19 reference Hospitals. One-hundred and eighty-four out of 76 residents (38.6 %) were tested on RT-PCR assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, and of them 12/184 (6.5 %) were positive to SARS-COV-2. Regarding the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), 267 (56.1 %) reported to receive adequate device, and 379 (79.6 %) felt to be well informed about prevention and management protocols. Three-hundred and thirty-one residents (69.5 %) reported to have managed COVID-19 positive patients. For 54,7 % of respondent residents, training activity in general decreased significantly during the COVID-19 epidemic. A one-third reduction was reported in 31,4 % of the cases, whereas a total suspension of the training in 9,9 % of the cases. In 89,3 % of cases the reduction was caused by the reorganization of work. Anxiety about the professional future was reported in 84 % of the residents, and 59 % of them had the perception that their training was irreversibly compromised. CONCLUSIONS: Among Italian residents in obstetrics and gynecology, COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant training impairment.","Bitonti, Giovanna; Palumbo, Anna Rita; Gallo, Cinzia; Rania, Erika; Saccone, Gabriele; De Vivo, Valentino; Zullo, Fulvio; Di Carlo, Costantino; Venturella, Roberta",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,242

In this article, we consider the general place of soft law in administrative law in England & Wales and the broad regulatory framework, including soft law, that governs the COVID-19 pandemic. This allows us to take a deep dive into COVID-19 and the criminal justice system, showing how the senior judiciary relied predominately on soft law (judicial guidance and protocols) to manage the system (set against the backdrop of targeted legislation and a limited number of Practice Directions, which have the force of law). We argue that the senior judiciary's approach to the use of COVID-19 soft law has, in many ways, been more effective than that taken by the government. Yet there remains room for improvement, particularly in the nature of the judicial guidance issued and about what guidance was in place and when. ©","Sorabji, J.; Vaughan, S.",European Journal of Risk Regulation,,242
431070,CT scan chest findings in symptomatic COVID-19 patients: A reliable alternative for diagnosis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: As COVID-19 is a new emerging disease, the hematological/immunological changes that develop in the infected patients remain unknown. This study aims to systematically review the hematologic autoimmune complications in these patients. METHOD: Data from three online databases including Medline (via PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science were searched on 19 December 2020, and after excluding duplicate, irrelevant and inappropriate records, eligible documents were identified. Afterwards, information such as patients' history, presentations, paraclinical data, treatment course and outcome were extracted from the records. RESULTS: A total of 58 documents were considered to be eligible for data extraction which described 94 patients with COVID-19 who developed hematologic autoimmune disorder in their course of infection. Of these patients with COVID-19, the most common hematologic autoimmune disorder was immune thrombocytopenic purpura (55 cases) followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (22 cases). Other hematologic autoimmune disorders include antiphospholipid syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Evans syndrome and autoimmune neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The current study would help us to always consider an autoimmune etiology for cases with abnormal hematologic finding which further lead to an appropriate treatment of the patients, especially when the symptoms present in about 1-2 weeks after the first manifestation of the infection symptoms. Maybe, at least in this pandemic, it should be recommended to evaluate patients with unexpected and unexplained decrease in their hemoglobulin or platelet count for COVID-19. Another challenging issue is the treatment options. Given the multiorgan involvement and multifaceted nature of the infection, an individualized approach should be taken for each patient.","Taherifard, Erfan; Taherifard, Ehsan; Movahed, Hamed; Mousavi, Mohammad Reza",Hematology,,242

431956,Commentary: Retinal manifestations in patients following COVID-19 infection: A consecutive case series,2021,"In this study we document the unexpected discovery of multiple coronaviruses and a BSL-3 pathogen in agricultural cotton and rice sequencing datasets. In particular, we have identified a novel HKU5-related Merbecovirus in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2017. We have also found an infectious clone sequence containing a novel HKU4-related Merbecovirus related to MERS coronavirus in a rice dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in early 2020. Another HKU5-related Merbecovirus, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus, were identified in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2018. An HKU3-related Betacoronavirus was found in a Mus musculus sequencing dataset from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2017. Finally, a SARS-WIV1-like Betacoronavirus was found in a rice dataset sequenced by the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in 2017. Using the contaminating reads we have extracted from the above datasets, we were able to assemble complete genomes of two novel coronaviruses which we disclose herein. In light of our findings, we raise concerns about biosafety protocol breaches, as indicated by our discovery of multiple dangerous human pathogens in agricultural sequencing laboratories in Wuhan and Fouzou City, China.","Zhang, Daoyu; Jones, Adrian; Deigin, Yuri; Sirotkin, Karl; Sousa, Alejandro",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01533v2.pdf,242

METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study assessing 254 Portuguese adults (82.7% women; 35.82 ± 11.82 years) 1 week after the end of the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. An online survey was conducted to evaluate psychological distress, disordered eating, and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations and Structural Equation Modeling were performed. RESULTS: Participants reported the presence of meal skipping (52.8%), grazing eating behavior (80.9%), overeating (81.0%), loss of control over eating (47.2%), and binge eating episodes (39.2%) during lockdown. Structural equation modeling analyses, controlling for age and sex, indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of the experienced psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors mediated through psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis may lead to disordered eating, and this relation may occur through the elevation of psychological distress. These findings can be used to inform interventions, to enhance mental health and manage disordered eating during similar future situations.

432071,Are statins safe in patients with COVID-19?,2020,"Covid-19 is a very serious deadly disease that has been announced as a pandemic by the world health organization (WHO). The whole world is working with all its might to end Covid-19 pandemic, which puts countries in serious health and economic problems, as soon as possible. The most important of these is to correctly identify those who get the Covid-19. Methods and approaches to support the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test have begun to take place in the literature. In this study, chest X-ray images, which can be accessed easily and quickly, were used because the covid-19 attacked the respiratory systems. Classification performances with support vector machines have been obtained by using the features extracted with residual networks (ResNet-50), one of the convolutional neural network models, from these images. While Covid-19 detection is obtained with support vector machines (SVM)-quadratic with the highest sensitivity value of 9635% with the 5 -fold cross-validation method, the highest overall performance value has been detected with both SVM-quadratic and SVM-cubic above 99%. According to these high results, it is thought that this method, which has been studied, will help radiology specialists and reduce the rate of false detection.","Narin, A.; Ieee,",2020 Medical Technologies Congress,,242

We hypothesized that this treatment strategy could lead to satisfying results in selected patients after preoperative microorganism isolation. METHODS: Ten patients underwent cementless one-stage revision hip arthroplasty with antibacterial hydrogel coating for the treatment of an infected THA. Inclusion criteria were: the presence of a known organism with known sensitivity, patients non-immunocompromised with healthy soft tissues with minimal or moderate bone loss. Mean age at surgery was 69.4 years. Assessment included objective examination, Harris hip score, visual analog scale pain score, standard X-rays. RESULTS: At a mean follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 2-5 years), none of the patients had clinical or radiographic signs suggesting recurrent infection. Follow-up examination showed significant improvement of all variables compared to pre-operative values (p < 0.05). Radiographs did not show progressive radiolucent lines or change in the position of the implant. CONCLUSIONS: One-stage revision THA with antibacterial hydrogel coated implants represents a safe and effective procedure providing infection eradication and satisfying subjective functional outcomes in selected patients.","Pellegrini, Antonio; Legnani, Claudio",Int J Artif Organs,,242

436268,"Cell-based therapies for COVID-19: A living, systematic review",2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had a massive impact on public health, resulting in sudden dietary and behavioral habit changes. Frontline epidemic prevention workers play a pivotal role against COVID-19. They must face high-risk infection conditions, insufficient anti-epidemic material supplies, mental pressure, and so on. COVID-19 seriously affects their dietary and behavioral habits, and poor habits make them more susceptible to COVID-19. However, their baseline dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of COVID-19 remain unclear for these workers in China. This study aimed to explore the baseline dietary and behavioral habits of frontline workers and their willingness to change these habits after the outbreak of the epidemic; in addition, susceptible subgroups were identified by stratified analyses as targets of protective measures to keep them from being infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online questionnaire using a sample of 22,459 valid individuals living in China, including 9402 frontline epidemic prevention workers. RESULTS: Before COVID-19, 23.9% of the frontline epidemic prevention workers reported a high-salt diet, 46.9% of them reported a high frequency of fried foods intake, and 50.9% of them smoked cigarettes. After the outbreak of COVID-19, 34.6% of them expressed a willingness to reduce salt intake, and 43.7% of them wanted to reduce the frequency of pickled vegetables intake. A total of 37.9% of them expressed a willingness to decrease or quit smoking, and 44.5% of them wanted to increase sleep duration. Significant differences in the baseline dietary and behavioral habits and the willingness to change their habits were observed between frontline epidemic prevention workers and other participants. Among the frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19, frontline epidemic prevention experience was a promoting factor for adopting worse dietary and behavioral habits, including those in the high-salt intake subgroup (OR, 2.824; 95% CI, 2.341-3.405) and the 11-20 cigarettes/day subgroup (OR, 2.067; 95% CI, 1.359-3.143). CONCLUSIONS: The dietary and behavioral habits of frontline epidemic prevention workers were worse than that those of other participants before COVID-19. They had a greater willingness to adopt healthy dietary and behavioral habits after experiencing the outbreak of COVID-19. However, frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor dietary and behavioral habits before COVID-19 continued in engage in these poor habits. Dietary and behavioral intervention policies should be drafted to protect their health, especially frontline epidemic prevention workers with poor habits at baseline.","Yu, Weijun; Xu, Ying; Zhang, Jianhua; Yuan, Qing; Guo, Yanfang; Li, Zhixue; He, Xiangyang; Ma, Yan; Cai, Fengmin; Liu, Zheng; Zhao, Rencheng; Wang, Dewang; Chen, Jialong; Guo, Quanwei",Environ Health Prev Med,,242

No specific treatment and vaccine with documented safety and efficacy for the disease have been established. Hence it is of utmost importance to identify more therapeutics such as Chinese medicine formulae to meet the urgent need. Qing Fei Pai Du Tang (QFPDT), a Chinese medicine formula consisting of 21 herbs from five classical formulae has been reported to be efficacious on COVID-19 in 10 provinces in mainland China. QFPDT could prevent the progression from mild cases and shorten the average duration of symptoms and hospital stay. It has been recommended in the 6th and 7th versions of Clinical Practice Guideline on COVID-19 in China. The basic scientific studies, supported by network pharmacology, on the possible therapeutic targets of QFPDT and its constituent herbs including Ephedra sinica, Bupleurum chinense, Pogostemon cablin, Cinnamomum cassia, Scutellaria baicalensis were reviewed. The anti-oxidation, immuno-modulation and antiviral mechanisms through different pathways were collated. Two clusters of actions identified were cytokine storm prevention and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding regulation. The multi-target mechanisms of QFPDT for treating viral infection in general and COVID-19 in particular were validated. While large scale clinical studies on QFPDT are being conducted in China, one should use real world data for exploration of integrative treatment with inclusion of pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and herb-drug interaction studies.","Zhong, Linda Li Dan; Lam, Wai Ching; Yang, Wei; Chan, Kam Wa; Sze, Stephen Cho Wing; Miao, Jiangxia; Yung, Ken Kin Lam; Bian, Zhaoxiang; Wong, Vivian Taam",Am J Chin Med,,242

438511,Acute Aortic Thrombosis Revealing a COVID-19 Infection,2020,"BACKGROUND: The possibility of psychopathological symptoms and related risk factors among normal persons and patients infected during the outbreak of COVID-19 has been widely investigated. The mental health outcomes of the second wave of the pandemic remain unclear, especially those of patients with an infection. Thus, this study aims to explore the prevalence of and related risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms among patients infected with COVID-19 during the second wave. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five isolated wards of a designated hospital in Beijing, China, from July 1 to July 15, 2020. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) was conducted to assess psychiatric disorders, and a series of scales were used to measure self-reported psychopathological symptoms and psychosomatic factors. Multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors associated with psychopathological symptoms. RESULTS: Among 119 participants with infections, the prevalence of generalized anxiety symptoms (51.3%), depressive symptoms (41.2%), and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS)/posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (33.6%) was observed. Loneliness, hope, coping strategies, and history of mental disorders were the shared risk or protective factors across several psychopathological symptoms. The perceived impact of COVID-19 is the specific risk factor associated with state anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSS/PTSD is high among patients with infections during the second wave of the pandemic in Beijing. Clinical doctors must realize that these patients will probably experience depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and PTSS/PTSD, as well as some neuropsychiatric syndromes. Specific mental health care is urgently required to help patients manage the virus during the second wave of the pandemic.","Zhang, Zhiyang; Feng, Yi; Song, Rui; Yang, Di; Duan, Xuefei",Global Health,,242
439591,Urine Cytokines as biomarkers in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"COVID-19 has a clear sex disparity in clinical outcome. Globally, infection rates between men and women are similar; however, men are more likely to have more severe disease and are more likely to die. The causes for this disparity are currently under investigation and are most likely multifactorial. Sex hormones play an important role in the immune response with estrogen seen as immune boosting and testosterone as immunosuppressing. Additionally, an important protease involved in viral entry, TMPRSS2, is regulated by androgens. Many observational and prospective studies are ongoing or initiating to further examine the role of sex hormones in SARS-CoV-2 infection and if modulation of them is a realistic treatment option.","Strope, Jonathan D; Chau, Cindy H; Figg, William D",Semin Oncol,,242

440731,COVID-19 Associated Coagulopathy in the Setting of Underlying Malignancy,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic causing global health problem. We provide estimates of the daily trend in the size of the epidemic in Wuhan based on detailed information of 10 940 confirmed cases outside Hubei province. METHODS: In this modelling study, we first estimate the epidemic size in Wuhan from 10 January to 5 April 2020 with a newly proposed model, based on the confirmed cases outside Hubei province that left Wuhan by 23 January 2020 retrieved from official websites of provincial and municipal health commissions. Since some confirmed cases have no information on whether they visited Wuhan before, we adjust for these missing values. We then calculate the reporting rate in Wuhan from 20 January to 5 April 2020. Finally, we estimate the date when the first infected case occurred in Wuhan. RESULTS: We estimate the number of cases that should be reported in Wuhan by 10 January 2020, as 3229 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3139-3321) and 51 273 (95% CI: 49 844-52 734) by 5 April 2020. The reporting rate has grown rapidly from 1.5% (95% CI: 1.5-1.6%) on 20 January 2020, to 39.1% (95% CI: 38.0-40.2%) on 11 February 2020, and increased to 71.4% (95% CI: 69.4-73.4%) on 13 February 2020, and reaches 97.6% (95% CI: 94.8-100.3%) on 5 April 2020. The date of first infection is estimated as 30 November 2019. CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak, the testing capacity of Wuhan was insufficient. Clinical diagnosis could be a good complement to the method of confirmation at that time. The reporting rate is very close to 100% now and there are very few cases since 17 March 2020, which might suggest that Wuhan is able to accommodate all patients and the epidemic has been controlled.","Lin, Qiu-Shi; Hu, Tao-Jun; Zhou, Xiao-Hua",Infect Dis Poverty,,242

441410,[Thrombus in transit in patient with COVID-19 pneumonia],2020,"BACKGROUND: The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of pregnant and lactating women is unclear. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health, sexual function, and quality of life (QoL) in Iranian pregnant and lactating women and compare the results with non-pregnant/non-lactating women. METHOD: This comparative cross-sectional study was carried out on pregnant and lactating women, with non-pregnant/non-lactating women from May to Jun 2020. Patients were asked to complete three questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). One-way ANOVA was used to reveal the statistical differences between the three groups. RESULT: The mean age of patients was 20.81 ± 5.92 years old. The mean (SD) score of HADS in pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant / non-lactating women were 12.11 (6.72), 11.98 (8.44) and 9.38 (6.2) respectively, and the results showed that the scores in pregnant, lactating women were higher than non-pregnant / non-lactating women (P < 0.001). Also the mean (SD) score of QOL and FSFI was 68.29 (9.47), 74.18 (12.65), 79.03 (10.48) and 22.71 (8.16), 22.72 (8.16), 26.19 (3.93) in three groups and the scores in pregnant, lactating women were lower than non-pregnant/non-lactating women (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 epidemic increases the risk of depression, anxiety, FSD, and lowers QoL in pregnant and lactating women, with the general population. This suggests the urgent need for psychological intervention in the maternal population during the epidemic.","Mirzaei, Negin; Jahanian Sadatmahalleh, Shahideh; Bahri Khomami, Mahnaz; Moini, Ashraf; Kazemnejad, Anoshirvan",Health Qual Life Outcomes,,242

442336,Anormal pulmonary function and residual CT abnormalities in rehabilitating COVID-19 patients after discharge,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused unprecedented pressure on public health and healthcare. The pandemic surge and resultant lockdown have affected the standard-of-care of many medical conditions and diseases. The initial uncertainty and fear of cross transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have changed the routine management of patients with pre-existing liver diseases, hepatocellular carcinoma, and patients either listed for or received a liver transplant. COVID-19 is best described as a multisystem disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, and it can cause acute liver injury or decompensation of the pre-existing liver disease. There has been considerable research on the pathophysiology, infection transmission, and treatment of COVID-19 in the last few months. The pathogenesis of liver involvement in COVID-19 includes viral cytotoxicity, the secondary effect of immune dysregulation, hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure, ischemic damage caused by vascular endotheliitis, congestion because of right heart failure, or drug-induced liver injury. Patients with chronic liver diseases, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma are at high risk for severe COVID-19 and mortality. The phase III trials of recently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 did not include enough patients with pre-existing liver diseases and excluded immunocompromised patients or those on immunomodulators. This article reviews the currently published research on the effect of COVID-19 on the liver and the management of patients with pre-existing liver disease, including SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.","Nasa, P.; Alexander, G.",World Journal of Hepatology,,242
442362,Specific Susceptibility to COVID-19 in Adults with Down Syndrome,2021,"Currently, there are four seasonal coronaviruses associated with relatively mild respiratory tract disease in humans. However, there is also a plethora of animal coronaviruses which have the potential to cross the species border. This regularly results in the emergence of new viruses in humans. In 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged and rapidly disappeared in May 2003. In 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as a possible threat to humans, but its pandemic potential so far is minimal, as human-to-human transmission is ineffective. The end of 2019 brought us information about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emergence, and the virus rapidly spread in 2020, causing an unprecedented pandemic. At present, studies on the virus are carried out using a surrogate system based on the immortalized simian Vero E6 cell line. This model is convenient for diagnostics, but it has serious limitations and does not allow for understanding of the biology and evolution of the virus. Here, we show that fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures constitute an excellent model to study infection with the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We observed efficient replication of the virus in the tissue, with maximal replication at 2 days postinfection. The virus replicated in ciliated cells and was released apically.IMPORTANCE Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged by the end of 2019 and rapidly spread in 2020. At present, it is of utmost importance to understand the biology of the virus, rapidly assess the treatment potential of existing drugs, and develop new active compounds. While some animal models for such studies are under development, most of the research is carried out in Vero E6 cells. Here, we propose fully differentiated human airway epithelium cultures as a model for studies on SARS-CoV-2.","Milewska, Aleksandra; Kula-Pacurar, Anna; Wadas, Jakub; Suder, Agnieszka; Szczepanski, Artur; Dabrowska, Agnieszka; Owczarek, Katarzyna; Marcello, Alessandro; Ochman, Marek; Stacel, Tomasz; Rajfur, Zenon; Sanak, Marek; Labaj, Pawel; Branicki, Wojciech; Pyrc, Krzysztof",J. virol,,242
443221,The Impact of COVID-19 on Elective Cardiovascular Procedures in Taiwan - A Single-Center Experience,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is limited information describing the presenting characteristics and outcomes of patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) requiring hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). AIMS: We aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 SCZ patients with those of non-SCZ patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 4 AP-HM/AMU acute care hospitals in Marseille, southern France. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive result on polymerase chain reaction testing of a nasopharyngeal sample and/or on chest computed scan among patients requiring hospital admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: A total of 1092 patients were included. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 9.0%. The SCZ patients had an increased mortality compared to the non-SCZ patients (26.7% vs. 8.7%, P=0.039), which was confirmed by the multivariable analysis after adjustment for age, sex, smoking status, obesity and comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio 4.36 [95% CI: 1.09-17.44]; P=0.038). In contrast, the SCZ patients were not more frequently admitted to the ICU than the non-SCZ patients. Importantly, the SCZ patients were mostly institutionalized (63.6%, 100% of those who died), and they were more likely to have cancers and respiratory comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SCZ is not overrepresented among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, but SCZ is associated with excess COVID-19 mortality, confirming the existence of health disparities described in other somatic diseases.","Fond, G; Pauly, V; Orleans, V; Antonini, F; Fabre, C; Sanz, M; Klay, S; Jimeno, M-T; Leone, M; Lancon, C; Auquier, P; Boyer, L",Encephale,,242

In this article, we reflect on how insights from the literature on career shocks can help us understand the career consequences of the pandemic and offer suggestions for future research in this area. In particular, we offer three ""key lessons"". The first lesson is that the implications of Covid-19 reflect the dynamic interplay between individual and contextual factors. Here, we argue that although the pandemic was difficult to predict and control, research shows that certain psychological resources - such as career competencies and resilience - could make this career shock more manageable. The second lesson is that the pandemic may have differential implications over time, as suggested by research that has shown the consequences of career shocks to differ between short-term vs. long-term time horizons, and across life- and career stages. The third lesson is that, even though the pandemic is clearly a negatively valenced shock for most people, further into the future it may allow for more positive outcomes. This lesson builds on research showing how negative career shocks have long-term positive consequences for some people. We hope that these insights will inspire both scholars and practitioners to study and understand the work and career implications of Covid-19 as a career shock, as well as to support people in dealing with its consequences.","Akkermans, Jos; Richardson, Julia; Kraimer, Maria",J Vocat Behav,,242

445293,Platelets: 'multiple choice' effectors in the immune response and their implication in COVID-19 thromboinflammatory process,2021,"Introduction: Despite its significance, the research on international migration with a specific focus on the European Union (EU) needs to be strengthened with comprehensive studies, for developing better immigration and integration policies. Considering the amplitude of migration flows in Europe and recent challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the Brexit decision and humanitarian dimension of the migration phenomena (asylum seekers and ref-ugees), the need for better immigration and integration policies within the host countries’ labor markets stands out as a major research direction, especially in case of immigrants looking for better working and living conditions. Aim: This chapter aims to design specific immigration clusters within the main EU-10 destination countries (including Spain, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, UK, Germany, Austria, and Sweden) (cluster analysis pro-cedure);and to identify feasible ways and specific policies for immigrants’ labor market success (spatial analysis and macroeconometric models). Method: The methodological framework consists of two parts: (i) immigration clusters analysis, based on the interlinkages between several fundamental migration coordinates, namely, economic welfare at destination, employment opportunities for the foreign population, migrant integration policies and associated governmental efforts, educational background;and (ii) spatial analysis models, namely spatial lag–autoregressive and spatial error, and other three econometric procedures, respectively, the robust regression, Panel Corrected Standard Errors, and Arellano-Bond Dynamic Generalized Method of Moments. National data compiled for the 10 main EU receiving economies during 2000–2015, with a particular focus on Spain were used. Findings: The impact of the proposed research is reflected through a set of new specific tailored ways, policies and strategies that can be adopted and implemented by the policy-makers across Europe. Our empirical results show that, overall, EU-10 countries still fail to identify immigrants with high levels of education and skills acquired to enhance their potential for labor market integration. Policy-makers should always monitor the specific ways in which migration policies lead to concrete positive labor market outcomes for immigrants and that the tools used for implementing these policies are suitable in achieving predefined migration goals. Therefore, a particular focus should be on developing a new immigration system to select migrants for their skills and high level of human capital, by following the best practices examples of other receiving countries. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited, All rights reserved.","Noja, G.

We used the health belief model (in three dimensions) to examine the determinants of non-attendance of scheduled appointments in outpatient clinics due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in Taiwan (n = 1954) completed an online survey from 10 April 10 to 23 April 2020, which assessed how people perceived and responded to the outbreak of a fast-spreading infectious disease. We performed both univariate and multivariate logistic regression to examine the roles of cognitive, affective, and behavioral health belief constructs in nonattendance at scheduled appointments. The results indicated that individuals who perceived high confidence in coping with COVID-19 were less likely to miss or cancel their doctor's appointments, whereas individuals who reported high anxiety and practiced more preventive health behaviors, including avoiding crowded places, washing hands more often, and wearing a mask more often, were more likely to miss or cancel their appointments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-heterosexual participants had a lower rate of nonattendance at scheduled appointments compared with heterosexual ones. The study results increase our understanding of the patients' cognitive health beliefs, psychological distress, and health behaviors when assessing adherence to medical appointments during a pandemic.","Hsieh, Yi-Ping; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Wu, Chia-Fen; Wang, Peng-Wei",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

445634,Clinical and histopathological findings of cutaneous manifestations of COVID19 patients,2020,"COVID-19 is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. It can lead to cough and fever and in some cases severe pneumonia. It is generally detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography scans. However, as it is a lung disease, it has common symptoms with other respiratory diseases. This necessitates us to carefully differentiate COVID19 from such diseases during the diagnosis. This work aims to do that with the help of several deep learning architectures and chest radiographs. It specifically focuses on differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia, pleural effusion and lung mass. During this analysis, it is shown that we can differentiate COVID19 from other respiratory diseases using various deep learning architectures. It is further shown that ResNet-18 architecture produces the best overall performance in three scenarios of experiments.","Serener, A.; Serte, S.; Ieee,",2020 Medical Technologies Congress,,242

At present, there are still many unknowns about this infection, and much more unknown is the impact into the surgical field. Although evidence regarding the effect of SARS-CoV-2 and laparoscopic surgery is scarce, laparoscopy has been considered the method of choice by different scientific societies for most indications in gynaecology during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to the advantages over the open route. There is less morbidity and hospital stay, and in addition, as it involves autonomous and contained surgical procedures with respect to smoke release. Moreover, the instruments and the setting in the operating room mean that there can be safe distance from the surgeon and other staff to the patient.

Objective: To evaluate whether unanticipated disparities by race or ethnicity arise from a single institution's resource allocation policy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included adults (aged &#8805;18 years) who were cared for on a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ward or in a monitored unit requiring invasive or noninvasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula between May 26 and July 14, 2020, at 2 academic hospitals in Miami, Florida. Exposures: Race (ie, White, Black, Asian, multiracial) and ethnicity (ie, non-Hispanic, Hispanic). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was based on a resource allocation priority score (range, 1-8, with 1 indicating highest and 8 indicating lowest priority) that was assigned daily based on both estimated short-term (using Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score) and longer-term (using comorbidities) mortality. There were 2 coprimary outcomes: maximum and minimum score for each patient over all eligible patient-days. Standard summary statistics were used to describe the cohort, and multivariable Poisson regression was used to identify associations of race and ethnicity with each outcome. Results: The cohort consisted of 5613 patient-days of data from 1127 patients (median [interquartile range {IQR}] age, 62.7 [51.7-73.7]; 607 [53.9%] men). Of these, 711 (63.1%) were White patients, 323 (28.7%) were Black patients, 8 (0.7%) were Asian patients, and 31 (2.8%) were multiracial patients; 480 (42.6%) were non-Hispanic patients, and 611 (54.2%) were Hispanic patients. The median (IQR) maximum priority score for the cohort was 3 (1-4); the median (IQR) minimum score was 2 (1-3). After adjustment, there was no association of race with maximum priority score using White patients as the reference group (Black patients: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.12; Asian patients: IRR, 0.95; 95% CI. 0.62-1.45; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.72-1.19) or of ethnicity using non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88-1.10); similarly, no association was found with minimum score for race, again with White patients as the reference group (Black patients: IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.90-1.14; Asian patients: IRR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.62-1.49; multiracial patients: IRR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.07) or ethnicity, again with non-Hispanic patients as the reference group (Hispanic patients: IRR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.13).

So far, no successful specific treatment has been found for this disease. As has been reported, most of non-survivor patients with COVID-19 (70%) had septic shock which was significantly higher than survived ones. Although the exact pathophysiology of septic shock in these patients is still unclear, it seems to be possible that part of it would be due to the administration of empiric antibiotics with inflammatory properties especially in the absence of bacterial infection. Herein, we have reviewed possible molecular pathways of septic shock in the patients who have received antibiotics with inflammatory properties which mainly is release of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF- &#945;) through different routes. Altogether, we highly recommend clinicians to look after those antibiotics with anti-inflammatory activity for both empiric antibiotic therapy and reducing the inflammation to prevent septic shock in patients with diagnosed COVID-19.","Hantoushzadeh, Sedigheh; Norooznezhad, Amir Hossein",Arch Med Res,,242

The aim of this study was to investigate endothelial-dependent and endothelial-independent skin microvascular reactivity in patients with critical COVID-19. METHODS: Twelve patients with COVID-19 treated with non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation were included in the study. We investigated skin microvascular reactivity on two separate days during hospitalization (study day 1 and 2) and at least three months after disease onset (study day 3). Twelve controls with no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection during 2020 were also examined. Skin perfusion was investigated through Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) before and after iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to determine the endothelial-dependent and the endothelial-independent vasodilation, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to controls, patients with critical COVID-19 had higher basal skin perfusion and reduced responses to endothelial-dependent (ACh, pâ=â0.002) and endothelial-independent (SNP, pâ=â0.01) vasodilator drugs on study day 1. In addition, the ACh/SNP ratio was significantly reduced in patients (0.50â±â0.36 versus 0.91â±â0.49 in controls, pâ=â0.02). Three months after disease onset, surviving patients tended to have reduced ACh-mediated vasodilation compared to controls (pâ=â0.08). CONCLUSIONS: This small-sized pilot study demonstrates that critical COVID-19 infection is associated with microvascular impairment and, in particular, a markedly reduced endothelial function. Our results also suggest that microvascular function may not be fully recovered three months after disease onset.","Tehrani, Sara; Gille-Johnson, Patrik",Shock (Augusta Ga.),,242

Effective antivirals with safe clinical profile are urgently needed to improve the overall prognosis. In an analysis of a randomly collected cohort of 124 patients with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), we found that hypercoagulability as indicated by elevated concentrations of D-dimers was associated with disease severity. By virtual screening of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug library, we identified an anticoagulation agent dipyridamole (DIP) in silico, which suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. In a proof-of-concept trial involving 31 patients with COVID-19, DIP supplementation was associated with significantly decreased concentrations of D-dimers (P<0.05), increased lymphocyte and platelet recovery in the circulation, and markedly improved clinical outcomes in comparison to the control patients. In particular, all 8 of the DIP-treated severely ill patients showed remarkable improvement: 7 patients (87.5%) achieved clinical cure and were discharged from the hospitals while the remaining 1 patient (12.5%) was in clinical remission.","Liu, Xiaoyan; Li, Zhe; Liu, Shuai; Sun, Jing; Chen, Zhanghua; Jiang, Min; Zhang, Qingling; Wei, Yinghua; Wang, Xin; Huang, Yi-You; Shi, Yinyi; Xu, Yanhui; Xian, Huifang; Bai, Fan; Ou, Changxing; Xiong, Bei; Lew, Andrew M; Cui, Jun; Fang, Rongli; Huang, Hui; Zhao, Jincun; Hong, Xuechuan; Zhang, Yuxia; Zhou, Fuling; Luo, Hai-Bin",,,242

455113,PAP therapy increases the risk of transmission of COVID-19,2020,"The subject matter of the article relates to the assessment of the perception of selected types of risk in economic activities of the SME sector, which change their intensity as a result of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current economic downturn is unprecedented and involves many companies and industries that have faced new, previously unknown challenges and threats. The objective of the article is to identify the most important risks and their resources based on the empirical research carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. The formulated objective was accomplished using the data collection method, i.e., the survey and reports on the condition of the SME sector in Poland as well as statistical data analysis methods, i.e., structure index and the analysis of variance, using the SPSS system. The process of primary data collection was carried out by means of an electronic survey among selected enterprises of the SME sector, conducting business activities in Poland. In the study, the employment factor was taken into account as a determinant of the perception and assessment of the intensity of selected risks arising from the economic activity in the Polish market in the conditions of the current economic downturn. On the basis of the obtained results, the impact of market, economic, financial and operational risks, depending on their intensity, on the functioning of micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises was identified. Based on the analysis of variance, the effect of the size of the company on the level of individual risks was also examined. As a result of the observations made, it was established that, during the pandemic, the level and type of risk is similar in all the surveyed enterprises. They are most often threatened by strong competition in the industry, an increase in energy prices and insufficient profit. The overall results of the empirical research indicate the importance and the need to manage the key threats to the Polish SME sector.","Grondys, K.; Slusarczyk, O.; Hussain, H.

455260,"Single, unilateral halo sign in COVID-19 pneumonia",2020,"BACKGROUND: Lockdowns amid the COVID-19 pandemic have offered a real-world opportunity to better understand air quality responses to previously unseen anthropogenic emission reductions. METHODS AND MAIN OBJECTIVE: This work examines the impact of Vienna's first lockdown on ground-level concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and total oxidant (Ox). The analysis runs over January to September 2020 and considers business as usual scenarios created with machine learning models to provide a baseline for robustly diagnosing lockdown-related air quality changes. Models were also developed to normalise the air pollutant time series, enabling facilitated intervention assessment. CORE FINDINGS: NO2 concentrations were on average -20.1% [13.7-30.4%] lower during the lockdown. However, this benefit was offset by amplified O3 pollution of +8.5% [3.7-11.0%] in the same period. The consistency in the direction of change indicates that the NO2 reductions and O3 increases were ubiquitous over Vienna. Ox concentrations increased slightly by +4.3% [1.8-6.4%], suggesting that a significant part of the drops in NO2 was compensated by gains in O3. Accordingly, 82% of lockdown days with lowered NO2 were accompanied by 81% of days with amplified O3. The recovery shapes of the pollutant concentrations were depicted and discussed. The business as usual-related outcomes were broadly consistent with the patterns outlined by the normalised time series. These findings allowed to argue further that the detected changes in air quality were of anthropogenic and not of meteorological reason. Pollutant changes on the machine learning baseline revealed that the impact of the lockdown on urban air quality were lower than the raw measurements show. Besides, measured traffic drops in major Austrian roads were more significant for light-duty than for heavy-duty vehicles. It was also noted that the use of mobility reports based on cell phone movement as activity data can overestimate the reduction of emissions for the road transport sector, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles. As heavy-duty vehicles can make up a large fraction of the fleet emissions of nitrogen oxides, the change in the volume of these vehicles on the roads may be the main driver to explain the change in NO2 concentrations. INTERPRETATION AND IMPLICATIONS: A probable future with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) dropping slower than emissions of nitrogen oxides could risk worsened urban O3 pollution under a VOC-limited photochemical regime. More holistic policies will be needed to achieve improved air quality levels across different regions and criteria pollutants.","Brancher, Marlon",Environ Pollut,,242

Previous research has found celebrity illness disclosures to influence behavior, but during the uncertainty of a pandemic, the effects of such a disclosure were unclear. OBJECTIVE: To test the proposed Celebrity Illness Disclosure Effects (CIDE) model, demonstrating how an illness disclosure, communicated through mediated and interpersonal channels, may shape willingness to engage in prevention behaviors. METHODS: We conducted an online survey (N = 587) 24 hours after Hanks' COVID-19 disclosure. RESULTS: Findings revealed that celebrity-related perception variables predicted illness-related cognitions and emotions\, which were associated with willingness to enact prevention behaviors. Greater willingness to seek information, stronger perceptions of COVID as a threat, and stronger perceptions of efficacy for dealing with COVID after learning of Hanks' diagnosis predicted stronger willingness to enact prevention behaviors. However, anxiety about COVID predicted lower willingness to enact prevention behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The CIDE model can serve as a guide for future research in this area. The results can help scholars who aim to better understand the phenomena around celebrities and health communication as well as policymakers who hope to ride the wave of star power to improved public health outcomes.","Myrick, Jessica Gall; Willoughby, Jessica Fitts",Soc Sci Med,,242
455642,In Reply: Thrombotic Neurovascular Disease in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"AimsThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented a challenge for treating people with OCD and it could be postulated that those with OCD fearing contamination might be more affected in current circumstances. Although there have been some studies already published, results have been heterogeneous and conflicting;possibly because of different populations or geographical locations examined.In this preliminary study we aim to identify the impact of the pandemic on the severity of OCD, as measured by Y-BOCS scores. To our knowledge, it is the first UK study of this kind and the only study that examines change in Y-BOCS scores over such a long time period.MethodPatients were identified from national OCD unit referral databases at Springfield Hospital. Referrals from March 2019–March 2020 were examined and patients included if they had a diagnosis of OCD, were accepted by the service following initial assessment and sufficient data were available. This preliminary study focused only on Y-BOCS to assess clinician-rated severity of OCD. Y-BOCS scores were compared from different time periods correlating to the progression of COVID-19. ‘Pre-pandemic’ score was taken from Jan–Dec 2019 or, if not available, from Jan–23 March 2020 (prior to UK lockdown). ‘Pandemic’ score was taken as the most recent rating from April 2020 onwards.Result21 patients were included. All treated as outpatients (although 9 had undergone previous inpatient treatment during the time period above). 81% showed improvement in Y-BOCS score between pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods, with an overall mean decrease in Y-BOCS of 10.3.ConclusionOverall, this study indicates that severity of OCD decreased during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. It may be that patients found it easier to access remote appointments, or perhaps the pandemic environment of being encouraged to stay at home and limiting unnecessary contact may have allowed limited opportunity for exposure. It might be that the pandemic provided a reason for patients to be avoidant of potential contamination thereby leading to a perceived rather than real improvement in Y-BOCS scores.Identification of specific contributing factors is beyond the scope of this preliminary study, however it will be important to conduct further research with a larger sample size that incorporates post-lockdown and post-pandemic scores to ascertain whether trends seen here are in fact maintained when normal social contact resumes.","Fischer, Claire Gyekye-Mensah Hannah Pampaloni Ilenia Chandler Augusta Govender Anusha Sibanda-Mbanga Josephine",BJPsych Open,,242

Based on the TESS light curve and updated stellar parameters, the planet radii are $2.15\pm0.10R_\oplus$ and $2.67\pm0.12R_\oplus$, the orbital periods are 7.11 and 20.55 days, and the orbital eccentricities are lower than abut 0.2. Using HARPS-N velocities, we measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal of the inner planet, demonstrating the orbit is prograde. Since the host star is bright (V=6.9), both planets are amenable to transmission spectroscopy, radial velocity measurements of their masses, and more precise determination of the stellar obliquity. This system is therefore poised to play an important role in our understanding of planetary system evolution in the first billion years after formation.","Mann, Andrew W.; Johnson, Marshall C.; Vanderburg, Andrew; Kraus, Adam L.; Rizzuto, Aaron C.; Wood, Mackenna L.; Bush, Jonathan L.; Rockcliffe, Keighley; Newton, Elisabeth R.; Latham, David W.; Mamajek, Eric E.; Zhou, George; Quinn, Samuel N.; Thao, Pa Chia; Benatti, Serena; Cosentino, Rosario; Desidera, Silvano; Harutyunyan, Avet; Lovis, Christophe; Mortier, Annelies; Pepe, Francesco A.; Poretti, Ennio; Wilson, Thomas G.; Kristiansen, Martti H.; Gagliano, Robert; Jacobs, Thomas; LaCourse, Daryll M.; Omohundro, Mark; Schwengeler, Hans Martin; Kane, Stephen R.; Hill, Michelle L.; Rabus, Markus; Esquerdo, Gilbert A.; Berlind, Perry; Collins, Karen A.; Murawski, Gabriel; Aitken, Michael M.; Sallam, Nezar Hazam; Massey, Bob; Ricker, George R.; Vanderspek, Roland; Seager, Sara; Winn, Joshua N.; Jenkins, Jon M.; Barclay, Thomas; Caldwell, Douglas A.; Dragomir, Diana; Doty, John P.; Glidden, Ana; Tenenbaum, Peter; Torres, Guillermo; Twicken, Joseph D.; Villanueva, Steven",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00047v1.pdf,242
458069,Three cases of spontaneous major bleeding in patients with a COVID-19 infection,2021,"It is commonly accepted that the breakup criteria of drops or bubbles in turbulence is governed by surface tension and inertia. However, also {\it{buoyancy}} can play an important role at breakup. In order to better understand this role, here we numerically study Rayleigh-B\'enard convection for two immiscible fluid layers, in order to identify the effects of buoyancy on interface breakup. We explore the parameter space spanned by the Weber number $5\leq We \leq 5000$ (the ratio of inertia to surface tension) and the density ratio between the two fluids $0.001 \leq \Lambda \leq 1$, at fixed Rayleigh number $Ra=10^8$ and Prandtl number $Pr=1$. At low $We$, the interface undulates due to plumes. When $We$ is larger than a critical value, the interface eventually breaks up. Depending on $\Lambda$, two breakup types are observed: The first type occurs at small $\Lambda \ll 1$ (e.g. air-water systems) when local filament thicknesses exceed the Hinze length scale. The second, strikingly different, type occurs at large $\Lambda$ with roughly $0.5<\Lambda \le 1$ (e.g. oil-water systems): The layers undergo a periodic overturning caused by buoyancy overwhelming surface tension. For both types the breakup criteria can be derived from force balance arguments and show good agreement with the numerical results.","Liu, Hao-Ran; Chong, Kai Leong; Wang, Qi; Ng, Chong Shen; Verzicco, Roberto; Lohse, Detlef",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05633v1.pdf,242
458081,Early neurological manifestations of hospitalized COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious consequences of lockdown and social distancing. The psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on this group are still unknown, and we want to explore how their quality of life (QoL) has changed in this unique situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey, composed of pandemic-specific items, plus the EORTC QLQ-C30, was administered to a cohort of HNC survivors. Using previously published reference values as a control group, we have evaluated the impact of the pandemic on their QoL. We have also explored the differences between those who had received a total laryngectomy (LP, laryngectomized population) vs other HNC patients, in order to assess the role of tracheostomy in this regard. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-one HNC patients completed the survey. The scores of the physical (80.5 vs 85, p = 0.028), role (78 vs 84, p = 0.030), and emotional functioning (76 vs 81, p = 0.041) were significantly different in the two groups, with worse functioning in our patients. Comparing LP with the other HNC patients, social (76.6 vs 88.9, p = 0.008) and physical functioning (75.5 vs 86.1, p = 0.006) were significantly worse in the former group. LP also reported a greater perception that others are afraid to be close to them (1.67 vs 1.32, p = 0.020). No differences were found between LP with and without voice prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show how HNC patients are at high risk for a worsening in QoL because of the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic.","Gallo, Oreste; Bruno, Chiara; Locatello, Luca Giovanni; Martelli, Federica; Cilona, Maria; Orlando, Pietro; Fancello, Giuseppe; Maggiore, Giandomenico; Viberti, Francesca; Ciabatti, Pierguido; Boccuzzi, Simone; Mandalà, Marco",Support. care cancer,,242

The independent role of each component contributing to the risk of COVID-19 is unknown, and how some non-cardiometabolic comorbidities affect the risk of COVID-19 remains unclear. Methods: A retrospective follow-up design was adopted. A total of 1,160 laboratory-confirmed patients were enrolled from nine provinces in China. Data on comorbidities were obtained from the patients' medical records. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratio ( OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the associations between comorbidities (cardiometabolic or non-cardiometabolic diseases), clinical severity, and treatment outcomes of COVID-19. Results: Overall, 158 (13.6%) patients were diagnosed with severe illness and 32 (2.7%) had unfavorable outcomes. Hypertension (2.87, 1.30-6.32), type 2 diabetes (T2DM) (3.57, 2.32-5.49), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (3.78, 1.81-7.89), fatty liver disease (7.53, 1.96-28.96), hyperlipidemia (2.15, 1.26-3.67), other lung diseases (6.00, 3.01-11.96), and electrolyte imbalance (10.40, 3.00-26.10) were independently linked to increased odds of being severely ill. T2DM (6.07, 2.89-12.75), CVD (8.47, 6.03-11.89), and electrolyte imbalance (19.44, 11.47-32.96) were also strong predictors of unfavorable outcomes. Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease on admission (5.46, 3.25-9.19), while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes (6.58, 1.46-29.64) within two weeks. Conclusion: Besides hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, fatty liver disease, hyperlipidemia, other lung diseases, and electrolyte imbalance were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity and poor treatment outcome. Women with comorbidities were more likely to have severe disease, while men with comorbidities were more likely to have unfavorable treatment outcomes.","Ma, Yan; Zhu, Dong Shan; Chen, Ren Bo; Shi, Nan Nan; Liu, Si Hong; Fan, Yi Pin; Wu, Gui Hui; Yang, Pu Ye; Bai, Jiang Feng; Chen, Hong; Chen, Li Ying; Feng, Qiao; Guo, Tuan Mao; Hou, Yong; Hu, Gui Fen; Hu, Xiao Mei; Hu, Yun Hong; Huang, Jin; Huang, Qiu Hua; Huang, Shao Zhen; Ji, Liang; Jin, Hai Hao; Lei, Xiao; Li, Chun Yan; Li, Min Qing; Li, Qun Tang; Li, Xian Yong; Liu, Hong De; Liu, Jin Ping; Liu, Zhang; Ma, Yu Ting; Mao, Ya; Mo, Liu Fen; Na, Hui; Wang, Jing Wei; Song, Fang Li; Sun, Sheng; Wang, Dong Ting; Wang, Ming Xuan; Wang, Xiao Yan; Wang, Yin Zhen; Wang, Yu Dong; Wu, Wei; Wu, Lan Ping; Xiao, Yan Hua; Xie, Hai Jun; Xu, Hong Ming; Xu, Shou Fang; Xue, Rui Xia; Yang, Chun",Biomed Environ Sci,,242
458700,Bottlenecks in the Acute Stroke Care System during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Catalonia,2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To study the safety and outcome profiles of tunnelled dialysis catheter (TDC) insertions and exchanges with fluoroscopy versus without fluoroscopy. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all TDC insertions or exchanges performed at our centre, between January 2017 and December 2017. Patient demographics, laboratory results and catheter placement information were obtained from electronic records. Immediate technical success, early and late catheter associated complications were collected. Outcomes for TDC inserted with or without fluoroscopy were statistically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 351 TDC insertions and 253 TDC exchanges were performed. Out of 351 TDC insertions, 261 were done with fluoroscopy while 90 were done without. Out of 253 TDC exchanges, 219 were done with fluoroscopy while 34 were done without. For both TDC insertions and exchanges, there were no significant differences in complication rates when done with or without fluoroscopy. Mean duration of catheter patency was longer for TDC inserted without fluoroscopy, after adjusting for site of insertion and presence of previous TDC. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of inserting TDC in the right internal jugular vein (IJV) without fluoroscopy is a safe and effective method in selected patients. This supports the practice of performing the procedure without fluoroscopy, especially in institutions where fluoroscopy facilities are not readily available. This potentially translates into reduced healthcare resources and hospitalisation days, which is particularly valuable in times of limited resources such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Chang, Zi Yun; Wong, Weng Kin; Chan, Yiong Huak; Khan, Behram A; Leo, Christopher Ch",J Vasc Access,,242

458930,The effect of tocilizumab on severe COVID-19 infection: Review of current evidence,2021,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a fatal epizootic swine coronavirus that presents a financial threat to the global swine industry. Since the discovery of the low-pathogenic genotype 1b (G1b) in 2014, it has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in South Korea. In this study, we identified novel G1b variants arising from the natural recombination of a major pandemic-like G2b virus and a minor G1b virus currently circulating in the domestic field. The whole-genome sequences of two 2018-19 G1b recombinants, KNU-1808 and KNU-1909, were determined. A genomic comparison showed that these two viruses share the highest nucleotide sequence similarity with the 2017 G1b strain but share less similarity with the 2014 G1b emergent strain KNU-1406. However, the putative recombination breakpoints spanning the first 1,170 nucleotides of the spike (S) gene were almost identical among the emergent and contemporary G1b strains. Recombination detection indicated that the inter-subgroup G1b recombinant first emerged in 2017 by introducing the N-terminal domain of S from KNU-1406 into the backbone of KNU-1703, possibly leading to antigenic shift. It then evolved into KNU-1808 and KNU-1909 through genetic drift, moving toward a more G2b-like genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 2018-2019 G1b recombinants belong to a cluster containing other G1b strains but form a new branch. This study provides an important advance warning in regard to the emergence and prevalence of new genotypes or variants that can result from genetic recombination between two different PEDV genotypes circulating in endemic areas and continuous non-lethal mutations essential for viral fitness in the host environment.","Park, Jonghyun; Lee, Changhee",Arch. virol,,242

This study explored why the integration of traditional medicines with the biomedical healthcare system in Qokolweni in Eastern Cape, South Africa was stalling. The research employed qualitative research methods; participant observation and in-depth ethnographic interviews of community members, traditional healers, and nurses. The study found that: traditional medicines are widely used in Qokolweni due to accessibility and long-built trust; the practice is broad and not certified. To achieve the integration of traditional medicine into the conventional health systems, the central government needs to show political will by setting up regulatory strategies that provide for the scientific evaluation and certification of traditional medicines. This will build confidence among biomedical scientists and health practitioners, thereby fostering easy collaboration and integration.","Mutola, Sianga; Pemunta, Ngambouk Vitalis; Ngo, Ngo Valery",Complement Ther Clin Pract,,242

METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers receiving five daily oral doses of 10 mg ARI and 5 mg OLA in a crossover clinical trial were genotyped for 46 polymorphisms in 14 genes by qPCR. Drug plasma concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Blood pressure (BP) and 12-lead electrocardiogram were measured in supine position. AEs were also recorded. RESULTS: ARI decreased diastolic BP on the first day and decreased QTc on the third and fifth day. OLA had a systolic and diastolic BP, heart rate and QTc lowering effect on the first day. Polymorphisms in ADRA2A, COMT, DRD3 and HTR2A genes were significantly associated to these changes. The most frequent adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to ARI were somnolence, headache, insomnia, dizziness, restlessness, palpitations, akathisia and nausea while were somnolence, dizziness, asthenia, constipation, dry mouth, headache and nausea to OLA. Additionally, HTR2A, HTR2C, DRD2, DRD3, OPRM1, UGT1A1 and CYP1A2 polymorphisms had a role in the development of ADRs.

Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of pulse-steroid in case of unresponsiveness to treatment with high dose steroid. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study is a retrospective controlled trial. We divided the patients in three groups: Standard-care therapy alone, high-dose steroid treatment and pulse-steroid treatment (250 mg/day methy-prednisolone). One hundred fifty patients were enrolled in each group. All patients were hospitalized and needed oxygen support. We matched the patients according to disease severity at the onset of hypoxia, weight of co-morbidities, age and gender. We then compared three groups in terms of mortality, length of hospitalization, need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay in ICU and duration of MV. RESULTS: The pulse-steroid group had shorter ICU stay. The median ICU stay was 9.0(CI 95% 6.0-12.0) days in standard ?care group, 8.0(CI 95% 5.0-13.0) days in high-dose steroid group and 4.5(CI %95 3.0-8.0) days in pulse-steroid group. Moreover, although they were initially unresponsive to steroid therapy, they achieved similar results compared to the high-dose steroid group in other outcomes except for length of hospital stay.

As of 4 August 2020, more than 18 million confirmed infections had been reported globally. Most patients have mild symptoms, but some patients develop respiratory failure which is the leading cause of death among COVID-19 patients. Endothelial cells with high levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression are major participants and regulators of inflammatory reactions and coagulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that endothelial activation and dysfunction participate in COVID-19 pathogenesis by altering the integrity of vessel barrier, promoting pro-coagulative state, inducing endothelial inflammation, and even mediating leukocyte infiltration. This review describes the proposed cellular and molecular mechanisms of endothelial activation and dysfunction during COVID-19 emphasizing the principal mediators and therapeutic implications.","Jin, Yuefei; Ji, Wangquan; Yang, Haiyan; Chen, Shuaiyin; Zhang, Weiguo; Duan, Guangcai",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,242
464687,Early intubation and restrictive fluid management are key in the treatment of patients with moderate-severe COVID-19 pneumonitis,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common manifestation of severe COVID-19. Prone positioning has been used successfully in adult patients with ARDS and has been shown to decrease mortality. The efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS is less clear. In this review, we discuss the physiologic principles and literature on prone positioning in adults and children relative to COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: There are limited published data on prone positioning in respiratory failure because of COVID-19. The use of proning in nonintubated patients with COVID-19 may improve oxygenation and dyspnea but has not been associated with improved outcomes. Initial adult cohort studies of intubated patients undergoing prone positioning in severe ARDS related to COVID-19 have shown an improvement in mortality. Although the use of proning in children with severe COVID-19 is recommended, data supporting its use is scarce. SUMMARY: Additional studies to evaluate the efficacy of prone positioning in pediatric ARDS are needed to provide evidence for or against this treatment strategy in children. Given the unknown evolution of this pandemic, collaborative research efforts across pediatric centers provides the greatest opportunity to develop a data driven-approach to make use of this potential therapy.","Leroue, Matthew K; Maddux, Aline B; Mourani, Peter M",Curr Opin Pediatr,,242

We used a 5-step process to gain domain knowledge, identify user needs, identify data sources, design and develop visualizations, and iteratively refine these visualizations. Through this process we identified 3 distinct stakeholder groups and designed and developed visualization dashboards to meet their needs. Feedback from users demonstrated the dashboard's support situation awareness and informed important operational decisions. Lessons learned are shared to provide other organizations with insights from our process.","Dixit, Ram A; Hurst, Stephen; Adams, Katharine T; Boxley, Christian; Lysen-Hendershot, Kristi; Bennett, Sonita S; Booker, Ethan; Ratwani, Raj M",J Am Med Inform Assoc,,242

Although the rapidity with which the virus struck was indeed overwhelming, scientists throughout the world have been up to the task of deciphering the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 induces the multisystem and multiorgan inflammatory responses that, collectively, contribute to the high mortality rate in affected individuals. In this issue of the JCI, Skendros and Mitsios et al. is one such team who report that the complement system plays a substantial role in creating the hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy that appear to contribute to the severity of COVID-19. In support of the hypothesis that the complement system along with neutrophils and platelets contributes to COVID-19, the authors present empirical evidence showing that treatment with the complement inhibitor compstatin Cp40 inhibited the expression of tissue factor in neutrophils. These results confirm that the complement axis plays a critical role and suggest that targeted therapy using complement inhibitors is a potential therapeutic option to treat COVID-19-induced inflammation.","Ghebrehiwet, Berhane; Peerschke, Ellinor I",J Clin Invest,,242

To understand the underlying mechanisms involved in lung pathology, we investigated the role of the lung-specific immune response. We profiled immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood collected from COVID-19 patients with severe disease and bacterial pneumonia patients not associated with viral infection. By tracking T cell clones across tissues, we identified clonally expanded tissue-resident memory-like Th17 cells (Trm17 cells) in the lungs even after viral clearance. These Trm17 cells were characterized by a a potentially pathogenic cytokine expression profile of IL17A and CSF2 (GM-CSF). Interactome analysis suggests that Trm17 cells can interact with lung macrophages and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which have been associated with disease severity and lung damage. High IL-17A and GM-CSF protein levels in the serum of COVID-19 patients were associated with a more severe clinical course. Collectively, our study suggests that pulmonary Trm17 cells are one potential orchestrator of the hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.","Zhao, Yu; Kilian, Christoph; Turner, Jan-Eric; Bosurgi, Lidia; Roedl, Kevin; Bartsch, Patricia; Gnirck, Ann-Christin; Cortesi, Filippo; Schultheiß, Christoph; Hellmig, Malte; Enk, Leon U B; Hausmann, Fabian; Borchers, Alina; Wong, Milagros N; Paust, Hans-Joachim; Siracusa, Francesco; Scheibel, Nicola; Herrmann, Marissa; Rosati, Elisa; Bacher, Petra; Kylies, Dominik; Jarczak, Dominik; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Pfefferle, Susanne; Steurer, Stefan; Zur-Wiesch, Julian Schulze; Puelles, Victor G; Sperhake, Jan-Peter; Addo, Marylyn M; Lohse, Ansgar W; Binder, Mascha; Huber, Samuel; Huber, Tobias B; Kluge, Stefan; Bonn, Stefan; Panzer, Ulf; Gagliani, Nicola; Krebs, Christian F",Sci. immunol,,242

Detection and measurement of donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA), expressed as a fraction of the total cell-free DNA (cfDNA), has emerged as a noninvasive biomarker for allograft rejection. Here, we present a case report of a patient who was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, 11 mo post-kidney transplant. The patient was serially monitored using an analytically and clinically validated massively multiplex PCR-based dd-cfDNA assay to assess allograft injury and risk for rejection. Over the course of infection, low dd-cfDNA fractions were observed (below the 1% cutoff) and were accompanied by unusually highly elevated levels of total cfDNA, which gradually declined as the infection resolved. The case study highlights the variability in total cfDNA levels during and after viral infection, and the need to consider both total and dd-cfDNA levels when clinically interpreting the results for allograft rejection. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of serial testing, wherein an interplay between total cfDNA and dd-cfDNA can inform the optimization of a patient's immunosuppressive treatment regimen in response to infection.","Bunnapradist, S.; Datta, N.; Schaenman, J.; Ioannou, N.; Bloom, M.

467962,Benefits of a virtual interstitial lung disease multidisciplinary meeting in the face of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Nonmissile penetrating injuries to the craniocervical junction caused by a glass fragment are rare, and a standard management strategy has not been established. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old Japanese man was brought into our emergency department after receiving a left retroauricular stab wound by broken glass fragments. After spinal immobilization, a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed glass fragments penetrating at the right craniocervical junction to the interatlantooccipital subarachnoid space. CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were not injured. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that the glass fragments did not penetrate the cervical cord or medulla oblongata. These glass fragments were removed via a midline incision from the external occipital protuberance to the C7 and with laminectomy without suboccipital craniectomy. Five of the glass fragments were found and removed in total. The dural defect was patched with a free fascia autograft. His postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative CT angiography showed that both vertebral arteries were intact and the glass fragments had been removed completely. CONCLUSIONS: CT graphical diagnosis is useful for the management of penetrating craniocervical junction trauma, and it should be considered in the evaluation of patients who have suffered craniocervical penetrating injury even in the absence of major wounds or bleeding. Spinal immobilization of patients with craniocervical penetrating injuries is crucial to avoid not only secondary neurologic damage but also secondary critical vascular damage. Incomplete or inadequate assessment of craniocervical stab wounds results in unexpected hazards that are preventable.","Yoneoka, Yuichiro; Akiyama, Katsuhiko; Seki, Yasuhiro",World Neurosurg,,242

The traditional model of bedside clinical teaching in required advanced clerkships was upended on March 17, 2020, when the Association of American Medical Colleges recommended removing medical students from direct patient care to prevent further spread of the disease and also to help conserve scarce personal protective equipment (PPE). This created unique challenges for delivering a robust, advanced emergency medicine (EM) clerkship since the emergency department is ground zero for the undifferentiated and potentially infected patient and has high demand for PPE. Here, we describe the development, application, and program evaluation of an online-based, virtual advanced EM curriculum developed rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Starting March 23, 2020, we began rotating fourth-year medical students through a four-week rotation. We completed a total of four virtual clerkship experiences comprised of 56 students through July 27, 2020. Through analysis of the students' performance on a national standardized EM shelf exam, students participating in this virtual clerkship demonstrated a fund of knowledge that was not significantly different from that of their peers who completed a traditional clerkship in the specialty prior to the pandemic interruptions. Additionally, the critical review of the traditional course created the opportunity to make improvements and enrich the medical student educational experience in a virtual environment and upon resumption of the traditional course when students returned to the in-person environment. The resources provided for those interested in adopting our pedagogical approach include a course syllabus, calendar, and learner summative assessment.","Redinger, Kathryn E; Greene, Jeffrey D",West J Emerg Med,,242

METHODS: All third- and fourth-year undergraduate dental students within a dental geriatric module were asked to provide a written guided reflection on the question: ""In your opinion, what factors make outbreaks (or pandemics) like COVID-19 relevant to the practice of dental geriatrics?"" Reflections were gathered from March 12 to May 8, 2020. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify and interpret patterns of meaning within the reflections by means of an interactive coding process. RESULTS: A total of 115 reflections, between 291 and 710 words each, were received from 56 third-year (62.5% male) and 59 fourth-year (42.6% male) students. Five main themes emerged: experiencing uncertainties, frailty as a moderator, constraints in accessing care, preparedness protocol, and redefining care. The frequency in which the same codes, categories, and themes were assigned varied from 16 to 140 times. CONCLUSIONS: Students' reflections highlighted the effects of the pandemic, not only on their education but also on frail older adults themselves and the profession of dentistry in general. Further studies are warranted to explore how this curtailment might impact educators' approaches to geriatric education, as well as the way graduating students will set up their practices and approach geriatric care in the future.","Brondani, Mario; Donnelly, Leeann",J. dent. educ,,242

An observational study with three cohorts of infertile women was designed including 37 PCOS patients, 36 women with tubal factor, and 31 women with male factor. Clinical history and physical examination were carried out in all patients. All subjects completed the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaires. Women with infertility due to PCOS showed a significantly higher prevalence of depressive (48.6 vs 19.4 and 12.9%, p < 0.01) and anxiety symptoms (21.6 vs 5.6 and 3.2%, p = 0.041) than respondents of reference groups. Sexual function in PCOS subjects was impaired in the areas orgasm and satisfaction (p < 0.01 for both) compared to patients of reference groups. Clinical, biochemical hyperandrogenism, and overweight were associated with a higher incidence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the infertile PCOS group (p < 0.01 for all). Besides, the severity of anxiety symptoms was associated with the number of medically assisted reproduction attempts (p = 0.014). Weight gain and age (p = 0.04 and p = 0.047) were associated with impaired sexual functioning. The relation between reduced sexuality and depressive/anxiety symptoms was found (p = 0.038 and p = 0.012, respectively). Infertile PCOS patients showed the highest prevalence of psychological complaints and some impairment in their sexual functioning.

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 ± 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 ± 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July-11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041; a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%; and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak. The study provides important information for public health providers and the government to control the COVID-19 epidemic.","Alsayed, Abdallah; Sadir, Hayder; Kamil, Raja; Sari, Hasan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

This retrospective study included 210 elderly COVID-19 patients (aged &#8805; 65 years), of whom 175 patients were discharged and 35 died. All deceased patients had at least one comorbidity. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the deceased group had cardiovascular diseases (49% vs. 20%), respiratory diseases (51% vs. 11%), chronic kidney disease (29% vs. 5%) and cerebrovascular disease (20% vs. 3%) than that in the discharged group.

This overview aims to highlight some important points regarding the mode of transmission for which continuously surprising facts are being revealed every day. We also raise some vital questions to alert the scientific community to find the right answers and minimize the drastic fatal outcomes of this disease. It can be stated that SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted as aerosol infection as well as through contacting infected surfaces. The possible role of abdominal gases as a route of spread of the virus should be considered and a fecal sample might be a useful diagnostic tool. Moreover, medical face masks are not protective from virus transmission during treating COVID-19 patients in settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Doffing of PPE for healthcare workers needs more attention as this might be a source of infection unless additional measures of PPE disinfection are employed before doffing.","Elsayed, Shadia Abdelhameed; Abu-Hammad, Osama; Alolayan, Albraa B.; Althagafi, Nebras; Ayed, Yosra; Eldeen, Yasmin Salah; Dar-Odeh, Najla",Pesqui.

Experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and early reports about SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that health-care settings and health-care workers (HCWs) are vulnerable in the context of the emergence of a new coronavirus. Areas covered: To highlight the need for prophylactic strategies particularly for HCWs, we identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in health-care settings and the incidence of infections in HCWs by a search on MEDLINE and MEDxRIV (for SARS-Cov-2). To identify prophylactic strategies against, we conducted a search on MEDLINE and clinicaltrials.gov about studies involving SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Expert opinion: HCWs account for a great part of SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 infections, they may also contribute to the spread of the disease, particularly in health-care settings, and contribute to nosocomial outbreaks. Some preventive strategies were evaluated in previous emerging coronavirus epidemics, particularly in MERS-CoV. For COVID-19 prevention, different chemoprophylaxis with drug repositioning and new agents are under evaluation, and different vaccine candidates entered clinical development, with clinical trials.

477410,Tocilizumab in Patients Hospitalized with Covid-19 Pneumonia. Reply,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is occasionally associated with manifold diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). We sought to present the neuroimaging features of such CNS involvement. In addition, we sought to identify typical neuroimaging patterns that could indicate possible COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations. METHODS: In this systematic literature review, typical neuroimaging features of cerebrovascular diseases and inflammatory processes associated with COVID-19 were analyzed. Reports presenting individual patient data were included in further quantitative analysis with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 115 studies reporting a total of 954 COVID-19 patients with associated neurological manifestations and neuroimaging alterations. A total of 95 (82.6%) of the identified studies were single case reports or case series, whereas 660 (69.2%) of the reported cases included individual information and were thus included in descriptive statistical analysis. Ischemia with neuroimaging patterns of large vessel occlusion event was revealed in 59.9% of ischemic stroke patients, whereas 69.2% of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage exhibited bleeding in a location that was not associated with hypertension.

As of today, there are no proven vaccines, therapies, or even strategies to fight off this virus. Here, we describe the in silico docking results of a novel broad range anti-infective fusion protein RTAM-PAP1 against the various key proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest protein-ligand docking software. RTAM-PAP1 was compared against the SARS-CoV-2 B38 antibody, ricin A chain, a pokeweed antiviral protein from leaves, and the lectin griffithsin using the special CoDockPP COVID-19 version. These experiments revealed novel binding mechanisms of RTAM-PAP1 with a high affinity to numerous SARS-CoV-2 key proteins. RTAM-PAP1 was further characterized in a preliminary toxicity study in mice and was found to be a potential therapeutic candidate. These findings might lead to the discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 targets and therapeutic protein structures with outstanding functions.","Hassan, Yasser; Ogg, Sherry; Ge, Hui",Toxins (Basel),,242

OBJECTIVE: It is vital to recognize how the pandemic has affected dermatology practices and identify methods to maximize clinical efficiency while maintaining patient safety. METHODS: Private practice dermatologists in metropolitan areas were interviewed regarding various issues, including patient volume, types of visits or procedures being performed, screening for COVID-19, and operational modifications. RESULTS: On average, there was a 65.2% decrease in patient volume during the initial surge of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was improved to a 15.5% decrease in July 2020. Despite this reduction in patient volume, the proportion of acute dermatologic issues, biopsies performed, and skin cancer concerns were all increased compared to pre-COVID. All of the dermatologists reported notable changes in regards to scheduling, staff, operations, and workplaces. LIMITATIONS: Interview participants were limited to metropolitan dermatologists mainly within the California region. CONCLUSION: Improving patient communication, implementing protocols to facilitate social distancing, and utilizing teledermatology were reported to be essential to optimizing efficiency and safety. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it is important that dermatologists identify specific ways to practice efficiently and effectively, while mitigating the spread of the virus.","Yim, Kaitlyn M; Yim, Rebecca M; Gaspard, Sara; MacDougall, Jamie; Armstrong, April W",J Dermatolog Treat,,242

Ensuring that medical HI systems' decision-making is ethical is key. The use of Team Design Patterns (TDPs) can advance this goal by describing successful and reusable configurations of design problems in which decisions have a moral component, as well as through facilitating communication in multidisciplinary teams designing HI systems. For this research, TDPs were developed to describe a set of solutions for two design problems in a medical HI system: (1) mitigating harmful biases in machine learning algorithms and (2) sharing health and behavioral patient data with healthcare professionals and system developers. The Socio-Cognitive Engineering methodology was employed, integrating operational demands, human factors knowledge, and a technological analysis into a set of TDPs. A survey was created to assess the usability of the patterns on their understandability, effectiveness, and generalizability. The results showed that TDPs are a useful method to unambiguously describe solutions for diverse HI design problems with a moral component on varying abstraction levels, that are usable by a heterogeneous group of multidisciplinary researchers. Additionally, results indicated that the SCE approach and the developed questionnaire are suitable methods for creating and assessing TDPs. The study concludes with a set of proposed improvements to TDPs, including their integration with Interaction Design Patterns, the inclusion of several additional concepts, and a number of methodological improvements. Finally, the thesis recommends directions for future research.","Stijn, Jip van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11211v1.pdf,242

In this report, we aim to further characterize the changes in cardiac catheterization at our institution, specifically in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization between December 23, 2019 and April 12, 2020 at our institution. All patients with cardiac catheterizations for ACS, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) activation, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) were analyzed. Cardiac catheterization volume, as well as clinical and procedural characteristics of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, was compared before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Patients presenting with ACS and OHCA were similar in terms of demographics and comorbidities during both time periods. The mean monthly volume for ACS cases dropped by 26% during the pandemic, which was consistent among both unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and STEMI cases. OHCA volume decreased significantly as well (five cases per month before to zero cases during the pandemic, P = 0.01). Among patients with STEMI, initial markers of cardiac injury, door-to-balloon time, and all-cause mortality were similar in both time periods. Conclusions: With the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in cardiac catheterization volume across the spectrum of ACS at our institution, which was consistent with reports from other centers across the globe. Patients with STEMI during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic did not seem to have delays in presentation or significant differences in all-cause mortality at our institution.","Tan, Weiyi; Parikh, Rushi V.; Chester, Rebecca; Harrell, Jeffrey; Franco, Vanessa; Aksoy, Olcay; Dave, Ravi; Rafique, Asim; Press, Marcella",Cardiol.

The availability of adequate SARS-CoV-2 drugs is also limited, and the efficacy and safety of these drugs for COVID-2019 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. For these reasons, there is a need for other strategies against COVID-19 that are capable of prevention and treatment. Physical exercise has proven to be an effective therapy for most chronic diseases and microbial infections with preventive/therapeutic benefits, considering that exercise involves primary immunological mediators and/or anti-inflammatory properties. This review aimed to provide an insight into how the implementation of a physical exercise program against COVID-19 may be a useful complementary tool for prevention, which can also enhance recovery, improve quality of life, and provide immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the long term. In summary, physical exercise training exerts immunomodulatory effects, controls the viral gateway, modulates inflammation, stimulates nitric oxide synthesis pathways, and establishes control over oxidative stress.","Fernández-Lázaro, Diego; González-Bernal, Jerónimo J; Sánchez-Serrano, Nerea; Navascués, Lourdes Jiménez; Ascaso-Del-Río, Ana; Mielgo-Ayuso, Juan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

METHOD: A prospective single-centre observational study was conducted of patients undergoing tracheostomy, who had been diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonitis, between 21st March and 20th May 2020. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients underwent tracheostomy after a median (interquartile range) of 16 (13-20) days of invasive mechanical ventilation. Median follow-up duration was 32 (23-40) days. Of patients, 86.7 per cent were successfully liberated from invasive mechanical ventilation in a median (interquartile range) of 12 (7-16) days. Moreover, 68.7 per cent were subsequently discharged from hospital. On univariate analysis, there was no difference in outcomes between early (before day 14) and late (day 14 or later) tracheostomy. The mortality rate was 8.6 per cent and no deaths were tracheostomy related. CONCLUSION: Outcomes appear favourable when patients are carefully selected.

484278,Type A aortic dissection in the elderly: One additional reason to pursue healthy ageing,2021,"Influenza virus causes an acute febrile respiratory disease in humans that is commonly known as 'flu'. Influenza virus has been around for centuries and is one of the most successful, and consequently most studied human viruses. This has generated tremendous amount of data and information, thus it is pertinent to summarise these for, particularly interdisciplinary readers. Viruses are acellular organisms and exist at the interface of living and non-living. Due to this unique characteristic, viruses require another organism, i.e. host to survive. Viruses multiply inside the host cell and are obligate intracellular pathogens, because their relationship with the host is almost always harmful to host. In mammalian cells, the life cycle of a virus, including influenza is divided into five main steps: attachment, entry, synthesis, assembly and release. To complete these steps, some viruses, e.g. influenza utilise all three parts - plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, of the cell; whereas others, e.g. SARS-CoV-2 utilise only plasma membrane and cytoplasm. Hence, viruses interact with numerous host factors to complete their life cycle, and these interactions are either exploitative or antagonistic in nature. The host factors involved in the life cycle of a virus could be divided in two broad categories - proviral and antiviral. This perspective has endeavoured to assimilate the information about the host factors which promote and suppress influenza virus infection. Furthermore, an insight into host factors that play a dual role during infection or contribute to influenza virus-host adaptation and disease severity has also been provided.","Husain, Matloob",Emerg Top Life Sci,,242

This cross-sectional study explored possible risk and protective factors that can help explain loneliness and emotional and social loneliness in a sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 477). The survey incorporated a standardized scale of loneliness and items to assess type and quality of contact with others, community support, social isolation, physical health, cognitive health, and functional ability. Bivariate and multivariate analyses explored the factors that contributed to loneliness, emotional loneliness, and social loneliness. Results indicated overall quality of contact with others, use of phone contact, and social isolation was significant in all three regressions; other significant variables were different for each analysis. The findings support social work and public health recommendations for addressing loneliness, particularly within the current climate of ""social distancing"" under the COVID-19 pandemic.","Teater, Barbra; Chonody, Jill M; Davis, Nadia",Soc Work Public Health,,242

METHOD: Case note review of all infants in whom laparoscopy was performed during 2016-2020 to investigate for possible malrotation. RESULTS: Eight infants were identified. All presented with acute clinical features of malrotation (bilious vomit) without evidence of an alternate explanatory diagnosis. All underwent upper gastrointestinal contrast study, with three also undergoing abdominal ultrasound. The radiological examinations could not exclude malrotation and all proceeded to laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, the small intestine was run to exclude the presence of midgut volvulus. In six cases, normal rotation was confirmed and no abnormal pathology was found. Two proceeded to laparotomy and underwent correction of malrotation. All infants recovered without complication. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy is an excellent modality for further investigation of infants presenting acutely in whom intestinal malrotation cannot be formally excluded radiologically. The positive identification of the DJ flexure and cecum in correct anatomical sites, both fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, provides adequate reassurance of low risk of volvulus and avoids a full laparotomy. We recommend diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of inconclusive upper gastrointestinal contrast study.","Sloan, K; Alzamrooni, A; Stedman, F E; Ron, O; Hall, N J",Pediatr. surg. int,,242

In less than three months since the first cases were reported, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic disease. Although several treatment and prevention strategies are currently under investigation, a continuous effort to investigate and develop effective cures is urgently needed. Thus, we performed molecular docking and structure-based virtual screening of libraries of approved drugs, antivirals, inhibitors of protein-protein interactions, and one million other small molecules to identify strong binders of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) that might interfere with the receptor recognition process, so as to inhibit the viral cellular entry. According to our screening and selection criteria, three approved antivirals (elbasvir, grazoprevir, and sovaprevir) and 4 other drugs (hesperidin, pamaqueside, diosmin, and sitogluside) were identified as potent binders of the RBD. The binding of these molecules involved several RBD residues required for the interaction of the virus with its cellular receptor. Furthermore, this study also discussed the pharmacological action of the 4 non-antiviral drugs on hematological and neurological disorders that, in addition to inhibiting the viral entry, could be beneficial against the neurological disorders identified in COVID-19 patients. Besides, six other small-molecules were identified, with no pharmacological description so far, exhibiting strong binding affinities to the RBD that we believe worth being investigated as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2-receptor interaction.","Behloul, Nouredine; Baha, Sarra; Guo, Yuqian; Yang, Zhifang; Shi, Ruihua; Meng, Jihong",Eur J Pharmacol,,242

A descriptive evaluation study with pre-post surveys (n = 21) and post-program interviews (n = 17) was conducted, with a convenience sample of NEST program participants living in Sydney, Newcastle, and Melbourne, Australia. Participants demonstrated improvements in food security status (p = 0.030), cooking confidence (p = 0.001), food preparation behaviours (p = 0.006), nutrition knowledge (p = 0.033), vegetable consumption (p = 0.043), and a reduction in intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (p = 0.017), and salty snack foods (p = 0.011). The interviews revealed that participants learned to stretch their food budgets and make meaningful changes to their food utilisation (a key dimension of food security). Interviews also identified enablers (e.g., social support) and barriers (e.g., health conditions) to achieving food security. Acknowledging the need for a multi-faceted approach that also addresses upstream determinants, interventions like NEST may play a role in promoting food security and food literacy.","West, Elisha G; Lindberg, Rebecca; Ball, Kylie; McNaughton, Sarah A",Nutrients,,242
489906,"Impact of the presence of heart disease, cardiovascular medications and cardiac events on outcome in COVID-19",2021,"Vaccine platforms have been critical for accelerating the timeline of COVID-19 vaccine development. Faster vaccine timelines demand further development of these technologies. Currently investigated platform approaches include virally vectored and RNA-based vaccines, as well as DNA vaccines and recombinant protein expression system platforms, each featuring different advantages and challenges. Viral vector-based and DNA vaccines in particular have received a large share of research funding to date. Platform vaccine technologies may feature dual-use potential through informing or enabling pathogen engineering, which may raise the risk for the occurrence of deliberate, anthropogenic biological events. Research on virally vectored vaccines exhibits relatively high dual-use potential for two reasons. First, development of virally vectored vaccines may generate insights of particular dual-use concern such as techniques for circumventing pre-existing anti-vector immunity. Second, while the amount of work on viral vectors for gene therapy exceeds that for vaccine research, work on virally vectored vaccines may increase the number of individuals capable of engineering viruses of particular concern, such as ones closely related to smallpox. Other platform vaccine approaches, such as RNA vaccines, feature relatively little dual-use potential. The biosecurity risk associated with platform advancement may be minimised by focusing preferentially on circumventing anti-vector immunity with non-genetic rather than genetic modifications, using vectors that are not based on viruses pathogenic to humans, or preferential investment into promising RNA-based vaccine approaches. To reduce the risk of anthropogenic pandemics, structures for the governance of biotechnology and life science research with dual-use potential need to be reworked. Scientists outside of the pathogen research community, for instance those who work on viral vectors or oncolytic viruses, need to become more aware of the dual-use risks associated with their research. Both public and private research-funding bodies need to prioritise the evaluation and reduction of biosecurity risks.","Sandbrink, Jonas B; Koblentz, Gregory D",Vaccine,,242

This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients at our center and aimed to share the lessons we learned with clinics currently experiencing this impact. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data on CRC patients admitted between January 1, 2020 and May 3, 2020; the control group comprised patients admitted between January 1, 2019 and May 3, 2019. RESULTS: During the pandemic, outpatient volumes decreased significantly, especially those of nonlocal and elderly patients, whereas the number of patients who received chemotherapy and surgery remained the same. During the pandemic, 710 CRC patients underwent curative resection. The proportion of patients who received laparoscopic surgeries was 49.4%, significantly higher than the 39.5% during the same period in 2019. The proportion of major complication during the pandemic was not significantly different from that of the control group. The mean hospital stay was significantly longer than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: CRC patients confirmed to be infection-free can receive routine treatment. Using online medical counseling and appropriate identification, treatment and follow-up can be effectively maintained. Adjuvant and palliative chemotherapy should not be discontinued. Endoscopic polypectomy, elective, palliative, and multidisciplinary surgeries can be postponed, while curative surgery should proceed as usual. For elderly CRC patients, endoscopic surgery and neoadjuvant radiotherapy are recommended.","Xu, Yun; Huang, Zong-Hao; Zheng, Charlie Zhi-Lin; Li, Cong; Zhang, Yu-Qin; Guo, Tian-An; Liu, Fang-Qi; Xu, Ye",BMC Gastroenterol,,242

495534,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has highlighted and amplified structural inequalities; drawing attention to issues of racism, poverty, xenophobia as well as arguably ineffective government policies and procedures. In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown have highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: We used qualitative, participatory approaches - specifically draw-and-write methods - to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This response is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","Haffejee, Sadiyya; Levine, Diane Thembekile",Child Abuse Negl,,242
495799,"COMMENT ON AN ARTICLE: ""Coagulopathy in COVID-19""",2020,"In this paper, the researchers argue that the repercussions of the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic are taking a toll on rural women, not as a new phenomenon, but as an amplifier for their historical calamities dovetailed by climate change. The declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organisation ignited widespread pronouncements of national state of disasters in various countries around the globe including Zimbabwe. Subsequently, like other countries, Zimbabwe followed the precautionary measures outlined by the WHO and pronounced its national lockdown to curtail the transmission of the virus. This paper intends to demonstrate how convergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change impacts serves as a double injustice for rural women in Nyanga communities, Zimbabwe. The study was qualitative in nature guided by the descriptive research design. Twenty participants comprising rural women and social workers were selected using purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. The Thematic Content Analysis was followed to analyse the data from which the findings were derived. This study established that the COVID-19 pandemic is enhancing the catastrophic implications created by climate change on rural women whose food security systems are shattered, livelihood strategies maimed, caregiving roles burgeoning, and access to healthcare systems compromised. This daunting double impact is aggravated by gender inequalities, social exclusion and patriarchal dominance. The centrality of social justice to social work connotes that the profession has a tendentious responsibility to stand in the gap and liberate women from the jaws of these double catastrophes (climate change and COVID-19).","Nyahunda, Louis; Chibvura, Shyleen; Tirivangasi, Happy Mathew",J Hum Rights Soc Work,,242

No study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to the infection relapse but however, to date, no human reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our prospective, multicenter, cohort study we investigated within three months all patients, with confirmed COVID-19, discharged from two Hospitals (Legnano and Magenta Hospitals), in an area of Italy severely affected by the infection. Telephone follow-up at 1 and 2 months and clinical contact within 3 months was initiated; demographic, clinical, radiologic and laboratory data were recorded in electronic medical records and updated. RESULTS: Of 1081 patients involved, 804 (74.3%) were discharged alive. For all these patients we obtained follow-up data. At 1 and 2 months none has died and none has had any signs of recurrence of infectious at both telephone interview and clinical visit. CONCLUSION: Our clinical observation have confirmed two basic points: the reinfection is very unlikely and any antibody immunity protects against recurrence, at least in the short term.","Mumoli, Nicola; Vitale, Josè; Mazzone, Antonino",Int J Infect Dis,,242

There has been a rapid increase in multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), including extended-spectrum ß-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), pan-echinocandin-resistant Candida glabrata and multi-triazole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus. The cause is multifactorial and is particularly related to high rates of antimicrobial agent utilisation in COVID-19 patients with a relatively low rate of co- or secondary infection. Appropriate prescription and optimised use of antimicrobials according to the principles of antimicrobial stewardship as well as quality diagnosis and aggressive infection control measures may help prevent the occurrence of MDROs during this pandemic.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Chen, Shey-Ying; Ko, Wen-Chien; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,242

The objectives of the present study were to assess survival and to identify predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients at Kinshasa University Hospital. Methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted, 141 COVID-19 patients admitted at the Kinshasa University Hospital from March 23 to June 15, 2020 were included in the study. Kaplan Meier's method was used to described survival. Predictors of mortality were identified by COX regression models. Results: of the 141 patients admitted with COVID-19, 67.4 % were men (sex ratio 2H: 1F); their average age was 49.6±16.5 years. The mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 29% during the study period with 70% deceased within 24 hours of admission. Survival was decreased with the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low blood oxygen saturation (BOS), severe or critical stage disease. In multivariate analysis, age between 40 and 59 years [adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 4.07; 95% CI: 1.16 - 8.30], age at least 60 years (aHR: 6.65; 95% CI: 1.48-8.88), severe or critical COVID-19 (aHR: 14.05; 95% CI: 6.3-15.67) and presence of dyspnea (aHR: 5.67; 95% CI: 1.46-21.98) were independently and significantly associated with the risk of death. Conclusion: older age, severe or critical COVID-19 and dyspnea on admission were potential predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19.

500279,Management of COVID-19 in hemodialysis patients: The Genoa experience,2020,"On March 12, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic following the exponential increase of SARS-CoV-2 cases. The rapid spread of the virus is due to both its high infectivity and the free circulation of unrecognized infectious cases. Thus, diagnostic testing is a key element to prevent further dissemination of the virus. Urged by WHO's call, laboratories worldwide have been working on nucleic acid tests protocols and immunoassays that became available, albeit poorly validated, within a comparatively short time. Since then, external studies evaluating these diagnostic tests have been published. The present study is a review of the COVID-19 diagnostic approaches, discussing both direct and indirect microbiological diagnoses. A compendium of the literature on commercial assays kits available to date is provided together with the conclusions drawn as well as RT-PCR protocols published by the WHO. Briefly, diagnostic accuracy varies according to time elapsed since symptom onset and evolves together with understanding of the COVID-19 disease. Taking into account all these variables will allow determining the most adequate diagnostic test to use and how to optimize diagnostic testing for COVID-19.","Melo-Vallès, Ada; Ballesté-Delpierre, Clara; Vila, Jordi",Front Public Health,,242

Here we show that there is already a sufficient amount of data collected in Italy to predict the outcome of the process. We show that using the proper metric, the data from Hubei Province and Italy has striking similarity, which enables us to calculate the expected number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths by the end of the process. Our predictions will improve as new data points are generated day by day, which can help to make further public decisions. The method is based on the data analysis of logistic growth equations describing the process on the macroscopic level. At the time of writing of the first version, the number of fatalities in Italy was expected to be 6000, and the predicted end of the crisis was April 15, 2020. In this new version, we discuss what changed in the two weeks which passed since then. The trend changed drastically on March 17, 2020, when the Italian health system reached its capacity limit. Without this limit, probably 3500 more people would have died. Instead, due to the limitations, 17.000 people are expected to die now, which is a five-fold increase.

503486,Evaluation of Antiplatelet and Anticoagulation Therapy in High-Risk COVID-19 Patients,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To model and compare effect of digital contact tracing versus shelter-in-place on severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. METHODS: Using a classical epidemiologic framework and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions - shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing - to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. RESULTS: Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. CONCLUSION: Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","Nuzzo, Andrea; Tan, Can Ozan; Raskar, Ramesh; DeSimone, Daniel C; Kapa, Suraj; Gupta, Rajiv",Mayo Clin Proc,,242
504089,Impact of Preoperative and Incident Musculoskeletal Problematic Areas on Postoperative Outcomes after Total Knee Replacement,2021,"BACKGROUNDIncreasing reports of long-term symptoms following COVID-19 infection, even among mild cases, necessitates systematic investigation into the prevalence and type of lasting illness. Notably, there is limited data regarding the influence of social determinants of health, like perceived discrimination and economic stress, which may exacerbate COVID-19 health risks. The primary goals of this study are to test the bearing of subjective experiences of discrimination, financial security, and quality of care on illness severity and lasting symptom complaints. METHODS1,584 recovered COVID-19 patients that experienced mild to severe forms of the disease provided information about their illness, medical history, lasting symptoms, and psychosocial information. Prevalence data isolated differences in patients infected early versus late in the pandemic. Path analyses examined hypothesized associations between discrimination, illness severity, and lasting symptoms. Post hoc logistic regressions tested social determinants hypothesized to predict neurological, cognitive, or mood symptoms. RESULTS70.6% of patients reported presence of one or more lasting symptoms after recovery. Neural systems were especially impacted, and 19.4% and 25.1% of patients reported mood or cognitive/memory complaints, respectively. Path models demonstrated that frequency and stress about experiences of discrimination predicted increased illness severity and increased lasting symptom count, even when adjusting for sociodemographic factors and mental/physical health comorbidities. Notably, this effect was specific to stress related to discrimination, and did not extend to general stress levels. Further, perceived but not objective socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with increased lasting symptom complaints after recovery. Finally, associations between discrimination and illness differed with individual perceptions about quality of medical care. CONCLUSIONSLasting symptoms after recovery from COVID-19 are highly prevalent and neural systems are significantly impacted. Importantly, psychosocial factors (perceived discrimination and perceived SES) can exacerbate individual health risk. This study provides actionable directions for improved health outcomes by establishing that sociodemographic risk and medical care influence near and long-ranging health outcomes.","Thomason, Moriah; Hendrix, Cassandra L; Werchan, Denise; Brito, Natalie H",,,242
504187,Clinical and Radiological Profiles of COVID-19 Patients with Neurological Symptomatology: A Comparative Study,2021,"MERS is a life-threatening disease and MERS-CoV has the potential to cause the next pandemic. Protein acetylation is known to play a crucial role in host response to viral infection. Acetylation of viral proteins encoded by other RNA viruses have been reported to affect viral replication. It is therefore of interest to see whether MERS-CoV proteins are also acetylated. Viral proteins obtained from infected cells were trypsin-digested into peptides. Acetylated peptides were enriched by immunoprecipitation and subject to nano-LC-Orbitrap analysis. Bioinformatic analysis was performed to assess the conservation level of identified acetylation sites and to predict the upstream regulatory factors. A total of 12 acetylation sites were identified from 7 peptides, which all belong to the replicase polyprotein pp1ab. All identified acetylation sites were found to be highly conserved across MERS-CoV sequences in NCBI database. Upstream factors, including deacetylases of the SIRT1 and HDAC families as well as acetyltransferases of the TIP60 family, were predicted to be responsible for regulating the acetylation events identified. Western blotting confirms that acetylation events indeed occur on pp1ab protein by expressing NSP4 in HEK293 cells. Acetylation events on MERS-CoV viral protein pp1ab were identified for the first time, which indicate that MERS-CoV might use the host acetylation machinery to regulate its enzyme activity and to achieve optimal replication. Upstream factors were predicted, which might facilitate further analysis of the regulatory mechanism of MERS-CoV replication.","Zhu, Lin; Fung, Sin-Yee; Xie, Guangshan; Wong, Lok-Yin Roy; Jin, Dong-Yan; Cai, Zongwei",Mol Cell Proteomics,,242
504385,The Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID): Development of Case Report Forms for Global Use,2020,"Protecting worker and public health involves an understanding of multiple determinants, including exposures to biological, chemical, or physical agents or stressors in combination with other determinants including type of employment, health status, and individual behaviors. This has been illustrated during the COVID-19 pandemic by increased exposure and health risks for essential workers and those with pre-existing conditions, and mask-wearing behavior. Health risk assessment practices for environmental and occupational health typically do not incorporate multiple stressors in combination with personal risk factors. While conceptual developments in cumulative risk assessment to inform a more holistic approach to these real-life conditions have progressed, gaps remain, and practical methods and applications are rare. This scoping review characterizes existing evidence of combined stressor exposures and personal factors and risk to foster methods for occupational cumulative risk assessment. The review found examples from many workplaces, such as manufacturing, offices, and health care; exposures to chemical, physical, and psychosocial stressors combined with modifiable and unmodifiable determinants of health; and outcomes including respiratory function and disease, cancers, cardio-metabolic diseases, and hearing loss, as well as increased fertility, menstrual dysfunction and worsened mental health. To protect workers, workplace exposures and modifiable and unmodifiable characteristics should be considered in risk assessment and management. Data on combination exposures can improve assessments and risk estimates and inform protective exposure limits and management strategies.","Fox, Mary A; Niemeier, Richard Todd; Hudson, Naomi; Siegel, Miriam R; Dotson, Gary Scott",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

506671,Changes in endoscopic patterns before and during COVID-19 outbreak: Experience at a single tertiary center in Korean,2021,"A local disruption can propagate to forward and downward through the material flow and eventually influence the entire supply chain network (SCN). This phenomenon of ripple effect, immensely existing in practice, has received great interest in recent years. Moreover, forward and backward disruption propagations became major stressors for SCNs during the COVID-19 pandemic triggered by simultaneous and sequential supply and demand disruptions. However, current literature has paid less attention to the different impacts of the directions of disruption propagation. This study examines the disruption propagation through simulating simple interaction rules of firms inside the SCN. Specifically, an agent-based computational model is developed to delineate the supply chain disruption propagation behavior. Then, we conduct multi-level quantitative analysis to explore the effects of forward and backward disruption propagation, moderated by network structure, network-level health and node-level vulnerability. Our results demonstrate that it is practically important to differentiate between forward and backward disruption propagation, as they are distinctive in the associated mitigation strategies and in the effects on network and individual firm performance. Forward disruption propagation generally can be mitigated by substitute and backup supply and has greater impact on firms serving the assembly role and on the supply/assembly networks, whereas backward disruption propagation is normally mitigated by flexible operation and distribution and has bigger impact on firms serving the distribution role and on distribution networks. We further analyze the investment strategies in a dual-focal supply network under disruption propagation. We provide propositions to facilitate decision-making and summarize important managerial implications.","Li, Yuhong; Chen, Kedong; Collignon, Stephane; Ivanov, Dmitry",European journal of operational research,,242

METHOD: The patient group (n = 84) and the healthy controls (HCs, n = 92) filled in the questionnaire including the socio-demographic form, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale, and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced through the online survey link. RESULTS: The COVID-19 patients had higher perceived social support and coping strategies scores than the HCs. However, anxiety and depression scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. In logistic regression analysis performed in COVID-19 patients, the presence of chest CT finding (OR = 4.31; 95% CI = 1.04-17.95) was a risk factor for anxiety and the use of adaptive coping strategies (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.73-0.99) had a negative association with anxiety. In addition, the use of adaptive coping strategies (OR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.79-0.98) and high perceived social support (OR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.93- 0,99) had a negative association with depression symptoms.

507509,CT scan of a COVID-positive patient,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a life threatening novel corona viral infection to our civilization and spreading rapidly. Terrific efforts are generous by the researchers to search for a drug to control SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Here, a series of arsenical derivatives were optimized and analyzed with in silico study to search the inhibitor of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the major replication factor of SARS-CoV-2. All the optimized derivatives were blindly docked with RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 using iGEMDOCK v2.1. RESULTS: Based on the lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp, darinaparsin (-82.52 kcal/mol) revealed most effective among them. Darinaparsin strongly binds with both Nsp9 replicase protein (-8.77 kcal/mol) and Nsp15 endoribonuclease (-8.3 kcal/mol) of SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed from the AutoDock analysis. During infection, the ssRNA of SARS-CoV2 is translated into large polyproteins forming viral replication complex by specific proteases like 3CL protease and papain protease. This is also another target to control the virus infection where darinaparsin also perform the inhibitory role to proteases of 3CL protease (-7.69 kcal/mol) and papain protease (-8.43 kcal/mol). CONCLUSION: In host cell, the furin protease serves as a gateway to the viral entry and darinaparsin docked with furin protease which revealed a strong binding affinity. Thus, screening of potential arsenic drugs would help in providing the fast invitro to in-vivo analysis towards development of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Chowdhury, Trinath; Roymahapatra, Gourisankar; Mandal, Santi M",Infectious disorders.

508315,Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 patients in Himachal Pradesh (India) and the absence of dengue false-positive tests: Insights for patient management,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has recently started worldwide. As the vaccine supply will be limited for a considerable period of time in many countries, it is important to devise the effective vaccination strategies that reduce the number of deaths and incidence of infection. One of the characteristics of COVID-19 is that the symptom, severity, and mortality of the disease differ by age. Thus, when the vaccination supply is limited, age-dependent vaccination priority strategy should be implemented to minimize the incidences and mortalities. In this study, we developed an age-structured model for describing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, including vaccination. Using the model and actual epidemiological data in Korea, we estimated the infection probability for each age group under different levels of social distancing implemented in Korea and investigated the effective age-dependent vaccination strategies to reduce the confirmed cases and fatalities of COVID-19. We found that, in a lower level of social distancing, vaccination priority for the age groups with the highest transmission rates will reduce the incidence mostly, but, in higher levels of social distancing, prioritizing vaccination for the elderly age group reduces the infection incidences more effectively. To reduce mortalities, vaccination priority for the elderly age group is the best strategy in all scenarios of levels of social distancing. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of vaccine supply and efficacy on the reduction in incidence and mortality.","Choi, Yongin; Kim, James Slghee; Kim, Jung Eun; Choi, Heejin; Lee, Chang Hyeong",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,242

The majority of the measured variables were shown to depend on the institution, the academic major, and the semester of study, although to a varying degree. Data analysis provided evidence for a statistically significant lower level of emotional engagement in the online relative to the traditional learning environment among the students of all three undergraduate learning communities. Multiple regression analysis showed that this documented decrease in students' emotional engagement is largely explained by the concurrent decrease at the level of human interaction (either student-student or student-instructor) upon the passage from the traditional to the online learning environment.","Salta, Katerina; Paschalidou, Katerina; Tsetseri, Maria; Koulougliotis, Dionysios",Sci Educ (Dordr),,242

The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×106 CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level.

When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might up-regulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers.","Li, Jiajun; Li, Wanqiang; Wang, Zhenhua; Khalique, Abdul; Wang, Junrui; Yang, Miao; Ni, Xueqin; Zeng, Dong; Zhang, Dongmei; Zeng, Yan; Luo, Qihui; Jing, Bo; Pan, Kangcheng",PLoS One,,242

In this case-based review, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, imaging findings, and in-hospital course of acute myocarditis. In addition, the limitations of the myocarditis diagnosis were discussed since only fulminant myocarditis cases have been mentioned in the current literature. METHODS We performed a review of the literature of all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane. RESULTS 16 case reports were found to be related to COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis. We observed that the ECG findings in most of the COVID-19 patients were non-specific, including diffuse ST-segment elevation, non-specific intraventricular conduction delay, sinus tachycardia, and inverted T-waves in anterior leads. Echocardiographic findings of COVID-19-induced acute myocarditis patients ranged from preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) without segmental abnormalities to reduced LVEF with global hypokinesia. Interestingly, a few patients with COVID-19-induced acute fulminant myocarditis were steroid-responsive and had an amelioration with glucocorticoid and immunoglobulin therapy. CONCLUSION Despite the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, a limited number of cases has been shared in the current literature.

510520,Shifting workstyle to teleworking as a new normal in face of COVID-19: Analysis with the model introducing intercity movement and behavioral pattern,2020,"Automotive mechanics are reported to have lower lung function indices. Spray painting is associated with impairment of lung function among spray painters. It is a common practice by auto repairers in Calabar to operate in the vicinity of spray painting shops. Whether such dual exposure to auto repair and spray painting environments worsens the lung function of auto mechanics is not documented. Lung function was evaluated in 300 males divided into three groups: control (group1), auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops (group 2) and auto mechanics working in the vicinity of spray painting shops (group 3). Each group consisted of 100 subjects. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in the first second expressed as percentage of FVC (FEV1%) were assessed using a Vitalograph spirometer. Percentage oxygen saturation was evaluated using a pulse oximeter. Results showed no significant differences in age, weight and height among various groups. FVC was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) compared to control but not between groups 2 and 3. FEV1 was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (P <0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3. FEV1% was significantly lower in groups 2 and 3 (p< 0.001 each) compared with control but not between groups 2 and 3. The PEFR was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.001 each) compared with control but not significantly different between groups 2 and 3. Percentage oxygen saturation was significantly reduced in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05 and p<0.001 respectively) and also significantly lower in group 2 compared with group 3 (p<0.01). In conclusion, auto mechanics in auto repair only and auto repair shops shared with spray painters have lower lung function compared with control but no significant difference in lung function between auto mechanics in stand-alone auto repair shops compared with those in auto repair shops shared with spray painters.","Aribo, Ekpe",Niger J Physiol Sci,,242

510641,Lung ultrasound in the frontline diagnosis of COVID-19 infection,2020,"Cannabis sativa is a well-known plant which has been of benefit since ancient times in several medicinal systems, including Chinese, Indian, Greek and Egyptian ones. Although C. sativa is one of the most investigated medicinal plants in the world, it faces the most controversial of issues for its legalization as a medication. C. sativa contains several hundreds of phytoconstituents including the infamous «cannabinoid."" It is necessary to properly understand the medicinal importance of these phytochemicals and spread awareness among the countries where it's still facing legal complexities. The current review is focusing on most recent literature pertaining to the various applications of cannabinoids with a special focus on medicinal aspect of the phytochemicals. Peer reviewed articles focusing on the importance of cannabis and cannabinoids were the target of this review. Articles were selected based on the relevance to the general scope of the work i.e. application of cannabinoids. Cannabinoids can truly be regarded as wonder drug keeping their immense diversity of usage but unfortunately, many of the mares never researched biologically or pharmacologically due to their low yield in the plant. However, the approval of some cannabinoids by the FDA (along with other recognized national medical health systems) has opened the horizons for the explicit use of these natural drugs in medicines such as Epidiolex® (cannabidiol used for the treatment of severe forms of epilepsy) and Sativex®('&#916;9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol' used for the treatment of spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis, aka: MS.) Many pharmacological properties of C. sativa are attributed to cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component, along with &#916;9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (&#916;9 -THC), a psychoactive component. This review addresses the most important application or current utilization of cannabinoids in a variety of treatments such as: chronic pain, cancer, emesis, anorexia, irritable bowel syndrome, communicative diseases, glaucoma and central nervous system disorders. The biosynthetic pathway of cannabinoids is also discussed. In short, this plant has a myriad of bioactive compounds which have the potential to increase the list of approved cannabinoids suitable for therapy.","Khalid, Shah; Almalki, Faisal A; Ben Hadda, Taibi; Bader, Ammar; Abu-Izneid, Tareq; Berredjem, Malika; Elsharkawy, Eman R; Alqahtani, Ali M",Curr. pharm. des,,242

A karez system is an underground water collection system, prevalent in the Turpan basin of China. Sources and the associated methodology have become more important today, because of contemporary issues such as modernisation, urbanisation and agricultural expansion. These problems make it harder to read the landscape, which is why we have to start extracting our data from maps, reports, photographs, and satellite imagery. We will give a short overview of sources, each with an explanation of their processing method. Despite certain cautions that should be taken into account, these methods clearly complement the current state of knowledge on the Turpan karez.

In this study, we draw from a nationally representative sample of American adults to examine the associations between exposure to different media and platforms (mainstream, conservative, liberal or social media) and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation measures such as physical distancing and mask use. We also examine the individual and social factors associated with adherence to mitigation measures. We find that exposure to conservative outlets, being republican, having low confidence in scientists and high perception of information overload are associated with low adherence. In contrast, exposure to liberal and mainstream news outlets, being democrat, having high confidence in scientists, and low perception of information overload are associated with high adherence. The findings suggest the need for consistent and unified public health messaging that cuts across partisan splits and the growing skepticism in science.","Bekalu, Mesfin A; Dhawan, Dhriti; McCloud, Rachel; Pinnamaneni, Ramya; Viswanath, Kasisomayajula",Health educ. res,,242

We would like to present some of important findings previously published there. First, we present the history of the JSBR. Secondly, we will focus on paced breathing, which is instrumental in achieving relaxation in heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF). We will look back on the origin of slow-paced breathing in Japan, that could be attributed to the concept of Tanden breathing (abdominal paced breathing) practiced in Zen meditation. Thirdly, we will introduce some of the current research progresses of JSBR, especially focusing on the development of a non-contact sensing technology and relaxation device. Finally, we will explain about a very recent trial, the ""Suu-Haa"" Relaxation Technique, which we hope may be useful for helping people cope with the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) crisis.","Oikawa, Leo O; Hirota, Akihisa; Uratani, Hiroki; Sakakibara, Masahito",Appl. psychophysiol. biofeedback,,242

METHODS: Meta-analysis was conducted using Medcalc 16.8 version software. Standardized mean differences (SMD), odds ratios (OR), and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CI) were determined appropriately. The Cochran Q statistic and the I2 test were used to assess studies' heterogeneity. RESULTS: GnRH-agonists were shown to correlate with fewer cancelled IVF/ICSI cycles (p = 0.044, OR = 1.268 > 1, 95% CI 1.007, 1.598), a larger number of embryos transferred (p = 0.008, SMD = - 0.230, 95% CI - 0.400, - 0.0599), and more clinical pregnancies (p = 0.018, OR = 0.748 < 1, 95% CI 0.588, 0.952). However, GnRH-antagonists resulted in a significantly shorter duration of ovarian stimulation (p = 0.007, SMD = - 0.426. 95% CI - 0.736, - 0.115). The number of oocytes and mature oocytes retrieved in both protocols did not differ statistically (p = 0.216, SMD = - 0.130, 95% CI - 0.337, 0.0763 and p = 0.807, SMD = - 0.0203, 95% CI - 0.183, 0.142, respectively). Moreover, a high heterogeneity among studies was observed regarding duration of ovarian stimulation (I2 = 90.6%), number of oocytes (I2 = 82.83%)/mature oocytes retrieved (I2 = 70.39%), and embryos transferred (I2 = 72.83%). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present meta-analysis, agonist protocols could be suggested as a first choice approach, in terms of effectiveness. Due to the high studies' heterogeneity, results should be considered with caution. Accordingly, larger cohort studies and meta-analyses like the present one will enhance the robustness of the emerging results to identify the ideal protocol for poor responders.","Papamentzelopoulou, Myrto; Stavros, Sofoklis; Mavrogianni, Despoina; Kalantzis, Christos; Loutradis, Dimitrios; Drakakis, Petros",Arch. gynecol. obstet,,242

514380,Predictive factors for a severe course of COVID-19 infection in myasthenia gravis patients with an overall impact on myasthenic outcome status and survival,2021,"BACKGROUND: Serological test is helpful in confirming and tracking infectious diseases in large population with the advantage of fast and convenience. Using the specific epitope peptides identified from the whole antigen as the detection antigen is sensitive and relatively economical. The development of epitope peptide-based detection kits for COVID-19 patients requires comprehensive information about epitope peptides. But the data on B cell epitope of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is still limited. More importantly, there is a lack of serological data on the peptides in the population. In this study, we aimed to identify the B cell epitope peptides of spike protein and detect the reactivity in serum samples, for further providing data support for their subsequent serological applications. RESULTS: Two B cell linear epitopes, P104 and P82, located in non-RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were identified by indirect ELISA screening of an overlapping peptide library of the S protein with COVID-19 patients' convalescent serum. And the peptides were verified by testing with 165 serum samples. P104 has not been reported previously; P82 is contained in peptide S21P2 reported before. The positive reaction rates of epitope peptides S14P5 and S21P2, the two non-RBD region epitopes identified by Poh et al., and P82 and P104 were 77.0%, 73.9%, 61.2% and 30.3%, respectively, for 165 convalescent sera, including 30 asymptomatic patients. Although P104 had the lowest positive rate for total patients (30.3%), it exhibited slight advantage for detection of asymptomatic infections (36.7%). Combination of epitopes significantly improved the positive reaction rate. Among all combination patterns, (S14P5 + S21P2 + P104) pattern exhibited the highest positive reaction rate for all patients (92.7%), as well as for asymptomatic infections (86.7%), confirming the feasibility of P104 as supplementary antigen for serological detection. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between epitopes with neutralizing antibody, but only S14P5 had a medium positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titre (rs = 0.510, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our research proved that epitopes on non-RBD region are of value in serological detection especially when combination more than one epitope, thus providing serological reaction information about the four epitopes, which has valuable references for their usage.","Zhang, Yunwen; Yang, Zhengrong; Tian, Sicheng; Li, Baisheng; Feng, Tiejian; He, Jianfan; Jiang, Min; Tang, Xiujuan; Mei, Shujiang; Li, Hao; Zhong, Yifan; Li, Guilian; Tang, Mingyuan; Liu, Sijing; Tang, Tian; Wang, Chuan; Wang, Xiaohui",BMC Microbiol,,242

517168,Benefit v. risk when using chloroquine in patients with severe COVID-19 disease,2020,"OCD has lagged behind other psychiatric illnesses in the identification of molecular treatment targets, due in part to a lack of significant findings in genome-wide association studies. However, while progress in this area is being made, OCD's symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, and anxiety can be deconstructed into distinct neural functions that can be dissected in animal models. Studies in rodents and non-human primates have highlighted the importance of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits in OCD pathophysiology, and emerging studies in human post-mortem brain tissue point to glutamatergic synapse abnormalities as a potential cellular substrate for observed dysfunctional behaviors. In addition, accumulated evidence points to a potential role for neuromodulators including serotonin and dopamine in both OCD pathology and treatment. Here, we review current efforts to use animal models for the identification of molecules, cell types, and circuits relevant to OCD pathophysiology. We start by describing features of OCD that can be modeled in animals, including circuit abnormalities and genetic findings. We then review different strategies that have been used to study OCD using animal model systems, including transgenic models, circuit manipulations, and dissection of OCD-relevant neural constructs. Finally, we discuss how these findings may ultimately help to develop new treatment strategies for OCD and other related disorders.","Chamberlain, Brittany L; Ahmari, Susanne E",Curr. top. behav. neurosci.

While RT-PCR assays are used routinely to diagnose active COVID-19, serological testing offers a means of identifying individuals who previously experienced asymptomatic infections, as well as those who experienced symptomatic infections but no longer carry the virus. METHODS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies in the sera of 673 blood donors residing in south-western Germany before and 3,880 donors after the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was determined and confirmed using two highly sensitive serological tests. RESULTS: Approximately 0.40% of the donors assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic possessed SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive antibodies, decidedly fewer than the percentage of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals determined by real-time RT-PCR nationwide. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the efficacy serological testing in identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.","Runkel, Stefan; Kowalzik, Frank; Gehring, Stephan; Winter, Julia; Grandt, Caine L; Marron, Manuela; Seifert-Hitzler, Susanne; Hitzler, Walter E",Clin. lab,,242

518499,Editorial: Understanding immune effects of oestrogens to explain the reduced morbidity and mortality in female versus male COVID-19 patients. Comparisons with autoimmunity and vaccination,2020,"Since early 2020, the world suffers from a new beta-coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that has devastating effects globally due to its associated disease, Covid-19. Until today, Covid-19, which not only causes life-threatening lung infections but also impairs various other organs and tissues, has killed hundreds of thousands of people and caused irreparable damage to many others. Since the very onset of the pandemic, huge efforts were made worldwide to fully understand this virus and numerous studies were, and still are, published. Many of these deal with structural analyses of the viral spike glycoprotein and with vaccine development, antibodies and antiviral molecules or immunomodulators that are assumed to become essential tools in the struggle against the virus. This paper summarizes knowledge on the properties of the four structural proteins (spike protein S, membrane protein M, envelope protein E and nucleocapsid protein N) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its relatives, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that emerged few years earlier. Moreover, attention is paid to ways to analyze such proteins using freely available bioinformatic tools and, more importantly, to bring these proteins alive by looking at them on a computer/laptop screen with the easy-to-use but highly performant and interactive molecular graphics program DeepView. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate non-bioinformaticians and non-specialists in structural biology to scrutinize these and other macromolecules and as such will contribute to establishing procedures to fight these and maybe other forthcoming viruses.","Beeckmans, S.; Van Driessche, E.",Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,,242
519079,Manual lymphatic drainage treatment for lymphedema: a systematic review of the literature,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Due to the high demand for information regarding COVID-19 vaccination in people with epilepsy (PWE), we assessed the symptoms and seizure control of PWE following their COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: All adult patients who were treated at our center were asked to report on their vaccination status and, if vaccinated, about their experiences following their first COVID-19 vaccination with regard to adverse effects and seizure control. RESULTS: Fifty-four PWE have already received their first vaccination against COVID-19 (27 female, 20% seizure free, 96<% on antiseizure medication) and were included in the study. Two-thirds tolerated the vaccines generally either very well or well. Thirty-three percent reported general vaccination adverse effects. The most frequently reported general adverse effects were, in descending order, headache, fatigue and fever, and shivering. With regard to epilepsy-related adverse effects, one patient reported increased seizure frequency one day after the first COVID-19 vaccination was administered, and one reported the occurrence of a new seizure type. None of the patients reported a status epilepticus or aggravation of preexisting adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that vaccination against COVID-19 appears to be well tolerated in PWE, supporting the recommendation of vaccination to PWE.","von Wrede, Randi; Pukropski, Jan; Moskau-Hartmann, Susanna; Surges, Rainer; Baumgartner, Tobias",Epilepsy Behav,,242

521299,"Predictors of Severity in Covid-19 Patients in Casablanca, Morocco",2020,"After initial reluctance masks have emerged as an important means of restricting the spread of SARS-CoV­2, the new coronavirus causing COVID-19. Other simple measures are keeping a distance of at least 1â¯½â¯m from other persons and observing hygiene recommendations, including washing or even disinfecting the hands, coughing into the crook of the arm and remaining at home when sick. Combining the initial letters of the German words for the three measures (Abstand-Hygiene-Alltagsmaske, distance-hygiene-face mask) the acronym AHA was formed, a colloquial German word meaning that the speaker understood the information presented. This acronym was later extended by the letter ""L"", initial letter of ""Lüften"" meaning air ventilation for indoor rooms and arriving at AHA­L, recommended by the federal German Health Institute the Robert Koch Institute. In fact, masks including surgical masks and face coverings can form an effective barrier against the spread of the virus: protecting other people from droplets expelled from the throat of the speaker wearing a mask and even in part protecting the wearer from inhaling droplets emanating from other peoples' throats. Studies to find out if wearing masks might impose risks did not find essential problems: alterations of respiratory parameters due to an increased airway resistance remained within normal limits in healthy adults and even in asthmatics whose disease was well controlled; however, many adults expressed their unease with masks describing them as cumbersome and inconvenient. Emotional resistance against masks made it increasingly more difficult for them to use a mask. Efficient application of masks requires, in addition to a logical explanation of its effect, the evocation of empathy for vulnerable people who can be protected from catching a possibly deadly disease. In children there are very few data on adverse effects of wearing a mask although there is ample experience in children with serious diseases compromising defense against infectious agents acquired via respiratory mucus membranes; however, when using masks appropriately in children relevant adverse effects have not been reported and are not to be expected. Masks should only be used in children when they are healthy and awake and can remove the masks themselves anytime they like. Children 10 years or older can use masks efficiently when they have been informed beforehand appropriate to their age. Under these conditions they can also be obliged to wear masks in certain situations, for example while walking through the school building to their desk in class. To limit the period of wearing a mask normally they will be allowed to remove the mask when sitting in class and keeping their distance. Children in primary schools may use masks, but they should not be obliged to wear them and children in kindergartens should not use masks. This exemption of younger children does not expose school and kindergarten teachers to additional risks since the infectivity with SARS-CoV­2 is age-dependent and increases with age reaching adult values only after 12 years of age.","Huppertz, Hans-Iko; Berner, Reinhard; Schepker, Renate; Kopp, Matthias; Oberle, Andreas; Fischbach, Thomas; Rodeck, Burkhard; Knuf, Markus; Keller, Matthias; Simon, Arne; Hübner, Johannes",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,242

In this paper, we explore the connections between media framing of disasters, and risk communication and preparedness. Through the case of media coverage of eleven newspapers (international and national publications) around the event of Cyclone Amphan in South Asia, we portray a strong media framing around the event. Our findings are three-fold. Firstly, the response system in India and Bangladesh could not follow pre-determined disaster action plans and protocols for a coordinated response, due to the risks and restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic. Secondly, the journalistic response to cyclone Amphan framed the disaster event as ‘natural’, thus reinforcing the reliance on a short-term Response & Recovery centric approach (evacuation, rescue, and relief), over long-term approaches such as disaster preparedness and prevention (adaptation, mitigation, and resilience). Finally, we find that media framing focused on personal stories of individuals helps advance the needs of vulnerable groups;yet at the same time concretizes a relief-centric approach that ignores questions around disaster infrastructure, resilience, and climate change adaptation. We contend that an integrated risk communication approach that is adaptive, takes into account multiple risks and complexities while allowing coordinated efforts between actors and institutions is necessary to develop an effective response policy for disasters and climate-induced extreme events in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Parida, D.; Moses, S.; Rahaman, K.

O microrganismo responsável pela doença é a Salmonella spp.. Esta doença, gera anualmente diversos surtos em vários países, assim como grandes prejuízos econômicos. Este agente é muito prevalente na indústria de produção de aves, por ser naturalmente presente no trato gastrointestinal das aves. A pesquisa, identificação e quantificação da Salmonella spp. é de grande interesse e importância para a indústria e consumidores afim de garantir um produto final seguro. Contudo, os métodos de detecção convencionais e atuais são laboriosos e exigem um período de 5 a 7 dias para conclusão do diagnóstico, além de fornecerem apenas dados de caráter qualitativo. Desta forma, o presente trabalho foi desenvolvido com o intuito de reduzir o tempo de detecção e fornecer resultados quantitativos utilizando uma associação das técnicas de Número Mais Provável Miniaturizado (mNMP) e Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Após padronização da técnica constatou-se sua aplicabilidade em amostras artificialmente contaminadas, posteriormente, 50 carcaças de frango congeladas obtidas do mercado local. Estas amostras foram submetidos a técnica de microbiologia tradicional à partir da Bacteriological Analytical Methods (BAM) e à associação de mNMP e qPCR. Os resultados obtidos indicaram uma frequência de 38% Salmonella spp., quando analisados os dados de ambas as técnicas aplicadas. A microbiologia convencional foi capaz de detectar 8% de positividade, enquanto a técnica associada de mNMP e qPCR detectou 34%. O intervalo de detecção das técnicas associadas foi de aproximadamente 36 horas e a partir destas foi possível quantificar a contaminação pelo agente. A quantificação das amostras positivas foi expressa em NMP/g e variou entre 0,35 NMP/g e 59NMP/g, sendo esta quantificação, um dado alarmante, que indica um grau de contaminação importante neste tipo de produto.","GASPAR, BRUNO MELO",,,242
589903,Myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients is associated with the thickness of epicardial adipose tissue,2021,"The major enteric RNA viruses in pigs include porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine rotavirus A (PRV‐A), porcine kobuvirus (PKV), porcine sapovirus (PSaV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). For differential diagnosis, a multiplex RT‐PCR method was established on the basis of the N genes of TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV, the VP7 gene of PRV‐A, and the polyprotein genes of PKV and PSaV. This multiplex RT‐PCR could specifically detect TGEV, PEDV, PDCoV, PRV‐A, PKV and PSaV without cross‐reaction to any other major viruses circulating in Chinese pig farms. The limit of detection of this method was as low as 10(0)–10(1) ng cDNA of each virus. A total of 398 swine faecal samples collected from nine provinces of China between October 2015 and April 2017 were analysed by this established multiplex RT‐PCR. The results demonstrated that PDCoV (144/398), PSaV (114/398), PEDV (78/398) and PRV‐A (70/398) were the main pathogens, but TGEV was not found in the pig herds in China. In addition, dual infections, for example, PDCoV + PSaV, PDCoV + PRV‐A, PRA‐V + PSaV and PEDV + PDCoV, and triple infections, for example, PDCoV + PRV‐A + PSaV and PEDV + PDCoV + PKV, were found among the collected samples. The multiplex RT‐PCR provided a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of swine enteric viruses circulating in Chinese pig farms and will facilitate the prevention and control of swine diarrhoea in China.","Ding, Guangming; Fu, Yuguang; Li, Baoyu; Chen, Jianing; Wang, Jianlin; Yin, Baishuang; Sha, Wanli; Liu, Guangliang",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597013/; https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13385,242

Protruding from the viral surface is a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, which engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host cell entry. However, studies have reported viral susceptibility in intra- and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking ACE2, suggesting that the S protein may exploit additional receptors for infection. Studies have demonstrated interactions between S protein and innate immune system, including C-lectin type receptors (CLR), toll-like receptors (TLR) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and the non-immune receptor glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78). Recognition of carbohydrate moieties clustered on the surface of the S protein may drive receptor-dependent internalization, accentuate severe immunopathological inflammation, and allow for systemic spread of infection, independent of ACE2. Furthermore, targeting TLRs, CLRs, and other receptors (Ezrin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4) that do not directly engage SARS-CoV-2 S protein, but may contribute to augmented anti-viral immunity and viral clearance, may represent therapeutic targets against COVID-19.","Gadanec, Laura Kate; McSweeney, Kristen Renee; Qaradakhi, Tawar; Ali, Benazir; Zulli, Anthony; Apostolopoulos, Vasso",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22030992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498183/,242

The aim was to assess centering, scan length, and positioning of patients undergoing chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia and to investigate their effect on associated radiation doses. METHODS: With respective approvals from institutional review boards, we compiled CT imaging and radiation dose data from four hospitals belonging to four countries (Brazil, Iran, Italy, and USA) on 400 adult patients who underwent chest CT for suspected or known COVID-19 pneumonia between April 2020 and August 2020. We recorded patient demographics and volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) and dose length product (DLP). From thin-section CT images of each patient, we estimated the scan length and recorded the first and last vertebral bodies at the scan start and end locations. Patient mis-centering and arm position were recorded. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: The extent and frequency of patient mis-centering did not differ across the four CT facilities (>0.09). The frequency of patients scanned with arms by their side (11–40% relative to those with arms up) had greater mis-centering and higher CTDI(vol) and DLP at 2/4 facilities (p = 0.027–0.05). Despite lack of variations in effective diameters (p = 0.14), there were significantly variations in scan lengths, CTDI(vol) and DLP across the four facilities (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mis-centering, over-scanning, and arms by the side are frequent issues with use of chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia and are associated with higher radiation doses.","Ebrahimian, Shadi; Oliveira Bernardo, Monica; Alberto Moscatelli, Antônio; Tapajos, Juliana; Leitão Tapajós, Luciano; Jamil Khoury, Helen; Babaei, Rosa; Karimi Mobin, Hadi; Mohseni, Iman; Arru, Chiara; Carriero, Alessandro; Falaschi, Zeno; Pasche, Alessio; Saba, Luca; Homayounieh, Fatemeh; Bizzo, Bernardo C.; Vassileva, Jenia; Kalra, Mannudeep K.",Phys Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmp.2021.04.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1120179721001538; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33894582/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1120179721001538,242

Furthermore, using real data of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we calibrate the Lattice-SIRQL model for 105 countries. The calibrated model is used to make country specific recommendations for lockdown relaxation and lockdown continuation. Finally, using an agent-based model we analyse the influence of cluster level relaxation rate and lockdown duration on the spread of the disease.","Timothy, J.

However, the biological mechanisms behind these conditions remain unexplored. Herein, we report on changes of the immune transcriptome in autoptic thyroid tissues of people who have died from COVID-19. METHODS: Twenty-five autoptic thyroid specimens of subjects dying from COVID-19 were investigated. Eleven autoptic thyroid specimens of subjects dying from causes other than infectious conditions served as controls. RNA transcripts of 770 immune-related genes together with RNA genomes of multiple coronavirus types were measured by the nCounter system. RT-PCR for two SARS-CoV-2 genes was used to assess virus positivity. Results were validated by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 genome and antigens were detected in nine out of 25 (36%) thyroid specimens from the COVID-19 cohort. Virus-negative thyroid tissues from COVID-19 subject did not show changes of gene transcription nor significant numbers of infiltrating immune cells. Conversely, SARS-CoV-2-positive thyroid specimens showed marked up-regulation of immune genes, especially those proper of the type I and type II interferon (IFN) pathways. In infected tissues, infiltrates of innate immune cells (macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: The thyroid gland can be directly infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Infection strongly activates IFN pathways. The direct viral insult combined with an intense immune response may trigger or worsen thyroid conditions in predisposed individuals.","Poma, Anello Marcello; Basolo, Alessio; Bonuccelli, Diana; Proietti, Agnese; Macerola, Elisabetta; Ugolini, Clara; Torregrossa, Liborio; Alì, Greta; Giannini, Riccardo; Vignali, Paola; Santini, Ferruccio; Toniolo, Antonio; Basolo, Fulvio",Thyroid,https://doi.org/10.1089/thy.2021.0345; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34541878/,242

In fact, in many cases, synchronization and epidemic behavior can arise simultaneously and interplay adaptively. In this paper, we first construct mathematical models of epidemic synchronization, based on traditional dynamical models on complex networks, by applying the adaptive mechanisms observed in real networks. Then, we study the relationship between the epidemic rate and synchronization stability of these models and, in particular, obtain the conditions of local and global stability for epidemic synchronization. Finally, we perform numerical analysis to verify our theoretical results. This work is the first to draw a theoretical bridge between epidemic transmission and synchronization dynamics and will be beneficial to the study of control and the analysis of the epidemics on complex networks.","Li, Kezan; Fu, Xinchu; Small, Michael; Ma, Zhongjun",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21974646/; https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3622678,242

An Outcome Study,2021-02-12,"Introduction: As we learn more about the paradigm of disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we are discovering severe multi- system involvement at an early stage, including sepsis and septic shock.1 Case Report: In March 2020, a normally fit 39-year-old Asian woman of 37 weeks’ gestation (G2P1) presented to the emergency department (ED) with a two-day history of fever, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, headache and vomiting. She was pyrexial, tachypnoeaic and tachycardic, but normotensive, alert and orientated, with oxygen saturations of 99% on air. Blood tests showed a normal serum lactate, a lymphopenia of 0.2 × 109/L, WCC 6 × 109/L, CRP 34 mg/L and D-dimer of 609 ng/mL. Her urine contained ketones ++. A chest radiograph showed mild bi-basal infiltrates. Intravenous fluids and co- amoxiclav were commenced. The fetal heart rate in ED was normal. She was admitted with a persistent tachycardia and pyrexia. The next day she had a syncopal collapse with severe hypotension. She regained consciousness on correction of her blood pressure with a fluid bolus and peripheral vasopressors. The fetal heart rate remained normal. She proceeded to develop visual hallucinations, fluctuating confusion, drowsiness and hypotension with transient response to fluids. Intravenous ceftriaxone and acyclovir cover for meningitis was started on microbiology advice. We proceeded with an emergency caesarean section under general anaesthesia with peripheral vasopressor support and fluid resuscitation. A healthy baby was delivered, and postoperatively the woman was extubated successfully without an oxygen or vasopressor requirement. Overnight she again became hypotensive, tachycardic and drowsy. A non-contrast CT brain was normal and a CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) showed bilateral peripheral opacification and ground glass halo. Troponin T, BNP and a transthoracic echocardiogram were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid from a lumbar puncture showed only slightly raised glucose and her lymphocyte count remained low. On postoperative day 2 she developed a mild oxygen requirement. A repeat CTPA showed moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Her PCR swab from admission was returned with a positive result for SARS-CoV-2. Blood cultures were all negative. The platelet count dropped from 102 to 88 × 109/L on day two. The diagnosis was confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia with encephalopathy and thrombocytopenia secondary to sepsis. She made a complete recovery after three days on oxygen, and seven days in hospital. Discussion: Whilst the risk of severe COVID-19 in healthy young adults is low, pregnancy is associated with an increased relative risk of severe disease, including the need for ICU admission.2 Risk factors in pregnancy are high body mass index, chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes and age over 35 years.2 Awareness of sepsis with COVID-19 is crucial to ensure early presentation and appropriate escalation in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.","Roach, M.T.; Munshi, S.",Int J Obstet Anesth,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijoa.2021.103148; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959289X21002065; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959289X21002065,242

It is identified as a common coinfecting pathogen in COVID-19 patients causing exacerbation of illness. In our hospital, P. aeruginosa is one of the top coinfecting bacteria identified among COVID-19 patients. We collected a strong biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa strain displaying small colony variant morphology from a severe COVID-19 patient. Genomic and transcriptomic sequencing analyses were performed with phenotypic validation to investigate its adaptation in SARS-CoV-2 infected environment. Genomic characterization predicted specific genomic islands highly associated with virulence, transcriptional regulation, and DNA restriction-modification systems. Epigenetic analysis revealed a specific N(6)-methyl adenine (m(6)A) methylating pattern including methylation of alginate, flagellar and quorum sensing associated genes. Differential gene expression analysis indicated that this isolate formed excessive biofilm by reducing flagellar formation (7.4 to 1,624.1 folds) and overproducing extracellular matrix components including CdrA (4.4 folds), alginate (5.2 to 29.1 folds) and Pel (4.8–5.5 folds). In summary, we demonstrated that P. aeuginosa clinical isolates with novel epigenetic markers could form excessive biofilm, which might enhance its antibiotic resistance and in vivo colonization in COVID-19 patients.","Qu, Jiuxin; Cai, Zhao; Liu, Yumei; Duan, Xiangke; Han, Shuhong; Liu, Jihong; Zhu, Yuao; Jiang, Zhaofang; Zhang, Yingdan; Zhuo, Chao; Liu, Yang; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Yang, Liang",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816347/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.641920,242
593400,Elevated eosinophil count is related with lower anti-factor Xa activity in COVID-19 patients,2020-10-08,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a major challenge worldwide. However, the epidemic potential of common human coronaviruses (HCoVs) remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the epidemiological and co-infection characteristics of common HCoVs in individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). This retrospective, observational, multicentre study used data collected from patients admitted to nine sentinel hospitals with ILI and SARI from January 2015 through December 2020 in Shanghai, China. We prospectively tested patients for a total of 22 respiratory pathogens using multi-real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 4541 patients tested, 40.37% (1833/4541) tested positive for respiratory pathogens and 3.59% (163/4541) tested positive for common HCoVs. HCoV infection was more common in the non-endemic season for respiratory pathogens (odds ratio: 2.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.64–3.31). HCoV-OC43 (41.72%, 68/163) was the most common type of HCoV detected. The co-infection rate was 31.29% (51/163) among 163 HCoV-positive cases, with HCoV-229E (53.13%, 17/32), the HCoV type that was most frequently associated with co-infection. Respiratory pathogens responsible for co-infections with HCoVs included parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A virus, and adenovirus. Furthermore, we identified one patient co-infected with HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63/HKU1. The prevalence of common HCoVs remains low in ILI/SARI cases, in Shanghai. However, the seasonal pattern of HCoVs may be opposite to that of other respiratory pathogens. Moreover, HCoVs are likely to co-exist with specific respiratory pathogens. The potential role of co-infections with HCoVs and other pathogenic microorganisms in infection and pathogenesis of ILI and SARI warrants further study.","Kong, Dechuan; Zheng, Yaxu; Hu, Linjie; Chen, Jian; Wu, Huanyu; Teng, Zheng; Zhou, Yanqiu; Qiu, Qi; Lu, Yihan; Pan, Hao",Emerging microbes & infections,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350810/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1965498,242

Crowded indoor environments with sustained close contact and conversations are a particularly high-risk setting. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis through July 29, 2020 of SARS-CoV-2 household secondary attack rate (SAR), disaggregating by several covariates (contact type, symptom status, adult/child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, index case sex, number of contacts in household, coronavirus). FINDINGS: We identified 40 relevant published studies that report household secondary transmission. The estimated overall household SAR was 18·8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15·4%–22·2%), which is higher than previously observed SARs for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. We observed that household SARs were significantly higher from symptomatic index cases than asymptomatic index cases, to adult contacts than children contacts, to spouses than other family contacts, and in households with one contact than households with three or more contacts. INTERPRETATION: To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, people are being asked to stay at home worldwide. With suspected or confirmed infections referred to isolate at home, household transmission will continue to be a significant source of transmission.","Madewell, Zachary J.; Yang, Yang; Longini, Ira M.; Halloran, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, a total of 280 individuals (158 outpatients and 122 inpatients) suffering from hyperglycemia were recruited between May and September 2019. The clinical information of all participants was collected from the hospital information system, including the duration of hyperglycemia, age, gender, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 75-g oral glucose tolerance test including fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), fasting C-peptide (FC-pep), 2-hour C-peptide (2hC-pep), fasting insulin (FIns), and 2-hour insulin (2hIns). In addition, the morbidity of diabetic complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) in the inpatient group was determined. Furthermore, the difference between 2hPG and FPG (ΔPG), the difference between 2hC-pep and FC-pep (ΔC-pep), and the difference between 2hIns and FIns (ΔIns) were calculated. The level of serum I-FABP, a biomarker of intestinal barrier (IB) dysfunction, was estimated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: For the outpatient group, the median duration of hyperglycemia was less than a year; the serum I-FABP level was positively correlated with age (R = 0.299, P < 0.001). For the inpatient group, the median duration of hyperglycemia was ten years; correlation analysis showed that the serum I-FABP level was positively associated with age and ΔPG (R = 0.286, P = 0.001; R = 0.250, P = 0.006, respectively) while negatively associated with FC-pep and 2hC-pep (R = − 0.304, P = 0.001; R = − 0.241, P = 0.008, respectively); multiple linear regression analysis showed that the serum I-FABP level was positively associated with the duration of hyperglycemia (β = 0.362, P < 0.001); moreover, patients with retinopathy had a significantly higher I-FABP level than those without retinopathy (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the outpatients whose duration of hyperglycemia was less than a year, the serum I-FABP level was positively associated with age. In the inpatients with different courses of diabetes, the serum I-FABP level was positively associated with the duration of hyperglycemia and glycemic variability but negatively associated with islet beta-cell function; moreover, the serum I-FABP level was higher in patients with retinopathy than in those without retinopathy, suggesting that the IB dysfunction got worse with the progression of diabetes.","Wang, Yifeng; Ding, Licheng; Yang, Jiayue; Liu, Lijun; Dong, Liang",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33604184/,242

Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the COVID-19 pandemic, five health systems in Maryland formed a consortium – with diverse expertise and representation – representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process, which determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and healthcare professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens’ values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, intensive care unit resources, blood components, novel therapeutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were developed. Creating operational algorithms for each resource posed unique challenges; each resource’s varying nature and underlying data on benefit prevented any single algorithm from being universally applicable. The development of scarce resource allocation processes must be iterative, legally vetted, and tested.

Here, we describe a novel and simple cell-ELISA specifically designed to measure viral spike S1-specific IgG produced in vitro by B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures from a cohort of 45 asymptomatic (n = 24) and symptomatic (n = 21) individuals, with age ranging from 8 to 99 years. All subjects underwent ELISA serological screening twice, at the same time as the cell-ELISA (T2) as well as 35–60 days earlier (T1). Cryopreserved PBMCs of healthy donors obtained years before the COVID-19 pandemic were also included in the analysis. The preliminary results presented here show that out of 45 tested subjects, 16 individuals (35.5%) were positive to the cell-ELISA, 11 (24.5%) were concomitantly positive in the serological screening (T1 and/or T2), and only one person was exclusively positive in ELISA (T1) and negative in cell-ELISA, though values were close to the cutoff. Of note, five individuals (11.2%) tested negative in ELISA but positive in cell-ELISA and thus, they appear to have circulating B cells that produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, likely at levels that are undetectable in the serum, which challenges the negative results of the serological screening. The relative level of in vitro secreted IgG was measurable in positive subjects, ranging from 7 to 50 ng/well. Accordingly, all anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive subjects previously reported moderate to severe symptoms attributable to COVID-19, even though the RT-PCR data were rarely available to confirm viral infection. Overall, the described cell-ELISA might be an effective method for detecting subjects who encountered the virus in the past, and thus helpful to improve serological ELISA tests in the case of undetectable/equivocal circulating IgG levels, and a suitable and improved tool to better evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zarletti, Gianpaolo; Tiberi, Massimo; De Molfetta, Veronica; Bossù, Maurizio; Toppi, Elisa; Bossù, Paola; Scapigliati, Giuseppe",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v12111274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171590/,242

To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies we hypothesize that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.","Hoffmann, H.-Heinrich; Schneider, William M; Rozen-Gagnon, Kathryn; Miles, Linde A; Schuster, Felix; Razooky, Brandon; Jacobson, Eliana; Wu, Xianfang; Yi, Soon; Rudin, Charles M; MacDonald, Margaret R; McMullan, Laura K; Poirier, John T; Rice, Charles M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.09.334128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052348/,242

It was noted that in cells infected with coronavirus, transcription and translation of some of these genes were differentially induced. Drastic induction of their expression at the transcriptional level was observed in cells infected with coronavirus. However, induction of the same genes at the translational level was usually found to be minimal to moderate. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out using SARS-CoV proteins as baits, revealing that a subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF3f, may interact with the N-terminal region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein. This interaction was subsequently confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. Meanwhile, parallel experiments confirmed that eIF3f could also interact with the S protein of another coronavirus, the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). These interactions led to the inhibition of translation of a reporter gene in both in vitro expression system and intact cells. Interestingly, IBV-infected cells stably expressing a Flag-tagged eIF3f showed much higher translation of IL-6 and IL-8, suggesting that the interaction between coronavirus S protein and eIF3f plays a functional role in controlling the expression of host genes, especially genes that are induced during coronavirus infection cycles. This study reveals a novel mechanism exploited by coronavirus to regulate viral pathogenesis.","Xiao, Han; Xu, Ling Hui; Yamada, Yoshiyuki; Liu, Ding Xiang",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0001494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18231581/,242

Firstly, populist anti-immigrant sentiments hinder the implementation of liberal democratic immigration policies and thus they represent a feasibility constraint for any liberal ethics of migration, not only the most cosmopolitan ones. Secondly, there are legitimacy reasons why such views should be neither merely dismissed nor simply contained, since they are voiced by populist political parties which are admitted in the electoral competition and even participate in governments. The main upshot of this discussion is a methodological one: the article argues that, since political theory should deal with the feasibility and legitimacy issues raised by populist anti-immigrant sentiments, a realistic approach is needed. The last section shows that such a methodological change offers the opportunity to extend the scope of normative theorising. In particular, it illustrates how a realistic approach encourages theorists to focus on local-level policies, as well as to devote attention to non-governmental actors and to their role in tackling citizens’ hostility towards immigrants.","Santi Amantini, Laura",Res Publica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11158-021-09516-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075296/,242

Qualitative data were analysed thematically, double-coded, and mapped to the TDF. Participants required information on symptom duration, safety netting, self-care, and antibiotics. Patients felt confident to self-care and were averse to consulting with HCPs unnecessarily but struggled to assess symptom severity. Patients reported seeking help for children or elderly dependents earlier. HCPs’ concerns included patients’ attitudes and a lack of available monitoring of advice given to patients. Participants believed community pharmacy should be the first place that patients seek advice on common infections. The patient information leaflet on common infections should be used in primary care and community pharmacy to support patients to self-manage symptoms and determine when further help is required.","Hayes, Catherine V.; Mahon, Bláthnaid; Sides, Eirwen; Allison, Rosie; Lecky, Donna M.; McNulty, Cliodna A.

598024,Follow-Up Study of the Chest CT Characteristics of COVID-19 Survivors Seven Months After Recovery,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND: A proactive approach to preventing and responding to emerging infectious diseases is critical to global health security. We present a three-stage approach to modeling the spatial distribution of outbreak vulnerability to Aedes aegypti-vectored diseases in Perú. METHODS: Extending a framework developed for modeling hemorrhagic fever vulnerability in Africa, we modeled outbreak vulnerability in three stages: index case potential (stage 1), outbreak receptivity (stage 2), and epidemic potential (stage 3), stratifying scores on season and El Niño events. Subsequently, we evaluated the validity of these scores using dengue surveillance data and spatial models. RESULTS: We found high validity for stage 1 and 2 scores, but not stage 3 scores. Vulnerability was highest in Selva Baja and Costa, and in summer and during El Niño events, with index case potential (stage 1) being high in both regions but outbreak receptivity (stage 2) being generally high in Selva Baja only. CONCLUSIONS: Stage 1 and 2 scores are well-suited to predicting outbreaks of Ae. aegypti-vectored diseases in this setting, however stage 3 scores appear better suited to diseases with direct human-to-human transmission. To prevent outbreaks, measures to detect index cases should be targeted to both Selva Baja and Costa, while Selva Baja should be prioritized for healthcare system strengthening. Successful extension of this framework from hemorrhagic fevers in Africa to an arbovirus in Latin America indicates its broad utility for outbreak and pandemic preparedness and response activities.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the viral loads of 6 different sample types (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal combined, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood) of patients with different ages and clinics, to reveal the relationship between disease course and SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and differences in viral loads of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal, oral cavity, saliva, rectal, urine, and blood samples are collected from patients who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 on admission. Laboratory analysis were carried out at Public Health Institute of Turkey Virology Reference and Research Laboratory. RESULTS: A total of 360 samples from 60 patients were obtained on admission. Fifteen (25%) of the patients were asymptomatic while 45 (75%) were symptomatic. A significant difference was found between mean ages of asymptomatic vs symptomatic patients (26.4 and 36.4, respectively, p = 0.0248). No PCR positivity were found in blood. Only one asymptomatic patient had positive PCR result for urine sample. Viral loads of asymptomatic patients were found to be significantly higher (p = 0.0141) when compared with symptomatic patients. Viral load had a significant negative trend with increasing age. A significant decrease in viral load was observed with increasing disease severity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that asymptomatic patients have higher SARSCoV-2 viral loads than symptomatic patients and unlike in the few study in the literature, a significant decrease in viral load of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples was observed with increasing disease severity. Factors associated with poor prognosis are found to be significantly correlated with low viral load.","Hasanoglu, Imran; Korukluoglu, Gulay; Asilturk, Dilek; Cosgun, Yasemin; Kalem, Ayse Kaya; Altas, Ayşe Basak; Kayaaslan, Bircan; Eser, Fatma; Kuzucu, Esra Akkan; Guner, Rahmet",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231841/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-020-01548-8,242
598792,Management of epistaxis: a guide for junior doctors,2021,"The circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic have taken a psychological toll on parents. Thus, understanding the impact of these contextual stressors on parents is important to help inform the development of family-based health promotion interventions. The present study examined parents' perception of various sources of stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 294) completed an open-ended question about their primary source of stress during the pandemic, which we coded into one or more of the following categories: family, work, health, and finance. We used chi-square tests to determine whether gender, marital status, financial strain, and education level were significantly related to each of the four primary sources of stress. We found that female, married, and financially strained participants were more likely to report family-related stressors. Further, we found that participants who expressed concern over health-related stressors were more likely to have pre-existing health conditions. Finally, we found that single participants were more likely to express concerns over financial stressors. Our findings shed light on parental concerns following the pandemic and inform new research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues at the individual, community, and societal levels.","Alonzi, Sarah; Park, Jae Eun; Pagán, Angélica; Saulsman, Courtney; Silverstein, Madison W",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11030061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34563074/,242
598887,Probiotics and COVID-19 – Authors' reply,2020-07-13,"OBJECTIVES: This study tested the mediation effects of two facets of psychache – bearable and unbearable – in the relationship between exposure to suicide in the family and suicidal ideation in Portugal during the Covid‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Two hundred and forty‐four adults aged between 19 and 64 participated. Two groups were defined: one exposed to suicide in the family (n = 42) and a control group (n = 192). RESULTS: Path analysis using structural equation modelling tested a mediation model. Results demonstrated that unbearable psychache fully mediated the relationship between exposure to suicide and suicidal ideation, even when controlling for the mediation effects of depressive symptoms, the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis, and years of education. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that rather than considering just the global experience of psychache in individuals exposed to suicide, researchers and clinicians should look to the presence of unbearable psychache given its contribution to suicidal ideation. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Unbearable psychache fully mediated the relationship between exposure to suicide in the family and suicidal ideation.

In addition, we aimed to highlight the role of clinicians in identifying sentinel cases of zoonotic disease outbreaks. RECENT FINDINGS: The majority of emerging infectious disease events over recent decades, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have been caused by zoonotic viruses and bacteria. In particular, coronaviruses, haemorrhagic fever viruses, arboviruses and influenza A viruses have caused significant epidemics globally. There have been recent advances in understanding the origins and drivers of zoonotic epidemics, yet there are gaps in diagnostic capacity and clinical training about zoonoses. SUMMARY: Identifying the origins of zoonotic pathogens, understanding factors influencing disease transmission and improving the diagnostic capacity of clinicians will be crucial to early detection and prevention of further epidemics of zoonoses.","Judson, Seth D; Rabinowitz, Peter M",Curr. opin. infect. dis,https://doi.org/10.1097/qco.0000000000000749; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34310453/,242

Data on the novel CoV respiratory disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients are still limited. Unlike other common viruses, CoV have not shown to cause a more severe disease in immunocompromised subjects. Along with direct viral pathogenicity, in some individuals CoV infection triggers an uncontrolled aberrant inflammatory response, leading to lung tissue damage. In cancer patients treated with immunotherapy (e.g. immune-checkpoint inhibitors), COVID-19 may therefore represent a serious threat. After a thorough review of the literature on CoV pathogenesis and cancer, we selected several shared features to define which patients can be considered at higher risk for COVID-19. We combined these clinical and laboratory variables, with the aim of developing a score to weight the risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients.","Indini, Alice; Rijavec, Erika; Ghidini, Michele; Cattaneo, Monica; Grossi, Francesco",Eur J Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534244/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920302847?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804920302847; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.05.017,242

It causes death for many individuals including health professionals. This study aimed to determine the occupational health safety of health professionals and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic at North Showa. METHODS: Institutions-based Cross-sectional study was conducted using a simple random sampling technique from May 10 to June 15, 2020. Interviewer-administered questioners were used, and data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS 23 for analysis. Bi-variable logistic regression was carried out to select candidate variables with a cutoff point < 0.2. Finally, multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify significant variables. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI at a 5% level of significance was used to measure the strength of association. P-value <0.05 indicated a significant association between variables. RESULTS: A total of 280 health professionals participated with a 92.72% response rate. Of which 57.9% (n=162) were males while 42.1% (n=118) females. Of total 48.9% (n=137) (95% CI: 43.2, 55.0) health professionals had poor occupational health and safety. Availability of soap and bleach (AOR=2.50; 1.439, 4.356), Possibility of isolate COVID-19 suspected clients (AOR=2.525; 1.690, 5.062), Availability of infections prevention and control program standards and policy (AOR=2.329; 1.325, 4.092), Availability of policy and procedure to prevent COVID-19 (AOR= 2.427; 1.389, 4.240) were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: The result suggested that occupational health safety was generally low in the study area. Therefore, a preventive measure such as the use of personal protective equipment and adherence to hand hygiene practice and Infection prevention policy could reduce the spread of COVID-19 and further study should be conducted to generate more evidence on determinants of occupational health safety.","Hailu, Dejene; Benayew, Mengistu; Liknaw, Tiliksew; Ayenew, Muluken; Ayalew, Agumas Fentahun; Ayano, Bizuneh; Adera, Addis; Tesema, Mengistu; Gezahegn, Andualem; Birhanu, Tadesse; Wendimu, Eshetu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s292830; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33790675/,242

The possible role of human coronavirus (HCoV) in lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) has not been well studied. METHODS. We conducted a retrospective review of HCT/HM patients with HCoV detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). HCoV strains were identified in BAL samples using strain-specific polymerase chain reaction. Mortality rates were compared among HCT recipients with LRTD caused by HCoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus (PIV) by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS. We identified 35 patients (37 episodes) with HCoV LRTD. Among 23 available BAL samples, 48% were strain OC43, 22% were NL63, 17% were 229E, and 13% were HKU1. Overall, 21 patients (60%) required oxygen therapy at diagnosis and 19 (54%) died within 90 days of diagnosis. Respiratory copathogens were detected in 21 episodes (57%), including viruses (n = 12), fungi (n = 10), and bacteria (n = 8). Mortality rates were not different between patients with and without copathogens (P = .65). In multivariable models, mortality associated with HCoV LRTD was similar to that seen with RSV, influenza, and PIV LRTD in HCT recipients (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval, .66–2.71], P = .41 vs RSV, adjusted for cell source, cytopenia, copathogens, oxygen use, and steroid use). CONCLUSIONS. HCoV LRTD in patients with HCT or HM is associated with high rates of oxygen use and mortality. Mortality associated with HCoV LRTD in HCT recipients appears to be similar to that seen with RSV, influenza virus, and PIV.","Ogimi, Chikara; Waghmare, Alpana A.; Kuypers, Jane M.; Xie, Hu; Yeung, Cecilia C.; Leisenring, Wendy M.; Seo, Sachiko; Choi, Su-Mi; Jerome, Keith R.; Englund, Janet A.; Boeckh, Michael",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix160; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28329354/; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-pdf/64/11/1532/17844203/cix160.pdf,242

However, we do not know the clinical significance of serum Zinc level in COVID-19 patients. Aim To determine the clinical significance of serum Zinc in COVID-19 patients and to establish a correlation with disease severity. Methodology A prospective study on COVID-19 patients underwent fasting Zinc level at the time of hospitalisation. An initial comparative analysis was carried out between COVID-19 patients and healthy controls. Zinc deficiency COVID-19 patients were compared to those with normal levels. Results COVID-19 patients (n = 47) showed significantly low Zinc levels compared to healthy controls (n = 45), median 74.5 (IQR 53.4-94.6) vs 105.8 (IQR 95.65120.90) µg/dl, P < 0.001. Amongst COVID-19 positive patients, 27 (57.4%) were found Zinc deficient.

602749,Clinical Profile and Outcome of Haemodialysis in Patients With COVID-19 – A Single Centre Experience,2021-08-14,"Hydroxychloroquine has gained much attention as one of the candidate drugs that can be repurposed as a prophylactic agent against SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high transmissibility and presence of asymptomatic carriers and presymptomatic transmission, there is need for a chemoprophylactic agent to protect the high-risk population. In this review, we dissect the currently available evidence on hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis from a clinical and pharmacological point of view. In vitro studies on Vero cells show that hydroxychloroquine effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 by affecting viral entry and viral transport via endolysosomes. However, this efficacy has failed to replicate in in vivo animal models as well as in most clinical observational studies and clinical trials assessing pre-exposure prophylaxis and postexposure prophylaxis in healthcare workers. An analysis of the pharmacology of HCQ in COVID-19 reveals certain possible reasons for this failure—a pharmacokinetic failure due to failure to achieve adequate drug concentration at the target site and attenuation of its inhibitory effect due to the presence of TMPRSS2 in airway epithelial cells. Currently, many clinical trials on HCQ prophylaxis in HCW are ongoing; these factors should be taken into account. Using higher doses of HCQ for prophylaxis is likely to be associated with increased safety concerns; thus, it may be worthwhile to focus on other possible interventions.","Agarwal, Mudit; Ranjan, Piyush; Baitha, Upendra; Mittal, Ankit",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390974/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.593099,242
603232,Correlations between COVID-19 and burden of dementia: An ecological study and review of literature,2020-07-04,"INTRODUCTION: Tocilizumab is an interleukin 6 receptor antagonist which has been used for the treatment of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (SSP), aiming to ameliorate the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) -induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are no consistent data whom might benefit most from it. METHODS: We provided tocilizumab on a compassionate-use basis to patients with SSP hospitalized (excluding intensive care and intubated cases) who required oxygen support to have a saturation >93%. Primary endpoint was intubation or death after 24 hours of its administration. Patients received at least one dose of 400 mg intravenous tocilizumab during March 8-2020, through April 20-2020. RESULTS: A total of 207 patients were studied and 186 analysed. The mean age was 65 years and 68% were male. A co-existing condition was present in 68 % of cases. Death prognostic factors were older age, higher IL-6, D-dimer and high sensitivity C reactive protein (HSCRP), lower total lymphocytes and severe disease requiring higher oxygen support. The primary endpoint (intubation or death) was significantly worst (37% vs 13%, p < 0·001) in those receiving the drug when the oxygen support was high (FiO2 > 0.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab is well tolerated in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, but it has a limited effect on the evolution of cases with high oxygen support needs.","Hernández-Mora, Miguel Górgolas; Cabello Úbeda, Alfonso; Pérez, Laura Prieto; Álvarez, Felipe Villar; Álvarez, Beatriz Álvarez; Rodríguez Nieto, María Jesús; Acosta, Irene Carrillo; Ormaechea, Itziar Fernández; Al-Hayani, Aws Waleed Mohammed; Carballosa, Pilar; Martínez, Silvia Calpena; Ezzine, Farah; González, Marina Castellanos; Naya, Alba; de las Heras, Marta López; Rodríguez Guzmán, Marcel José; Guijarro, Ana Cordero; Lavado, Antonio Broncano; Valcayo, Alicia Macías; García, Marta Martín; Martínez, Javier Bécares; Roblas, Ricardo Fernández; Piris Pinilla, Miguel Ángel; Alen, José Fortes; Pernaute, Olga Sánchez; Bueno, Fredeswinda Romero; Frades, Sarah Heili; Romero, Germán Peces Barba",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322499; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.045; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322499?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115682/,242
603922,COVID-19 Associated Stroke--A Single Centre Experience,2021-02-18,"Scientists across disciplines, policymakers, and journalists have voiced frustration at the unprecedented polarization and misinformation around coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several false dichotomies have been used to polarize debates while oversimplifying complex issues. In this comprehensive narrative review, we deconstruct six common COVID-19 false dichotomies, address the evidence on these topics, identify insights relevant to effective pandemic responses, and highlight knowledge gaps and uncertainties. The topics of this review are: 1) Health and lives vs. economy and livelihoods, 2) Indefinite lockdown vs. unlimited reopening, 3) Symptomatic vs. asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, 4) Droplet vs. aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, 5) Masks for all vs. no masking, and 6) SARS-CoV-2 reinfection vs. no reinfection. We discuss the importance of multidisciplinary integration (health, social, and physical sciences), multilayered approaches to reducing risk (“Emmentaler cheese model”), harm reduction, smart masking, relaxation of interventions, and context-sensitive policymaking for COVID-19 response plans. We also address the challenges in understanding the broad clinical presentation of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. These key issues of science and public health policy have been presented as false dichotomies during the pandemic. However, they are hardly binary, simple, or uniform, and therefore should not be framed as polar extremes. We urge a nuanced understanding of the science and caution against black-or-white messaging, all-or-nothing guidance, and one-size-fits-all approaches. There is a need for meaningful public health communication and science-informed policies that recognize shades of gray, uncertainties, local context, and social determinants of health.","Escandón, Kevin; Rasmussen, Angela L.; Bogoch, Isaac I.; Murray, Eleanor J.; Escandón, Karina; Popescu, Saskia V.; Kindrachuk, Jason",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315427/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06357-4,242

OBJECTIVE: To describe lung US imaging findings and aeration score of 34 children with COVID-19. METHODS: This study included 0–16-year-old patients with confirmed COVID-19, who were admitted between April 19 and June 18, 2020 in two hospitals in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Lung US was performed as part of the routine evaluation by a skilled Pediatric Emergency physician. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and severity classifications were done according to an available clinical definition. The lung US findings were described for each lung field and a validated ultrasound lung aeration score was calculated. Data obtained was correlated with clinical information and other imaging modalities available for each case. RESULTS: Thirty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients had a lung US performed during this period. Eighteen (18/34) had abnormalities on the lung US, but eight of them (8/18) had a normal chest radiograph. Ultrasound lung aeration score medians for severe/critical, moderate, and mild disease were 17.5 (2–30), 4 (range 0–14), 0 (range 0–15), respectively (p = 0.001). Twelve patients (12/34) also had a chest computed tomography (CT) performed; both the findings and topography of lung compromise on the CT were consistent with the information obtained by lung US.

Disease-associated genes were obtained by the Human Gene Database (GeneCards), the Human Online Mendelian Inheritance Platform (OMIM) and the DisGeNET database, and the co-targeted genes/proteins as targets of both SFJD and COVID-19 were selected by the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Co-targeted genes/proteins were analyzed by STRING, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Reactome for proteins to protein interaction (PPI), pathway and GO (gene ontology) enrichment, and predicted by AutoDock for their high-precision docking simulation. In addition, the therapeutic effect for SFJD treatment on COVID-19 was validated by the Chinese medicine anti-novel coronavirus pneumonia drug effect prediction and analysis platform (TCMCOVID). RESULTS: Screening resulted in 163 compounds and 463 targeted genes. The PPI core network contains 76 co-targeted proteins. The Reactome pathways were enriched in signaling by interleukins, immune system, etc. Finally, 6 key proteins of TNF, IL-10, IL-2, IL-6, STAT1 and CCL2 were selected and successfully docked with 4 active ingredients of quercetin, luteolin, wogonin and kaempferol. CONCLUSION: SFJD may play a role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 through multiple active compounds acting on multiple targets and then multiple pathways.","Xiong, Haijun; Dong, Zhaowei; Lou, Guanhua; Gan, Qingxia; Wang, Jin; Huang, Qinwan",Eur J Integr Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2020.101241; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876382020314220; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1876382020314220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33520015/,242
604955,"Neutralizing Antibody Production in Asymptomatic and Mild COVID-19 Patients, in Comparison with Pneumonic COVID-19 Patients",2020-07-17,"BACKGROUND: Screen use is increasing rapidly among preschool children and excess screen use in these children has been associated with cognitive side effects and speech delay. We undertook this study to estimate the risk associated with screen time in children, parental supervision, and parent-reported cognitive development among preschool children aged 2–5 years. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done between July 2019 and January 2020 involving parents of all students aged 2–5 years, attending 2 kindergarten schools in Thiruvalla using a self-administered questionnaire. Parents also used the Werner David Development pictorial scale (WDDPS), a screening tool to report cognitive development. The schools were sampled based on convenience. RESULTS: Of the 189 children included in the study, 89.4% had excess screen use (> 1 h per day) and the average use was 2.14 h. 45.0% of parents supervised screen use inconsistently (self-reported). Meal-time screen use (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.3–10.8), receiving screen on demand (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.2–11.3), and using devices other than computers (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.6–26.8) were significantly associated with excess screen use in pre-school children. Similarly, those children with inconsistently supervised screen time were significantly more likely to have suspected deficits in attention (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–8.2), intelligence (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.3–13.3), and social skills (OR 15.3, 95% CI 1.9–121.2), compared to children whose screen use was consistently supervised. CONCLUSION: Screen time in the majority of preschool children is above the recommended limits, and inconsistent supervision by parents was seen in almost half of the study participants. Inconsistently supervised screen time is associated with suspected cognitive delays in children.

604956,COVID‐19: Risk Factors Associated with Infectivity and Severity,2021-03-19,"BACKGROUND: Vitamin-D deficiency is linked to a wide range of chronic and infectious diseases. Body of literature suggested that the prevalence of this deficiency can have geographical variation. Although vitamin D deficiency is frequently reported in the South Asian population, the scarcity of systematic reviews and meta-analysis means the true extent of the disease and the underlying factors causing it are poorly characterized. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using two databases (PubMed and Scopus) and one search engine (Google Scholar) for original studies on the South Asian population (published from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2019). Following the search, a random effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate population-level weighted average, the pooled prevalence of deficiency, and heterogeneity of vitamin D among different countries and genders; in addition to South Asia as a whole. RESULTS: Our study, based on our selection criteria was narrowed down to a total of 44,717 participants; which spanned over 65 studies from five South Asian countries. Overall, the pooled prevalence of deficiency was 68% [95% CI: 64 to 72%] with significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 98%; p = 0.00). The average level of vitamin D ranged from 4.7 to 32 ng/mL, with a weighted mean of 19.15 ng/mL (weighted standard deviation 11.59 ng/mL). The highest prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was found in Pakistan (73%;95% CI: 63 to 83%) followed by Bangladesh (67%; 95% CI: 50 to 83%), India (67%; 95% CI: 61 to 73%), Nepal (57%; 95% CI: 53 to 60%) and Sri Lanka (48%; 95% CI: 41 to 55%), respectively. This finding indicated a high degree of heterogeneity among the population. (I(2) = 98.76%), Furthermore, a gender-wise analysis suggested that in South Asia, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was higher in females than males. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal highly prevalent and variable vitamin D deficiency among the adults of different South Asian countries. Findings from this review would be helpful to generate hypotheses and explore the factors affecting the inter-country variability, alongside strengthening evidence for governments to prioritize mitigation strategies in this region.

Lastly, I engage various layers of interpretation in the studies (via the interconnected avenues of theory, researcher positionality, and methodology) to describe race taming discourses that attempt to make race, racism, and white supremacy manageable and containable through insufficient education interventions. I suggest that both exclusion and race taming can offer cautionary lessons about the tenuousness and possibilities of interest convergence during a time of apparently renewed cross-racial support for public education in the contemporary Milwaukee education scene.","Hurie, Andrew H.",Urban Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782627/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11256-021-00601-6,242

In this positional piece, we seek to elucidate areas of commonality across what have traditionally been divergent approaches to the role of constructions in language.

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a severe viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome caused by Ebola virus (EBOV) is transmitted by direct contact with the body fluids of infected person and objects contaminated with virus or infected animals. World Health Organization (WHO) has declared EVD epidemic as public health emergency of international concern with severe global economic burden. At fatal EBOV infection stage, patients usually die before the antibody response. Currently, rapid blood tests to diagnose EBOV infection include the antigen or antibodies capture using ELISA and RNA detection using RT/Q-PCR within 3–10 days after the onset of symptoms. Moreover, few nanotechnology-based colorimetric and paper-based immunoassay methods have been recently reported to detect Ebola virus. Unfortunately, these methods are limited to laboratory only. As state-of-the art (SoA) diagnostics time to confirm Ebola infection, varies from 6 hours to about 3 days, it causes delay in therapeutic approaches. Thus developing a cost-effective, rapid, sensitive, and selective sensor to detect EVD at point-of-care (POC) is certainly worth exploring to establish rapid diagnostics to decide therapeutics. This review highlights SoA of Ebola diagnostics and also a call to develop rapid, selective and sensitive POC detection of EBOV for global health care. We propose that adopting miniaturized electrochemical EBOV immunosensing can detect virus level at pM concentration within ~40 minute compared to 3 days of ELISA test at nM levels.","Kaushik, Ajeet; Tiwari, Sneham; Jayant, Rahul Dev; Marty, Aileen; Nair, Madhavan",Biosensors and Bioelectronics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26319169/; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4601610?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.08.040; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566315303651; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566315303651,242

In this study we focus on gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), where active screening was suspended in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) due to the pandemic. We use two independent mathematical models to predict the impact of COVID-19 interruptions on transmission and reporting and achievement of the 2030 elimination of transmission (EOT) goal for gHAT in two moderate-risk regions of the DRC. We consider different interruption scenarios, including reduced passive surveillance in fixed health facilities, and whether this suspension lasts until the end of 2020 or 2021. Our models predict an increase in the number of new infections in the interruption period only if both active screening and passive surveillance were suspended, and with a slowed reduction—but no increase—if passive surveillance remains fully functional. In all scenarios, the EOT may be slightly pushed back if no mitigation, such as increased screening coverage, is put in place. However, we emphasise that the biggest challenge will remain in the higher-prevalence regions where EOT is already predicted to be behind schedule without interruptions unless interventions are bolstered.","Aliee, Maryam; Castaño, Soledad; Davis, Christopher N; Patel, Swati; Miaka, Erick Mwamba; Spencer, Simon E F; Keeling, Matt J; Chitnis, Nakul; Rock, Kat S",Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611586/; https://doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/trab019,242

The objective of this study was to quantify and describe US adults who delayed dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional responses collected from a nationally representative and long-running panel survey of US adults conducted in late May and early June 2020 (response rate = 70%). The survey included questions about dental care delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, purpose of the delayed dental visits, timing of future dental visits, and demographic information. Pearson’s chi-square tests were used to determine if rates of delayed dental care varied by subgroup. A multivariable regression model, adjusted for age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, census division, and rurality, was estimated to predict the odds of reporting delayed dental care. RESULTS: Nearly half of respondents (46.7%) reported delaying going to the dentist or receiving dental care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among adults who reported delaying dental care due to the pandemic, 74.7% reported delaying a checkup, 12.4% reported delaying care to address something that was bothering them, and 10.5% reported delaying care to get planned treatment. About 44.4% of adults reported that they planned to visit the dentist within the next 3 mo.

RESULTS: Agreement was achieved for 27 (73%) management strategies which were then used to develop expert clinical practice statements. Experts agreed that COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is clinically similar to other forms of ARDS. The Delphi process yielded strong suggestions for use of systemic corticosteroids for critical COVID-19; awake self-proning to improve oxygenation and high flow nasal oxygen to potentially reduce tracheal intubation; non-invasive ventilation for patients with mixed hypoxemic-hypercapnic respiratory failure; tracheal intubation for poor mentation, hemodynamic instability or severe hypoxemia; closed suction systems; lung protective ventilation; prone ventilation (for 16–24 h per day) to improve oxygenation; neuromuscular blocking agents for patient-ventilator dyssynchrony; avoiding delay in extubation for the risk of reintubation; and similar timing of tracheostomy as in non-COVID-19 patients. There was no agreement on positive end expiratory pressure titration or the choice of personal protective equipment. CONCLUSION: Using a Delphi method, an agreement among experts was reached for 27 statements from which 20 expert clinical practice statements were derived on the respiratory management of C-ARF, addressing important decisions for patient management in areas where evidence is either absent or limited.

610968,Cardiovascular comorbidity and its impact on patients with Covid-19,2020-04-27,"BACKGROUND: Progress in therapeutic research is slowed by the regulatory burden of clinical trials, which provide the best evidence for guiding treatment. There is a long delay from evidence generation to adoption, highlighting the need for designs that link evidence generation to implementation. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical trial designs that confer minimal risk above that inherent in clinical care, to obviate the need for cumbersome consenting processes to enrol patients in prospective clinical research studies. These designs extend the scope of the Learning Healthcare System, a framework for leveraging retrospective ‘big data’ to advance clinical research, to include data collected from prospective controlled trials. SUMMARY: Pragmatic trials may use simplified eligibility criteria, unblinded interventions and objective outcome measures that can all be monitored through the electronic health records (EHR), to reduce costs and speed study conduct. Most pragmatic trials continue to suffer from substantial regulatory burden. Written consent to participate in research can be waived only if the research produces minimal risk above what is encountered in everyday life. However, the ‘consent’ processes for prescribing Federal Drug Administration-approved medications in clinical medicine are informal, even when they involve decisions of uncertain benefit and higher levels of risk. We propose that trial designs that mimic clinical decision-making in areas of uncertainty (clinical equipoise) and in which no data are generated outside of usual care (ideally by EHR embedding) confer minimal additional risk. Trial designs meeting this standard could, therefore, be conducted with minimal documentation of consent, even when interventions contain different risks. To align with risk encountered in clinical practice, allocation to treatment arms should change (adaptive randomisation) as data are collected and analysed. Embedding of informatics tools into the EHR has the additional benefit that, as adaptive randomisation progresses, evidence-generation transitions into implementation via decision-support tools—the ultimate realisation of the Learning Healthcare System.","Monach, Paul A; Branch-Elliman, Westyn",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521663/,242
611162,68 Changes in Incidence of COVID-19 Associated AKI Over 2020,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND: Household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important component of the community spread of the pandemic. Little is known about the factors associated with household transmission, at the level of the case, contact or household, or how these have varied over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: The Household Transmission Evaluation Dataset (HOSTED) is a passive surveillance system linking laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to individuals living in the same household in England. We explored the risk of household transmission according to: age of case and contact, sex, region, deprivation, month and household composition between April and September 2020, building a multivariate model. RESULTS: In the period studied, on average, 5.5% of household contacts in England were diagnosed as cases. Household transmission was most common between adult cases and contacts of a similar age. There was some evidence of lower transmission rates to under-16s [adjusted odds ratios (aOR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66–0.74). There were clear regional differences, with higher rates of household transmission in the north of England and the Midlands. Less deprived areas had a lower risk of household transmission. After controlling for region, there was no effect of deprivation, but houses of multiple occupancy had lower rates of household transmission [aOR 0.74 (0.66–0.83)]. CONCLUSIONS: Children are less likely to acquire SARS-CoV-2 via household transmission, and consequently there was no difference in the risk of transmission in households with children. Households in which cases could isolate effectively, such as houses of multiple occupancy, had lower rates of household transmission. Policies to support the effective isolation of cases from their household contacts could lower the level of household transmission.","Hall, J A; Harris, R J; Zaidi, A; Woodhall, S C; Dabrera, G; Dunbar, J K",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33837417/,242
611229,COVID-19 Lockdown Effects on Acute Stroke Care in Latin America,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented changes, as many state and local governments enacted stay-at-home orders and non-essential businesses were closed. State chiropractic licensing boards play an important role in protecting the public via regulation of licensure and provision of guidance regarding standards of practice, especially during times of change or uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to summarize the guidance provided in each of the 50 United States, related to chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A review of the public facing websites of governors and state chiropractic licensing boards was conducted in the United States. Data were collected regarding the official guidance provided by each state’s chiropractic licensing board as well as the issuance of stay-at-home orders and designations of essential personnel by state governors. Descriptive statistics were used to report the findings from this project. RESULTS: Each of the 50 state governor’s websites and individual state chiropractic licensing board’s websites were surveyed. Stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders were issued in 86% of all states. Chiropractors were classified as essential providers in 54% of states, non-essential in one state (2%), and no guidance was provided in the remaining 44% of all states. Fourteen states (28%) recommended restricting visits to only urgent cases and the remaining states (72%) provided no guidance. Twenty-seven states (54%) provided information regarding protecting against infectious disease and the remaining states (46%) provided no guidance. Twenty-two states (44%) provided recommendations regarding chiropractic telehealth and the remaining states (56%) provided no guidance. Seventeen states (34%) altered license renewal requirements and eight states (16%) issued warnings against advertising misleading or false information regarding spinal manipulation and protection from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: State guidance during the COVID-19 pandemic was heterogenous, widely variability in accessibility, and often no guidance was provided by state chiropractic licensing boards. Some state chiropractic licensing boards chose to assemble guidance for licensees into a single location, which we identified as a best practice for future situations where changes in chiropractic practice must be quickly communicated.","Neff, Shawn M.; Roecker, Christopher B.; Okamoto, Casey S.; Holguin, Samuel L.; Napuli, Jason G.; Mattox, Ross; Hinkeldey, Nathan A.; Paris, David J.",Chiropr Man Therap,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32631385/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12998-020-00333-6,242
611780,Subjective and Objective Assessments of Post-traumatic Olfactory Dysfunction,2020-08-26,"Importance: Digital contact tracing (DCT) apps were released in several countries to help interrupt SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains in the population. However, the impact of DCT on pandemic mitigation still remains to be demonstrated. Objective: To estimate key populations and performance indicators along the DCT app notification cascade in a clearly defined regional (Canton of Zurich, using all of Switzerland as a comparison) and temporal context (September/October 2020). Design: Publicly available administrative and research data, including key DCT performance indicators, SARS-CoV-2 testing statistics, infoline call statistics, and observational study data, were compiled. A model of the DCT notification cascade was developed and key performance indicators for DCT processes were defined. Subpopulation sizes at each cascade step were estimated using data triangulation. Resulting estimates were systematically checked for internal consistency and consistency with other up- or downstream estimates in the cascade. Stochastic simulations were performed to explore robustness of results. Results: For the Canton of Zurich, we estimate that 537 app users received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in September 2020, of whom 324 received and entered a CovidCode. This triggered an app notification for an estimated 1374 proximity contacts and led to 722 infoline calls. In total, 170 callers received a quarantine recommendation, and 30 app users tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after an app notification, reflecting a performance above the national level. Based on this quantification, key performance indicators were evaluated. For September 2020, these analyses suggest that SwissCovid triggered quarantine recommendations in the equivalent of 5% of all exposed contacts placed in quarantine by manual contact tracing. Per 11 CovidCodes entered in the app, we estimate that almost 1 contact tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon app notification. However, longitudinal indicator analyses demonstrate bottlenecks in the notification cascade, as capacity limits were reached due to large increases in SARS-CoV-2 incidence in October 2020. Conclusion: Although requiring confirmation, our estimations on the number of notified proximity contacts receiving quarantine recommendations or testing positive after notification suggest relevant contributions to mitigating the pandemic. Increasing SwissCovid app uptake and improving notification cascade performance may further enhance its impact.","Menges, D.; Aschmann, H. E.; Moser, A.; Althaus, C.

The infection affects multiple organ systems leading to systemic organ failure. There is an increased incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients who become critically ill. In the critical care setting, the incidence of AKI has been variable amongst different studies. Patients with acute kidney injury who progress to renal replacement therapy are associated with worse outcomes. We describe a case of a 42-year-old male who presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to SARS-CoV-2 associated pneumonia. The patient was initially managed with the nasal cannula and then required high flow nasal cannula with worsening hypoxemic respiratory failure, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. On top of worsening respiratory status, the patient developed new onset renal failure requiring hemodialysis.","Ayad, Sarah; Elkattawy, Sherif; Ejikeme, Chidinma; Al-nasseri, Abraheim; Reddy, Aravinda",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33767927/,242
612136,"COVID-19 Pathophysiology Predicts That Ischemic Stroke Occurrence Is an Expectation, Not an Exception—A Systematic Review",2021-01-28,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), poses extraordinary threats and complex challenges to global public health. Quantitative measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer plays an important role in understanding the patient-to-patient variability of immune response, assessing the efficacy of vaccines, and identifying donors for blood transfusion therapy. There is an urgent and ever-increasing demand for serological COVID-19 antibody tests that are highly sensitive, quantitative, rapid, simple, minimally invasive, and inexpensive. In this work, we developed a single-step, wash-free immunoassay for rapid and highly sensitive quantitative analysis of serological human IgG against SARS-CoV-2 which requires only a single droplet of serum. By simply incubating 4 μL human serum samples with antibody-functionalized gold nanoparticles, a photonic crystal optical biosensor coated with the recombinant spike protein serves as a sensing platform for the formation of sandwich immunocomplex through specific antigen–antibody interactions, upon which the detected IgG molecules can be counted with digital precision. We demonstrated a single-step 15-min assay capable of detecting as low as 100 pg mL(−1) human COVID-19 IgG in serum samples. The calculated limit of detecting (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) is 26.7 ± 7.7 and 32.0 ± 8.9 pg mL(−1), respectively. This work represents the first utilization of the Activate Capture + Digital Counting (AC + DC)-based immunoassay for rapid and quantitative analysis of serological COVID-19 antibody, demonstrating a route toward point-of-care testing, using a portable detection instrument. On the basis of the sandwich immunoassay principle, the biosensing platform can be extended for the multiplexed detection of antigens, additional IgGs, cytokines, and other protein biomarkers.","Zhao, Bin; Che, Congnyu; Wang, Weijing; Li, Nantao; Cunningham, Brian T.",Talanta,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039914020312959; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.122004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33592744/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914020312959,242

El PS de Clínica Las Condes (CLC) que requirió licencia médica (LM) por COVID-19 durante el periodo de estudio, fue evaluado por Organismo Administrador según Ley 16.744, categorizando cada caso de contacto estrecho (CE) o contagio, en común o laboral. Además, fue contactado en su totalidad por equipo de RRHH y de IAAS, para conocer estado de salud, factores de riesgo y evolución. El objetivo fue caracterizar los casos y CE de PS que tuvieron LM, relacionándolas con diferentes eventos ocurridos en la institución y la comunidad durante el periodo comprendido entre el 12 de febrero y el 31 de julio. Un 21% del PS requirió LM en el periodo y un 12,97% presentó infección confirmada por PCR. En cuanto a la distribución por sexo y edad de casos y CE, esta no difiere de la distribución observada en el total de funcionarios de CLC. Se observa que, en los casos, la mayoría corresponde a categoría intrahospitalaria, en cambio los CE, la mayor parte correspondió a comunitario. En relación con casos confirmados intrahospitalarios, destaca que el primer caso ocurrió 63 días después del primer paciente hospitalizado en CLC con diagnóstico de COVID-19, y cuando ya estaba instalada la epidemia en la Región Metropolitana (RM) de Santiago, lo que refleja la efectividad de las medidas de prevención adoptadas al interior de CLC. Health care workers (HCW) are at higher risk to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 than general population, so they must use personal protective equipment (PPE) in all care situations. The HCW at Clinica las Condes (CLC) that required a sick leave (SL) during the study period was evaluated by the Administrative Institution according to Law 16.744, which categorized each case of close contact (CC) or confirmed case, as community-acquired (CA) or health care-associated (HCA). In addition, all of them were traced by the HR and Infection Control team, to find out health status, risk factors and evolution. The aims were to characterize the confirmed cases and CC, their association with key events that occurred in the institution and the community between February 12th and July 31th. 21% of the HCW had to take SL in the period and in 12,97% infection was confirmed by PCR. Distribution by sex and age did not differ from the distribution of total HCW in CLC. Among confirmed cases, most of them were HCA, whereas in the CC group the majority were CA. Regarding HCA cases, it stands out that the first case occurred 63 days after the first COVID-19 inpatient in CLC, when the epidemic was already spread in the community, which reflects the effectiveness of the preventive measures adopted within CLC.","Chomali, May; Guell, Macarena; Hervé, Beatrice; Angulo, Magdalena; Huerta, Catherina; Gutiérrez, Cecilia; Blamey, Rodrigo",Revista Médica Clínica Las Condes,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0716864020301012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0716864020301012,242

The dataset consisted of 19 patients (tested in both a practically defined OFF phase and ON phase) and 8 controls, who performed the “Timed-Up-and-Go” test multiple times while being recorded with the Microsoft Kinect V2 sensor. Camera-derived features were step length, average walking speed and mediolateral sway. Motor signs were assessed clinically using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: We found significant group differences between patients and controls for step length and average walking speed, showing the ability to detect Parkinson’s features.

We describe the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of the dorsal visual stream and correlate the localization of this type of infarct in our patient with the known functional neuroanatomy. Although lesional studies in Macaque monkeys and functional MRI studies in humans have documented the clinical-functional correlations of POs lesions and perceived motion deficits, our case is one of the very first human cases in the literature that pinpoints the Zeitraffer phenomenon to a specific and strategic circumscribed ischemic stroke in the region of the POs.","Kesserwani, Hassan",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32864267/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9443,242

NSS is poorly characterized and hemodynamic studies have focused on cerebral perfusion ignoring the heart. We hypothesized in NSS the heart would be more likely to receive hypoxemic blood than the brain due to the proximity of the coronary arteries to the aortic annulus. To test this, we conducted a computational fluid dynamics simulation of blood flow in a human supported by VA-ECMO. Simulations quantified the fraction of blood at each aortic branching vessel originating from residual native cardiac output versus VA-ECMO. As residual cardiac function was increased, simulations demonstrated myocardial hypoxia would develop prior to cerebral hypoxia. These results illustrate the conditions where NSS will develop and the relative cardiac function that will lead to organ-specific hypoxia.

Regionalization of critical care is a possible solution; regionalization has been implemented for trauma and neonatal intensive care, and it is under active discussion for medical and cardiac critical care. However, regionalization is only one possible approach to reorganizing critical care services. This commentary introduces the technique of network analysis as a framework for the following: (1) understanding how critically ill patients move between hospitals, (2) defining the roles hospitals play in regional care delivery, and (3) suggesting systematic improvements that may benefit population health. We examined transfers of critically ill Medicare patients in Connecticut in 2005 as a model system. We found that patients are systematically transferred to more capable hospitals. However, we find the standard distinction of hospitals into either “secondary hospitals” or “tertiary hospitals” poorly explains observed transfer patterns; instead, hospitals show a continuum of roles. We further examine the implications of the network pattern in a simulation of quarantine of a hospital to incoming transfers, as occurred during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Network perspectives offer new ways to study systems to care for critically ill patients and provide additional tools for addressing pragmatic problems in triage and bed management, regionalization, quality improvement, and disaster preparedness.","Iwashyna, Theodore J.; Christie, Jason D.; Kahn, Jeremy M.; Asch, David A.",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265091/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209602105; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369209602105; https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/61909/1/09.I.Christie.Asch.Kahn.09.Chest.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.08-1052,242

Preparing for a phased reopening, a knowledge exchange coalition (representing government, academia, hospitals, oral health professions, and regulators) developed return-to-work (RTW) guidelines detailing the augmentation of standard practices to ensure safety for patients, oral health care providers (OHPs), and the community. Using online surveys, this study explored the influence of the RTW guidelines and related education on registered NS OHPs during a phased return to work. METHODS: Dissemination of R2W guidelines included website or email communiques and interdisciplinary education webinars that coincided with 2 RTW phases approved by the government. Aligned with each phase, all registered dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants were invited to complete an online survey to gauge the influence of the coalition-sponsored education and RTW guidelines, confidence, preparedness, and personal protective equipment use before and after the pandemic. RESULTS: Three coalition-sponsored multidisciplinary webinars hosted 3541 attendees prior to RTW. The response to survey 1 was 41% (881/2156) and to survey 2 was 26% (571/2177) of registrants. Survey 1 (82%) and survey 2 (89%) respondents “agreed/strongly agreed” that R2W guidelines were a primary source for guiding return to practice, and most were confident with education received and had the skills needed to effectively treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gowns/lab coat use for aerosol-generating procedures increased from 26% to 93%, and the use of full face shields rose from 6% to 93% during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A multistakeholder coalition was effective in establishing and communicating comprehensive guidelines and web-based education to ensure unified reintegration of oral health services in NS during a pandemic. This multiorganizational cooperation lay the foundation for responses to subsequent waves of COVID-19 and may serve as an example for collaboratively responding to future public health threats in other settings.

615110,Dynamic Characteristic Analysis of Antibodies in Patients With COVID-19: A 13-Month Study,2021-07-20,"OBJECTIVE Complete blood count parameters are frequently altered in COVID-19 patients. Leucopenia and lymphopenia are the most common findings. This is not specific to COVID-19 as similar alterations are found in various other viral infections. This work is intended to summarize the evidence regarding white blood cell and lymphocyte subset alterations in COVID-19 and their clinical implications. MATERIALS AND METHODS A PubMed search was conducted to identify relevant original studies. Articles not available in English or referring exclusively to pediatric patients were excluded. The study was designed as a narrative review from its inception. RESULTS Complete white blood cell number and lymphocytes may be reduced in COVID-19 patients. Circulating CD4+ cells (helper T lymphocytes), CD8+ cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), regulatory T cells and natural killer (NK) cells may be reduced, with a greater reduction observed in critically ill patients. CD4+ and regulatory cell deficiencies may contribute to the cytokine storm and subsequent tissue damage observed in severe COVID-19 infection. NK and CD8+ cell deficiency might delay infection clearance. These aberrations of cellular immunity may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease. Alterations observed in monocyte function can also be implicated as they are effector cells responsible for tissue damage and remodeling. B cell dysfunction and maturation abnormalities have also been reported, suggesting that the virus also impairs humoral immunity. CONCLUSIONS Lymphocyte subset abnormalities may be useful prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19, with circulating CD8+ cell count being the most promising as a predictor of severe disease requiring mechanical ventilation and mortality.","Lagadinou, M; Zareifopoulos, N; Gkentzi, D; Sampsonas, F; Kostopoulou, E; Marangos, M; Solomou, E",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355378/; https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202108_26463,242

METHODS: A quantitative, qualitative mixed‐method study performed in 1–10 June 2020 during the compulsory home‐stay for elderly people in Turkey. The quantitative study was conducted using a structured online questionnaire with 278 participants aged 65 or older. The Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI) was used to assess the anxiety. An in‐depth interview with 20 participants was used to fill the gap of face‐to‐face interview due to pandemic situation and strengthen the results of quantitative survey. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Of all participants, 88 (31.7%) had a score above the cut‐off point for GAI. The prevalence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was significantly higher in female (37.8%) than in male (23.8%). Female gender, economic loss, uncertainty, and the time participants expend to follow news about COVID‐19 pandemic were risk factors of GAD. On the other hand, higher education level, hobbies, and regular physical activity were protective factors against GAD. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, social isolation and lockdown for elderly people make serious risk factor for their mental well‐being. Measures must be taken to support the psychological well‐being of elderly by promoting physical activity and hobbies at home, and reducing their economic concerns.","Sirin, Hulya; Ahmadi, Ahmad Abed; Ketrez, Gamze; Ozbeyaz, Cagri; Dikmen, Asiye Ugras; Ozkan, Secil",Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1002/gps.5600; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231924/,242

Inhibition of coiled coil-mediated interactions using bioactive peptides that replicate an α-helical chain from the viral fusion machinery has significant antiviral potential. Here, we present the construction of a series of lipopeptides composed of a de novo heptad repeat sequence-based α-helical peptide plus a hydrocarbon tail. Promisingly, the constructs adopted stable α-helical conformations and exhibited relatively broad-spectrum antiviral activities against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and influenza A viruses (IAVs). Together, these findings reveal a new strategy for relatively broad-spectrum antiviral drug discovery by relying on the tunability of the α-helical coiled-coil domains present in all class I fusion proteins and the amphiphilic nature of the individual helices from this multihelix motif.","Wang, Chao; Zhao, Lei; Xia, Shuai; Zhang, Tianhong; Cao, Ruiyuan; Liang, Guodong; Li, Yue; Meng, Guangpeng; Wang, Weicong; Shi, Weiguo; Zhong, Wu; Jiang, Shibo; Liu, Keliang",Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b00890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30192544/,242

Patients with chronic liver diseases require a high level of care and are therefore particularly vulnerable to disruptions in medical services during COVID‐19. Recent data have also identified chronic liver disease as an independent risk factor for COVID‐19 related hospital mortality. In response to the pandemic, national and international societies have recommended interim changes to the management of patients with liver diseases. These modifications included the implementation of telehealth, postponement or cancelation of elective procedures, and other non‐urgent patient care‐related activities. There is concern that reduced access to diagnosis and treatment can also lead to increased morbidity in patients with liver diseases and we may witness a delayed surge of hospitalizations related to decompensated liver disease after the COVID‐19 pandemic has receded. Therefore, it is paramount that liver practices craft a comprehensive plan for safe resumption of clinical operations while minimizing the risk of exposure to patients and health‐care professionals. Here, we provide a broad roadmap for how to safely resume care for patients with chronic liver disease according to various phases of the pandemic with particular emphasis on outpatient care, liver transplantation, liver cancer care, and endoscopy.","Kapuria, Devika; Bollipo, Steven; Rabiee, Atoosa; Ben‐Yakov, Gil; Kumar, Goutham; Siau, Keith; Lee, Hye‐Won; Congly, Stephen; Turnes, Juan; Dhanasekaran, Renumathy; Lui, Rashid N",J Gastroenterol Hepatol,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgh.15178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656794/,242
618338,"COVID-19 and electrophysiology procedures—review, reset, reboot!!!",2020-09-15,"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), presents with a broad range of symptoms. Existing COVID-19 case definitions were developed from early reports of severely ill, primarily hospitalized, patients. Symptom-based case definitions that guide public health surveillance and individual patient management in the community must be optimized for COVID-19 pandemic control. Methods: We collected daily symptom diaries and performed RT-PCR on respiratory specimens over a 14-day period in 185 community members exposed to a household contact with COVID-19 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Salt Lake City, Utah metropolitan areas. We interpreted the discriminatory performance (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, F-1 score, Youden's index, and prevalence estimation) of individual symptoms and common case definitions according to two principal surveillance applications (i.e., individual screening and case counting). We also constructed novel case definitions using an exhaustive search with over 73 million symptom combinations and calculated bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals stratified by children versus adults. Findings: Common COVID-19 case definitions generally showed high sensitivity (86-96%) but low positive predictive value (PPV) (36-49%; F-1 score 52-63) in this community cohort. The top performing novel symptom combinations included taste or smell dysfunction. They also improved the balance of sensitivity and PPV (F-1 score 78-80) and reduced the number of false positive symptom screens. Performance indicators were generally lower for children (<18 years of age). Interpretation: Existing COVID-19 case definitions appropriately screened in community members with COVID-19. However, they led to many false positive symptom screens and poorly estimated community prevalence. Absent unlimited, timely testing capacity, more accurate case definitions may help focus public health resources. Novel symptom combinations incorporating taste or smell dysfunction as a primary component better balanced sensitivity and specificity. Case definitions tailored specifically for children versus adults should be further explored.","Reses, H. E.; Fajans, M.; Lee, S. H.; Heilig, C. M.; Chu, V. T.; Thornburg, N.

618543,Flattening-the-curve associated with reduced COVID-19 case fatality rates- an ecological analysis of 65 countries,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global health problem. Beside the specific pathogenic effect of SARS-CoV-2, incompletely understood deleterious and aberrant host immune responses play critical roles in severe disease. Our objective was to summarise the available information on the pathophysiology of COVID-19. METHODS: Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies according to the following PICO framework: P (population): patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection; I (intervention): any intervention/no intervention; C (comparator): any comparator; O (outcome) any clinical or serological outcome including but not limited to immune cell phenotype and function and serum cytokine concentration. RESULTS: Of the 55 496 records yielded, 84 articles were eligible for inclusion according to question-specific research criteria. Proinflammatory cytokine expression, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), was increased, especially in severe COVID-19, although not as high as other states with severe systemic inflammation. The myeloid and lymphoid compartments were differentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection depending on disease phenotype. Failure to maintain high interferon (IFN) levels was characteristic of severe forms of COVID-19 and could be related to loss-of-function mutations in the IFN pathway and/or the presence of anti-IFN antibodies. Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection showed a high variability across individuals and disease spectrum. Multiparametric algorithms showed variable diagnostic performances in predicting survival, hospitalisation, disease progression or severity, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection affects both humoral and cellular immunity depending on both disease severity and individual parameters.

This study examines changes in high-risk alcohol consumption from before to during the COVID-19 crisis in an established cohort of middle-aged British adults. METHODS: Participants consisted of 3,358 middle-aged adults from the 1970 British Cohort Study who completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for detecting hazardous drinkers in primary care settings in 2016–2018 (when aged 46–48 years) and May 2020 (aged 50 years). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine changes in high-risk drinking (scores of ≥5), and multinomial regression was used to compare responses with individual test items in 2016–2018 and May 2020. RESULTS: Among middle-aged British adults, high-risk drinking increased by 5.2 percentage points from 19.4% to 24.6% (p <0.001) between 2016–2018 and May 2020. The increase in high-risk drinking was not moderated by sex, marital status, educational attainment, the presence of a chronic illness, or the year the baseline survey was completed. The prevalence of drinking ≥4 times a week doubled from 12.5% to 26% from before to during the pandemic (p<0.001), and there was also evidence of an increase in the frequency of being unable to stop drinking. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence linking the COVID-19 crisis and associated lockdown restrictions to an increase in high-risk drinking patterns and particularly frequent drinking in British adults.

METHODS: From 16 to 24 March 2020, 241 consecutive patients addressed to hospital for COVID-19 suspicion had both chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Eight observers (2 thoracic and 2 general senior radiologists, 2 junior radiologists, and 2 emergency physicians) retrospectively categorized each CT into one out of 4 categories (evocative, compatible for COVID-19 pneumonia, not evocative, and normal). Observer agreement for categorization between all readers and pairs of readers with similar experience was evaluated with the Kappa coefficient. The results of a consensus categorization were correlated to RT-PCR. RESULTS: Observer agreement across the 4 categories was good between all readers (κ value 0.61 95% CI 0.60–0.63) and moderate to good between pairs of readers (0.54–0.75). It was very good (κ 0.81 95% CI 0.79–0.83), fair (κ 0.32 95% CI 0.29–0.34), moderate (κ 0.56 95% CI 0.54–0.58), and moderate (0.58 95% CI 0.56–0.61) for the categories evocative, compatible, not evocative, and normal, respectively. RT-PCR was positive in 97%, 50%, 31%, and 11% of cases in the respective categories. Observer agreement was lower (p < 0.001) and RT-PCR positive cases less frequently categorized evocative in the presence of an underlying pulmonary disease (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Interobserver agreement for chest CT reporting using categorization of findings is good in patients suspected of COVID-19. Among patients considered for hospitalization in an epidemic context, CT categorized evocative is highly predictive of COVID-19, whereas the predictive value of CT decreases between the categories compatible and not evocative. KEY POINTS: • In patients suspected of COVID-19, interobserver agreement for chest CT reporting into categories is good, and very good to categorize CT “evocative.” • Chest CT can participate in estimating the likelihood of COVID-19 in patients presenting to hospital during the outbreak, CT categorized “evocative” being highly predictive of the disease whereas almost a third of patients with CT “not evocative” had a positive RT-PCR in our study. • Observer agreement is lower and CTs of positive RT-PCR cases less frequently “evocative” in presence of an underlying pulmonary disease.","Debray, Marie-Pierre; Tarabay, Helena; Males, Lisa; Chalhoub, Nisrine; Mahdjoub, Elyas; Pavlovsky, Thomas; Visseaux, Benoît; Bouzid, Donia; Borie, Raphael; Wackenheim, Catherine; Crestani, Bruno; Rioux, Christophe; Saker, Loukbi; Choquet, Christophe; Mullaert, Jimmy; Khalil, Antoine",Eur Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07126-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32862289/,242

621737,Thoracic incidentaloma in a chest computed tomography scan of a patient with COVID-19,2021,"Endothelial cells have emerged as key players in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 inflammatory pathologies. Dysfunctional endothelial cells can promote chronic inflammation and disease processes like thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and lung injury. In endothelial cells, mitochondria regulate these inflammatory pathways via redox signaling, which is primarily achieved through mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Excess mtROS causes oxidative stress that can initiate and exacerbate senescence, a state that promotes inflammation and chronic endothelial dysfunction. Oxidative stress can also activate feedback loops that perpetuate mitochondrial dysfunction, mtROS overproduction, and inflammation. In this review, we provide an overview of phenotypes mediated by mtROS in endothelial cells – such as mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and senescence – as well as how these chronic states may be initiated by SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells. We also propose that SARS-CoV-2 activates mtROS-mediated feedback loops that cause long-term changes in host redox status and endothelial function, promoting cardiovascular disease and lung injury after recovery from COVID-19. Finally, we discuss the implications of these proposed pathways on long-term vascular health and potential treatments to address these chronic conditions.","Chang, Ryan; Mamun, Abrar; Dominic, Abishai; Le, Nhat-Tu",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519510/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.605908,242

This study describes the characteristics healthcare workers (HCWs) who tested positive for COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital in Oman. METHOD: a cross-sectional descriptive analysis of COVID-19 infected HCWs. RESULTS: During the study period, 204 HCWs were tested positive for COVID-19 by rRT-PCR test with a test positivity rate of 21.2% and the percentage of infected hospital staff was 4.3%. The mean age was 36 years, 2.2% of the male staff were infected while 9.3% of the female staff got infected. Among the clinicians, 4.7% were infected and among the nurses, 4.1% were infected. 61.3% (125) of infection were community acquired followed by hospital acquisition 25.5% (52) and no source was identified in 13.2% (27). There was a significant difference between hospital acquired and community acquired COVID-19 infection between different HCWs categories (p < 0.001), gender (p = 0.041) and being at risk of COVID 19 exposure in the hospital (p < 0.001).

SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People’s Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURE: A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.","Endriyas, Misganu; Kawza, Aknaw; Alano, Abraham; Hussen, Mamush; Shibru, Endashaw",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34049921/,242

Plague caused by Yersinia pestis endangers large populations during outbreaks or bioterrorism attacks. Recommended antibiotic countermeasures include well-established protocols based on animal studies and corroborated by effective treatment of human cases. Until now, prior exposure to viral respiratory infections was not taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate treatment for plague. Here, we show that as late as 25 days after exposure to influenza virus, convalescent mice still exhibited an increased susceptibility to sublethal doses of Y. pestis, presented with aberrant cytokine expression, and impaired neutrophil infiltration in the lungs. Increased levels of M2 alveolar macrophages and type II epithelial cells, as well as induction in metalloproteases expression and collagen and laminin degradation, suggested that the previous viral infection was under resolution, correlating with enhanced susceptibility to plague. Surprisingly, postexposure prophylaxis treatment with the recommended drugs revealed that ciprofloxacin was superior to doxycycline in mice recovering from influenza infection. These results suggest that after an influenza infection, the consequences, such as impaired immunity and lung tissue remodeling and damage, should be considered when treating subsequent Y. pestis exposure.","Vagima, Yaron; Gur, David; Erez, Noam; Achdout, Hagit; Aftalion, Moshe; Levy, Yinon; Zauberman, Ayelet; Tidhar, Avital; Gutman, Hila; Lazar, Shlomi; Israely, Tomer; Paran, Nir; Melamed, Sharon; Brosh-Nissimov, Tal; Chitlaru, Theodor; Sagi, Irit; Mamroud, Emanuelle",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-75840-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154422/,242

However, there is no review examining the broader aspect of research themes in online learning in the last decade. This systematic review addresses this gap by examining 619 research articles on online learning published in twelve journals in the last two decades. These studies were examined for publication trends and patterns, research themes, research methods, and research settings and compared with the research themes from the previous decades. While there has been a slight decrease in the number of studies on online learning in 2015 and 2016, it has then continued to increase in 2017 and 2018. The majority of the studies were quantitative in nature and were examined in higher education. Online learning research was categorized into twelve themes and a framework across learner, course and instructor, and organizational levels was developed. Online learner characteristics and online engagement were examined in a high number of studies and were consistent with three of the prior systematic reviews.

In these infections, the presence of one micro-organism generates a niche for other pathogenic micro-organisms to colonise, one micro-organism predisposes the host to colonisation by other micro-organisms, or two or more non-pathogenic micro-organisms together cause disease. STARTING POINT: Recently, Gili Regev-Yochay (JAMA 2004; 292: 716–20) and Debby Bogaert (Lancet 2004; 363: 1871–72), and their colleagues, suggested another interaction: microbial interference—the ability of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage to protect against Staphylococcus aureus carriage, and the inverse effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination on the increased carriage of Staph aureus and Staph-aureus-related disease. Strep pneumoniae carriage protected against Staph aureus carriage, and the bacterial interference could be disrupted by vaccinating children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that reduced nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-type Strep pneumoniae. WHERE NEXT: The medical community is recognising the significance of polymicrobial diseases and the major types of microbial community interactions associated with human health and disease. Many traditional therapies are just starting to take into account the polymicrobial cause of diseases and the repercussions of treatment and prevention.","Brogden, Kim A; Guthmiller, Janet M; Taylor, Christopher E",Lancet,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673605177459; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673605177459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15652608/,242

To understand this puzzle, we investigate how mitigation strategies and compliance can work together (or in opposition) to reduce (or increase) the spread of COVID-19 infection. Building on the Oxford index, we create state-specific stringency indices tailored to U.S. conditions, to measure the degree of strictness of public mitigation measures. A modified time-varying SEIRD model, incorporating this Stringency Index as well as a Compliance Indicator is then estimated with daily data for a sample of 6 U.S. states: New York, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, and Arizona. We provide a simple visual policy tool to evaluate the various combinations of mitigation policies and compliance that can reduce the basic reproduction number to less than one, the acknowledged threshold in the epidemiological literature to control the pandemic. Understanding of this relationship by both the public and policy makers is key to controlling the pandemic. This tool has the potential to be used in a real-time, dynamic fashion for flexible policy options. Our methodology can be applied to other countries and has the potential to be extended to other epidemiological models as well. With this first step in attempting to quantify the factors that go into the “black box” of the transmission factor β, we hope that our work will stimulate further research in the dual role of mitigation policies and compliance.","Mukerjee, Swati; Chow, Clifton M.; Li, Mingfei",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239352; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370739/,242

METHODS: Claimed subjects to the Korean National Health Insurance claims database diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Ten thousand sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 between January 28 and April 5, 2020, were included. Stratified random sampling of 1:5 was used to select the control group of COVID-19 patients. In total 50,587 subjects were selected as the control group. After deleting the missing values, 60,656 subjects were included. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio (OR) indicated that diabetic insulin users had a higher risk of COVID-19 than subjects without diabetes (OR, 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.53; P=0.0278). In the subgroup analysis, infection risk was higher among diabetes male insulin users (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89), those between 40 and 59 years (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.44). The infection risk was higher in diabetic insulin users with 2 to 4 years of morbidity (OR, 1.744; 95% CI, 1.003 to 3.044). CONCLUSION: Some diabetic patients with certain conditions would be associated with a higher risk of acquiring COVID-19, highlighting their need for special attention. Efforts are warranted to ensure that diabetic patients have minimal exposure to the virus. It is important to establish proactive care and screening tests for diabetic patients suspected with COVID-19 for timely disease diagnosis and management.","Chun, Sung-Youn; Kim, Dong Wook; Lee, Sang Ah; Lee, Su Jung; Chang, Jung Hyun; Choi, Yoon Jung; Kim, Seong Woo; Song, Sun Ok",Diabetes Metab J,https://doi.org/10.4093/dmj.2020.0199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389959/,242

VERSO exploits an efficient algorithmic strategy to return robust phylogenies from clonal variant profiles, also in conditions of sampling limitations. It then leverages variant frequency patterns to characterize the intra-host genomic diversity of samples, revealing undetected infection chains and pinpointing variants likely involved in homoplasies. On simulations, VERSO outperforms state-of-the-art tools for phylogenetic inference. Notably, the application to 6726 Amplicon and RNA-seq samples refines the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, while co-occurrence patterns of minor variants unveil undetected infection paths, which are validated with contact tracing data. Finally, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutational landscape uncovers a temporal increase of overall genomic diversity, and highlights variants transiting from minor to clonal state and homoplastic variants, some of which falling on the spike gene.

To control spread and finally contain novel viruses, rapid identification and subsequent isolation of infected individuals and their contacts is of utmost importance. Next to methods for nucleic acid detection, validated serological assays are particularly important as the timeframe for antibody detection is less restricted. During the SARS-CoV epidemic a wide variety of serological diagnostic assays were established using multiple methods as well as different viral antigens. Even though the majority of the developed assays showed high sensitivity and specificity, numerous studies reported on cross-reactive antibodies to antigens from wide-spread common cold associated CoVs. In order to improve preparedness and responsiveness during future outbreaks of novel CoVs, information and problems regarding serological diagnosis that occurred during the SARS-CoV should be acknowledged. In this review we summarize the performance of different serological assays as well as the applicability of the two main applied antigens (spike and nucleocapsid protein) used during the SARS-CoV outbreak. We highlight challenges and potential pitfalls that occur when dealing with a novel emerging coronavirus like MERS-CoV. In addition we describe problems that might occur when animal sera are tested in serological assays for the identification of putative reservoirs.

Our findings demonstrated the clonal cells were mainly composed of CD4(+) T cells in response to Pneumocystis, which were marked by highly expressed genes associated with T cell activation. Mice infected with Pneumocystis showed reduced TCR diversity in CD4(+) T cells and increased diversity in CD8(+) T cells compared with uninfected controls. Furthermore, Th17 cells were mostly clonal CD4(+) T cells, which exhibited the phenotype of tissue-resident memory-like Th17 cells. In addition, Pneumocystis-infected mice showed biased usage of TCRβ VDJ genes.

631861,The Clinical Significance of Procalcitonin Elevation in Patients over 75 Years Old Admitted for COVID-19 Pneumonia,2021-06-28,"Background Radiological examinations have a significant role in the diagnosis and management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Many COVID-19 patients show typical Chest Computed Tomography (CT Scan) features which can aid in the diagnoses and triaging of such patients. This is especially so in resource-limited settings where access to molecular diagnostic techniques such as Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is not optimal. We report chest CT findings in 28 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Ghana. Objective To document common chest CT scan findings amongst patients with COVID-19 infection in Ghana. Method Chest CT scans of twenty-eight COVID-19 patients (n=28) were retrieved and reviewed independently by 2 experienced radiologists and their findings documented. Two 64 and one 32 slice spiral CT scanners were used at three centres. Results Chest CT Images from 16 males(57.1.7%) and 12 females(42.9%) patients aged between 36 and 65 years with mean age of 55.9 years (SD-8.4years) were evaluated. Of these, 21 (75.0%) of them were COVID-19 patients who were undiagnosed at the time of imaging while 7(25.0%) were known confirmed COVID-19 patients. On the chest CT scans (n=28), 17(66.7%) patients showed predominantly ground glass opacities while 12(42.9%) had evidence of consolidation predominantly. In 26(92.9%) of the patients, the opacities were bilateral and peripheral in distribution. None of these patients had pleural effusion. Conclusion COVID-19 patients tend to manifest typical imaging features on chest CT scan . The most common chest imaging finding was bilateral, peripheral and predominantly basal ground glass opacities. Importantly, these findings were frequently obtained before PCR diagnosis. Chest CT scan can help in the diagnosis and triaging of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients in jurisdictions with limited PCR diagnostic capacity and can improve early isolation, contact tracing and treatment thus helping to reduce community spread, morbidity and mortality.","Sarkodie, Benjamin Dabo; Mensah, Yaw Boateng; Ayetey, Harold; Dzefi-Tettey, Klenam; Brakohiapa, Edmund; Kaminta, Andrew; Idun, Ewurama",J Med Imaging Radiat Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33342483/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1939865420303003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1939865420303003?v=s5,242

Identification of targetable mechanisms continues and includes investigations into the role of inflammatory pathways. Of interest, MAPK is aberrantly expressed in CRC patients, yet the activation status is not defined. The present study assessed p38γ activation in CRC patients, cancer cells, and tissues of cotton top tamarin (CTT) and common marmoset (CM). The primate world is an overlooked resource as colitis-CRC-prone CTT are usually inure to liver metastasis while CM develop colitis but not CRC. The results demonstrate that p38γ protein and phosphorylation levels are significantly increased in CRC patients compared to normal subjects and CTT. Furthermore, p38γ phosphorylation is significantly elevated in human CRC cells and hepatoblastoma cells but not in CM colon. Additionally, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and biliary glycoprotein (BGP) are induced in the CRC patients that showed p38γ phosphorylation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK in CRC cells showed a significant decline in cell growth with no effect on apoptosis or BGP level. Overall, p38γ is activated in CRC tumorigenesis and likely involves CEA antigens during CRLM in humans but not in the CTT or CM, that rarely develop CRLM.","Talwar, Harvinder; McVicker, Benita; Tobi, Martin",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33276422/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040720,242

632067,The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis in COVID-19 pneumonia: report of two cases,2020-05-17,"BACKGROUND: Serological test is helpful in confirming and tracking infectious diseases in large population with the advantage of fast and convenience. Using the specific epitope peptides identified from the whole antigen as the detection antigen is sensitive and relatively economical. The development of epitope peptide-based detection kits for COVID-19 patients requires comprehensive information about epitope peptides. But the data on B cell epitope of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is still limited. More importantly, there is a lack of serological data on the peptides in the population. In this study, we aimed to identify the B cell epitope peptides of spike protein and detect the reactivity in serum samples, for further providing data support for their subsequent serological applications. RESULTS: Two B cell linear epitopes, P104 and P82, located in non-RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 S protein were identified by indirect ELISA screening of an overlapping peptide library of the S protein with COVID-19 patients’ convalescent serum. And the peptides were verified by testing with 165 serum samples. P104 has not been reported previously; P82 is contained in peptide S21P2 reported before. The positive reaction rates of epitope peptides S14P5 and S21P2, the two non-RBD region epitopes identified by Poh et al., and P82 and P104 were 77.0%, 73.9%, 61.2% and 30.3%, respectively, for 165 convalescent sera, including 30 asymptomatic patients. Although P104 had the lowest positive rate for total patients (30.3%), it exhibited slight advantage for detection of asymptomatic infections (36.7%). Combination of epitopes significantly improved the positive reaction rate. Among all combination patterns, (S14P5 + S21P2 + P104) pattern exhibited the highest positive reaction rate for all patients (92.7%), as well as for asymptomatic infections (86.7%), confirming the feasibility of P104 as supplementary antigen for serological detection. In addition, we analyzed the correlation between epitopes with neutralizing antibody, but only S14P5 had a medium positive correlation with neutralizing antibody titre (r(s) = 0.510, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our research proved that epitopes on non-RBD region are of value in serological detection especially when combination more than one epitope, thus providing serological reaction information about the four epitopes, which has valuable references for their usage.

632640,Testosterone Deficiency Is a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19,2021-06-18,"What influences the adoption of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation behaviors–both personal, such as mask wearing and frequent handwashing, and social, such as avoiding large gatherings and physical contact–across countries? Understanding why some individuals are more willing to change their behavior to mitigate the spread of a pandemic will not only help us to address the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but also to respond to future ones. Researchers have pointed to a variety of factors that may influence individual adoption of personal and social mitigation behaviors, including social inequality, risk perception, personality traits, and government policies. While not denying the importance of these factors, we argue that the role of trust and confidence has received insufficient attention to date. Our study explores whether there is a difference in the way trust and confidence in particular leaders and organizations affect individual compliance and whether this effect is consistent across different types of mitigation behaviors. Specifically, we utilize an original cross-national survey conducted during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (May-June 2020) to investigate how trust in scientists, medical professionals, politicians, and religious leaders and confidence in global, national, and local health organizations affects individual compliance in 16 countries/territories across five world regions. Our analyses, which control for the aforementioned factors as well as several others, suggest that trust in politicians and confidence in national health ministries have the most consistent influence on whether individuals adopt both personal and social mitigation behaviors. Across our sample, we find that greater trust in politicians is associated with lower levels of individual compliance with public health directives, whereas greater confidence in the national health ministry is associated with higher levels of individual compliance. Our findings suggest the need to understand trust and confidence as among the most important individual level characteristics driving compliance when developing and delivering messaging about the adoption of mitigation behaviors. The content of the message, it seems, will be most effective when citizens across countries trust its source. Trusted sources, such as politicians and the national health ministry, should thus consider working closely together when determining and communicating recommended health behaviors to avoid contradicting one another.","Jones, Pauline; Menon, Anil; Hicken, Allen; Rozek, Laura S.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495998/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256159,242
632721,"COVID‐19: a collision of complement, coagulation and inflammatory pathways",2020-06-30,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Pets are an integrative part of everyday life. Understanding the impact that pets have on human mental health and wellbeing, especially during periods of prolonged social isolation, is vitally important to determine whether animals can be integrated in prevention, recovery and intervention programmes to promote mental health and wellbeing. Research, with Western samples, suggests a positive impact of pets on humans; however, there is a lack of research on the effects of human–animal interactions in Southeast Asia. The aim of this study was to address this gap and to explore whether and how pets impact mental health and wellbeing in Malaysia during the COVID-19 induced movement control order (MCO). Additionally, the study explored if there was any interaction between other demographics, like age, gender, education, and pet ownership when it comes to mental health and wellbeing. The results show that in comparisons with people without animals, pet owners had significantly higher levels of mental wellbeing, in that they felt they could cope better with adverse situations and experienced significantly more positive emotions during the lockdown. On the other hand, there were no differences in levels of depression, stress, resilience, anxiety and negative emotions between the two participant groups. These results indicate that although the information about human–animal interaction is limited in Malaysia, pets can have a positive impact on some aspects of mental health and wellbeing and be actively integrated into promoting mental health and wellbeing in situations where people are socially isolated and experiencing difficulties coping with adversities or negative emotions. ABSTRACT: The adverse impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) on mental and physical health has been witnessed across the globe. Associated mental health and wellbeing issues include stress, social isolation, boredom, and anxiety. Research suggests human–animal interactions may improve the overall wellbeing of an individual. However, this has been less explored in Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia and the present study examined the effect of pets on the mental health and wellbeing of Malaysians during the lockdown, or movement control order (MCO), due to COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was carried out, with 448 Malaysian participants, who completed online assessments for psychological outcomes, psychological wellbeing, positive–negative emotions, resilience, and coping self-efficacy. Results indicate that pet owners reported significantly better coping self-efficacy, significantly more positive emotions, and better psychological wellbeing, but contrary to expectations, there was no differences on other measures. Among pet owners, cat owners reported more positive emotions and greater wellbeing than dog owners. The results show that that pets have some impact on improved psychological health of their owners and could be integrated into recovery frameworks for promoting mental health and wellbeing.","Grajfoner, Dasha; Ke, Guek Nee; Wong, Rachel Mei Ming",Animals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11092689; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34573655/,242

The psychotic symptoms persisted for about 40 days. Her magnetic resonance imaging brain scan, electroencephalogram, cerebrospinal fluid examination and extensive autoimmune panel did not show any abnormalities. The cause of the psychotic symptoms in this patient were not ascertained but we propose either an inflammatory state, characterised by the patient's elevated TNF-alpha levels as a possible contributing mechanism for her psychosis in line with the proinflammatory changes observed in some cases of psychosis.

634335,COVID-19 in cancer patients: Risk factors for the development of severe clinical event (SCE),2020-09-30,"Movement trajectories are usually recorded as a sequence of discrete movement events described by two parameters: step length (distance) and turning angle (bearing). One of the most widespread methods to record the geocoordinates of each step is by a GPS device. Such devices have limited suitability for recording fine movements of species with low dispersal ability including flightless carabid beetles at small spatio‐temporal scales. As an alternative, the distance‐bearing approach can avoid the measurement error of GPS units since it uses directly measured distances and compass azimuths. As no quantification of measurement error between distance‐bearing and GPS approaches exists so far, we generated artificial fine‐scale trajectories and in addition radio‐tracked living carabids in a temperate forest and recorded each movement step by both methods. Trajectories obtained from distance‐bearing were compared to those obtained by a GPS device in terms of movement parameters. Consequently, both types of trajectories were segmented by state‐switching modeling into two distinct movement stages typical for carabids: random walk and directed movement. We found that the measurement error of GPS compared to distance‐bearing was 1.878 m (SEM = 0.181 m) for distances and 31.330° (SEM = 2.066°) for bearings. Moreover, these errors increased under dense forest canopy and rainy weather. Distance error did not change with increasing distance recorded by distance‐bearing but bearings were significantly more sensitive to error at short distances. State‐switching models showed only slight, not significant, differences in movement states between the two methods in favor of the random walk in the distance‐bearing approach. However, the shape of the GPS‐measured trajectories considerably differed from those recorded by distance‐bearing caused especially by bearing error at short distances. Our study showed that distance‐bearing could be more appropriate for recording movement steps not only of ground‐dwelling beetles but also other small animals at fine spatio‐temporal scales.","Růžičková, Jana; Elek, Zoltán",Ecol Evol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257916/,242

METHODS: We study 200 million interactions captured from Twitter during the early stage of the pandemic, from January to April 2020, to understand its socio-informational structure on a global scale. FINDINGS: The COVID-19 global communication network is characterized by knowledge groups, hierarchically organized in sub-groups with well-defined geo-political and ideological characteristics. Communication is mostly segregated within groups and driven by a small number of subjects: 0.1% of users account for up to 45% and 10% of activities and news shared, respectively, centralizing the information flow. INTERPRETATION: Contradicting the idea that digital social media favor active participation and co-creation of online content, our results imply that public health policy strategies to counter the effects of the infodemic must not only focus on information content, but also on the social articulation of its diffusion mechanisms, as a given community tends to be relatively impermeable to news generated by non-aligned sources.","Sacco, Pier Luigi; Gallotti, Riccardo; Pilati, Federico; Castaldo, Nicola; De Domenico, Manlio",Soc Sci Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34364158/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953621005475; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621005475; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114215,242

Whether a favorable evolution in lung function and/or radiological abnormalities is to be expected beyond 3 months is uncertain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a real-life follow-up study assessing the evolution in lung function, chest CT and ventilation distribution between 10 weeks and 6 months after diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were assessed at 6 months of whom 63 had chest CT at both follow-up visits and 46 had multiple breath washout testing to obtain lung clearance index (LCI). The study group was divided into a restrictive (n = 39) and a non-restrictive subgroup (n = 40) based on TLC z-score. Restriction was associated with a history of intubation, neuromuscular blockade use and critical illness polyneuropathy. Restriction significantly improved over time, but was not resolved by 6 months (median TLC z-score of −2.2 [IQR: −2.7; −1.5] at 6 months versus −2.7 [IQR: −3.1; −2.1] at 10 weeks). LCI did not evolve between both follow-up visits. Symptoms and chest CT score improved irrespective of restriction. CONCLUSION: We observed a disconnect between the improvement of COVID-19 related symptoms, chest CT lesions, and corresponding lung function. While CT imaging is almost normalized at 6 months, a further reduction of pulmonary restriction may be hoped for beyond 6 months in those patients showing restriction at their first follow-up visit.","Stylemans, Dimitri; Smet, Jelle; Hanon, Shane; Schuermans, Daniël; Ilsen, Bart; Vandemeulebroucke, Jef; Vanderhelst, Eef; Verbanck, Sylvia",Respir Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmed.2021.106421; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901788/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S095461112100127X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095461112100127X?v=s5,242

OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of rhinovirus infections in relation to the atopic status of children treated for wheezing in Costa Rica, a country with an increased asthma burden. METHODS: The children enrolled (n=287) were 7 through 12 years old. They included 96 with acute wheezing, 65 with stable asthma, and 126 non-asthmatic controls. PCR methods, including gene sequencing to identify rhinovirus strains, were used to identify viral pathogens in nasal washes. Results were examined in relation to wheezing, total IgE, allergen-specific IgE antibody, and levels of expired nitric oxide (FE(NO)). RESULTS: Sixty-four percent of wheezing children compared to 13% of children with stable asthma and 17% of the non-asthmatic controls tested positive for rhinovirus (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Among wheezing subjects, 75% of the rhinoviruses detected were Group C strains. High titers of IgE antibodies to dust mite allergen (especially Dermatophagoides sp) were common and correlated significantly with levels of total IgE and FE(NO). The greatest risk for wheezing was observed among children with titers of IgE antibodies to dust mite ≥17.5 IU/ml who tested positive for rhinovirus (odds ratio for wheezing: 31.5; 95% CI 8.3–108, p<0.001).

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has made caring for youth with an ED even more onerous and preliminary research is beginning to emerge demonstrating the profound negative impact the pandemic is having upon individuals with EDs and their carers. MAIN: In this review, we briefly summarize what is known about carer burden in families where a young person has an ED, consider the additional impact consequent to COVID-19 and highlight the need for interventions aimed at alleviating this. Pre-COVID-19 research identifies high levels of psychological and physical strain amongst those caring for a child with an ED. Themes are beginning to emerge as to why COVID-19 may further exacerbate carer burden: (1) reduced access to ED services; (2) increased physical vulnerability and exacerbation of psychiatric co-morbidity amongst youth with EDs; (3) increased practical demands placed on carers; and (4) social isolation and decreased social support. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a specific threat to the mental health of youth with EDs and their carers. Given the salient role families play in caring for youth with an ED, attending to carer burden is imperative. Supporting carers through all phases of their child’s ED journey by offering adaptive and flexible supportive services which accommodate time constraints, geographic barriers and possible COVID-19 spread is essential.","Maunder, Kristen; McNicholas, Fiona",J Eat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602093/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-021-00485-7,242

Twenty-two patients received immunoglobulin therapy, and 32 were given corticosteroids. A total of 20 patients (55.6%) required supplemental oxygen, and 8 (22.2%) were intubated with mechanical ventilatory support. Two of these patients died. A higher body temperature at presentation (median 39.5 vs 38.6°C), and higher peak values of lactate dehydrogenase (410 vs 282 U/L) and C-reactive protein (10.2 vs 2.5 mg/dL), were associated with subsequent respiratory failure. Multivariate analysis showed that peak level of C-reactive protein was the only independent predictor of respiratory failure and intubation (odds ratio for every increment of 1 mg/dL = 1.45; 95% confidence interval = 1.003, 2.097; p = 0.048). Conclusion All patients with probable SARS who were admitted to hospital presented with fever and lymphopenia. While the efficacy of different treatments could not be evaluated from this retrospective study, a higher value of C-reactive protein was associated with the development of respiratory failure and subsequent intubation.","Liu, Chun-Yu; Huang, Lin-Ju; Lai, Chung-Hsu; Chen, Hsin-Pai; Chen, Te-Li; Fung, Chang-Phone; Li, Cheng-Yi",Journal of the Chinese Medical Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15813244/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S172649010970231X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S172649010970231X,242

A possible ritonavir–rocuronium interaction interfering weaning from mechanical ventilation in a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia",2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging serious global health problem. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. RESULTS: Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94. CONCLUSION: The gut microbial signature of patients with COVID-19 was different from that of H1N1 patients and HC. Our study suggests the potential value of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for COVID-19, but further validation is needed.","Gu, Silan; Chen, Yanfei; Wu, Zhengjie; Chen, Yunbo; Gao, Hainv; Lv, Longxian; Guo, Feifei; Zhang, Xuewu; Luo, Rui; Huang, Chenjie; Lu, Haifeng; Zheng, Beiwen; Zhang, Jiaying; Yan, Ren; Zhang, Hua; Jiang, Huiyong; Xu, Qiaomai; Guo, Jing; Gong, Yiwen; Tang, Lingling; Li, Lanjuan",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32497191/,242

Persons with disabilities are more likely than are those without disabilities to have chronic health conditions (2) and also face barriers to accessing health care (3). These and other health and social inequities have placed persons with disabilities at increased risk for COVID-19-related illness and death, yet they face unique barriers to receipt of vaccination (4,5). Although CDC encourages that considerations be made when expanding vaccine access to persons with disabilities,* few public health surveillance systems measure disability status. To describe COVID-19 vaccination status and intent, as well as perceived vaccine access among adults by disability status, data from the National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM) were analyzed. Adults with a disability were less likely than were those without a disability to report having received ≥1 dose of COVID-19 vaccine (age-adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.93) but more likely to report they would definitely get vaccinated (aPR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.43-2.42). Among unvaccinated adults, those with a disability were more likely to report higher endorsement of vaccine as protection (aPR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.16-1.44), yet more likely to report it would be or was difficult to get vaccinated than did adults without a disability (aPR = 2.69; 95% CI = 2.16-3.34).

However, there is insufficient research on risk factors for readmission and management of patients after discharge is poor. In this study, 7590 confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients were defined as a target for analysis using nationwide medical claims data. The demographic characteristics, underlying diseases, and the use of medical resources were used to examine the association with readmission through the chi-square test and then logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze factors affecting readmission. Of the 7590 subjects analyzed, 328 patients were readmitted. The readmission rates of men, older age and patients with medical benefits showed a high risk of readmission. The Charlson Comorbidity Index score was also related to COVID-19 readmission. Concerning requiring medical attention, there was a higher risk of readmission for the patients with chest radiographs, computed tomography scans taken and lopinavir/ritonavir at the time of their first admission. Considering the risk factors presented in this study, classifying patients with a high risk of readmission and managing patients before and after discharge based on priority can make patient management and medical resource utilization more efficient. This study also indicates the importance of lifestyle management after discharge.","Jeon, Woo-Hwi; Seon, Jeong Yeon; Park, So-Youn; Oh, In-Hwan",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806775/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165844,242

STUDY DESIGN: It was cross sectional survey conducted by personal interviews. METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted by interviewing 302 HCPs from 7 major district headquarter hospitals of AJK from May to September 2020. The questionnaire included 29 questions about demography, perception, training, preparedness, knowledge and awareness of HCPs about COVID-19. The data was encoded and analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents (78.5%) believed that corona-virus is a serious health threat. However, 10.6% perceived it as a bio-weapon and 4.3% as not dangerous. About 10% of doctors were not considering it very dangerous compared to 1% of paramedics and 2.5% of the supporting staff (P = 0.003). About 55% of the respondents showed confidence of the steps taken by government for prevention of COVID-19 while 45% had an opposite view. More than 70% of the participants had no formal training and the ratio of trained personals was significantly higher (0.018) in paramedical staff (33%) than doctors (15%). About 53% of the respondents were not satisfied with the provision of PPEs and 64% were not satisfied with their work and wages situation. Majority of the respondents (97%) were observed to follow the protocols for personal protection. CONCLUSION: Majority of HCPs perceive covid-19 as a serious health concern.

638435,"Abdominal CT in COVID-19 patients: incidence, indications, and findings",2020-09-19,"NS5 is the largest and most conserved protein among the four dengue virus (DENV) serotypes. It has been the target of interest for antiviral drug development due to its major role in replication. NS5 consists of two domains, the N-terminal methyltransferase domain and C-terminal catalytic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain. It is an unstable protein and is prone to inactivation upon prolonged incubation at room temperature, thus affecting the inhibitor screening assays. In the current study, we expressed and purified DENV RdRp alone in Esherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The N-terminally His-tagged construct of DENV RdRp was transformed into E. coli expression strain BL-21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.4 mM. The induced cultures were then grown for 20 h at 18 °C and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C. The recombinant protein was purified using HisTrap affinity column (Ni-NTA) and then the sample was subjected to size exclusion chromatography, which successfully removed the degradation product obtained during the previous purification step. The in vitro polymerase activity of RdRp was successfully demonstrated using homopolymeric polycytidylic acid (poly(rC)) RNA template. This study describes the high level production of enzymatically active DENV RdRp protein which can be used to develop assays for testing large number of compounds in a high-throughput manner. RdRp has the de novo initiation activity and the in vitro polymerase assays for the protein provide a platform for highly robust and efficient antiviral compound screening systems.","Amraiz, Deeba; Zaidi, Najam-us-Sahar Sadaf; Fatima, Munazza",Enzyme Microb Technol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2016.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542741/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141022916301120; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0141022916301120,242

Elderly patients with cardiac, pulmonary and metabolic comorbidities are more likely to develop the severe manifestations of COVID‐19, which are observed in less than 5% of the pediatric patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) is able to induce an immune impairment and dysregulation, finally resulting in the massive release of inflammatory mediators, strongly contributing to the pulmonary and systemic manifestations in COVID‐19. In children, the immune dysregulation following SARS‐CoV‐2 can also be responsible of a severe disease phenotype defined as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. As the immune system undergoes a complex process of maturation from birth to adult age, differences in the immune and inflammatory response could have a significant impact in determining the spectrum of severity of COVID‐19. Indeed, children show a higher ability to respond to viral infections and a reduced baseline pro‐inflammatory state compared with elderly patients. Age and comorbidities contribute to disease severity through immune‐mediated mechanisms, since they are associated with a chronic increase of pro‐inflammatory mediators, and cause an enhanced susceptibility to develop an immune dysregulation following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Also the expression of ACE2, the receptor of SARS‐CoV‐2, varies with age, and is linked to the immune and inflammatory response through a complex, and not completely elucidated, network. This paper reviews the peculiar immunopathogenic aspects of COVID‐19, with a focus on the differences between adult and pediatric patients.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Spada, Erika; Consolini, Rita",Immun Inflamm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33566457/; https://doi.org/10.1002/iid3.404,242

Via both mechanism, immune impairments and cardiometabolic concomitant diseases, patients with GC excess could be at increased risk for COVID-19. The impact on incidence and outcome of a SARS-CoV-2 infection in this population are not yet completely clear. This review aims to compile the data available to date and to discuss the existing literature on this topic. Further we highlight potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis as well as the influence of endogenous or exogenous GC excess on SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. There is growing evidence suggesting an increased risk of infection and severe outcome in patients with high-dose GC therapy after contracting SARS-CoV-2. The few data and case reports on patients with endogenous GC excess and SARS-CoV-2 infection point in a similar direction: chronic GC excess seems to be associated with an unfavorable course of COVID-19. Whether this is mainly a primary immune-mediated effect, or also triggered by the many GC-associated comorbidities in this population, is not yet fully understood. Patients with endogenous or exogenous GC excess should be considered as a vulnerable group during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Regardless of the cause, vaccination and consistent surveillance and control of associated comorbidities are recommended.","Vogel, Frederick; Reincke, Martin",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-021-09670-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34241765/,242
639517,Small Droplet Emission in Exhaled Breath During Different Breathing Manoeuvres: Implications for Clinical Lung Function Testing during COVID‐19,2020-09-23,"Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and previous pandemics have been viewed almost exclusively as virology problems, with toxicology problems mostly being ignored. This perspective is not supported by the evolution of COVID-19, where the impact of real-life exposures to multiple toxic stressors degrading the immune system is followed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus exploiting the degraded immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID-19. This immune system degradation from multiple toxic stressors (chemical, physical, biological, psychosocial stressors) means that attribution of serious consequences from COVID-19 should be made to the virus-toxic stressors nexus, not to any of the nexus constituents in isolation. The leading toxic stressors (identified in this study as contributing to COVID-19) are pervasive, contributing to myriad chronic diseases as well as immune system degradation. They increase the likelihood for comorbidities and mortality associated with COVID-19. For the short-term, tactical/reactive virology-focused treatments are of higher priority than strategic/proactive toxicology-focused treatments, although both could be implemented in parallel to reinforce each other. However, for long-term pandemic prevention, toxicology-based approaches should be given higher priority than virology-based approaches. Since current COVID-19 treatments globally ignore the toxicology component almost completely, only limited benefits can be expected from these treatments.","Kostoff, Ronald N.; Briggs, Michael B.; Porter, Alan L.; Hernández, Antonio F.; Abdollahi, Mohammad; Aschner, Michael; Tsatsakis, Aristidis",Food and Chemical Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2020.111687; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278691520305779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32805343/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691520305779?v=s5,242

The Crank–Nicolson method for time discretization is used and a continuous, piecewise linear finite element space is employed for the space discretization. The a posteriori error estimators corresponding to space discretization are derived by using the interpolation estimates. Two different continuous, piecewise quadratic reconstructions are used to obtain the error due to the time discretization. To estimate the error in the approximation of the delay term, linear approximations of the delay term are used in a crucial way. As a consequence, a posteriori upper and lower error bounds for fully discrete approximation are derived for the first time. In particular, long-time a posteriori error estimates are obtained for stable systems. Numerical experiments are presented which confirm our theoretical results.","Wang, Wansheng; Yi, Lijun; Xiao, Aiguo",J Sci Comput,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10915-020-01262-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834471/,242

The aim of this study was to determine factors that could possibly affect the acceptance of Indonesian citizens of COVID-19 vaccination using a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), a model how users come to accept and use a technology. Methods: An online survey was conducted between the first and fifth of November, 2020. Participants were asked to respond to questions on acceptance, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived religiosity towards, and amount of information about COVID-19. This study used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the framework to decide factors that affect vaccine acceptance. Structural Equation Model was employed to assess the correlation between all explanatory variables and vaccine acceptance. Mann-Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis rank were employed to assess demographic factors associated with acceptance. Results: In total, 311 responses were included for analysis. Our TAM model suggested that high perceived usefulness significantly increased COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and high perceived ease of use significantly increased the perceived usefulness. Perceived religiosity did not substantially affect vaccine acceptance. The amount of information on COVID-19 also did not significantly affect vaccine acceptance. Our data suggested that vaccine acceptance was associated with age, type of occupation, marital status and monthly income to some degree. Conclusion: Since perceived usefulness affects vaccine acceptance, the government should focus on the usefulness of the vaccine when promoting the COVID-19 vaccine to Indonesian citizens. In addition, since perceived ease of use significantly affects users’ acceptance to COVID-19 vaccine, the easier to acquire the vaccine in the community, the higher chance that the citizens are willing to be vaccinated.","Faturohman, Taufik; Kengsiswoyo, Giofella Adesta Navaky; Harapan, Harapan; Zailani, Suhaiza; Rahadi, R.

Realms of virtual communication including meetings, networking, surgery department administration, social media, application processes, and advice for early or mid-career academic surgeons are explored. Virtual conferences pose a new challenge by removing the in-person component that is evident to be integral to networking, collaboration, and all aspects of academic socialization. Strategies such as creating virtual chat rooms, mentor-mentee virtual introductions, and deliberate interactions can enhance the experience. Virtual administrative meetings require special attention to preparation and strategies to insure engagement.

641068,Questioning the association between ABO type and outcomes in patients with COVID-19,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Spatial and temporal lung infection distributions of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their changes could reveal important patterns to better understand the disease and its time course. This paper presents a pipeline to analyze statistically these patterns by automatically segmenting the infection regions and registering them onto a common template. METHODS: A VB-Net is designed to automatically segment infection regions in CT images. After training and validating the model, we segmented all the CT images in the study. The segmentation results are then warped onto a pre-defined template CT image using deformable registration based on lung fields. Then, the spatial distributions of infection regions and those during the course of the disease are calculated at the voxel level. Visualization and quantitative comparison can be performed between different groups. We compared the distribution maps between COVID-19 and community acquired pneumonia (CAP), between severe and critical COVID-19, and across the time course of the disease. RESULTS: For the performance of infection segmentation, comparing the segmentation results with manually annotated ground-truth, the average Dice is 91.6% ± 10.0%, which is close to the inter-rater difference between two radiologists (the Dice is 96.1% ± 3.5%). The distribution map of infection regions shows that high probability regions are in the peripheral subpleural (up to 35.1% in probability). COVID-19 GGO lesions are more widely spread than consolidations, and the latter are located more peripherally. Onset images of severe COVID-19 (inpatients) show similar lesion distributions but with smaller areas of significant difference in the right lower lobe compared to critical COVID-19 (intensive care unit patients). About the disease course, critical COVID-19 patients showed four subsequent patterns (progression, absorption, enlargement, and further absorption) in our collected dataset, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations. CONCLUSIONS: By segmenting the infection regions with a VB-Net and registering all the CT images and the segmentation results onto a template, spatial distribution patterns of infections can be computed automatically. The algorithm provides an effective tool to visualize and quantify the spatial patterns of lung infection diseases and their changes during the disease course. Our results demonstrate different patterns between COVID-19 and CAP, between severe and critical COVID-19, as well as four subsequent disease course patterns of the severe COVID-19 patients studied, with remarkable concurrent HU patterns for GGO and consolidations.

Though diagnostic tests are fundamental to the ability to detect and respond, many health systems are already experiencing shortages of reagents associated with this test. Here, testing a pooling approach for the standard RT-qPCR test, we find that a single positive sample can be detected even in pools of up to 32 samples, with an estimated false negative rate of 10%. Detection of positive samples diluted in even up to 64 samples may also be attainable, though may require additional amplification cycles. As it uses the standard protocols, reagents and equipment, this pooling method can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. We hope that such implementation of a pool test for COVID-19 would allow expanding current screening capacities thereby enabling the expansion of detection in the community, as well as in close integral groups, such as hospital departments, army units, or factory shifts.","Yelin, Idan; Aharony, Noga; Shaer-Tamar, Einat; Argoetti, Amir; Messer, Esther; Berenbaum, Dina; Shafran, Einat; Kuzli, Areen; Gandali, Nagam; Hashimshony, Tamar; Mandel-Gutfreund, Yael; Halberthal, Michael; Geffen, Yuval; Szwarcwort-Cohen, Moran; Kishony, Roy",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20039438,242

642059,The Case for Therapeutic Massage as an Adjuvant in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION: Severe COVID-19 illness in adults has been linked to underlying medical conditions. This study identified frequent underlying conditions and their attributable risk of severe COVID-19 illness. METHODS: We used data from more than 800 US hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database Special COVID-19 Release (PHD-SR) to describe hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older with COVID-19 from March 2020 through March 2021. We used multivariable generalized linear models to estimate adjusted risk of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, and death associated with frequent conditions and total number of conditions. RESULTS: Among 4,899,447 hospitalized adults in PHD-SR, 540,667 (11.0%) were patients with COVID-19, of whom 94.9% had at least 1 underlying medical condition. Essential hypertension (50.4%), disorders of lipid metabolism (49.4%), and obesity (33.0%) were the most common. The strongest risk factors for death were obesity (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.27–1.33), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aRR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25–1.31), and diabetes with complication (aRR = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.24–1.28), as well as the total number of conditions, with aRRs of death ranging from 1.53 (95% CI, 1.41–1.67) for patients with 1 condition to 3.82 (95% CI, 3.45–4.23) for patients with more than 10 conditions (compared with patients with no conditions). CONCLUSION: Certain underlying conditions and the number of conditions were associated with severe COVID-19 illness. Hypertension and disorders of lipid metabolism were the most frequent, whereas obesity, diabetes with complication, and anxiety disorders were the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. Careful evaluation and management of underlying conditions among patients with COVID-19 can help stratify risk for severe illness.","Kompaniyets, Lyudmyla; Pennington, Audrey F.; Goodman, Alyson B.; Rosenblum, Hannah G.; Belay, Brook; Ko, Jean Y.; Chevinsky, Jennifer R.; Schieber, Lyna Z.; Summers, April D.; Lavery, Amy M.; Preston, Leigh Ellyn; Danielson, Melissa L.; Cui, Zhaohui; Namulanda, Gonza; Yusuf, Hussain; Mac Kenzie, William R.; Wong, Karen K.; Baggs, James; Boehmer, Tegan K.; Gundlapalli, Adi V.",Prev Chronic Dis,https://doi.org/10.5888/pcd18.210123; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34197283/,242
642170,Evaluating the efficacy of extracted squalene from seed oil in the form of microemulsion for the treatment of COVID‐19: A clinical study,2021-08-26,"In recent times,COVID-19, has a great impact on the healthcare sector and results in a wide range of respiratory illnesses. It is a type of Ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, which affects humans as well as animals. Though several artificial intelligence-based COVID-19 diagnosis models have been presented in the literature, most of the works have not focused on the hyperparameter tuning process. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent COVID-19 diagnosis model using a barnacle mating optimization (BMO) algorithm with a cascaded recurrent neural network (CRNN) model, named BMO-CRNN. The proposed BMO-CRNN model aims to detect and classify the existence of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images. Initially, image pre-processing is applied to enhance the quality of the image. Next, the CRNN model is applied as feature extraction and the hyperparameter tuning of CRNN takes place via the BMO algorithm to improve the classification performance. The BMO algorithm determines the optimal values of the CRNN hyperparameters namely learning rate, batch size, activation function, and epoch count. The application of CRNN and hyperparameter tuning using BMO algorithm shows the novelty of this work. A comprehensive simulation analysis is carried out to ensure the better performance of the BMO-CRNN model and the experimental outcome is investigated using several performance metrics. The simulation results portrayed that the BMO-CRNN model has showcased optimal performance with an average sensitivity of 97.01%, specificity of 98.15%, accuracy of 97.31%, and F-measure of 97.73% compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Shankar, K.; Perumal, Eswaran; Díaz, Vicente García; Tiwari, Prayag; Gupta, Deepak; Saudagar, Abdul Khader Jilani; Muhammad, Khan",Appl Soft Comput,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494621008000; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621008000?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2021.107878; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512217/,242

642839,Patients with arterial hypertension and COVID-19 are at higher risk of ICU admission,2020-04-27,"Filtering facepiece particle (FFP) masks are important items of personal protective equipment in fighting COVID-19 pandemic. They shall protect the wearer of the mask from particles, droplets and aerosols, but can also prevent the spread of aerosol-transmitted viruses if the wearer becomes infected. Most often, FFP respirators consist of multiple layers of non-woven fabric made from polypropylene. Worldwide, FFP respirators are subject to various regulatory standards that specify physical properties and performance characteristics. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health authorities have temporarily repealed standards for respirators. We report on 46 patients that presented with rhinitis-like symptoms strongly associated to the use of FFP masks. Some of them were obliged to use FFP masks in their work environment. Nasal endoscopy showed edemata of the nasal mucosa that significantly decreased after a period of non-use of FFP masks. Subjectively reported symptom levels decreased after cessation of FFP use for 3 or more days. The presence of polypropylene fibres isolated from nasal rinsing solution was significantly associated with the use of FFP masks in our patients. Material safety and performance deregulation of FFP masks can pose a health risk. Thus, especially healthcare professionals and other individuals with occupational need for FFP masks should be aware of possible hazards that come with COVID-19 pandemic protection measures.","Klimek, Ludger; Huppertz, Tilman; Alali, Ali; Spielhaupter, Magdalena; Hörmann, Karl; Matthias, Christoph; Hagemann, Jan",World Allergy Organ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042359/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.waojou.2020.100474; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S193945512030377X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193945512030377X?v=s5,242

COVID-19 severity ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe multi-organ disease. Although the inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, the exact nature of dysregulation in signaling pathways has not yet been elucidated underscoring the need for further molecular characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Here, we characterize the host response directly at the point of viral entry through analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs. Multiplexed high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of confirmed COVID-19 cases and negative controls identified 7,582 proteins and revealed significant upregulation of interferon-mediated antiviral signaling in addition to multiple other proteins that are not encoded by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) or well-characterized during viral infections. Downregulation of several proteasomal subunits, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and components of protein synthesis machinery was significant upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted proteomics to measure abundance levels of MX1, ISG15, Stat1, RIG-I and CXCL10, detected proteomic signatures of interferon-mediated anti-viral signaling that differentiated COVID-19 positive from negative cases. Phosphoproteomic analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of several proteins with known antiviral properties as well as several proteins involved in ciliary function (CEP131 and CFAP57) that have not previously been implicated in the context of coronavirus infections. Additionally, decreased phosphorylation levels of AKT and PKC, which have been shown to play varying roles in different viral infections, were observed in infected individuals relative to controls. These data provide novel insights that add depth to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper airway and establish a proteomic signature for this viral infection.","Vanderboom, Patrick M.; Mun, Dong-Gi; Madugundu, Anil K.; Mangalaparthi, Kiran K.; Saraswat, Mayank; Garapati, Kishore; Chakraborty, Rana; Ebihara, Hideki; Sun, Jie; Pandey, Akhilesh",Mol Cell Proteomics,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1535947621001067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400346/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2021.100134; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947621001067?v=s5,242

Material and Methods A prospective study of patient satisfaction with telemedicine consultation was carried out in the ENT department of a university hospital center where telemedicine consultations were set up to replace scheduled out-patient consultations. Patients were divided into two groups according to overall satisfaction, in order to identify predictive factors. The significance threshold was set at p<0.005. The main endpoint was patient satisfaction after an ENT telemedicine consultation during global lockdown. The secondary endpoint comprised predictive factors for overall satisfaction. Results One hundred of the 125 patients with telemedicine consultation over a 7-day inclusion period completed the questionnaire. Overall satisfaction was 87%. There were no clinically relevant predictive factors significantly associated with satisfaction. Sound and video quality was satisfactory for 76% and 61% of patients respectively, without significant impact on overall satisfaction (respectively: OR = 3.40, p-value = 0.049; and OR = 3.79, p-value = 0.049). Lack of physical examination did not significantly correlate with reduced overall satisfaction (OR = 0.30, p-value = 0.027). Conclusion Telemedicine consultation did not allow complete medical care but, in a difficult time like the global pandemic, was well accepted by patients. It is a simple way to maintain continuity of care while reducing contamination risk by avoiding direct contact between patients and healthcare professionals.","Fieux, M.; Duret, S.; Bawazeer, N.; Denoix, L.; Zaouche, S.; Tringali, S.",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.06.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32624390/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879729620301538; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729620301538?v=s5,242

Many drugs benefit from encapsulation, which protects them from harsh conditions and allows targeted delivery and controlled release. Although many encapsulation methods are inexpensive, such as the formulation of tablets for oral delivery, others require complex procedures that add significantly to production costs and require low-temperature transport and storage, making them inaccessible in developing countries. In this review we consider the benefits of encapsulation technologies based on plants. Plant-derived biopolymers such as starch and the maize storage protein zein are already used as protective coatings, but plant cells used as production host provide natural in vivo bioencapsulation that survives passage through the stomach and releases drugs in the intestine, due to the presence of microbes that can digest the cell wall. Proteins can also be encapsulated in subcellular compartments such as protein bodies, which ensure stability and activity while often conferring additional immunomodulatory effects. Finally, we consider the incorporation of drugs and vaccines into plant-derived nanoparticles assembled from the components of viruses. These are extremely versatile, allowing the display of epitopes and targeting peptides as well as carrying cargoes of drugs and imaging molecules.","Schwestka, Jennifer; Stoger, Eva",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33920425/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040369,242

We investigated DSs phenomenon in 2020 through (1) exploration of Google searches worldwide and in Poland (with Google Trends (GT) tool), and (2) analyses of results of PLifeCOVID-19 Online Studies conducted during the first and second wave of the pandemic. The conducted GT analysis and cross-sectional studies revealed that during the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, the interest in immune-related compounds and foods like vitamins C and D, zinc, omega-3, garlic, ginger, or turmeric, as well as their consumption increased. Improving immunity was the main reason behind the supplementation and changes in consumption of pro-healthy foods. GT analysis has shown these interests were positively correlated with the interest in COVID-19, but adversely with cumulative cases or deaths. Respondents tended to start supplementation during the first COVID-19 wave rather than the second one. Except for the role of vitamins D and C, zinc, and selenium in patients with deficiencies of those nutrients, there are no clear and convincing studies that support the role of DSs use in COVID-19 prevention and treatment in healthy, well-nourished individuals. Moreover, as the risk of elevated intake of some nutrients due to the popularity of DSs exists, effective education of consumers in rationale use of DSs and health-protecting behaviors against COVID-19 should be developed.","Hamulka, Jadwiga; Jeruszka-Bielak, Marta; Górnicka, Magdalena; Drywień, Małgorzata E.; Zielinska-Pukos, Monika A.",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33375422/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13010054,242

We identified human H522 lung adenocarcinoma cells as naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection despite complete absence of ACE2. Infection of H522 cells required the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, though in contrast to ACE2-dependent models, spike alone was not sufficient for H522 infection. Temporally resolved transcriptomic and proteomic profiling revealed alterations in cell cycle and the antiviral host cell response, including MDA5-dependent activation of type-I interferon signaling. Focused chemical screens point to important roles for clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal cathepsins in SARS-CoV-2 infection of H522 cells. These findings imply the utilization of an alternative SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor which may impact tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and consequently human disease pathogenesis.","Puray-Chavez, Maritza; LaPak, Kyle M.; Schrank, Travis P.; Elliott, Jennifer L.; Bhatt, Dhaval P.; Agajanian, Megan J.; Jasuja, Ria; Lawson, Dana Q.; Davis, Keanu; Rothlauf, Paul W.; Jo, Heejoon; Lee, Nakyung; Tenneti, Kasyap; Eschbach, Jenna E.; Mugisha, Christian Shema; Vuong, Hung R.; Bailey, Adam L.; Hayes, D.

Seasonal influenza also occasionally results in neurologic complications. Rarely, viruses that have spread from wild birds to domestic poultry can infect humans; such “avian influenza” can range in severity from mild conjunctivitis through the rapidly lethal disease seen in persons infected with the H5N1 virus that first emerged in Hong Kong in 1997.

To evaluate the possible cause, incidence and levels of anxiety and depression in the relatives of the patients in the ICU in accordance with the patients’ SARS‐CoV‐2 PCR result. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study was prospectively conducted on relatives of patients admitted to tertiary intensive care units during COVID‐19 pandemic. Sociodemographic characteristics of the patients and their relatives were recorded. “The Turkish version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale” survey was applied twice to the relatives of 120 patients to determine the symptoms of anxiety and depression in accordance with the PCR results of the patients (PCR positive n=60, PCR negative n=60). RESULTS: The ratios above cut‐off values for anxiety and depression among relatives of the patients were 45.8% and 67.5% for the first test and 46.7% and 62.5% for the second test respectively. The anxiety and depression in the relatives of PCR positive patients was more frequent than the PCR negative (p< 0.001 for HADS‐A and p=0.034 for HADS‐D). The prevalence of anxiety and depression was significantly higher in female participants (p=0.046 for HADS‐A and p=0.009 for HADS‐A). There was no significant correlation between HADS and age of the patient or education of the participants. The fact that the patients were hospitalized in the ICU during the pandemic was an independent risk factor for anxiety (AUC = 0.746) while restriction of patient visiting in the ICU was found to be an independent risk factor for depression (AUC= 0.703). CONCLUSION: While patient with positive PCR and participant with female gender is responsible for both anxiety and depression, hospitalization in the ICU due to COVID‐19 is an independent risk factor for anxiety and restriction of patient visiting in the ICU is an independent risk factor for depression.","Kosovali, Behiye Deniz; Mutlu, Nevzat Mehmet; Gonen, Canan Cam; Peker, Tulay Tuncer; Yavuz, Asiye; Soyal, Ozlem Balkiz; Cakır, Esra; Akan, Belgin; Gokcinar, Derya; Erdem, Deniz; Turan, Isıl Ozkocak",Int J Clin Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33960085/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14328,242

The aim of this study was to evaluate the attack rate of HCP by the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus during the 2009 pandemic influenza season in Korea. HCP infected with H1N1 virus were asked to fill out a questionnaire, which included job type, method of diagnosis, facility type, history of contact with patients infected by H1N1 virus, vaccination status, and use of personal protective equipment. A total of 328 HCP (female 68.6%, 225/328) were infected with H1N1 virus at the nine study centers. The highest attack rate was in physicians, followed by nurses and nurses’ aides. Transmission occurred primarily after contact with outpatients (27.8%), followed by contact with inpatients (21.6%). Most (77.3%) of the infected HCP never used an N95 mask during contact with patients. Surgical masks were always used by 29.4% of the subjects and usually or intermittent used by 46.9%. The peak incidence of the H1N1 infection among HCP preceded that among the general population. Among HCPs, physicians, nurses, and nurses’ aides were at the greatest risk of H1N1 infection. HCP should be more vigilant and protect themselves with appropriate personal protective equipment during the influenza season.","Yeom, J.

Food fortification is a cost-effective strategy with demonstrated health, economic and social benefits. Despite ongoing debates globally and in some countries regarding the performance and safety of food fortification, the practice offers significant benefits across each of the main vehicles for food fortification (large-scale food fortification, biofortification and point-of-use or home fortification) ranging from reducing the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and economic benefits to societies and economies. Using Sight and Life’s global and national experiences in implementing food fortification efforts, we demonstrate how different programs in LMICs have successfully addressed challenges with food fortification and in doing so, find that these efforts are most successful when partnerships are formed that include the public and private sector as well as other parties that can provide support in key areas such as advocacy, management, capacity building, implementation and regulatory monitoring.","Olson, Rebecca; Gavin-Smith, Breda; Ferraboschi, Chiara; Kraemer, Klaus",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13041118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805305/,242

Current microbiological diagnostic methods are based on culture and phenotypic identification of isolated microorganisms, which can be obtained in about 24-48 h. Given that the microbiological identification is of major importance for patient management, new diagnostic methods are needed in order to detect and identify microorganisms in a timely and accurate manner. Over the last few years, several molecular techniques based on the amplification of microbial nucleic acids have been developed with the aim of reducing the time needed for the identification of the microorganisms involved in different infectious processes. On the other hand, mass spectrometry has emerged as a rapid and consistent alternative to conventional methods for microorganism identification. This review describes the most widely used mass spectrometry technologies —matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) and electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF)—, both for protein and nucleic acid analysis, as well as the commercial platforms available.

While attaching a HEPA filter to the endotracheal tube will protect the anesthesia machine and the gas sampling line from contamination, this contributionto the dead space makes ventilation of these small patients challenging. Direct filtration of the gas sampling line eliminates this problem;however, appropriate filters are not readily available. AIMS: Identify a small filter capable of filtering outparticles of a size similar to the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus for the gas sampling line. METHODS: We used fluorescence microspheres suspended in a solution for a challenge test to determine the filtration efficiency of various filters. The microspheres varied in diameter (0.02 µm, 0.042 µm, 0.109 µm and 0.989 µm). A fluorescence plate reader was used to evaluate the degree of fluorescence intensity in the flow‐through from various filters and referenced to the fluorescence intensity of the input. RESULTS: AHEPA filter,as recommended as an anti‐viral filter, effectively filtered all the particles tested. The B. Braun PERIFIX Flat Epidural Filter was the second most effective filter, filtering particleslarger than 0.042 µm.Other filters tested did not filter fluorescence microspheres equivalent in size to a single coronavirus particle (0.07 µm). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the Flat Epidural Filter for use as an anesthesia machine gas filter, our simple challenge test suggests that it could be used to effectively filter the anesthesia gas sampling line.","Brustowicz, Robert M.; Yuki, Koichi",Paediatr Anaesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32748414/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.13990,242

We evaluated whether TAT2 fulfills the recommended 60-minute criteria. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was observed for all comparisons (P <.001), with TAT1 prominently contributing to TAT3 prolongation (from 48 minutes to 108 minutes) and exceeding the recommended 60-minute criteria. The TAT2 was extended from 33 minutes to 49 minutes. CONCLUSION: An ED reorganization compromised the usual laboratory services for patients in the ED, with manual specimen delivery being the main cause for TAT prolongation.","Lapić, Ivana; Komljenović, Sven; Knežević, Josip; Rogić, Dunja",Lab Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32929507/; https://doi.org/10.1093/labmed/lmaa081,242

Pacientes Y Métodos: Realizamos un análisis retrospectivo multicéntrico de las admisiones en los servicios de urgencias de tres departamentos de urología de gran volumen (uno directamente implicado en el tratamiento de los pacientes de COVID-19 y dos no implicados) en Roma (Italia) entre marzo y abril de 2020 y en el mismo período de 2019. Se realizó un análisis estadístico del número de admisiones por urolitiasis, la tasa de complicaciones, hospitalización y el tipo de tratamiento recibido. Resultados: 304 pacientes fueron incluidos en el análisis. Se observó una reducción significativa en el número global de pacientes ingresados en urgencias por urolitiasis entre 2019 y 2020 (48,8%). Además, con respecto a la elección del tratamiento de los pacientes hospitalizados, se informó un aumento estadísticamente significativo de los procedimientos de extracción de cálculos en comparación con el drenaje urinario en 2020 (p: 0,015). Conclusiones: Durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en Roma ha habido una reducción significativa de los ingresos en urgencias por urolitiasis. Los pacientes ingresados en el SU tuvieron más complicaciones, necesitaron hospitalización con mas frecuencia y en cuanto al manejo clínico, se prefirió la extracción temprana de los cálculos en vez del drenaje urinario. Todos los urólogos deben ser conscientes de que en los próximos meses podrían enfrentarse a un mayor número de admisiones por urolitiasis y al manejo de casos más complicados. Abstract Introduction And Objectives: We aimed to evaluate how the corona virus disease of 2019 (COVID-19)* outbreak influenced emergency department (ED)** admissions for urolithiasis, hospitalizations and clinical management of the hospitalized Patients. Patients And Methods: We conducted a multicentric retrospective analysis of ED admissions in three high volume urology departments (one directly involved in COVID-19 patients management and two not involved) in Rome - Italy between March and April 2020 and in the same period of 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted on the number of admissions for urolithiasis, rate of complications, hospitalization and the type of treatment received. Results: 304 patients were included in the analysis. A significant reduction in the global number of patients admitted to ED for urolithiasis between 2019 and 2020 (48.8 %) was noted. Moreover, regarding the choice of treatment of hospitalized patients, a statistically significant increase of stone removal procedures versus urinary drainage was reported in 2020 (p: 0.015). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Rome there has been a significant reduction of emergency admissions for urolithiasis. Patients admitted to ED had more complications, more frequently need hospitalization and regarding clinical management early stone removal was preferred over urinary drainage only. All the urologists should be aware that in the next months they could face an increased number of admissions for urolithiasis and manage more complicated cases.","Antonucci, M.; Recupero, S M; Marzio, V.; De Dominicis, M.; Pinto, F.; Foschi, N.; Di Gianfrancesco, L.; Bassi, P.; Ragonese, M.",Actas Urol Esp,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0210480620301509?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32713658/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0210480620301509; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acuro.2020.06.005,242
649168,Hydroelectrolytic Disorder in COVID-19 patients: Evidence Supporting the Involvement of Subfornical Organ and Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus,2021-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Annually, about 2.7 million snakebite envenomings occur globally. Alongside antivenom, patients usually require additional care to treat envenoming symptoms and antivenom side effects. Efforts are underway to improve snakebite care, but evidence from the ground to inform this is scarce. This study, therefore, investigated the availability, affordability, and stock-outs of antivenom and commodities for supportive snakebite care in health facilities across Kenya. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study used an adaptation of the standardised World Health Organization (WHO)/Health Action International methodology. Data on commodity availability, prices and stock-outs were collected in July-August 2020 from public (n = 85), private (n = 36), and private not-for-profit (n = 12) facilities in Kenya. Stock-outs were measured retrospectively for a twelve-month period, enabling a comparison of a pre-COVID-19 period to stock-outs during COVID-19. Affordability was calculated using the wage of a lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and the impoverishment approach. Accessibility was assessed combining the WHO availability target (≥80%) and LPGW affordability (<1 day’s wage) measures. Overall availability of snakebite commodities was low (43.0%). Antivenom was available at 44.7% of public- and 19.4% of private facilities. Stock-outs of any snakebite commodity were common in the public- (18.6%) and private (11.7%) sectors, and had worsened during COVID-19 (10.6% versus 17.0% public sector, 8.4% versus 11.7% private sector). Affordability was not an issue in the public sector, while in the private sector the median cost of one vial of antivenom was 14.4 days’ wage for an LPGW. Five commodities in the public sector and two in the private sector were deemed accessible. CONCLUSIONS: Access to snakebite care is problematic in Kenya and seemed to have worsened during COVID-19. To improve access, efforts should focus on ensuring availability at both lower- and higher-level facilities, and improving the supply chain to reduce stock-outs. Including antivenom into Universal Health Coverage benefits packages would further facilitate accessibility.","Ooms, Gaby Isabelle; van Oirschot, Janneke; Okemo, Dorothy; Waldmann, Benjamin; Erulu, Eugene; Mantel-Teeuwisse, Aukje K; van den Ham, Hendrika A; Reed, Tim",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398889/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009702,242

Hygienic precautions have been recommended, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. However, some people in society have not considered and ignored these health issues. This study aims to identify the sociological perceptions of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. A qualitative study was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were purposefully selected from people in Isfahan who avoided paying attention to the COVID-19 warnings. The saturation point was reached in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12). RESULTS: The results show 2 themes and 4 sub-themes related to the sociological perception of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. The themes and sub-themes include: feelings of social anomie (disruption and social unrest, social distrust), unmet social relationship needs (intention to maintain social participation, Feeling of reduced social support). In order to tackle social perceptions contrary to health observance during the coronavirus pandemic, educational resources such as mass media, cyberspace and social programs on the necessity and importance of health observance need to be used. Policies should also be implemented in the social, cultural and legislative contexts to enhance the degree of individuals' social responsibility.

BNT162b2 is approved for the vaccination of adolescents over 16 years of age. Systemic adverse events were scarce though the pretested cohort of this age group was relatively small. The aim of the current study is to raise awareness for potential adverse reactions. METHODS: This is a case series of patients diagnosed with perimyocarditis following vaccination. Patients were compiled from 3 pediatric medical centers in Israel through a network of pediatricians and data regarding those cases was collected. In addition, incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was compared with previous years. RESULTS: All patients were males 16–18 years old, of Jewish descent, who presented with chest pain that began 1–3 days following vaccination (mean, 2.1 days). In 6 of the 7 patients, symptoms began following the 2nd dose and in 1 patient following the 1st dose. All cases were mild and none required cardiovascular or respiratory support. The incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination period was elevated in comparison to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: This case series describes a time association between coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine and perimyocarditis in adolescents. All cases were mild, although only long-term follow-up can reveal the true impact of this cardiac injury. While it seems that the incidence of perimyocarditis during the vaccination campaign period is increased, a more comprehensive data collection on a wider scale should be done. We hope this report will serve as a reminder to report events and allow for analysis of potential adverse reactions.","Snapiri, Ori; Rosenberg Danziger, Chen; Shirman, Nina; Weissbach, Avichai; Lowenthal, Alexander; Ayalon, Itay; Adam, Dganit; Yarden-Bilavsky, Havatzelet; Bilavsky, Efraim",Pediatr Infect Dis J,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000003235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34077949/,242

With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development. Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non‐existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited. While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non‐replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility.","Afrough, B.; Dowall, S.; Hewson, R.",Clin Exp Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993690/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13295,242

Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.","Olney, Andrew M.; Smith, Jesse; Sen, Saunak; Thomas, Fridtjof; Unwin, H.

Mexico is the country with the fourth highest fatality rate from SARS-Cov-2, with high mortality in younger adults. OBJECTIVES: To describe and characterize the association of NCDs with the case-fatality rate (CFR) adjusted by age and sex in Mexican adults with a positive diagnosis for SARS-Cov-2. METHODS: We studied Mexican adults aged ≥20 years who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 during the period from 28 February to 31 July 2020. The CFR was calculated and associations with history of NCDs (number of diseases and combinations), severity indicators and type of institution that treated the patient were explored. The relative risk (RR) of death was estimated using Poisson models and CFR was adjusted using logistic models. RESULTS: We analysed 406 966 SARS-Cov-2-positive adults. The CFR was 11.2% (13.7% in men and 8.4% in women). The CFR was positively associated with age and number of NCDs (p trend <0.001). The number of NCDs increased the risk of death in younger adults when they presented three or more NCDs compared with those who did not have any NCDs [RR, 46.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 28.2, 76.9 for women; RR, 16.5; 95% CI, 9.9, 27.3 for men]. Lastly, there was great heterogeneity in the CFR by institution, from 4.6% in private institutions to 18.9% in public institutions. CONCLUSION: In younger adults, higher CFRs were associated with the total number of NCDs and some combinations of type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease.","Monterrubio-Flores, Eric; Ramírez-Villalobos, María D; Espinosa-Montero, Juan; Hernandez, Bernardo; Barquera, Simón; Villalobos-Daniel, Victor E; Campos-Nonato, Ismael",Int J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33585901/,242

In the present study, we wanted to determine whether TiLV agglutinated avian and piscine erythrocytes, and whether its replication was inhibited by lysosomotropic agents, such as ammonium chloride (NH(4)Cl), as seen for orthomyxoviruses. Our findings showed that influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8 (PR8) was able to hemagglutinate turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) red blood cells (RBCs), while infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) only agglutinated Atlantic salmon, but not turkey or tilapia, RBCs. In contrast to PR8 and ISAV, TiLV did not agglutinate turkey, Atlantic salmon, or tilapia RBCs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that 30 mM NH(4)Cl, a basic lysosomotropic agent, neither inhibited nor enhanced TiLV replication in E-11 cells. There was no difference in viral quantities in the infected cells with or without NH(4)Cl treatment during virus adsorption or at 1, 2, and 3 h post-infection. Given that hemagglutinin proteins that bind RBCs also serve as ligands that bind host cells during virus entry leading to endocytosis in orthomyxoviruses, the data presented here suggest that TiLV may use mechanisms that are different from orthomyxoviruses for entry and replication in host cells. Therefore, future studies should seek to elucidate the mechanisms used by TiLV for entry into host cells and to determine its mode of replication in infected cells.","Chengula, Augustino Alfred; Mutoloki, Stephen; Evensen, Øystein; Munang’andu, Hetron Mweemba",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31842425/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11121152,242
653616,Implications of ABO blood group in hypertensive patients with covid-19,2020-08-12,"Innate immune responses play a critical role in the control of early virus replication and dissemination. It remains unknown, however, how SARS-CoV evades respiratory innate immunity to establish a systemic infection. Here, we show in Chinese macaques that SARS-CoV traversed the mucosa through the respiratory tract within 2 days, resulting in extensive mucosal infiltration by T cells, MAC387(+) and CD163(+) monocytes/macrophages followed by limited viral replication in the lung but persistent viral shedding into the upper airway. Mucosal monocytes/macrophages sequestered virions in intracellular vesicles together with infected Langerhans cells (LCs) and migrated into the tonsils and/or draining lymph nodes (LNs) within 2 days. In lymphoid tissues, viral RNA and proteins were detected in infected monocytes upon differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs) within 3 days. Systemic viral dissemination was observed within 7 days. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the spatiotemporal interactions of SARS-CoV, monocytes/macrophages and the dendritic cell network in mucosal tissues and highlights the fact that while these innate cells contribute to viral clearance, they probably also serve as shelters and vehicles to provide a mechanism for the virus to escape host mucosal innate immunity and disseminate systemically.","Liu, Li; Wei, Qiang; Nishiura, Kenji; Peng, Jie; Wang, Haibo; Midkiff, Cecily; Alvarez, Xavier; Qin, Chuan; Lackner, Andrew; Chen, Zhiwei",Mucosal Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1038/mi.2015.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26647718/,242

Whether circulating cell-free MT-DNA quantitation could be used to predict the risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes remains undetermined. METHODS: We measured circulating MT-DNA levels in prospectively collected, cell-free plasma samples from 97 subjects with COVID-19 at hospital presentation. Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19. RESULTS: Circulating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy. Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy. CONCLUSION: These results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.

Forecasting demand for such a mega-event has received only limited attention in the literature. Unlike most studies forecasting international tourism demand, forecasting Expo demand involves using both quantitative forecasting models and qualitative technique because of data limitations. Combining quantitative techniques with willingness-to-visit (WTV) surveys predicts the Expo demand at 8.9 million visitors. In comparison using the Delphi method, experts predict Expo demand at 6.8 million visitors. For this study, the Delphi method provides more conservative estimates than estimates from combining quantitative techniques with WTV.

Risk factors associated with this disease are age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities, the most common being hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. The aim of this meta-analysis was to calculate the prevalence and geographical distribution of comorbidities in all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), and the mortality rate of COVID-19. We selected studies based upon epidemiological and clinical descriptions of the patients and mortality from the disease to determine the pooled prevalence of comorbidities in all patients and in mortality cases due to COVID-19. The pooled prevalence was estimated using the random effects model, and odds ratios were used to measure the probability of death for a patient with a comorbidity. The total prevalence of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 was 42% (95% CI: 25-60), 61% (95% CI: 42-80) in those admitted to the ICU, and 77% (95% CI: 68-86) among death cases; males were the most affected. Hypertension was the most prevalent comorbidity in all three groups studied, accounting for 32%, 26%, and 35%, respectively. The odds ratio of death for a patient with a comorbidity compared to one with no comorbidity was 2.4 (P < 0.0001). The higher the prevalence of comorbidities the higher the odds that the COVID-19 patient will need intensive care or will die, especially if the pre-existing disease is hypertension, heart disease, or diabetes.","Espinosa, Omar Ariel; Zanetti, Andernice dos Santos; Antunes, Ednardo Fornanciari; Longhi, Fabiana Gulin; de Matos, Tatiane Amorim; Battaglini, Paula Franciene",Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32578683/; https://doi.org/10.1590/s1678-9946202062043,242

In severe novel coronavirus pneumonia cases, the number of platelets, their dynamic changes during the treatment, platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were a concern. We sought to describe the platelet feature of these cases. Single‐center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID)‐19 in Huizhou municipal central hospital from January 2020 to February 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, blood routine results, other laboratory results, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of severe patients and nonsevere patients were compared. Univariate analysis showed that: age, platelet peaks, and PLR at peak platelet were the influencing factors in severe patients, multivariate analysis showed that the PLR value at peak platelet during treatment was an independent influencing factor in severe patients. The average hospitalization day of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was longer than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The average age of patients with platelet peaks during treatment was older than those without platelet peaks (P < .05). The patients with significantly elevated platelets during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. And the higher PLR of patients during treatment had longer average hospitalization days. Single‐center case series of the 30 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID‐19 in Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital, presumed that the number of platelets and their dynamic changes during the treatment may have a suggestion on the severity and prognosis of the disease. The patient with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days may be related to the cytokine storm. The PLR of patients means the degree of cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID‐19.","Qu, Rong; Ling, Yun; Zhang, Yi‐hui‐zhi; Wei, Li‐ya; Chen, Xiao; Li, Xu‐mian; Liu, Xuan‐yong; Liu, Han‐mian; Guo, Zhi; Ren, Hua; Wang, Qiang",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181903/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25767,242

However, strong similarities in their contemporary approaches can be detected. Migration sits at the very top of the national political agendas and both have undertaken successive, major policy reforms over the past decade. Both have governments publicly committed to policies to attract ‘highly skilled’ migrants, with a restrictive approach towards ‘unskilled’ migrants. This article draws out the similarities and differences of migration law and policy in Japan and the UK via their respective legislative structures and policy trajectories on highly skilled migration. The article argues that Japan and the UK promote a market-driven model which enables highly skilled migration to be ‘sold’ to publics believed to be hostile to increased migration. Yet, the rapid changes in policy and revising of applicable rules often prevents the successful recruitment of highly skilled migrants to both countries.","Wakisaka, Daisuke; Cardwell, Paul James",Comp Migr Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603970/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-021-00251-3,242

We report 2 cases. The diagnosis of non‐cardiogenic pulmonary edema due to pulmonary capillary leak syndrome SARS‐CoV‐2 virus infection was obtained by a medical committee of 6 physicians. The diagnosis of COVID‐19 infection is confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) test. Moreover, in this specific endemic situation, and according to the British Society of Thoracic Imaging expert reference group update, we took account of chest CT‐Scan results in the early detection of COVID‐19 pneumonia. Our 2 patients with a confirmed influenza SARS‐CoV‐2virus infection had respiratory distress with lung crackles on auscultation of one or both lungs and with alveolar pulmonary edema on the chest CT‐Scan. The cardiogenic nature of pulmonary edema was ruled out in both cases by a transthoracic echocardiography showing normal systolic and diastolic functions. Our patients were treated by oxygen via face mask in one case and mechanical ventilation as supportive treatment in the other patient. Hydroxychloroquine (600mg/day), Azithromycine, steroids (dexamethasone 20mg/day), vitamin C (3g/day), Zinc, diuretics and Enoxaparine were equally used for the two patients. Evolution was marked by a good outcome in both of them. In summary, acute respiratory failure is a rare but major complication of COVID‐19 virus infection. It is due to pulmonary capillary leak syndrome. Treatment is based on a good oxygenation, intravenous corticosteroids, diuretics, Azithromycine, vitamin C, and other symptomatic treatments.

655993,The Application Of Plasmapheresis For Covid‐19 Patients,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic, small intestinal inflammatory disease mediated by dietary gluten and related prolamins. The only current therapeutic option is maintenance of a strict life-long gluten-free diet, which implies substantial burden for CD patients. Different treatment regimes might be feasible, including masking of toxic celiac peptides with blocking antibodies or fragments thereof. The objective of this study was therefore to select and produce a recombinant avian single-chain fragment variable (scFv) directed against peptic-tryptic digested gliadin (PT-Gliadin) and related celiac toxic entities. RESULTS: Gluten-free raised chicken of same age were immunized with PT-Gliadin. Chicken splenic lymphocytes, selected with antigen-coated magnetic beads, served as RNA source for the generation of cDNA. Chicken V(H) and V(L) genes were amplified from the cDNA by PCR to generate full-length scFv constructs consisting of V(H) and V(L) fragments joined by a linker sequence. ScFv constructs were ligated in a prokaryotic expression vector, which provides a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. ScFvs from several bacterial clones were expressed in soluble form and crude cell lysates screened for binding to PT-Gliadin by ELISA. We identified an enriched scFv motif, which showed reactivity to PT-Gliadin. One selected scFv candidate was expressed and purified to homogeneity. Polyclonal anti-PT-Gliadin IgY, purified from egg yolk of immunized chicken, served as control. ScFv binds in a dose-dependent manner to PT-Gliadin, comparable to IgY. Furthermore, IgY competitively displaces scFv from PT-Gliadin and natural wheat flour digest, indicating a common epitope of scFv and IgY. ScFv was tested for reactivity to different gastric digested dietary grain flours. ScFv detects common and khorasan wheat comparably with binding affinities in the high nanomolar range, while rye is detected to a lesser extent. Notably, barley and cereals which are part of the gluten-free diet, like corn and rice, are not detected by scFv. Similarly, the pseudo-grain amaranth, used as gluten-free alternative, is not targeted by scFv. This data indicate that scFv specifically recognizes toxic cereal peptides relevant in CD. CONCLUSION: ScFv can be of benefit for future CD treatment regimes.","Stadlmann, Valerie; Harant, Hanna; Korschineck, Irina; Hermann, Marcela; Forster, Florian; Missbichler, Albert",BMC Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12896-015-0223-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26625857/,242

IBV, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens, resembles the recently described severe acute respiratory syndrome virus in pathogenesis and genome organization. While previous studies demonstrated that effector and memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes are critical in controlling acute IBV infection and disease in chickens, here chicken anti-IBV antibody (IgG) secreting cells (ASC) in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and spleens collected following IBV Gray infection were evaluated using an ELISPOT assay. The ASC in peripheral blood and spleens can be detected from 3 to 7 days post-infection (p.i.), which is 3–7 days earlier than anti-IBV IgG detected in the serum. The ASC frequency reached a maximum at 7–10 days p.i., and decreased more than 90% in the spleen and 70% in PBMC by 14 days p.i. The ASC levels in the PBMC then decreased gradually to 0.5 ASC/10(6) over the next 8 weeks. The higher concentration of about 20 ASC/10(6) cells in spleens may, at least partially, account for the presence of antibody in the serum although bone marrow ASC were not determined. In vitro stimulation of PBMC and splenocytes with IBV antigen demonstrated that memory B cells can be activated to secrete antibody by 3 weeks p.i.

657849,Letter to the editor in response to COVID-19 presenting as acute pancreatitis,2020-07-01,"The membrane proteins of viruses play critical roles in the virus life cycle and are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Virus-like particles (VLP) present the possibility to study the biochemical and biophysical properties of viral membrane proteins in their native environment. Specifically, the VLP constructs contain the entire protein sequence and are comprised of native membrane components including lipids, cholesterol, carbohydrates and cellular proteins. In this study we prepare VLP containing full-length hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) from influenza and characterize their interactions with small molecule inhibitors. Using HA-VLP, we first show that VLP samples prepared using the standard sucrose gradient purification scheme contain significant amounts of serum proteins, which exhibit high potential for non-specific interactions, thereby complicating NMR studies of ligand-target interactions. We then show that the serum contaminants may be largely removed with the addition of a gel filtration chromatography step. Next, using HA-VLP we demonstrate that WaterLOGSY NMR is significantly more sensitive than Saturation Transfer Difference (STD) NMR for the study of ligand interactions with membrane bound targets. In addition, we compare the ligand orientation to HA embedded in VLP with that of recombinant HA by STD NMR. In a subsequent step, using NA-VLP we characterize the kinetic and binding properties of substrate analogs and inhibitors of NA, including study of the H274Y-NA mutant, which leads to wide spread resistance to current influenza antivirals. In summary, our work suggests that VLP have high potential to become standard tools in biochemical and biophysical studies of viral membrane proteins, particularly when VLP are highly purified and combined with control VLP containing native membrane proteins.","Antanasijevic, Aleksandar; Kingsley, Carolyn; Basu, Arnab; Bowlin, Terry L.; Rong, Lijun; Caffrey, Michael",J Biomol NMR,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10858-016-0025-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921030/,242
657985,Complement inhibition in severe COVID-19 – Blocking C5a seems to be key,2021-04-24,"Weather and climate play a significant role in infectious disease transmission, through changes to transmission dynamics, host susceptibility and virus survival in the environment. Exploring the association of weather variables and COVID-19 transmission is vital in understanding the potential for seasonality and future outbreaks and developing early warning systems. Previous research examined the effects of weather on COVID-19, but the findings appeared inconsistent. This review aims to summarize the currently available literature on the association between weather and COVID-19 incidence and provide possible suggestions for developing weather-based early warning system for COVID-19 transmission. Studies eligible for inclusion used ecological methods to evaluate associations between weather (i.e., temperature, humidity, wind speed and rainfall) and COVID-19 transmission. The review showed that temperature was reported as significant in the greatest number of studies, with COVID-19 incidence increasing as temperature decreased and the highest incidence reported in the temperature range of 0–17 °C. Humidity was also significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence, though the reported results were mixed, with studies reporting positive and negative correlation. A significant interaction between humidity and temperature was also reported. Wind speed and rainfall results were not consistent across studies. Weather variables including temperature and humidity can contribute to increased transmission of COVID-19, particularly in winter conditions through increased host susceptibility and viability of the virus. While there is less indication of an association with wind speed and rainfall, these may contribute to behavioral changes that decrease exposure and risk of infection. Understanding the implications of associations with weather variables and seasonal variations for monitoring and control of future outbreaks is essential for early warning systems.","McClymont, Hannah; Hu, Wenbiao",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020396; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419216/,242

Infection of people with RVFV can occur through mosquito bite or mucosal exposure during butchering or milking of infected livestock. Disease typically presents as a self-limiting fever; however, in rare cases, hepatitis, encephalitis and ocular disease may occur. Recent studies have illuminated the neuropathogenic mechanisms of RVFV in a rat aerosol infection model. Neurological disease in rats is characterized by breakdown of the blood–brain barrier late in infection, infiltration of leukocytes to the central nervous system (CNS) and massive viral replication in the brain. However, the route of RVFV entry into the CNS after inhalational exposure remains unknown. Here, we visualized the entire nasal olfactory route from snout to brain after RVFV infection using RNA in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found widespread RVFV-infected cells within the olfactory epithelium, across the cribriform plate, and in the glomerular region of the olfactory bulb within 2 days of infection. These results indicate that the olfactory tract is a major route of infection of the brain after inhalational exposure. A better understanding of potential neuroinvasion pathways can support the design of more effective therapeutic regiments for the treatment of neurological disease caused by RVFV.","Boyles, Devin A.; Schwarz, Madeline M.; Albe, Joseph R.; McMillen, Cynthia M.; O'Malley, Katherine J.; Reed, Douglas S.; Hartman, Amy L.",J Gen Virol,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.001522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231535/,242

METHODS: We compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in school-age children, teachers and the general working population in Luxembourg during two epidemic waves: a spring wave from March–April 2020 corresponding to general lockdown with schools being closed and May–July 2020 corresponding to schools being open. We assessed the number of secondary transmissions occurring in schools between May and July 2020 using routine contact tracing data. RESULTS: During the first wave in March–April 2020 when schools were closed, the incidence in pupils peaked at 28 per 100,000, while during the second wave in May–July 2020 when schools were open, incidence peaked 100 per 100,000. While incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in adults than in children during the first spring wave, no significant difference was observed during the second wave in early summer. Between May and July 2020, we identified a total of 390 and 34 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 90,150 school-age children and 11,667 teachers, respectively. We further estimate that 179 primary cases caused 49 secondary cases in schools. While some small clusters of mainly student-to-student transmission within the same class were identified, we did not observe any large outbreaks with multiple generations of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within Luxembourg schools was limited during an early summer epidemic wave in 2020. Precautionary measures including physical distancing as well as easy access to testing, systematic contact tracing appears to have been successful in mitigating transmission within educational settings.

We simulated scenarios with particular relevance for anesthesiology, perioperative and critical care, including (1) cardiac arrest, (2) emergency airway management, (3) tele-instruction for remote guidance and supervision, and (4) transporting an intubated patient. Using a grounded theory approach, three authors (MHA, DLR, EHS) developed emergent themes. First alone and then together, we sought consensus in uncovering overarching themes and constructs from the debriefings. We thus performed an informal qualitative thematic analysis based in a critical realist epistemological position - the understanding that our findings, while real, are affected by situational variables and the observer's perspective.[1,2] We compared data from videos and triangulated the data by member checking. All participants and course instructors volunteered to participate in this educational project and contributed as co-authors to this manuscript. During debriefing, we applied crisis resource management concepts including situation awareness, prioritization of tasks, and clear communication practices, conducting the debriefing with emphasis on current TeamStepps 2.0 terminology and concepts. [3,4] In addition, we re-evaluated formerly familiar processes, as shortcomings of protocols, kits, and interdisciplinary cooperation became apparent. The data provide detailed observations on how immersive simulation and debriefing among peers mitigated the unfamiliarity of individual clinicians and the organization at large with the demands of an unprecedented healthcare crisis. We also observed and report on the anxiety caused by resource constraints, risk to clinicians in the face of limited personal equipment, and the overall uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. We began to summarize, interpret, critique, and discuss our data and debriefing observations in a rapid co-publication in the Journal of Clinical Anesthesia.

Here, we reported for the first time a case of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) that developed after the first dose of inactivated virus vaccine for COVID-19. The patient developed mild fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and cough after receiving the first dose of inactivated virus vaccine. Two months later, she experienced dizziness and unsteady walking. MRI scanning of the brain revealed lesions in area postrema and bilateral hypothalamus, typical for NMOSD. Serum antibodies for AQP4, ANA, SSA, SSB, Ro-52, and p-ANCA were positive. The patient was diagnosed as AQP4-positive NMOSD with coexisting systemic autoimmunity. After treatment with methylprednisolone (500 mg for 5 days), symptoms were greatly relieved. As NMOSD is seriously harmful and curative, it is important to be aware of the NMOSD symptoms after vaccination. Cautions should be given for those with preexisting systemic autoimmune abnormalities in vaccination for COVID-19.","Chen, Shuai; Fan, Xiao-Rui; He, Shuang; Zhang, Jie-Wen; Li, Shu-Jian",Neurol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189662/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-021-05427-4,242

From March to May 2020, 261 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated, including 41 SOT recipients. Of these, thirty-two were kidney recipients, 4 liver, 3 heart and 2 combined kidney-liver transplants. Median time from transplantation to COVID-19 diagnosis was 6 years. Thirteen SOT recipients (32%) required Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and 5 patients died (12%). Using a propensity score match analysis, we found no significant differences between SOT recipients and non-transplant patients. Older age (OR 1.142; 95% [CI 1.08–1.197]) higher levels of C-reactive protein (OR 3.068; 95% [CI 1.22–7.71]) and levels of serum creatinine on admission (OR 3.048 95% [CI 1.22–7.57]) were associated with higher mortality. The clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of SOT recipients appear to be similar to that observed in the non-transplant population. Older age, higher levels of C-reactive protein and serum creatinine were associated with higher mortality, whereas SOT was not associated with worse outcomes.","Linares, Laura; Cofan, Frederic; Diekmann, Fritz; Herrera, Sabina; Marcos, María Angeles; Castel, María Angeles; Farrero, Marta; Colmenero, Jordi; Ruiz, Pablo; Crespo, Gonzalo; Llopis, Jaume; Garcia-Vidal, Carolina; Soriano, Àlex; Moreno, Asunción; Bodro, Marta",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657157/,242

To develop financial security physicians need to save a portion of their income regularly to invest. The stock market is the best place to increase one's monetary worth over a long period. • Physicians need to develop financial security so that their patient decisions are free of inappropriate financial reward. • That requires becoming financially secure which requires regular savings and appropriate spending. • The best way to become financially secure is to invest in the stock market regularly over a long period of time. • Buying and holding is not ideal, but it is better than frequent buying and selling. • Stay out of debt. • Stay healthy and live long. Good health is better than gold.","Roberts, William C.",Am J Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000293432030601X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S000293432030601X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.06.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32682867/,242
660930,Helping Us Heal: telephone versus in-person marital communication and support counseling for spouse caregivers of wives with breast cancer,2021-08-13,"BACKGROUND: Emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers is critical to the quality of patient care, and effective function of health services. The corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic exerted unique physical and emotional demands on healthcare workers, however little is known about the emotional wellbeing of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in resource-restricted settings. This study investigated the prevalence of psychological distress, and sleep problems in healthcare workers in a COVID-19 referral hospital in Nigeria. METHODS: A total of 303 healthcare workers were interviewed with the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) to evaluate psychological distress, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to assess multidimensional aspects of sleep, including quality, latency, duration, habitual efficiency, disturbances, use of sleeping medications and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The participants were mostly males, 183(60.4%) and mean age was 38.8(SD = 8.9) years. Most of the participants were married (70.3%), had spent less than 10 years in service (72.9%), and had no medical comorbidity (92.1%). The prevalence of psychological distress was 23.4%, and six in every ten participants reported sleep problems. The largest proportion of participants reported difficulty in sleep latency (81.5%), duration (71.3%), and daytime dysfunction (69.6%), while approximately one third (32%) each reported using sleep medication, and had difficulty with sleep quality. Psychological distress was inter-related with poor sleep problems (p = 0.001; effect size = 0.2). CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of psychological distress and sleep problems during the COVID-19 pandemic were several folds the rates previously reported in similar contexts. Preventative psychosocial support services for healthcare workers are indicated. The creation of a culturally-sensitive interdisciplinary blueprint for locally-viable actions model are strongly suggested ahead of future emergency situations.","Olagunju, Andrew T.; Bioku, Ayodeji A.; Olagunju, Tinuke O.; Sarimiye, Foluke O.; Onwuameze, Obiora E.; Halbreich, Uriel",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2021.110292; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584621000518?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33662533/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0278584621000518,242

It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (OR = 1.62) and sleep disorder (OR = 1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (OR = 1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (OR = 1.44, OR = 1.83, OR = 2.61) or >5000 CNY (OR = 1.47, OR = 1.45, OR = 2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (OR = 1.45, OR = 1.71, OR = 1. 85, OR = 1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor’s degree and above) (OR = 1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder. Wuhan residents’ psychological status and sleep quality were relatively poorer than they were before the COVID-19 epidemic; however, the rate of passive coping to stress was relatively higher.","Fu, Wenning; Wang, Chao; Zou, Li; Guo, Yingying; Lu, Zuxun; Yan, Shijiao; Mao, Jing",Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00913-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647160/,242

An accurate estimate of this fraction is crucial for the assessment of the situation and the establishment of protective measures. In most current studies using epidemics models, the total number of infected is either approximated by the number of diagnosed individuals or is dependent on the model parameters and assumptions, which are often debated. We here study the relationship between the fraction of diagnosed infected out of all infected, and the fraction of infected with known contaminator out of all diagnosed infected. We show that those two are approximately the same in exponential models and across most models currently used in the study of epidemics, independently of the model parameters.

Authors from Thailand, China mainland, South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Malaysia present their analyses in three parts. The first part of the article describes the data-collection process and the sources of data. The second part of the article presents issues around policies of data sharing with the stakeholders. The third and final part of the article focuses on the extent of health-care data use for policy reform in these different economies. Even though these economies differ in their economic structure and population size, they share some similarities on issues related to health-care data. There are two main institutions that collect and manage the health-care data in these economies. In Thailand, China mainland, Taiwan, and Malaysia, the Ministry of Health is responsible through its various agencies for collecting and managing the health-care data. On the other hand, health insurance is the main institution that collects and stores health-care data in South Korea and Japan. In all economies, sharing of and access to data is an issue. The reasons for limited access to some data are privacy protection, fragmented health-care system, poor quality of routinely collected data, unclear policies and procedures to access the data, and control on the freedom on publication. The primary objective of collecting health-care data in these economies is to aid the policymakers and researchers in policy decision making as well as create an awareness on health-care issues for the general public. The usage of data in monitoring the performance of the heath system is still in the process of development. In conclusion, for the region under discussion, health-care data collection is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health and health insurance agencies. Data are collected from health-care providers mainly from the public sector. Routinely collected data are supplemented by national surveys. Accessibility to the data is a major issue in most of the economies under discussion. Accurate health-care data are required mainly to support policy making and evidence-based decisions.","Aljunid, Syed Mohamed; Srithamrongsawat, Samrit; Chen, Wen; Bae, Seung Jin; Pwu, Raoh-Fang; Ikeda, Shunya; Xu, Ling",Value Health,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301511035418; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2011.11.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265060/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301511035418,242

Although most of the time, the symptoms of the infection are flu like, a percentage of patients develop severe forms, along with severe complications. Many of them are known among front-line health workers, but the number of uncommon presentations and complications has increased. This case report aims to alert healthcare workers on less common forms of presentation, and to introduce this differential diagnosis in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, given the increasing occurrence of pneumothorax in patients who are not mechanical ventilated. Case presentation: A 57-year-old female patient came to the Emergency Department (ED) by ambulance, with acute respiratory failure. She had SpO(2) (peripheral O(2) saturation ) = 43% on room air at home, and 86% on admission in ED after oxygen delivery (on a reservoir mask). SARS-CoV-2 infection was suspected based on symptoms that started three days ago (fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigability). Blood was taken for lab tests, pharyngeal and nasal swabs for the reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) test, and native computed tomography (CT) was scheduled. The thoracic CT scan showed massive right pneumothorax, partially collapsed lung, multiple bilateral lung infiltrates with a ground glass aspect and the RT-PCR test came back positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the prompt diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax (thoracostomy was performed and the drain tube was placed), the patient died after a long hospitalization in the intensive care unit. Conclusion: Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP), as a complication in severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in female patients without risk factors is rare, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for increasing the survival chances of these patients.","Marza, Adina Maria; Petrica, Alina; Buleu, Florina Nicoleta; Mederle, Ovidiu Alexandru",Medicina (Kaunas),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498180/; https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina57020082,242

METHODS: This study is a comparative thematic content analysis of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care’s (MOHLTC) website and the websites of each of the 14 local health integration networks (LHINs) in 2009 and 2017. It provides a snapshot and evaluation of the amount and type of online content concerning LGBTQ+-specific health needs and determines how well the programs and services aligned with the Ministry’s stated priorities and population health/SDH philosophy. RESULTS: We found very little content that suggested a population health approach on the Ministry’s website. We also found very little LGBTQ+-specific content on the LHINs’ websites in both periods, with two notable exceptions in 2017. Our analysis revealed a persistent emphasis on HIV/AIDS risk containment in the LGBTQ + community over the two periods.

Up to now, there is scarce information regarding the clinical features and short-term outcomes of infected patients with cancer. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 14, 2020, to Mar 15, 2020, China. Data were retrieved including demographic and clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome data. Patients were classified into the discharged group and undischarged group by the 4-week outcomes from admission. Difference analysis and correlation analysis were performed between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were enrolled in the study, including 27 cancer survivors in routine follow-up. Breast cancer (18.9%) was the most frequent cancer type, and common symptoms included cough (54.1%), fever (48.6%), and fatigue (27%). Lymphocytopenia and hypoproteinemia were much frequent in patients who had received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery within the past month. However, the concentration of D-dimer (median: 3.75 vs 0.43, P =0.010) and fibrin degradation products (median: 23.60 vs 1.80, P =0.002) were evidently increased in this population compared with cancer survivors. At the end of follow-up, 83.8% of the enrolled patients were discharged. Among the discharged, women (48.6%) and cancer survivors (67.6%) showed better short-term outcomes. The elevated level of FDP was significantly higher in the undischarged group (median: 21.85 vs 2.00, P =0.049). The proportion of CD3-positive lymphocyte cells and CD4-positive lymphocytes was correlated with short-term outcomes. CONCLUSION: Peripheral lymphocyte subset (CD3-positive and CD4-positive) on admission as a novel biomarker had a potential association with early efficacy. Cancer survivors in routine follow-up would achieve better short-term outcomes.

662921,Association of Frailty with Adverse Outcomes in Patients with Suspected COVID-19 Infection,2021-06-02,"In the past, the utilization of the limb prosthesis has improved the daily life of amputees or patients with movement disorders. However, a leg-amputee has to take a series of training after wearing a limb prosthesis, and the training results determine whether a patient can use the limb prosthesis correctly in her/his daily life. Limb prosthesis vendors thus desire to offer the leg-amputee a complete and well-organized training process, but they often fail to do so owing to the factors such as the limited support of human resource and financial condition of the amputee. This work proposes a prosthesis training system that the amputees can borrow or buy from the limb prosthesis vendors and train themselves at home. Instant feedback messages provided by the prosthesis training system are used to correct their walking postures during the self-training process. An embedded chip is used as a core to establish a body area sensor network for the prosthesis training system. RFID readers and tags are employed to acquire the 3D positioning information of the amputee's limbs in this work to assist in diagnosing the amputee's walking problem. A series of simulations were conducted and the simulation results exhibit the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed prosthesis training system.","Huang, Chenn-Jung; Wang, Yu-Wu; Huang, Tz-Hau; Lin, Chin-Fa; Li, Ching-Yu; Chen, Heng-Ming; Chen, Po Chiang; Liao, Jia-Jian",Appl Soft Comput,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2010.12.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362800/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494610003327; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568494610003327,242

A Commentary,2020-07-15,"The ongoing pandemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which originated from Wuhan, China, has led to 68,279 deaths due to 2019-nCoV pneumonia as of May 5, 2020. We conducted a systematic review and included 16 case reports to summarize the transmission and pathology of 2019-nCoV, and clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, and treatment in 2019-nCoV pneumonia. The disease is mild in most people; in some, it may progress to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Patients with mild illness usually recover at home, with supportive care and isolation in accordance with guidelines. Patients who have moderate to severe pneumonia are usually monitored in the hospital. Although there is no definitive treatment for 2019-nCoV pneumonia so far, some antiviral drugs have shown promising results. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir was associated with significant clinical improvement in severe pneumonia. Nonetheless, we need more randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and treatment guidelines for developing effective management of the 2019-nCoV and improve patient outcomes by reducing mortality in high-risk patients. We also need ﻿more clinical trials and management guidelines for the effective management of 2019-nCoV pneumonia.","Patel, Rikinkumar S; Patel, Neev; Baksh, Mizba; Zaidi, Annam; Patel, Jaiminkumar",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656006/,242
663442,Things You Should Know in the Performing Echocardiographic Examination in Patients with COVID-19,2020-10-30,"For most emerging infectious diseases, including SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), pharmaceutical intervensions such as drugs and vaccines are not available, and disease surveillance followed by isolating, contact-tracing and quarantining infectious individuals is critical for controlling outbreaks. These interventions often begin by identifying symptomatic individuals. However, by actively removing pathogen strains likely to be symptomatic, such interventions may inadvertently select for strains less likely to result in symptomatic infections. Additionally, the pathogen's fitness landscape is structured around a heterogeneous host pool. In particular, uneven surveillance efforts and distinct transmission risks across host classes can drastically alter selection pressures. Here we explore this interplay between evolution caused by disease control efforts, on the one hand, and host heterogeneity in the efficacy of public health interventions on the other, on the potential for a less symptomatic, but widespread, pathogen to evolve. We use an evolutionary epidemiology model parameterized for SARS-CoV-2, as the widespread potential for silent transmission by asymptomatic hosts has been hypothesized to account, in part, for its rapid global spread. We show that relying on symptoms-driven reporting for disease control ultimately shifts the pathogen's fitness landscape and can cause pandemics. We find such outcomes result when isolation and quarantine efforts are intense, but insufficient for suppression. We further show that when host removal depends on the prevalence of symptomatic infections, intense isolation efforts can select for the emergence and extensive spread of more asymptomatic strains. The severity of selection pressure on pathogens caused by these interventions likely lies somewhere between the extremes of no intervention and thoroughly successful eradication. Identifying the levels of public health responses that facilitate selection for asymptomatic pathogen strains is therefore critical for calibrating disease suppression and surveillance efforts and for sustainably managing emerging infectious diseases.","Okamoto, K.

An alleged past-resolved problem,2020-10-16,"OBJECTIVE: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in clinical, financial, and mental health outcomes within a diverse sample of hospitalized COVID-19–positive patients in the 60 days postdischarge. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2217 adult patients who were hospitalized with a COVID-19–positive diagnosis as evidenced by test (reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), a discharge diagnosis of COVID-19 (ICD-10 code U07.1), or strong documented clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but no testing completed or recorded owing to logistical constraints (n=24). METHODS: Patient records were abstracted for the Mi-COVID19 data registry, including the hospital and insurer data of patients discharged from one of 38 participating hospitals in Michigan between March 16, 2020, and July 1, 2020. Registry data also included patient responses to a brief telephone survey on postdischarge employment, mental and emotional health, persistence of COVID-19–related symptoms, and medical follow-up. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data; analysis of variance and Pearson chi-squared test were used to evaluate racial and ethnic variances among patient outcomes and survey responses. RESULTS: Black patients experienced the lowest physician follow-up postdischarge (n = 65, 60.2%) and the longest delays in returning to work (average 35.5 days). More than half of hospital readmissions within the 60 days following discharge were among nonwhite patients (n = 144, 55%). The majority of postdischarge deaths were among white patients (n = 153, 21.5%), most of whom were discharged on palliative care (n = 103). Less than a quarter of patients discharged back to assisted living, skilled nursing facilities, or subacute rehabilitation facilities remained at those locations in the 60 days following discharge (n = 48). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Increased attention to postdischarge care coordination is critical to reducing negative health outcomes following a COVID-19–related hospitalization.","Robinson-Lane, Sheria G.; Sutton, Nadia R.; Chubb, Heather; Yeow, Raymond Y.; Mazzara, Nicholas; DeMarco, Kayla; Kim, Tae; Chopra, Vineet",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861021007623; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861021007623,242
664251,Intra-arterial thrombosis associated with COVID-19,2020-05-17,"2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetases are a family of interferon-induced enzymes playing an important role in antiviral defense in mammals. In the human genome, three genes encoding functional synthetases (OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3) form a cluster. Previously, we found that particular genotypes and/or alleles of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of OAS2 and OAS3 are associated with predisposition to severe forms of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Russians. In the current study, we investigated the distribution of three of the above SNPs, OAS3 rs2285932 (C/T, Ile438Ile), OAS3 rs2072136 (G/A, Ser567Ser), and OAS2 rs15895 (G/A, Trp720Ter relative to p71 isoform), in seven populations of North Eurasia: Caucasians (Russians, Germans from Altai region), Central Asian Mongoloids (Altaians, Khakass, Tuvinians, and Shorians), and Arctic Mongoloids (Chukchi). Interpopulational differences in genotype, allele and haplotype frequencies and in linkage disequilibrium structure for these SNPs were detected. These frequencies correlated with the ethnicity of the populations and with their supposed differential exposure to the TBE virus. In particular, the lowest frequencies of G/G genotype for OAS3 SNP rs2072136 (which, according to our earlier results, is associated with predisposition to severe forms of TBE) were found in Altaians, Khakass, Tuvinians, and Shorians, who commonly contact with the TBE virus in their habitation regions. Thus, the data obtained suggest that the TBE virus might act as a selection factor for particular OAS variants in Central Asian Mongoloids.","Barkhash, A. V.; Babenko, V. N.; Kobzev, V.

665264,Accurate and efficient pulmonary CT imaging workflow for COVID-19 patients by the combination of intelligent guided robot and automatic positioning technology,2021-05-27,"The Human Immunomics Initiative (HII), a joint project between the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Human Vaccines Project (HVP), focuses on studying immunity and the predictability of immuneresponsiveness to vaccines in aging populations. This paper describes the hypotheses and methodological approaches of this new collaborative initiative. Central to our thinking is the idea that predictors of age-related non-communicable diseases are the same as predictors for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. Fundamental to our approach is to differentiate between chronological, biological and immune age, and to use existing large-scale population cohorts. The latter provide well-typed phenotypic data on individuals’ health status over time, readouts of routine clinical biochemical biomarkers to determine biological age, and bio-banked plasma samples to deep phenotype humoral immune responses as biomarkers of immune age. The first phase of the program involves 1. the exploration of biological age, humoral biomarkers of immune age, and genetics in a large multigenerational cohort, and 2. the subsequent development of models of immunity in relation to health status in a second, prospective cohort of an aging population. In the second phase, vaccine responses and efficacy of licensed COVID-19 vaccines in the presence and absence of influenza-, pneumococcal- and pertussis vaccines routinely offered to elderly, will be studied in older aged participants of prospective population-based cohorts in different geographical locations who will be selected for representing distinct biological and immune ages. The HII research program is aimed at relating vaccine responsiveness to biological and immune age, and identifying aging-related pathways crucial to enhance vaccine effectiveness in aging populations.","Goudsmit, Jaap; van den Biggelaar, Anita Huiberdina Johanna; Koudstaal, Wouter; Hofman, Albert; Koff, Wayne Chester; Schenkelberg, Theodore; Alter, Galit; Mina, Michael Joseph; Wu, Julia Wei",Eur J Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10654-021-00767-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117979/,242

The present evaluation attempts to assess the long-term (1989–2016) physiochemical characteristics of WQ of river Ganga at five upstream locations (Uttarkashi, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Devprayag, and Rishikesh) of Uttarakhand, India using comprehensive pollution index (CPI) and environmetrics (PCA and CA). These methods were used to categorize, summarize expensive datasets, and grouping the similar polluted areas along the river stretches. The WQ of river at all the locations were within the good category and most of the physiochemical parameters were well within their acceptable limit for drinking WQ. Considerably, CPI demonstrated the river WQ was in slight pollution range (CPI: 0.40–1.00) in the year 2007 and 2015 at all the five locations. The positive correlation coefficient (R(2) > 0.50) among NO(2) [Formula: see text] NO(3), Ca, Na, B, and K indicates the significant contribution of organic and inorganic salts through runoffs from catchments due to weathering of rocks. PCA confirmed the input source of nutrients in the river from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Moreover, the upstream WQ assessed was found to be good as compared to the severely polluted downstream region. Due to COVID-19 and shutdown in the country, reduction of pollution load in the river was observed due to the rejuvenation capability of river Ganga.

A disaster MH conceptual model incorporating demographics, disaster exposure and threat (COVID-19 fear and workplace threat perception), perceived stress, and social support (lack of from family and friends) was utilized to predict MH outcomes (anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms; PTSS) of GSWs. GSWs (n = 842) were recruited through a regional union in California. The participants were diverse (62.1% female) and were 18–69 years of age (M = 41.5, SD = 13.9). They completed an online survey regarding COVID-19 fear, workplace threat perception, perceived stress, lack of social support, and workplace needs/recommendations for support. Three hierarchical linear regression models were run assessing each MH outcome. Thematic analysis coding and an inductive approach were utilized for analyzing open-ended responses of workplace needs/recommendations. Females and younger GSWs (ages 18–29 years old) on average, reported higher MH symptoms than males and older age groups, respectively. COVID-19 fear and perceived stress were significant predictors of anxiety, while COVID-19 fear, workplace threat perception, and perceived stress significantly predicted depression and PTSS, explaining almost half of the variance for each model. Social support and demographics were not predictive of MH outcomes. Almost half of GSWs (40%) requested increased safety protections in the workplace. Feelings of fear of COVID-19, threat in the workplace, and overall perceived stress are predictive of GSWs’ MH outcomes. Increasing feelings of safety in the workplace and reducing stress may lessen MH symptoms.","Janson, Melissa; Sharkey, Jill D.; del Cid, Daniel A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444423/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168675,242

The aims were to quantify the incidence of seropositive failure in the medium term in a cohort of patients with different COVID‐19 severity and to analyze its associated factors. Patients who had recovered from mild and severe forms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in an Academic Spanish hospital (March 12–May 2, 2020), were tested for total anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Elecsys Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 test; Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The non‐seropositive status (seropositive failure) incidence (95% CI) was determined. Associations were tested by multiple logistic regression in a global cohort and severe pneumonia subpopulation. Of 435 patients with PCR‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2, a serological test was carried out in 325: 210 (64.6%) had severe pneumonia (hospitalized patients), 51 (15.7%) non‐severe pneumonia (managed as outpatients), and 64 (19.7%) mild cases without pneumonia. After a median (IQR) of 76 days (70–83) from symptom onset, antibody responses may not consistently develop or reach levels sufficient to be detectable by antibody tests (non‐seropositive incidence) in 6.9% (95% CI, 4.4–10.6) and 20.3% (95% CI, 12.2–31.7) of patients with and without pneumonia, respectively. Baseline independent predictors of seropositive failure were higher leukocytes and fewer days of symptoms before admission, while low glomerular filtrate and fever seem associated with serologic response. Age, comorbidity or immunosuppressive therapies (corticosteroids, tocilizumab) did not influence antibody response. In the medium‐term, SARS‐CoV‐2 seropositive failure is not infrequent in COVID‐19 recovered patients.

However, there is a lack of investigation on longitudinal changes in physical activity beyond lockdowns and stay-at-home orders. Moreover, it is unclear if there is heterogeneity in physical activity growth trajectories. This study aimed to explore longitudinal patterns of physical activity and factors associated with them. Data were from the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. The analytical sample consisted of 35,915 adults in England who were followed up for 22 weeks from 24th March to 23rd August 2020. Data were analysed using growth mixture models. Our analyses identified six classes of growth trajectories, including three stable classes showing little change over time (62.4% in total), two classes showing decreasing physical activity (28.6%), and one class showing increasing physical activity over time (9%). A range of factors were found to be associated the class membership of physical activity trajectories, such as age, gender, education, income, employment status, and health. There is substantial heterogeneity in longitudinal changes in physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a substantial proportion of our sample showed persistent physical inactivity or decreasing physical activity. Given the well-established link between physical activity and health, persistent or increased physical inactivity is likely to have both immediate and long-term implications for people’s physical and mental health, as well as general wellbeing. More efforts are needed to promote physical activity during the pandemic and beyond.","Bu, Feifei; Bone, Jessica K.; Mitchell, John J.; Steptoe, Andrew; Fancourt, Daisy",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34475465/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97065-1,242
667263,Pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy in COVID-19 pneumonia,2020-06-29,"BACKGROUND: Small airway function parameters (SAFPs) combined with fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) can predict a positive methacholine challenge test (MCT) for asthma diagnosis. However, their predictive utility in patients with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) ≥80% predicted within different age ranges remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the utility of SAFPs, alone or combined with FeNO, to predict a positive MCT in patients in two age groups (<55 and ≥55 years) with asthma‐suggestive symptoms and FEV(1) ≥80% predicted. METHODS: We enrolled 846 Chinese patients with suspected asthma and standard spirometry, FeNO, and MCT findings. Using the area under the curves (AUCs), the utility of SAFPs, alone or combined with FeNO, for predicting a positive MCT was analyzed in a discovery (n = 534) and validation cohort (n = 312) in both age groups with FEV(1) ≥80% predicted. RESULTS: In the discovery cohort, the optimal cut‐off values for predicting a positive MCT in patients aged <55 years (74.2% and 74.9% for forced expiratory flow (FEF)(50%) and FEF(25%–75%), respectively) were higher than those in patients aged ≥55 years (65.0% and 62.9% for FEF(50%), FEF(25%–75%), respectively). However, the optimal FeNO value in patients aged <55 years (43 ppb) was lower than that in patients aged ≥55 years (48 ppb). FeNO combined with SAFPs (FEF(50%), FEF(25%–75%)) significantly increased the AUCs in both groups (≥55 years [0.851 for FEF(50%) and 0.844 for FEF(25%–75%)]; <55 years [0.865 for FEF(50%) and 0.883 for FEF(25%–75%)]) compared with a single parameter (p < 0.05). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort. Compared with patients ≥55 years, those aged <55 years had higher and lower optimal cut‐off values for SAFPs and FeNO, respectively. The AUCs of FeNO combined with SAFPs for predicting a positive MCT for asthma diagnosis were significantly higher than those of the individual parameters (p < 0.05) in both age groups. CONCLUSIONS: There were age‐group differences in the utility of SAFPs combined with FeNO for predicting a positive MCT. Patients with an asthma‐suggestive history and a normal FEV(1) should be stratified by age when using SAFPs combined with FeNO to predict a positive MCT.","Hou, Lili; Hao, Huijuan; Huang, Gang; Liu, Jinkai; Yu, Li; Zhu, Lei; Shen, Huahao; Zhang, Min",Clin Transl Allergy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33900045/; https://doi.org/10.1002/clt2.12007,242

These service constraints, coupled with concerns relating to an increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 among patients with cancer, should lead to re-consideration of the risk–benefit balance for standard treatment pathways. This is of particular importance to pancreatic cancer, given that standard diagnostic modalities such as endoscopy may be restricted, and that disease biology precludes significant delays in treatment. In light of this, we sought consensus from UK clinicians with an interest in pancreatic cancer for management approaches that would minimise patient risk and accommodate for healthcare service restrictions. The outcomes are described here and include recommendations for treatment prioritisation, strategies to bridge to later surgical resection in resectable disease and factors that modify the risk–benefit balance for treatment in the resectable through to the metastatic settings.

667637,Dynamic monitoring of serum liver function indexes in patients with COVID-19,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have modeled and predicted the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in the U.S. using data that begins with the first reported cases. However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data documenting the daily new and cumulative cases of confirmed COVID-19 in the U.S. from January 22 to April 6, 2020, and reconstructed the epidemic using a 5-parameter logistic growth model. We fitted our model to data from a 2-week window (i.e., from March 21 to April 4, approximately one incubation period) during which large-scale testing was being conducted. With parameters obtained from this modeling, we reconstructed and predicted the growth of the epidemic and evaluated the extent and potential effects of underdetection. RESULTS: The data fit the model satisfactorily. The estimated daily growth rate was 16.8% overall with 95% CI: [15.95, 17.76%], suggesting a doubling period of 4 days. Based on the modeling result, the tipping point at which new cases will begin to decline will be on April 7th, 2020, with a peak of 32,860 new cases on that day. By the end of the epidemic, at least 792,548 (95% CI: [789,162, 795,934]) will be infected in the U.S. Based on our model, a total of 12,029 cases were not detected between January 22 (when the first case was detected in the U.S.) and April 4. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate the utility of a 5-parameter logistic growth model with reliable data that comes from a specified period during which governmental interventions were appropriately implemented.

669311,Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis Secondary to Sphenoid Mycetoma following COVID-19 infection,2021-04-12,"OBJECTIVES The Pediatric Emergency Research Network (PERN) was launched in 2009 with the intent for existing national and regional research networks in paediatric emergency care to organise globally for the conduct of collaborative research across networks. METHODS PERN has grown from five to eight member networks over the past decade. With an executive committee comprising representatives from all member networks, PERN plays a supportive and collaborative rather than governing role. The full impact of PERN's facilitation of international collaborative research, although somewhat difficult to quantify empirically, can be measured indirectly by the observed growth of the field, the nature of the increasingly challenging research questions now being addressed and the collective capacity to generate and implement new knowledge in treating acutely ill and injured children. RESULTS Beginning as a pandemic response studying H1N1 influenza risk factors in children, PERN research has progressed to multiple observational studies and ongoing global randomised controlled trials (RCTs). As a recent example, PERN has developed sufficient network infrastructure to enable the rapid initiation of a prospective observational study in response to the current COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS Following its success with developing global research, the PERN goal now is to promote the implementation of scientific advances into everyday clinical practice by: (i) expanding the capacity for global RCTs; (ii) deepening the focus on implementation science; (iii) increasing attention to healthcare disparities; and (iv) expanding PERN's reach into resource-restricted regions. Through these actions, PERN aims to meet the needs of acutely ill and injured children throughout the world.","Klassen, Terry P; Dalziel, Stuart R; Babl, Franz E; Benito, Javier; Bressan, Silvia; Chamberlain, James; Chang, Todd P; Freedman, Stephen B; Kohn Loncarica, Guillermo; Lyttle, Mark D; Mintegi, Santiago; Mistry, Rakesh D; Nigrovic, Lise E; Oostenbrink, Rianne; Plint, Amy C; Rino, Pedro; Roland, Damian; Van de Mosselaer, Greg; Kuppermann, Nathan",Emergency medicine Australasia : EMA,https://doi.org/10.1111/1742-6723.13801; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218513/,242
670449,A severe COVID-19 despite ongoing treatment with Lopinavir-Ritonavir,2020-07-15,"BACKGROUND: Patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) frequently require mechanical ventilation and have high mortality rates, but the impact of viral burden on these outcomes is unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from March 30 to April 30, 2020 at two hospitals in New York City. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed using cycle threshold (Ct) values from a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay applied to nasopharyngeal swab samples. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes among patients with high, medium, and low admission viral loads and assessed whether viral load was independently associated with risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We evaluated 678 patients with COVID-19. Higher viral load was associated with increased age, comorbidities, smoking status, and recent chemotherapy. In-hospital mortality was 35.0% with a high viral load (Ct<25; n=220), 17.6% with a medium viral load (Ct 25-30; n=216), and 6.2% with a low viral load (Ct>30; n=242; P<0.001). The risk of intubation was also higher in patients with a high viral load (29.1%), compared to those with a medium (20.8%) or low viral load (14.9%; P<0.001). High viral load was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.92-12.52; P<0.001) and intubation (aOR 2.73; 95% CI: 1.68-4.44; P<0.001) in multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Admission SARS-CoV-2 viral load among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 independently correlates with the risk of intubation and in-hospital mortality. Providing this information to clinicians could potentially be used to guide patient care.","Magleby, Reed; Westblade, Lars F; Trzebucki, Alex; Simon, Matthew S; Rajan, Mangala; Park, Joel; Goyal, Parag; Safford, Monika M; Satlin, Michael J",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603425/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa851,242

671304,Abdominal symptoms as initial manifestation of COVID-19: a case series,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND Mirror syndrome (MS) is a rare obstetric disorder complicated with high maternal morbidity and fetal mortality. MS is often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed due to the low incidence and lack of awareness of its diverse features. This study aimed to summarise the etiology, clinical characteristics, and risk factors of MS among mothers with fetal hydrops. METHODS This retrospective case-control study included 37 pregnant women with fetal hydrops in the second and third trimesters from 58,428 deliveries performed at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University between January 2012 and December 2020. Cases were categorized as MS and non-MS according to the presence or absence of maternal mirroring symptoms. Binary logistic regression was performed for analysis. RESULTS Fourteen women developed MS with an overall incidence of 0.024% (14/58,428) and 37.8% (14/37) in the fetal hydrops cases. Among the 11 MS cases with known associated etiologies, seven had alpha thalassemia major. Onset of fetal hydrops was later (27.8 vs. 23.0 weeks) and the rate of placental thickening was higher (85.7% vs. 34.8%) in the MS group than in the non-MS group (P < 0.05). Regarding maternal characteristics, the MS group had higher maternal morbidity (85.7% vs. 8.7%), more weight gain (9.0 vs. 5.5 kg), higher rates of hypertension (35.7 vs. 0%) and proteinuria (64.3% vs. 4.3%), and lower levels of hemoglobin (88 vs. 105 g/L) and serum albumin (25.8 vs. 35.0 g/L) than the non-MS group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that onset of fetal hydrops at ≥24 weeks and placental thickening were associated with the risk of MS among fetal hydrops cases (OR 15.83, 95% CI 1.56-160.10 and OR 8.63, 95% CI 1.29-57.72, respectively). CONCLUSIONS MS is relatively common among fetal hydrops cases in the late second and third trimesters, and alpha thalassemia major is the main etiology for fetal hydrops and also MS in this population. Complicated with high maternal morbidity, the key maternal features of MS include more weight gain, hemodilution, and hypertension. Among those with fetal hydrops, the onset time of ≥24 weeks and placental thickening are risk factors for MS.","Han, Zhenyan; Chen, Xiaodan; Wang, Qingqing; Zhou, Jin; Guo, Yan; Hou, Hongying; Zhang, Yuan",BMC pregnancy and childbirth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583666/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04143-3,242

Currently, different therapies active on the immune system are used for the management of COVID-19. The involvement of the immune system also opens the opportunity for the use of nutritional supplements with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity. MAIN ASPECTS: Nutritional supplements with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activity are promising therapeutic adjuvants for the treatment of COVID-19, and also for the prevention of viral spreading. In particular, the role of vitamin D, probiotics, lactoferrin, and zinc is of significant clinical interest, although there are only a few data on their use in COVID-19 patients. Their molecular actions, together with the results of studies performed on other respiratory infections, strongly suggest their potential utility in COVID-19. This article discusses the main properties of these nutritional supplements and their potential applicability in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The supplementation with vitamin D, probiotics, lactoferrin and zinc could have a role both in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and in mitigating the clinical course in infected patients, contributing in the prevention of immune-mediated organ damage.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Spada, Erika; Comberiati, Pasquale; Peroni, Diego G.",Ital J Pediatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-021-00990-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33588905/,242

Besides hygienic measurements to reduce the spread of the virus vaccines have been confected, partially based on the experiences with Ebola virus vaccine, based on recombinant human or chimpanzee adenovirus carrying the spike protein and its ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Further vaccines are constructed by spike protein coding mRNA incorporated in lipid nano vesicles that after entry in human cells produce spike protein. Both vaccine types induce a strong immune response that lasts for months possibly for T-cell immunity a few years. Due to mutations in the coronavirus genome in several parts of the world variants selected, that were partially more pathogenic and partially easier transmissible - variants of concern (VOC). Until now vaccinees are protected against the VOC, even when protection might be reduced compared to the Wuhan wild virus.An open field is still how long the vaccine induced immunity will be sufficient to prevent infection and/or disease; and how long the time period will last until revaccination will be required for life saving protection, whether a third vaccination is needed, and whether revaccination with an adenovirus-based vaccine will be tolerated.","Schmidt, Jonas; Blessing, Frithjof; Gürtler, Lutz",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34416777/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1550-0001,242

671926,Evaluation of organ function in patients with severe COVID-19 infections,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND: In classical phenylketonuria (PKU) phenylalanine (Phe) accumulates due to functional impairment of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase caused by pathogenic variants in the PAH gene. PKU treatment prevents severe cognitive impairment. Blood Phe concentration is the main biochemical monitoring parameter. Between appointments and venous blood sampling, Austrian PKU patients send dried blood spots (DBS) for Phe measurements to their centre. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS CoV-2 virus, was classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. In Austria, two nationwide lockdowns were installed during the first and second pandemic wave with variable regional and national restrictions in between. This retrospective questionnaire study compared the frequency of Phe measurements and Phe concentrations during lockdown with the respective period of the previous year in children and adolescents with PKU and explored potential influencing factors. RESULTS: 77 patients (30 female, 47 male; mean age 12.4 [8–19] years in 2020) from five centres were included. The decline of venous samples taken on appointments in 2020 did not reach significance but the number of patients with none or only one DBS tripled from 4 (5.2%) in 2019 to 12 (15.6%) in 2020. Significantly more patients had a decline than a rise in the number of DBS sent in between 2019 and 2020 (p < 0.001; Chi(2) = 14.79). Especially patients ≥ 16 years sent significantly less DBS in 2020 (T = 156, p = 0.02, r = 0.49). In patients who adhered to DBS measurements, Phe concentrations remained stable. Male or female sex and dietary only versus dietary plus sapropterin treatment did not influence frequency of measurements and median Phe. CONCLUSION: During the COVID pandemic, the number of PKU patients who stopped sending DBS to their metabolic centre increased significantly, especially among those older than 16 years. Those who kept up sending DBS maintained stable Phe concentrations. Our follow-up system, which is based on DBS sent in by patients to trigger communication with the metabolic team served adherent patients well. It failed, however, to actively retrieve patients who stopped or reduced Phe measurements.","Herle, Marion; Brunner-Krainz, Michaela; Karall, Daniela; Goeschl, Bernadette; Möslinger, Dorothea; Zobel, Joachim; Plecko, Barbara; Scholl-Bürgi, Sabine; Spenger, Johannes; Wortmann, Saskia B.; Huemer, Martina",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-01996-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34412683/,242
672151,In Reply: May Cooler Heads Prevail During a Pandemic: Stroke in COVID-19 Patients or COVID-19 in Stroke Patients?,2020-08-28,"BACKGROUND: Although numerous medicinal herbal compounds demonstrate promising therapeutic potential, their clinical application is often limited by their poor oral bioavailability. To circumvent this barrier, various lipid-based herbal formulations have been developed and trialled with promising experimental results. PURPOSE: This scoping review aims to describe the effect of lipid-based formulations on the oral bioavailability of herbal compounds. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted across three electronic databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Library) between January 2010 and January 2021 to identify relevant studies. The articles were rigorously screened for eligibility. Data from eligible studies were then extracted and collated for synthesis and descriptive analysis using Covidence. RESULTS: A total of 109 studies were included in the present review: 105 animal studies and four clinical trials. Among the formulations investigated, 50% were emulsions, 34% lipid particulate systems, 12% vesicular systems, and 4% were other types of lipid-based formulations. Within the emulsion system classification, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems were observed to produce the best improvements in oral bioavailability, followed by mixed micellar formulations. The introduction of composite lipid-based formulations and the use of uncommon surfactants such as sodium oleate in emulsion preparation was shown to consistently enhance the bioavailability of herbal compounds with poor oral absorption. Interestingly, the lipid-based formulations of magnesium lithospermate B and Pulsatilla chinensis produced an absolute bioavailability greater than 100% indicating the possibility of prolonged systemic circulation. With respect to chemical conjugation, D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) was the most frequently used and significantly improved the bioavailability of its phytoconstituents. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there is no distinct lipid-based formulation superior to the other. Bioavailability improvements were largely dependent on the nature of the phytoconstituents. This scoping review, however, provided a detailed summary of the most up-to-date evidence on phytoconstituents formulated into lipid preparations and their oral bioavailability. We conclude that a systematic review and meta-analysis between bioavailability improvements of individual phytoconstituents (such as kaempferol, morin and myricetin) in various lipid-based formulations will provide a more detailed association. Such a review will be highly beneficial for both researchers and herbal manufacturers.","Tan, Oi Jin; Loo, Hooi Leong; Thiagarajah, Gayathiri; Palanisamy, Uma Devi; Sundralingam, Usha",Phytomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34340903/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.153651,242

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine if a self-triage tool could reduce the burden on emergency call centers and help predict increasing burden on hospitals. METHODS: Users were asked questions about their underlying conditions, sociodemographic status, postal code, and main COVID-19 symptoms. Participants were advised to call an emergency call center if they reported dyspnea or complete loss of appetite for over 24 hours. Data on COVID-19–related calls were collected from 6 emergency call centers and data on COVID-19 hospitalizations were collected from Santé Publique France and the French Ministry of Health. We examined the change in the number of emergency calls before and after the launch of the web application. RESULTS: From March 17 to April 2, 2020, 735,419 questionnaires were registered in the study area. Of these, 121,370 (16.5%) led to a recommendation to call an emergency center. The peak number of overall questionnaires and of questionnaires leading to a recommendation to call an emergency center were observed on March 22, 2020. In the 17 days preceding the launch of the web application, emergency call centers in the study area registered 66,925 COVID-19–related calls and local hospitals admitted 639 patients for COVID-19; the ratio of emergency calls to hospitalizations for COVID-19 was 104.7 to 1. In the 17 days following the launch of the web application, there were 82,347 emergency calls and 6009 new hospitalizations for COVID-19, a ratio of 13.7 calls to 1 hospitalization (chi-square test: P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The self-triage web application launch was followed by a nearly 10-fold increase in COVID-19–related hospitalizations with only a 23% increase in emergency calls. The peak of questionnaire completions preceded the peak of COVID-19–related hospitalizations by 5 days. Although the design of this study does not allow us to conclude that the self-triage tool alone contributed to the alleviation of calls to the emergency call centers, it does suggest that it played a role, and may be used for predicting increasing burden on hospitals.

This ten-patient study was designed to determine the efficacy of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving oxygenation and in reducing the cytokine load in a critically ill subset of patients. METHODS: Five single volume plasma exchanges over eight days within a 14-day study period. In mechanically ventilated patients, oxygenation was measured via the PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio and the oxygenation index (OI) daily for 14 days. Supplemental oxygen requirements were tracked daily for non-ventilated patients. RESULTS: Non-ventilated patients were liberated from supplemental oxygen after TPE. The response was rapid with an 87% average reduction in oxygenation requirements following and average time to return to room air of 5.25 days. All mechanically ventilated patients demonstrated improvement in oxygenation with a 78% average improvement in the P/F ratio and a 43% improvement in OI. C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ and GM-CSF, were measured daily with immediate post TPE levels drawn on days 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. All patients demonstrated significant reductions in CRP, IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα. CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with Penn class 3 and 4 CRS complicating COVID-19, TPE demonstrated a prompt improvement in oxygenation and reduction in cytokine load without compromising patient safety. As this pilot study was envisioned to be hypothesis generating, expanded trials using TPE alone and in conjunction with novel pharmacologic agents are warranted.

And for the study, we associate financial data using the profit indicators of firms. We perceive that the sustainable supply chain practices considering environmental, social and governance performances may not positively impact the financial performance measured by the Return on Asset (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE), during the considered period of five years for the study. We construct the empirical model and use Partial Least Square (PLS) regression modeling to analyze the results. The study can be further extended for many Indian firms and for firms across different developing economies, as well.

METHODS: This analysis from the COVED Project presents data from 12 sites across four Australian states for the period from 1 April to 30 November 2020. All adult patients who met local criteria for suspected COVID‐19 and underwent testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 in the ED were eligible for inclusion. Study outcomes were mechanical ventilation and in‐hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 24 405 eligible ED presentations over the whole study period, 423 tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2. During the ‘second wave’ from 1 July to 30 September 2020, 26 (6%) of 406 SARS‐CoV‐2 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, compared to 175 (2%) of the 9024 SARS‐CoV‐2 negative patients (odds ratio [OR] 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–5.2, P < 0.001), and 41 (10%) SARS‐CoV‐2 positive patients died in hospital compared to 312 (3%) SARS‐CoV‐2 negative patients (OR 3.2; 95% CI 2.2–4.4, P = 0.001).

The present report is of a case of hyponatremia and encephalopathy due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) as the main presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 55-year-old woman. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old woman with type II diabetes mellitus presented with confusion and slurring of speech, with a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure of 159/81 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She did not have edema on examination. Laboratory testing showed a low sodium level of 116 mEq/L (reference range, 135–145 mEq/L) with urine osmolarity of 364 mOsm/kg, urinary sodium of 69 mEq/L, urinary potassium of 15.6 mEq/L, and serum osmolarity of 251 mOsm/kg. The patient had normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and cortisol levels. A chest X-ray should no pulmonary infiltrates nor did a lumbar puncture reveal signs of infection. A real-time SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for COVID-19. Brain imaging with computed tomography was negative for acute infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, and mass effect. Based on findings from laboratory testing and physical examination, a diagnosis of SIADH was made. The patient was treated with 3% hypertonic saline, followed by salt tablets and fluid restriction, with improvement in her clinical symptoms and serum sodium level. CONCLUSIONS: The present report is of a rare but previously reported association with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Encephalopathy and hyponatremia associated with SIADH without pneumonia or other symptoms of infection should be an indication for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Sherazi, Andleeb; Bedi, Puneet; Udevbulu, Ehizode; Rubin, Vadim; Alasadi, Lutfi; Spitalewitz, Samuel",Am J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.930135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33760803/,242
676153,Strangulated Amyand’s hernia: management during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-30,"Guinea, like many other African countries, has been facing an unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, since March 2020. In April 2020, Guinean National agency for health security recorded 1351 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 313 recoveries and 07 deaths. To address this health crisis, some drastic measures were implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those measures might potentially cause some psychological problems among Guineans. Thus, we conducted this study to assess the psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 in the Guinean population. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey among internet users in Guinea. A free e-survey platform was used, and questionnaires were sent to internet users. The study ran from May 1 through May 10 2020. Participation in the study was voluntary. Data collection was based on sociodemographic information and self-reported questionnaires: Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) for stress evaluation, Penn state worry questionnaire (PSWQ), and an adapted Social Psychological Measurements of COVID-19. A total of 280 participants took part in the study; responses from 5 participants were deleted because of incompleteness. The average age of participants was 28.9 [95% CI: 28.1;29.6]. Most of participants were male 65.5% [95% CI: 59.5%;71.1%]. Unemployed participants stood for 48.7% [95% CI: 42.7%;54.8%]. IES-R scale for stress evaluation yielded the following findings: 19.6% (mild), 5.23% (moderate) and 9.15% (severe); 82.8% and 17.2% of participants had respectively reported low and moderate worry. No significant statistical association was found between sociodemographic variables and traumatic events (IES-R and PSWQ). However, 82% of our participants had to cope with the negative impacts of COVID-19. Although there were few cases of traumatic events, negative impacts of COVID-19 on study participants deserve to be underlined. So, further investigations are necessary to identify and disentangle specific psychosocial problems in different Guinean socio-cultural contexts.","Touré, Almamy Amara; Camara, Lansana Mady; Magassouba, Aboubacar Sidiki; Doumbouya, Abdoulaye; Camara, Gnoume; Camara, Alsény Yarie; Loua, Gaspard; Cissé, Diao; Sylla, Mohamed; Bereté, Alpha Oumar; Beavogui, Abdoul Habib",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33529216/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245751,242

This provides an opportunity to quantify the contribution rate of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO(2) concentrations. This paper creatively puts forward the concept of the Maximum Possible Contribution Rate (MPCR) and estimates the MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO(2) by analyzing the daily air pollution data and road traffic data in Beijing from January 24 to March 31, 2020 and the same period in 2019. The findings of this paper include: The decrease in SO(2) concentration during the lockdown indicates a reduction in pollutant emissions from industry and households. During the lockdown, road traffic in Beijing reduced by 46.9 %, while the concentrations of PM2.5 and NO(2) in the atmosphere reduced by 5.6 % and 29.2 % respectively. The MPCR of road traffic to PM2.5 and NO(2) concentrations are 11.9 % and 62.3 %, respectively. The concentration of O(3) did not increase significantly with the decrease of PM2.5 and NO(2) concentrations. The findings of this paper provide a reference for city managers to evaluate the contribution rate of Beijing’s road traffic to air pollutants and to formulate reasonable emission reduction policies.","Xin, Yalu; Shao, Shuangquan; Wang, Zhichao; Xu, Zhaowei; Li, Hao",Sustain Cities Soc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670721002754; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2210670721002754; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.102989; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34631394/,242

An early report from newly established laboratory‐based influenza surveillance in Lao PDR. Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 4(2), 47–52. Background Prior to 2007, little information was available about the burden of influenza in Laos. We report data from the first laboratory‐based influenza surveillance system established in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. Methods Three hospitals in the capital city of Vientiane began surveillance for influenza‐like illness (ILI) in outpatients in 2007 and expanded to include hospitalized pneumonia patients in 2008. Nasal/throat swab specimens were collected and tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by multiplex ID‐Tag(TM) respiratory viral panel (RVP) assay on a Luminex® 100× MAP IS instrument (Qiagen, Singapore). Results During January 2007 to December 2008, 287 of 526 (54·6%) outpatients with ILI were positive for at least one respiratory virus. Influenza was most commonly identified, with 63 (12·0%) influenza A and 92 (17·5%) influenza B positive patients identified. In 2008, six of 79 (7·6%) hospitalized pneumonia patients were positive for influenza A and four (5·1%) were positive for influenza B. Children <5 years represented 19% of viral infections in outpatients and 38% of pneumonia inpatients. Conclusion Our results provide the first documentation of influenza burden among patients with febrile respiratory illness and pneumonia requiring hospitalization in Laos. Implementing laboratory‐based influenza surveillance requires substantial investments in infrastructure and training. However, continuing outbreaks of avian influenza A/H5N1 in poultry and emergence of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic strain further underscore the importance of establishing and maintaining influenza surveillance in developing countries.","Vongphrachanh, Phengta; Simmerman, James M.; Phonekeo, Darouny; Pansayavong, Vimatha; Sisouk, Thongchanh; Ongkhamme, Somvay; Bryce, Gary T.; Corwin, Andrew; Bryant, Juliet E.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20167044/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2009.00120.x,242
678046,The liaison between respiratory failure and high blood pressure: evidence from COVID-19 patients,2020-05-19,"CD81 is a major receptor for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). It belongs to the tetraspanin family whose members form dynamic clusters with numerous partner proteins and with one another, forming tetraspanin‐enriched areas in the plasma membrane. In our study, we combined single‐molecule microscopy and biochemistry experiments to investigate the clustering and membrane behaviour of CD81 in the context of cells expressing EWI‐2wint, a natural inhibitor of HCV entry. Interestingly, we found that EWI‐2wint reduces the global diffusion of CD81 molecules due to a decrease of the diffusion rate of mobile CD81molecules and an increase in the proportion of confined molecules. Indeed, we demonstrated that EWI‐2wint promotes CD81 clustering and confinement in CD81‐enriched areas. In addition, we showed that EWI‐2wint influences the colocalization of CD81 with Claudin‐1 – a co‐receptor required for HCV entry. Together, our results indicate that a change in membrane partitioning of CD81 occurs in the presence of EWI‐2wint. This study gives new insights on the mechanism by which HCV enters into its target cells, namely by exploiting the dynamic properties of CD81.","Potel, Julie; Rassam, Patrice; Montpellier, Claire; Kaestner, Laura; Werkmeister, Elisabeth; Tews, Birke A.; Couturier, Cyril; Popescu, Costin‐Ioan; Baumert, Thomas F.; Rubinstein, Eric; Dubuisson, Jean; Milhiet, Pierre‐Emmanuel; Cocquerel, Laurence",Cell Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23351194/,242
678124,Antibiotic Prescribing Patterns at COVID-19 Dedicated Wards in Bangladesh: Findings from a Single Center Study,2021-02-27,"This was a cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to report the impact of COVID-19 on spine surgery fellow education and readiness for practice. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 has emerged as one of the most devastating global health crises of our time. To minimize transmission risk and to ensure availability of health resources, many hospitals have cancelled elective surgeries. There may be unintended consequences of this decision on the education and preparedness of current surgical trainees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multidimensional survey was created and distributed to all current AO Spine fellows and fellowship directors across the United States and Canada. RESULTS: Forty-five spine surgery fellows and 25 fellowship directors completed the survey. 62.2% of fellows reported >50% decrease in overall case volume since cancellation of elective surgeries. Mean hours worked per week decreased by 56.2%. Fellows reported completing a mean of 188.4±64.8 cases before the COVID-19 crisis and 84.1% expect at least an 11%–25% reduction in case volume compared with previous spine fellows. In all, 95.5% of fellows did not expect COVID-19 to impact their ability to complete fellowship. Only 2 directors were concerned about their fellows successfully completing fellowship; however, 32% of directors reported hearing concerns regarding preparedness from their fellows and 25% of fellows were concerned about job opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has universally impacted work hours and case volume for spine surgery fellows set to complete fellowship in the middle of 2020. Nevertheless, spine surgery fellows generally feel ready to enter practice and are supported by the confidence of their fellowship directors. The survey highlights a number of opportunities for improvement and innovation in the future training of spine surgeons.

Cellulose substrates, including thread, paper and hydrogels are alternatives due to their distinct structural and mechanical properties for a number of applications. Thread have gained considerable attention and become promising powerful tool due to its advantages over paper-based systems thus finds numerous applications in the development of diagnostic systems, smart bandages and tissue engineering. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review articles on the topic of thread-based microfluidics have been published and it is of significance for many scientific communities working on Microfluidics, Biosensors and Lab-on-Chip. This review gives an overview of the advances of thread-based microfluidic diagnostic devices in a variety of applications. It begins with an overall introduction of the fabrication followed by an in-depth review on the detection techniques in such devices and various applications with respect to effort and performance to date. A few perspective directions of thread-based microfluidics in its development are also discussed.

678776,Nosocomial or not? A combined epidemiological and genomic investigation to understand hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection on an elderly care ward,2021-08-28,"A serious pandemic has been caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The interaction between spike surface viral protein (Sgp) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor is essential to understand the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and pathogenicity. Currently, no drugs are available to treat the infection caused by this coronavirus and the use of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may be a promising alternative therapeutic strategy to control SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we investigated the in silico interaction of AMPs with viral structural proteins and host cell receptors. We screened the antimicrobial peptide database (APD3) and selected 15 peptides based on their physicochemical and antiviral properties. The interactions of AMPs with Sgp and ACE2 were performed by docking analysis. The results revealed that two amphibian AMPs, caerin 1.6 and caerin 1.10, had the highest affinity for Sgp proteins while interaction with the ACE2 receptor was reduced. The effective AMPs interacted particularly with Arg995 located in the S2 subunits of Sgp, which is key subunit that plays an essential role in viral fusion and entry into the host cell through ACE2. Given these computational findings, new potentially effective AMPs with antiviral properties for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, but they need experimental validation for their therapeutic effectiveness.","Liscano, Yamil; Oñate-Garzón, Jose; Ocampo-Ibáñez, Iván Darío",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25235535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33255849/,242

679458,Healthcare disparities among anticoagulation therapies for severe COVID-19 patients in the multi-site VIRUS registry,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a high risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) that requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). A state of hypercoagulability reduces circuit life spans. To maintain circuit patency and therapeutic efficiency, an optimized anticoagulation strategy is needed. This study investigates whether alternative anticoagulation strategies for RRT during COVID-19 are superior to administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH). METHODS: Retrospective cohort study on 71 critically ill COVID-19 patients (≥18 years), admitted to intensive care units at a tertiary health care facility in the southwestern part of Germany between February 26 and May 21, 2020. We collected data on the disease course, AKI, RRT, and thromboembolic events. Four different anticoagulatory regimens were administered. Anticoagulation during continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was performed with UFH or citrate. Anticoagulation during sustained low-efficiency daily dialysis (SLEDD) was performed with UFH, argatroban, or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Primary outcome is the effect of the anticoagulation regimen on mean treatment times of RRT. RESULTS: In patients receiving CVVHD, mean treatment time in the UFH group was 21.3 h (SEM: ±5.6 h), in the citrate group 45.6 h (SEM: ±2.7 h). Citrate anticoagulation significantly prolonged treatment times by 24.4 h (P = .001). In patients receiving SLEDD, mean treatment time with UFH was 8.1 h (SEM: ±1.3 h), with argatroban 8.0 h (SEM: ±0.9 h), and with LMWH 11.8 h (SEM: ±0.5 h). LMWH significantly prolonged treatment times by 3.7 h (P = .008) and 3.8 h (P = .002), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: UFH fails to prevent early clotting events in the dialysis circuit during COVID-19. For patients, who do not require effective systemic anticoagulation, regional citrate dialysis is the most effective strategy. For patients, who require effective systemic anticoagulation, the usage of LMWH results in the longest circuit life spans. The proposed anticoagulatory strategies are safe, can easily be monitored, and allow an individualized treatment.

In the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Sul (population 11.3 million), we are carrying out fortnightly household surveys in nine of the largest cities. Multi-stage probability sampling was used in each city to select 500 households, within which one resident was randomly chosen for testing. The Wondfo lateral flow rapid test for detecting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 has been validated in four different settings, including our own, with pooled estimates of sensitivity (84.8%, 95% CI 81.4%;87.8%) and specificity (99.0%, 95% CI 97.8%;99.7%), which are within the acceptable range for epidemiological studies. In the first wave of the study (April 11-13), 4,188 subjects were tested, of whom two were positive (0.0477%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0058%;0.1724%). In the second round (Apr 25-27) there were six positive subjects (0.1333%; 95% CI 0.0489%;0.2900%). We also tested family members of positive index cases, and nine out of 19 had positive results. Testing of reported COVID-19 cases according to RT-PCR confirmed that the test was highly sensitive under field conditions. The epidemic is at an early stage in the State, as the first case was reported on Feb 28, and by Apr 30, 50 deaths were registered. Strict lockdown measures were implemented in mid-March, and our results suggest that compliance was high, with full or near full compliance rates of 79.4% in the first and 71.7% in the second round. As far as we know, this is the only large population anywhere undergoing regular household serological surveys for COVID-19. The results show that the epidemic is at an early phase, and findings from the next rounds will allow us to document time trends and propose Public Health measures.","Silveira, Mariangela; Barros, Aluisio; Horta, Bernardo; Pellanda, Lucia; Victora, Gabriel; Dellagostin, Odir; Struchiner, Claudio; Burattini, Marcelo; Valim, Andreia; Berlezi, Evelise; Mesa, Jeovany; Ikeda, Maria Leticia; Mesenburg, Marilia; Mantesso, Marina; Dall039, Marinel; Agnol,; Bittencourt, Raqueli; Hartwig, Fernando P; Menezes, Ana Maria; Barros, Fernando C; Hallal, Pedro; Victora, Cesar G",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.01.20087205; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.20087205v1?rss=1,242
680065,COVID-19 presenting as acute pancreatitis,2020-05-08,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, vascular surgeons in the Veteran Affairs Health Care System have been undertaking only essential cases, such as advanced critical limb ischemia. Surgical risk assessment in these patients is often complex, considers all factors known to impact short- and long-term outcomes, and the additional risk that COVID-19 infection could convey in this patient population is unknown. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published risk factors (ECDC-RF) implicated in increased COVID-19 hospitalization and case-fatality which have been further evidenced by initial reports from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC reports additionally indicate that African American (AA) patients have incurred disparate infection outcomes in the United States. We set forth to survey the Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) database over a nearly 20 year span to inform ongoing risk assessment with an estimation of the prevalence of ECDC-RF in our veteran critical limb ischemia population and investigate whether an increased COVID-19 comorbidity burden exists for AA veterans presenting for major non-traumatic amputation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VASQIP database was queried for all above knee amputation (AKA) and below knee amputation (BKA) completed 1999–2018 after IRB approval (MIRB:#02507). Patient race and ECDC-RF including male gender, age > 60 years, smoking status, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were recorded from preoperative patient history. AKA and BKA cohorts were compared via χ(2)-test with Yates correction or unpaired t-test and a subgroup analysis was conducted between AA and all other race patients for COVID-19 comorbidities in each cohort. RESULTS: VASQIP query returned 50,083 total entries. Average age was 65.1 ± 10.4 years and 68.2 ± 10.5 years for BKA and AKA cohorts, respectively, (P < .0001) and nearly all patients were male (99%). At least one ECDC-RF comorbidity was present in 25,526 (88.7%) of BKA and 17,558 (82.4%) of AKA patients (P < .0001). AA BKA patients were significantly more likely than non-AA BKA patients to present with at least one ECDC-RF comorbidity (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: According to a large national Veterans Affairs database, there are high rates of ECDC-RF in veteran amputees. During the present crisis, management of these patients should incorporate telehealth, expedient discharge, and ongoing COVID-19 transmission precautions.","Dittman, James M; Tse, Wayne; Amendola, Michael F",Mil Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601682/,242

This study aims to describe the clinical course of COVID-19 in children with kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication and to assess disease severity. METHODS: Cross-sectional study hosted by the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network and supported by the European, Asian and International paediatric nephrology societies. Anonymised data were submitted online for any child (age <20 years) with COVID-19 taking immunosuppressive medication for a kidney condition. Study recruited for 16 weeks from 15 March 2020 to 05 July 2020. The primary outcome was severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: 113 children were reported in this study from 30 different countries. Median age: 13 years (49% male). Main underlying reasons for immunosuppressive therapy: kidney transplant (47%), nephrotic syndrome (27%), systemic lupus erythematosus (10%). Immunosuppressive medications used include: glucocorticoids (76%), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (54%), tacrolimus/ciclosporine A (58%), rituximab/ofatumumab (11%). 78% required no respiratory support during COVID-19 illness, 5% required bi-level positive airway pressure or ventilation. Four children died; all deaths reported were from low-income countries with associated comorbidities. There was no significant difference in severity of COVID-19 based on gender, dialysis status, underlying kidney condition, and type or number of immunosuppressive medications. CONCLUSIONS: This global study shows most children with a kidney disease taking immunosuppressive medication have mild disease with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We therefore suggest that children on immunosuppressive therapy should not be more strictly isolated than children who are not on immunosuppressive therapy.","Marlais, Matko; Wlodkowski, Tanja; Al-Akash, Samhar; Ananin, Petr; Bandi, Varun Kumar; Baudouin, Veronique; Boyer, Olivia; Vásquez, Luciola; Govindan, Sukanya; Hooman, Nakysa; Ijaz, Iftikhar; Loza, Reyner; Melgosa, Marta; Pande, Nivedita; Pape, Lars; Saha, Anshuman; Samsonov, Dmitry; Schreuder, Michiel F; Sharma, Jyoti; Siddiqui, Sahar; Sinha, Rajiv; Stewart, Heather; Tasic, Velibor; Tönshoff, Burkhard; Twombley, Katherine; Upadhyay, Kiran; Vivarelli, Marina; Weaver, Donald J; Woroniecki, Robert; Schaefer, Franz; Tullus, Kjell",Arch Dis Child,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2020-320616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355203/,242

Government aid during the Great Recession was aimed primarily at restoring the status quo. In the current deeper crisis, aid should be designed to create a fairer, more inclusive and more socially responsible economy by promoting employee ownership as both an incentive and a reward.

683156,Psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 during disease outbreak: prevalence and associated biopsychosocial risk factors,2020-05-11,"Background: We evaluated measures to protect healthcare workers (HCWs) in Vancouver, Canada, where variants of concern (VOC) went from <1% in February 2021 to >92% in mid-May. Canada has amongst the longest periods between vaccine doses worldwide, despite Vancouver having the highest P.1 variant rate outside Brazil. Methods: With surveillance data since the pandemic began, we tracked laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections, positivity rates, and vaccine uptake in all 25,558 HCWs in Vancouver Coastal Health, by occupation and subsector, and compared to the general population. We employed Cox regression modelling adjusted for age and calendar-time to calculate vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 in fully vaccinated ([≥] 7 days post-second dose), partially vaccinated (14 days post vaccine) and unvaccinated HCWs; we also compared with unvaccinated community members of the same age-range. Findings: Only 3.3% of our HCWs became infected, mirroring community rates, with peak positivity of 9.1%, compared to 11.8% in the community. As vaccine coverage increased, SARS-CoV-2 infections declined significantly in HCWs, despite a surge with predominantly VOC; unvaccinated HCWs had an infection rate of 1.3/10,000 person-days compared to 0.89 for HCWs post first dose, and 0.30 for fully vaccinated HCWs. VE compared to unvaccinated HCWs was 37.2% (95% CI: 16.6-52.7%) 14 days post-first dose, 79.2% (CI: 64.6-87.8%) 7 days post-second dose; one dose provided significant protection against infection until at least day 42. Compared with community infection rates, VE after one dose was 54.7% (CI: 44.8-62.9%); and 84.8% (CI: 75.2-90.7%) when fully vaccinated. Interpretation: Predominantly droplet-contact precautions, with N95s required for aerosol generating medical procedures and available as needed according to point-of-care risk assessment, has been a highly effective approach to preventing occupational infection in HCWs, with one dose of mRNA vaccination further reducing infection risk despite VOC and transmissibility concerns. Delaying second doses to allow more widespread vaccination against severe disease, with strict public health, occupational health and infection control measures, has been effective in protecting the healthcare workforce.","Yassi, A.; Grant, J.

We studied protein modifications such as mutating functional sites, changing secretion potential, and altering protein conformation, which could improve the safety and/or potency of mRNA-based influenza virus vaccines. Mice were vaccinated intradermally with wild-type or mutant constructs of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein 2 (M2), nucleoprotein (NP), or matrix protein 1 (M1). Membrane-bound HA constructs elicited more potent and protective antibody responses than secreted forms. Altering the catalytic site of NA to reduce enzymatic activity decreased reactogenicity while protective immunity was maintained. Disruption of M2 ion channel activity improved immunogenicity and protective efficacy. A comparison of internal proteins NP and M1 revealed the superiority of NP in conferring protection from influenza virus challenge. These findings support the use of the nucleoside-modified mRNA platform for guided antigen design for influenza virus with extension to other pathogens.","Freyn, Alec W.; Pine, Matthew; Rosado, Victoria C.; Benz, Marcel; Muramatsu, Hiromi; Beattie, Mitchell; Tam, Ying K.; Krammer, Florian; Palese, Peter; Nachbagauer, Raffael; McMahon, Meagan; Pardi, Norbert",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485597/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2021.06.003,242

The clinical features of COVID-19 are heterogeneous and subtle in many cases. They may easily be overlooked in the case of other acute diseases. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 is able to enter gastrointestinal epithelial cells. However, these complaints can also be caused by a COVID-19-independent concomitant abdominal pathology. Therefore, patients with acute abdominal pain and fever need to be assessed very thoroughly. Based on a clinical case, we present our approach of managing emergency patients with acute abdomen and concomitant suspicion of ­COVID-19.","Kühn, Florian; Klein, Matthias; Laven, Henning; Börner, Nikolaus; Weinberger, Tobias; Streitparth, Florian; Werner, Jens; Schiergens, Tobias S.",Visc Med,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173797/,242

The relationship between clinical characteristics and antibody response to COVID‐19 is not well defined. We investigated predictors of convalescent antibody production and quantified recipient antibody response in a convalescent plasma therapy clinical trial. METHODS: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID‐19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed‐effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID‐19. RESULTS: Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti‐receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti‐spike). Higher anti‐RBD and anti‐spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID‐19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05). Fatigue was significantly associated with anti‐RBD (P = 0.03). In pairwise comparison amongst ABO blood types, AB donors had higher anti‐RBD and anti‐spike than O donors (P < 0.05). No toxicity was associated with plasma transfusion. Non‐ECMO recipient anti‐RBD antibody titre increased on average 31% per day during the first three days post‐transfusion (P = 0.01) and anti‐spike antibody titre by 40.3% (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, fever, absence of myalgia, fatigue, blood type and hospitalization were associated with higher convalescent antibody titre to COVID‐19. Despite variability in donor titre, 80% of convalescent plasma recipients showed significant increase in antibody levels post‐transfusion. A more complete understanding of the dose‐response effect of plasma transfusion amongst COVID‐19‐infected patients is needed.","Madariaga, M. L. L.; Guthmiller, J. J.; Schrantz, S.; Jansen, M.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the performance of a protocol for ambulatory management of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia regarding readmissions, admission into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and deaths. Also, to identify unfavorable prognostic factors that increase the risk of readmission. This is a prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia discharged from the emergency ward of Infanta Cristina Hospital (Madrid, Spain) that met the criteria of the hospital protocol for outpatient management. We describe outcomes of those patients and compare those who needed readmission versus those who did not. We use logistic regression to explore factors associated with readmissions. A total of 314 patients were included, of which 20 (6.4%) needed readmission, and none needed ICU admission nor died. At least one comorbidity was present in 29.9% of patients. Hypertension, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and increased aminotransferases were all associated with a higher risk of readmission. A clinical course of 10 days or longer, and an absolute eosinophil count over 200/µL were associated with a lower risk. After the multivariate analysis, only hypertension (OR 4.99, CI 1.54–16.02), temperature over 38 °C in the emergency ward (OR 9.03, CI 1.89–45.77), leukopenia (OR 4.92, CI 1.42–17.11) and increased LDH (OR 6.62, CI 2.82–19.26) remained significantly associated with readmission. Outpatient management of patients with low-risk COVID-19 pneumonia is safe, if adequately selected.

We studied longitudinal cohorts of naive individuals and disease-recovered patients for up to 2 months after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. We assessed the quality of the memory response by analysis of VDJ repertoires, affinity and neutralization against variants of concern (VOCs), using unbiased cultures of 2452 MBCs. Upon boosting, the MBC pool of recovered patients selectively expanded, further matured and harbored potent neutralizers against VOCs. Although naïve individuals had weaker neutralizing serum responses, half of their RBD-specific MBCs displayed high affinity towards multiple VOCs, including delta (B.1.617.2), and one-third retained neutralizing potency against beta (B.1.351). Our data suggest that an additional challenge in naive vaccinees could recall such affinity-matured MBCs and allow them to respond efficiently to VOCs.","Sokal, Aurélien; Barba-Spaeth, Giovanna; Fernández, Ignacio; Broketa, Matteo; Azzaoui, Imane; de La Selle, Andrea; Vandenberghe, Alexis; Fourati, Slim; Roeser, Anais; Meola, Annalisa; Bouvier-Alias, Magali; Crickx, Etienne; Languille, Laetitia; Michel, Marc; Godeau, Bertrand; Gallien, Sébastien; Melica, Giovanna; Nguyen, Yann; Zarrouk, Virginie; Canoui-Poitrine, Florence; Noizat-Pirenne, France; Megret, Jérôme; Pawlotsky, Jean-Michel; Fillatreau, Simon; Bruhns, Pierre; Rey, Felix A.; Weill, Jean-Claude; Reynaud, Claude-Agnès; Chappert, Pascal; Mahévas, Matthieu",Immunity,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321003964; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321003964?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.09.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34614412/,242

The provision of trauma care has been substandard in England and Wales prior to the implementation of an inclusive major trauma network system in London in 2010 and subsequently across the rest of England two years later. The implementation of the London trauma system has brought about improvements to the delivery of trauma care by decreasing the overall morbidity and mortality significantly. This framework encompasses the collaboration of emergency services, designated Major Trauma Centres (MTCs), Trauma Units (TUs) and community providers which have been optimized with the expertise and resources to provide the best outcomes for major trauma patients. Specific triage protocols, consultant-led trauma service and on-the-spot access to radiology services and operating theatres have played a pivotal role in the improvement of trauma care. In spite of several strengths, however, the London major trauma network system is by no means without its limitations. The emergence of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created major barriers to the smooth running of trauma services by exhausting resources due to infection control measures, reduced theatre space and re-deployment of medical staffs. In addition, the cancellation of elective surgeries has impacted directly on the training of surgical trainees by leaving them with significantly reduced surgical exposure. As a results of this ever changing surgical landscape, a need to urgently review these traditional surgical training methods with a view to modernize the curriculum. Although the London trauma system has evolved significantly since its implementation, its limitations should be recognized and addressed to enhance performance and improve patient outcomes.","Beeharry, Mohammad Waseem; Moqeem, Komal",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.12000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33324530/,242

The aim of this study was to quantify the effects on physical activity (PA) levels using data from the prospective Triage-HF Plus Evaluation study. METHODS: This study represents a cohort of adult patients with implanted cardiac devices capable of measuring activity by embedded accelerometery via a remote monitoring platform. Activity data were available for the 4 weeks pre-implementation and post implementation of ‘stay at home’ lockdown measures in the form of ‘minutes active per day’ (min/day). RESULTS: Data were analysed for 311 patients (77.2% men, mean age 68.8, frailty 55.9%. 92.2% established heart failure (HF) diagnosis, of these 51.2% New York Heart Association II), with comorbidities representative of a real-world cohort. Post-lockdown, a significant reduction in median PA equating to 20.8 active min/day was seen. The reduction was uniform with a slightly more pronounced drop in PA for women, but no statistically significant difference with respect to age, body mass index, frailty or device type. Activity dropped in the immediate 2-week period post-lockdown, but steadily returned thereafter. Median activity week 4 weeks post-lockdown remained significantly lower than 4 weeks pre-lockdown (p≤0.001).

In proliferating mammalian cells, a canonical dilysine motif at the C-terminus of Sac1 is required for coatomer complex-I (COP-I)-binding and continuous retrieval to the ER. Starvation triggers accumulation of Sac1 at the Golgi. The mechanism responsible for Golgi retention of Sac1 is unknown. Here we show that the first of the two transmembrane regions in human SAC1 (TM1) functions in Golgi localization. A minimal construct containing only TM1 and the adjacent flanking sequences is concentrated at the Golgi. Transplanting TM1 into transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) induces Golgi accumulation of this normally plasma membrane and endosomal protein, indicating that TM1 is sufficient for Golgi localization. In addition, we determined that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SAC1 also promotes Golgi localization, even when TM1 is mutated or absent. We conclude that the distribution of SAC1 within the Golgi is controlled via both passive membrane thickness-dependent partitioning of TM1 and a retention mechanism that requires the N-terminal cytoplasmic region.","Wang, Jinzhi; Chen, Juxing; Enns, Caroline A.; Mayinger, Peter",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23936490/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071112,242

The model incorporates a plethora of distinct trade measures, which is particularly important in the pandemic, as PPEs and other essential products are in high demand, but short in supply globally. In the model, product flows as well as prices at the supply markets and the demand markets in different countries are variables that allows us to seamlessly introduce various trade measures, including tariffs, quotas, as well as price floors and ceilings.

Methods: We used whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences derived from ten European regions belonging to eight countries to perform phylogenetic and phylodynamic analysis. We developed dedicated bioinformatics pipelines to identify regional MTCs and to assess demographic factors potentially associated with their formation. Results: The total number and the scale of MTCs varied from small household clusters identified in all regions, to a super-spreading event found in Uusimaa-FI. Specific age groups were more likely to belong to MTCs in different regions. The clustered sequences referring to the age groups 50–100 years old (y.o.) were increased in all regions two weeks after the establishment of the lockdown, while those referring to the age group 0–19 y.o. decreased only in those regions where schools’ closure was combined with a lockdown. Conclusions: The spatiotemporal profiling of the SARS-CoV-2 MTCs can be a useful tool to monitor the effectiveness of the interventions and to reveal cryptic transmissions that have not been identified through contact tracing.","Bousali, Maria; Dimadi, Aristea; Kostaki, Evangelia-Georgia; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K.; Sgouras, Dionyssios N.; Magiorkinis, Gkikas; Papatheodoridis, George; Pogka, Vasiliki; Lourida, Giota; Argyraki, Aikaterini; Angelakis, Emmanouil; Sourvinos, George; Beloukas, Apostolos; Paraskevis, Dimitrios; Karamitros, Timokratis",Life (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/life11030219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33803490/,242
687836,CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in ICU-patients,2021,"The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a conserved step in animal development, where control is passed from the maternal to the zygotic genome. Although the MZT is typically considered from its impact on the transcriptome, we previously found that three maternally deposited Drosophila RNA-binding proteins (ME31B, Trailer Hitch [TRAL], and Cup) are also cleared during the MZT by unknown mechanisms. Here, we show that these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Marie Kondo, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and the E3 CTLH ligase are required for the destruction of ME31B, TRAL, and Cup. Structure modeling of the Drosophila CTLH complex suggests that substrate recognition is different than orthologous complexes. Despite occurring hours earlier, egg activation mediates clearance of these proteins through the Pan Gu kinase, which stimulates translation of Kdo mRNA. Clearance of the maternal protein dowry thus appears to be a coordinated, but as-yet underappreciated, aspect of the MZT.","Zavortink, Michael; Rutt, Lauren N; Dzitoyeva, Svetlana; Henriksen, Jesslyn C; Barrington, Chloe; Bilodeau, Danielle Y; Wang, Miranda; Chen, Xiao Xiao Lily; Rissland, Olivia S",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.53889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32573431/,242

Often, extrapulmonary manifestations occur simultaneously with pulmonary disease. However, there is a paucity of literature describing the cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 in the absence of pulmonary findings. We report a rare case of acute pericarditis presenting with pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in a 43-year-old man diagnosed with COVID-19.

A 3D turbulence model was used to simulate the airflow in the classroom, and a Lagrangian particle trajectory analysis method was used to track the droplets. The numerical model was validated and was used to study the effects of ventilation airflow speeds of 3, 5, and 7 m/s on the dispersion of droplets of different sizes. In particular, the effect of installing transparent barriers in front of the seats on reducing the average droplet concentration was examined. The results showed that using the seat partitions for individuals can prevent the infection to a certain extent. An increase in the ventilation air velocity increased the droplets’ velocities in the airflow direction, simultaneously reducing the trapping time of the droplets by solid barriers. As expected, in the absence of partitions, the closest seats to the infected person had the highest average droplet concentration (3.80 × 10(−8) kg/m(3) for the case of 3 m/s).","Mirzaie, Mahshid; Lakzian, Esmail; Khan, Afrasyab; Warkiani, Majid Ebrahimi; Mahian, Omid; Ahmadi, Goodarz",J Hazard Mater,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34273880/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421015521?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389421015521; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126587,242
688787,Diabetic Ketoacidosis Complicated by a Brain Death,2020-06-29,"COVID-19 is an infection induced by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and severe forms can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. Severe forms are associated with coagulation changes, mainly characterized by an increase in D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, with a higher risk of thrombosis, particularly pulmonary embolism. The impact of obesity in severe COVID-19 has also been highlighted. In this context, standard doses of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be inadequate in ICU patients, with obesity, major inflammation, and hypercoagulability. We therefore urgently developed proposals on the prevention of thromboembolism and monitoring of hemostasis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Four levels of thromboembolic risk were defined according to the severity of COVID-19 reflected by oxygen requirement and treatment, the body mass index, and other risk factors. Monitoring of hemostasis (including fibrinogen and D-dimer levels) every 48 h is proposed. Standard doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/24 h SC) are proposed in case of intermediate thrombotic risk (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), no other risk factors and no ARDS). In all obese patients (high thrombotic risk), adjusted prophylaxis with intermediate doses of LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin 4000 IU/12 h SC or 6000 IU/12 h SC if weight > 120 kg), or unfractionated heparin (UFH) if renal insufficiency (200 IU/kg/24 h, IV), is proposed. The thrombotic risk was defined as very high in obese patients with ARDS and added risk factors for thromboembolism, and also in case of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), unexplained catheter thrombosis, dialysis filter thrombosis, or marked inflammatory syndrome and/or hypercoagulability (e.g., fibrinogen > 8 g/l and/or D-dimers > 3 μg/ml). In ICU patients, it is sometimes difficult to confirm a diagnosis of thrombosis, and curative anticoagulant treatment may also be discussed on a probabilistic basis. In all these situations, therapeutic doses of LMWH, or UFH in case of renal insufficiency with monitoring of anti-Xa activity, are proposed. In conclusion, intensification of heparin treatment should be considered in the context of COVID-19 on the basis of clinical and biological criteria of severity, especially in severely ill ventilated patients, for whom the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism cannot be easily confirmed.","Susen, Sophie; Tacquard, Charles Ambroise; Godon, Alexandre; Mansour, Alexandre; Garrigue, Delphine; Nguyen, Philippe; Godier, Anne; Testa, Sophie; Levy, Jerrold H.; Albaladejo, Pierre; Gruel, Yves",Crit Care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-020-03000-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32560658/,242

A large number of papers have used epidemiological models to argue that inflow restrictions are unlikely to be effective. We conduct a mathematical analysis using a simple epidemiological model and perform simulations which show how this conclusion changes if we relax the assumption of unlimited capacity in containment efforts such as contact tracing. In particular, when contact tracing is effective, but the system is close to being overwhelmed, moderate travel restrictions can have a very large effect on the probability of an epidemic.","Malmberg, Hannes; Britton, Tom",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050401,242

In Brazil many are discussing the best way to manage the opening of the quarantine under the constraints of hospitals infrastructure. In this work we implement a forecast of the demand for hospital beds for the next 30 days for every state in Brazil for different quarantine flexibilization scenarios and analyse how long it would take for the demand to exceed current available hospital beds.","Silva, H.

We use German survey data to provide novel evidence on short- and long-run effects of an exogenous shock on paternal availability, through a job loss, on the intra-household allocation of domestic work. We find that paternal child care and housework significantly increase in the short run on weekdays, while we do not see any similar shifts on weekends. Effects are positive and persistent for fathers who remain unemployed or have a working partner, but reverse after re-employment. We also find significant changes for female partners as well as in cumulative household time investments and outsourcing of tasks. Our results are in line with theoretical predictions regarding time availability and financial constraints, while we find no strong evidence for changes in bargaining powers, gender role attitudes or emotional bonding.","Hennecke, Juliane; Pape, Astrid",Rev Econ Househ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11150-021-09582-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34466136/,242

A retrospective cross-sectional study was designed with the aim to evaluate psychiatric emergencies from March 14 to May 1, 2020, coinciding with the start of the emergency state and the lockdown until the attenuation of the confinement. Data obtained during this period were compared with the emergencies attended in the same period of 2019. A total of 213 psychiatric emergencies were attended in 2020 compared with 367 in 2019. The mean number of emergencies per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 (M=4.35, SD= 2.04) vs. the same period in 2019 (M=7.50, SD= 3.18). A higher percentage of patients with schizo/psychotic disorders (34.3% in 2020, vs. 24.3% in 2019), as well as a lower percentage of patients with anxiety/adaptive disorders (25.4% in 2020 vs. 35.4% in 2019) was observed during the outbreak.
