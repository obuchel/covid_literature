Previously a method for conjugation of small molecules to glycoproteins through existing glycans by using an engineered glycotransferase and a chemically reactive sugar as a handle was developed. Here, for the first time, we report the use of this method with some modifications to generate an ADC from a monoclonal antibody, m860, which we identified from a human naïve phage display Fab library by panning against the extracellular domain of human HER2. M860 bound to cell surface-associated HER2 with affinity comparable to that of Trastuzumab (Herceptin), but to a different epitope. The m860ADC was generated by enzymatically adding a reactive keto-galactose to m860 using an engineered glycotransferase and conjugating the reactive m860 to aminooxy auristatin F. It exhibited potent and specific cell-killing activity against HER2 positive cancer cells, including trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells. This unique ADC may have utility as a potential therapeutic for HER2 positive cancers alone or in combination with other drugs. Our results also validate the keto-galactose/engineered glycotransferase method for generation of functional ADCs, which could potentially also be used for preparation of ADCs targeting other disease markers.","Zhu, Zhongyu; Ramakrishnan, Boopathy; Li, Jinyu; Wang, Yanping; Feng, Yang; Prabakaran, Ponraj; Colantonio, Simona; Dyba, Marzena A; Qasba, Pradman K; Dimitrov, Dimiter S",mAbs,918,19

Surgical patients are vulnerable to the infection during their hospital admission. Some surgical procedures are classified as aerosol generating (AGP). METHODS: Retrospective observational study in a tertiary healthcare centre of four specialities associate with known AGP's during the four months of the first wave of UK COVID-19 epidermic to identify post-surgical cross infection with SARSCoV-2 within 14 days of a procedure. RESULTS: There were 3410 procedures reported during this period. The overall cross infection rate from tested patients was 1.3% (4 patients), i.e., 0.11% of all operations over 4 months. Ear, nose, and throat carried slightly higher rate of infection (0.4%) than gastroenterology (0.08%). The mortality rate was 0.3% (one gastroenterology patient from 304 positive cases) compared to 0% if surgery performed after recovery from SARSCoV-2 and 37.5% when surgery was conducted during the incubation period of the disease. Routine preoperative rapid screening tests and self-isolation is crucial to avoid the risk of cross infection. Patients with underlying malignancy or receiving chemotherapy were more prone to pulmonary complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of SARS-COV-2 cross infection after surgical procedure is very low. Preoperative screening and self-isolation together with personal protective measures should be in place to minimize the cross infection. This article is protected by copyright.

Methods: An anonymous open web-based survey study was conducted among healthcare workers from the March 2020 to April 2020. A total of 24 relevant questions were asked based on participants' characteristics, obligations, and preparedness in healthcare workers in the event of COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Approximately 1036 healthcare workers participated in this study with high response rate. Out of all the participants, 70% were women, 52% belonged to the 26-34 year age range, 50% were nurses, 33.7% were clinicians, 74.3% agreed to work overtime, 93.1% understand why they should stay past their shift end, 97.7% thought that preventing illness among healthcare workers and providing safety to family members, nearly 94% thought that personal protective equipment (PPE) for employees will enhance their willingness to report to work. Approximately 89.3% express a desire for incentives and financial support for family members. Conclusion: We recommend that providing PPE, reducing psychological stress, financial support and safety to family members of healthcare workers will increase the willingness to report to work.","Almaghrabi, Rana H; Alfaraidi, Huda A; Al Hebshi, Wejdan A; Albaadani, Mohammed M",Saudi Med J,918,24

As a result of the COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, however, banks face considerable uncertainty about the potential scale of the bad debts for which they will need to provide. Banks need to reassess their loan assets, by updating their risk models with expectations about potential default rates and future macro-economic and financial developments. However, we see several interventions worldwide. The European Securities and Markets Authority addresses a position paper on the prudential application of IFRS 9. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act in the US has given banks an optional deferral of implementation of the CECL model until 31 December 2020. This paper addresses the challenges banks face when applying the expected losses model during the current crisis. More importantly, it discusses the impact of supervisor and regulators’ intervention on future financial reporting comparability, transparency and whether there is a level playing field.","Barnoussi, Aziz el; Howieson, Bryan; van Beest, Ferdy",Aust.
