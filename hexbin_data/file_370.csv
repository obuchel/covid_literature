2740,What is a Hotspot Anyway?,2017-06-07,"The importance of spatial clusters, or “hotspots,” in infectious disease epidemiology has been increasingly recognized, and targeting hotspots is often seen as an important component of disease-control strategies. However, the precise meaning of “hotspot” varies widely in current research and policy documents. Hotspots have been variously described as areas of elevated incidence or prevalence, higher transmission efficiency or risk, or higher probability of disease emergence. This ambiguity has led to confusion and may result in mistaken inferences regarding the best way to target interventions. We surveyed the literature on epidemiologic hotspots, examining the multitude of ways in which the term is used; and highlight the difference in the geographic scale of hotspots and the properties they are supposed to have. In response to the diversity in the term's usage, we advocate the use of more precise terms, such as “burden hotspot,” “transmission hotspot,” and “emergence hotspot,” as well as explicit specification of the spatiotemporal scale of interest. Increased precision in terminology is needed to ensure clear and effective policies for disease control.","Lessler, Justin; Azman, Andrew S.; McKay, Heather S.; Moore, Sean M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5462559/,370
4473,Prevalence of Group A Streptococcus in Primary Care Patients and the Utility of C-Reactive Protein and Clinical Scores for Its Identification in Thailand,2019-12-30,"The activation of somatic mutations conferring sensitivity to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been widely used in the development of advanced or metastatic primary lung cancer therapy. Therefore, identification of EGFR mutations is essential. In the present study, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was used to identify EGFR mutations, and its efficiency was compared with the Therascreen quantitative PCR assay. Using LAMP and Therascreen to analyze surgically resected tissue samples from patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma, EGFR mutations were observed in 32/59 tumor samples (LAMP) and 33/59 tumor samples (Therascreen). Notably, the LAMP assay identified one tumor as wild-type, which had previously been identified as a deletion mutation in exon 19 via the Therascreen assay (Case X). However, the direct sequencing to confirm the EGFR status of the Case X adhered to the results of the LAMP assay. Further experiments using Case X DNA identified this exon 19 deletion mutation using both methods. In addition, a novel deletion mutation in exon 19 of the EGFR was identified. Overall, the present study shows that the LAMP method may serve as a valuable alternative for the identification oncogene mutations.","Horiuchi, Sho; Saito, Yuichi; Matsui, Atsuka; Takahashi, Nobumasa; Ikeya, Tomohiko; Hoshi, Eishin; Shimizu, Yoshihiko; Yasuda, Masanori",Int J Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7010225/,370

12834,Evaluating the Effectiveness of an Intervention Integrating Technology and In-Person Sexual Health Education for Adolescents (In the Know): Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial,2020-08-07,"The heavy impact of obesity on both the population general health and the economy makes clarifying the underlying mechanisms, identifying pharmacological targets, and developing efficient therapies for obesity of high importance. The main struggle facing obesity research is that the underlying mechanistic pathways are yet to be fully revealed. This limits both our understanding of pathogenesis and therapeutic progress toward treating the obesity epidemic. The current anti-obesity approaches are mainly a controlled diet and exercise which could have limitations. For instance, the “classical” anti-obesity approach of exercise might not be practical for patients suffering from disabilities that prevent them from routine exercise. Therefore, therapeutic alternatives are urgently required. Within this context, pharmacological agents could be relatively efficient in association to an adequate diet that remains the most efficient approach in such situation. Herein, we put a spotlight on potential therapeutic targets for obesity identified following differential genes expression-based studies aiming to find genes that are differentially expressed under diverse conditions depending on physical activity and diet (mainly high-fat), two key factors influencing obesity development and prognosis. Such functional genomics approaches contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that both control obesity development and switch the genetic, biochemical, and metabolic pathways toward a specific energy balance phenotype. It is important to clarify that by “gene-related pathways”, we refer to genes, the corresponding proteins and their potential receptors, the enzymes and molecules within both the cells in the intercellular space, that are related to the activation, the regulation, or the inactivation of the gene or its corresponding protein or pathways. We believe that this emerging area of functional genomics-related exploration will not only lead to novel mechanisms but also new applications and implications along with a new generation of treatments for obesity and the related metabolic disorders especially with the modern advances in pharmacological drug targeting and functional genomics techniques.","Ghanemi, Abdelaziz; Melouane, Aicha; Yoshioka, Mayumi; St-Amand, Jonny",Genes (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7463441/,370

14291,REMOTION Blended Transdiagnostic Intervention for Symptom Reduction and Improvement of Emotion Regulation in an Outpatient Psychotherapeutic Setting: Protocol for a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND: Many older adults choose to live independently in their homes for as long as possible, despite psychosocial and medical conditions that compromise their independence in daily living and safety. Faced with unprecedented challenges in allocating resources, home care administrators are increasingly open to using monitoring technologies known as ambient assisted living (AAL) to better support care recipients. To be effective, these technologies should be able to report clinically relevant changes to support decision making at an individual level. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the concurrent validity of AAL monitoring reports and information gathered by care professionals using triangulation. METHODS: This longitudinal single-case study spans over 490 days of monitoring a 90-year-old woman with Alzheimer disease receiving support from local health care services. A clinical nurse in charge of her health and social care was interviewed 3 times during the project. Linear mixed models for repeated measures were used to analyze each daily activity (ie, sleep, outing activities, periods of low mobility, cooking-related activities, hygiene-related activities). Significant changes observed in data from monitoring reports were compared with information gathered by the care professional to explore concurrent validity. RESULTS: Over time, the monitoring reports showed evolving trends in the care recipient’s daily activities. Significant activity changes occurred over time regarding sleep, outings, cooking, mobility, and hygiene-related activities. Although the nurse observed some trends, the monitoring reports highlighted information that the nurse had not yet identified. Most trends detected in the monitoring reports were consistent with the clinical information gathered by the nurse. In addition, the AAL system detected changes in daily trends following an intervention specific to meal preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, trends identified by AAL monitoring are consistent with clinical reports. They help answer the nurse’s questions and help the nurse develop interventions to maintain the care recipient at home. These findings suggest the vast potential of AAL technologies to support health care services and aging in place by providing valid and clinically relevant information over time regarding activities of daily living. Such data are essential when other sources yield incomplete information for decision making.","Lussier, Maxime; Aboujaoudé, Aline; Couture, Mélanie; Moreau, Maxim; Laliberté, Catherine; Giroux, Sylvain; Pigot, Hélène; Gaboury, Sébastien; Bouchard, Kévin; Belchior, Patricia; Bottari, Carolina; Paré, Guy; Consel, Charles; Bier, Nathalie",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7695528/,370

An efficient C–H esterification of indoles with CO and alcohols has been reported in which the high reactivity and the exclusive C7-selectivity derives from the selection of a P(III)–directing group and the utilization of benzoquinone as an external oxidant with palladium catalysis. This strategy shows many advantages, involving an easily accessible and removable directing group, the use of cheap carbonylation sources, a broad substrate scope, and excellent positional selectivity.

Therefore, proper treatment of diarrhea represents a therapeutic challenge in livestock production and public health concerns. Here, we describe the ability of a fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), to ameliorate diarrhea and restore gut microbial composition in 57 growing calves. We conduct multi-omics analysis of 450 longitudinally collected fecal samples and find that FMT-induced alterations in the gut microbiota (an increase in the family Porphyromonadaceae) and metabolomic profile (a reduction in fecal amino acid concentration) strongly correlate with the remission of diarrhea. During the continuous follow-up study over 24 months, we find that FMT improves the growth performance of the cattle. This first FMT trial in ruminants suggest that FMT is capable of ameliorating diarrhea in pre-weaning calves with alterations in their gut microbiota, and that FMT may have a potential role in the improvement of growth performance.","Kim, Hyun Sik; Whon, Tae Woong; Sung, Hojun; Jeong, Yun-Seok; Jung, Eun Sung; Shin, Na-Ri; Hyun, Dong-Wook; Kim, Pil Soo; Lee, June-Young; Lee, Choong Hwan; Bae, Jin-Woo",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7794225/,370
14771,Calming Troubled Waters: A Narrative Review of Challenges and Potential Solutions in the Residency Interview Offer Process,2020-12-14,"Intracellular antibodies are valuable tools for target validation studies for clinical situations such as cancer. Recently we have shown that antibodies can be used for drug discovery in screening for chemical compounds surrogates by showing that compounds could be developed to the so-called undruggable RAS protein family. This method, called Antibody-derived compound (Abd) technology, employed intracellular antibodies binding to RAS in a competitive surface plasmon resonance chemical library screen. Success with this method requires a high affinity interaction between the antibody and the target. We now show that reduction in the affinity (dematuration) of the anti-active RAS antibody facilitates the screening of a chemical library using an in vitro AlphaScreen method. This identified active RAS specific-binding Abd compounds that inhibit the RAS-antibody interaction. One compound is shown to be a pan-RAS binder to KRAS, HRAS and NRAS-GTP proteins with a Kd of average 37 mM, offering the possibility of a new chemical series that interacts with RAS in the switch region where the intracellular antibody binds. This simple approach shows the druggability of RAS and is generally applicable to antibody-derived chemical library screening by affording flexibility through simple antibody affinity variation. This approach can be applied to find Abd compounds as surrogates of antibody-combining sites for novel drug development in a range of human diseases.","Tanaka, Tomoyuki; Thomas, Jemima; Van Montfort, Rob; Miller, Ami; Rabbitts, Terry",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814043/,370

16821,Healer-led vs. clinician-led training to improve personal protective equipment use among traditional healers in South Africa: a randomized controlled trial protocol,2021-04-02,"The folate and methionine cycles, constituting one-carbon metabolism, are critical pathways for cell survival. Intersecting these two cycles, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) directs one-carbon units from the folate to methionine cycle, to be exclusively used for methionine and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) synthesis. MTHFR deficiency and upregulation result in diverse disease states, rendering it an attractive drug target. The activity of MTHFR is inhibited by the binding of AdoMet to an allosteric regulatory domain distal to the enzyme’s active site, which we have previously identified to constitute a novel fold with a druggable pocket. Here, we screened 162 AdoMet mimetics using differential scanning fluorimetry, and identified 4 compounds that stabilized this regulatory domain. Three compounds were sinefungin analogues, closely related to AdoMet and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy). The strongest thermal stabilisation was provided by (S)-SKI-72, a potent inhibitor originally developed for protein arginine methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4). Using surface plasmon resonance, we confirmed that (S)-SKI-72 binds MTHFR via its allosteric domain with nanomolar affinity. Assay of MTHFR activity in the presence of (S)-SKI-72 demonstrates inhibition of purified enzyme with sub-micromolar potency and endogenous MTHFR from HEK293 cell lysate in the low micromolar range, both of which are lower than AdoMet. Nevertheless, unlike AdoMet, (S)-SKI-72 is unable to completely abolish MTHFR activity, even at very high concentrations. Combining binding assays, kinetic characterization and compound docking, this work indicates the regulatory domain of MTHFR can be targeted by small molecules and presents (S)-SKI-72 as an excellent candidate for development of MTHFR inhibitors.","Bezerra, Gustavo A.; Holenstein, Alexander; Foster, William R.; Xie, Bing; Hicks, Kevin G.; Bürer, Céline; Lutz, Seraina; Mukherjee, Ayan; Sarkar, Dipika; Bhattacharya, Debomita; Rutter, Jared; Talukdar, Arindam; Brown, Peter J.; Luo, Minkui; Shi, Lei; Froese, D.

16836,"Twelve-Year Longitudinal Trends in Trachoma Prevalence among Children Aged 1–9 Years in Amhara, Ethiopia, 2007–2019",2021-01-18,"OBJECTIVE: To validate Rowland Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), as an instrument for the screening of people with dementia and cognitive impairment in Primary Health Care (PHC). RUDAS is a brief cognitive test, appropriate for people with minimum completed level of education and easily adaptable to multicultural contexts. For these reason it could be a good instrument for dementia screening in PHC. DESIGN: Cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study with a five-year follow up. LOCATION: O Grove PHC centre, Galicia, Spain (covering a population of 10,650 individuals). OUTCOME MEASURES: RUDAS; Mini Mental State Examination; Clinical Dementia Rating; Katz, Barthel and Lawton Indexes; MMSE and Yesavage Geriatric Depression Scale. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 150 older adults (mean age 76.35 ± 7.12 years) randomly selected, from a low sociocultural and economical background and mainly rural and semirural origin. INTERVENTION: RUDAS viability in PHC was checked, and its psychometric properties assessed: reliability, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values. RESULTS: RUDAS application was brief (7.58 ± 2.10 min) and well accepted. RUDAS area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the detection of dementia was 0.983 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97-1.00) for an optimal cut-off point of 22.5, with sensitivity of 89.3%, and a specificity of 100%. Area under ROC curve for discriminating dementia from mild cognitive impairment was 0.965 (95% CI: 0.91-1.00). CONCLUSIONS: RUDAS test is fit for dementia screening in PHC and it is especially sensitive to discriminate PWD from people with MCI.","Coelho-Guimarães, Natacha; Garcia-Casal, J.

However, financial resources and scheduling conflicts make clinical AT infeasible. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap between need and accessibility, we primarily aimed to develop a mobile health (mHealth) app called Speech Banana for AT. The app would be substantially more affordable and portable than clinical AT; would deliver a validated training model that is reflective of modern techniques; and would track users’ progress in speech comprehension, providing greater continuity between periodic in-person visits. To improve international availability, our secondary aim was to implement the English language training model into Korean as a proof of concept for worldwide usability. METHODS: A problem- and objective-centered Design Science Research Methodology approach was adopted to develop the Speech Banana app. A review of previous literature and computer-based learning programs outlined current AT gaps, whereas interviews with speech pathologists and users clarified the features that were addressed in the app. Past and present users were invited to evaluate the app via community forums and the System Usability Scale. RESULTS: Speech Banana has been implemented in English and Korean languages for iPad and web use. The app comprises 38 lessons, which include analytic exercises pairing visual and auditory stimuli, and synthetic quizzes presenting auditory stimuli only. During quizzes, users type the sentence heard, and the app provides visual feedback on performance. Users may select a male or female speaker and the volume of background noise, allowing for training with a range of frequencies and signal-to-noise ratios. There were more than 3200 downloads of the English iPad app and almost 100 downloads of the Korean app; more than 100 users registered for the web apps. The English app received a System Usability Scale rating of “good” from 6 users, and the Korean app received a rating of “OK” from 16 users. CONCLUSIONS: Speech Banana offers AT accessibility with a validated curriculum, allowing users to develop speech comprehension skills with the aid of a mobile device.

Mould-active azoles are the frontline therapeutics employed to treat aspergillosis. The global emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates in clinic and environment, however, notoriously limits the therapeutic options of mould-active antifungals and potentially can be attributed to a mortality rate reaching up to 100 %. Although specific mutations in CYP51A are the main cause of azole resistance, there is a new wave of azole-resistant isolates with wild-type CYP51A genotype challenging the efficacy of the current diagnostic tools. Therefore, applications of whole-genome sequencing are increasingly gaining popularity to overcome such challenges. Prominent echinocandin tolerance, as well as liver and kidney toxicity posed by amphotericin B, necessitate a continuous quest for novel antifungal drugs to combat emerging azole-resistant A. fumigatus isolates.

18079,Baseline Mapping of Neglected Tropical Diseases in Africa: The Accelerated WHO/AFRO Mapping Project,2021-04-26,"INTRODUCTION: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic life-threatening viral infection endemic across sub-Saharan African countries and the Arabian Peninsula; however, there is a growing panic of its spread to non-endemic regions. This viral infection triggers a wide spectrum of symptoms that span from fibril illnesses to more severe symptoms such as haemorrhagic fever and encephalitis. These severe symptoms have been associated with dysregulated immune response propagated by the virulence factor, non-structural protein (NSs). Thus, this study investigates the effects of lithium on NF-κB translocation and RFVF-induced inflammation in Raw 264.7 macrophages. METHODS: The supernatant from RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 cells, treated with lithium, was examined using an ELISA assay kit to measure levels of cytokines and chemokines. The H(2)DCF-DA and DAF-2 DA florigenic assays were used to determine the levels of ROS and RNS by measuring the cellular fluorescence intensity post RVFV-infection and lithium treatment. Western blot and immunocytochemistry assays were used to measure expression levels of the inflammatory proteins and cellular location of the NF-κB, respectively. RESULTS: Lithium was shown to stimulate interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production as early as 3 h pi. Production of the secondary pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), were elevated as early as 12 h pi. Treatment with lithium stimulated increase of production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in RVFV-infected and uninfected macrophages as early as 3 h pi. The RVFV-infected cells treated with lithium displayed lower ROS and RNS production as opposed to lithium-free RVFV-infected control cells. Western blot analyses demonstrated that lithium inhibited iNOS expression while stimulating expression of heme oxygenase (HO) and IκB in RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 macrophages. Results from immunocytochemistry and Western blot assays revealed that lithium inhibits NF-κB nuclear translocation in RVFV-infected cells compared to lithium-free RVFV-infected cells and 5 mg/mL LPS controls. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that lithium inhibits NF-kB nuclear translocation and modulate inflammation profiles in RVFV-infected Raw 264.7 macrophage cells.","Makola, Raymond Tshepiso; Kgaladi, Joe; More, Garland Kgosi; Jansen van Vuren, Petrus; Paweska, Janusz Tadeusz; Matsebatlela, Thabe Moses",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8177254/,370

METHODS: In a representative sample of the population aged 15 to 33 years (N = 220) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, study nurses administered a standardized paper questionnaire consisting of predominantly open questions, collecting information on meningitis risk factors and prevention, and on exposure to dry air and kitchen fire smoke. We identified themes and analyzed their frequency. We created a meningitis knowledge score (range 0 to 4) based on pre-defined best responses and analyzed the determinants of knowledge score levels ≥2 (basic score) and ≥3 (high score) using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Biomedically supported facts and good practices were known by the majority of participants (eg vaccine prevention, 84.5%). Younger women aged 15–20 years had a higher frequency of low scores <2 (17.0%) compared to older women aged 21–33 years (6.3%) and men of both age groups (3.8%). Junior secondary School attendance explained the differences between the two groups of women, the gender gap for the older, but not the young women, and explained score differences among young women. Local understandings and practices for risk and prevention were commonly reported and used (risk from unripe mango consumption and prevention through nasal application of shea nut butter). DISCUSSION: This study shows a gender gap in knowledge of meningitis risk and prevention, largely due to education-level inequalities. Women below 21 years had particularly low levels of knowledge and may need interventions outside schools and perinatal care. Our study suggests a strong adherence to local understandings of and practices around meningitis risk and prevention, which should be taken into account by vaccination promotion.","Mueller, Judith E.; Seanehia, Joy; Yaro, Seydou; Trotter, Caroline L.; Borrow, Ray; Giles-Vernick, Tamara",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8279338/,370
20577,Clinicians’ Perspectives After Implementation of the Serious Illness Care Program: A Qualitative Study,2021-08-18,"IMPORTANCE: Educational attainment is an underrecognized factor associated with racial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Early childhood programs providing comprehensive family services can promote educational and socioeconomic success, but few, if any, studies of large-scale programs have assessed their associations with midlife CVD risk and mediating factors. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between an early childhood program providing multisystemic services from ages 3 to 9 years with midlife CVD risk and whether years of education mediate these associations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a matched-group, quasi-experimental design, a cohort of Black and Hispanic children in the Chicago Longitudinal Study enrolled in an established early childhood program from 1983 to 1989 or the usual services were followed up for 30 years after the end of the intervention. A midlife survey on well-being was administered when the participants were aged 37 years. Analyses were conducted from September 1, 2020, to October 15, 2020. INTERVENTION: The Child-Parent Center (CPC) Education Program provides school-based educational enrichment and comprehensive family services for 6 years, from ages 3 to 9 years (preschool to third grade [P-3]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: General and hard Framingham Risk Scores (FRSs) were calculated from self-reported physical health and behavior profiles in the midlife Chicago Longitudinal Study survey. Years of education completed at age 34 years were measured primarily from administrative records. RESULTS: There were 1539 participants in the original sample (1430 Black participants [92.9%]; 108 Hispanic participants [7.0%]; 1 White participant [0.1%]); 1104 of 1401 participants (78.8%) in the tracked sample completed a midlife survey on well-being by age 37 years, and 1060 participants had data available for analysis (mean [SD] age, 34.9 [1.4] years; 565 women [53.3%]), including 523 participants who grew up in high-poverty contexts. After adjusting for 17 baseline attributes and differential attrition via propensity score weighting, CPC preschool was associated with significantly lower general FRS (marginal coefficient, –2.2 percentage points [% hereafter]; 95% CI –0.7% to –3.6%; P = .004) and hard FRS (marginal coefficient, –1.6%; 95% CI –0.5% to –2.6%; P = .004), for a 20% reduction in cardiovascular disease risk. The program group was also less likely to have high-risk FRS status, including being in the top quartile of hard FRS (marginal coefficient, –7.2%; 95% CI, –0.3% to –11.6%; P = .02). Those who participated for 4 to 6 years (CPC P-3) had lower general FRS than those who participated for fewer years, but the difference was not significant (marginal coefficient, –1.2%; 95% CI, −2.5% to 0.2%; P = .09); longer participation was associated with placement in the median or higher risk category for general FRS (marginal coefficient, –7.9%; 95% CI –0.7% to –12.4%; P = .007) and hard FRS (marginal coefficient, –9.0%; 95% CI –0.6% to –11.4%; P = .02). Years of education completed by age 34 years accounted for up to 23% of the observed group differences for FRSs, including CPC preschool (general FRS, from –2.16% to –1.66%; difference = –0.5%) and P-3 (general FRS, from –1.16% to –0.71%; difference = –0.45%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quasi-experimental design study, a comprehensive early childhood program for a community cohort at high risk of disparities was associated with lower CVD risk later in life. Corroborating previous research, years of education through college matriculation accounted for a sizable percentage of this association. Early childhood enrichment may contribute to CVD prevention.","Reynolds, Arthur J.; Ou, Suh-Ruu; Eales, Lauren; Mondi, Christina F.; Giovanelli, Alison",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8379657/,370
21052,Representation of Women Among Editors in Chief of Leading Medical Journals,2021-09-08,"BACKGROUND: High-quality phenotype definitions are desirable to enable the extraction of patient cohorts from large electronic health record repositories and are characterized by properties such as portability, reproducibility, and validity. Phenotype libraries, where definitions are stored, have the potential to contribute significantly to the quality of the definitions they host. In this work, we present a set of desiderata for the design of a next-generation phenotype library that is able to ensure the quality of hosted definitions by combining the functionality currently offered by disparate tooling. METHODS: A group of researchers examined work to date on phenotype models, implementation, and validation, as well as contemporary phenotype libraries developed as a part of their own phenomics communities. Existing phenotype frameworks were also examined. This work was translated and refined by all the authors into a set of best practices. RESULTS: We present 14 library desiderata that promote high-quality phenotype definitions, in the areas of modelling, logging, validation, and sharing and warehousing. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of choices to be made when constructing phenotype libraries. Our considerations distil the best practices in the field and include pointers towards their further development to support portable, reproducible, and clinically valid phenotype design. The provision of high-quality phenotype definitions enables electronic health record data to be more effectively used in medical domains.","Chapman, Martin; Mumtaz, Shahzad; Rasmussen, Luke V; Karwath, Andreas; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Gao, Chuang; Thayer, Dan; Pacheco, Jennifer A; Parkinson, Helen; Richesson, Rachel L; Jefferson, Emily; Denaxas, Spiros; Curcin, Vasa",Gigascience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8434766/,370

There is still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, so preventative measures remain the key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19, with it being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and prevent a lack of information through community empowerment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a sample from a primary care facility was conducted. We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: Our sample included 222 subjects (median age 62 years), mostly females (n = 131), undergraduates (n = 193), and with at least 1 risk factor for COVID-19 (n = 144). Overall, younger individuals, females, graduates and the nonrisk group appeared to have higher levels of health literacy, with some exceptions. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a well-informed population. However, it being a pandemic situation, our intention was to identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allowed a perspective of the current state/pattern of health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, it raised awareness of the relevance of specific communication approaches. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are necessary.","da Silva, Joana Gomes; Silva, Carla Sofia; Alexandre, Bárbara; Morgado, Pedro",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7801966/,370

A self-administrated survey of water users was conducted for both graduate and undergraduate students at Boğaziçi University, Turkey in 2019. This study quantifies and maps the water footprint (WF) of Boğaziçi University (BU). It reports preferences of students and personnel in terms of indoor water use, outdoor water use, and virtual water use such as transportation, shopping, and dietary preferences. Water footprints are estimated per person for both engineering students and all students of BU. WF of an average BU student is above the average WF of Turkey as well as the average global WF. The attributes that influence the water use behavior of people were broadly categorized into two groups, which were dietary preferences and shopping preferences. Moreover, the eating pattern of a person regarding whether a person consumes meat was the largest contributor to the WF of BU. The results of this study can help to develop a basic understanding of WF and how it is affected by people's choices. This study is also unique by calculating water footprint in terms of direct and virtual water footprint by considering people’s daily choices in Turkey.","Okutan, Pelin; Akkoyunlu, Atilla",Appl Water Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239324/,370
58818,"Institutional patterns of head and neck oncology care during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective, pooled cross-sectional analysis",2021-10-07,"Over the past 30 years, higher education institutions (HEIs) worldwide have been grappling with the difficulties experienced by many students entering higher education due to their poor pre-entry core mathematical skills. In the Republic of Ireland and the UK, the provision of mathematics learning support (MLS) is the approach most commonly adopted by HEIs to deal with this problem, providing free one-to-one mathematical support and/or workshops for students. However, despite the availability of such supports and research that suggests that engagement with these supports can have a positive impact on student retention and progression, ensuring high levels of student engagement with these supports remains a significant challenge. In more recent years, some institutions have started to provide online MLS which takes many different forms but mainly provide links to websites, revision notes, past exam papers, etc. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for many to resort to remote teaching, it would appear the successful provision of online mathematics support is set to become increasingly important over the coming years. This paper will examine student interaction data with one such online MLS provision, hosted within a virtual learning environment. The interaction data will be analysed in order to gain a better understanding of the level of student engagement with this resource and the content most frequently accessed. This analysis will be used to inform the future development and enhancement of the resource so as to encourage student engagement.","O’Sullivan, Linda; Casey, Deirdre; Crowley, Julie",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500054/,370
60331,Effect of COVID-19 on the Working of a Tertiary Care Hospital.,2020-10-01,"Chronic neuroinflammation with sustained microglial activation occurs following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is believed to contribute to subsequent neurodegeneration and neurological deficits . Microglia, the primary innate immune cells in brain, are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) signaling for their survival. In this pre-clinical study, we examined the effects of delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia on functional recovery and neurodegeneration up to three months post-injury. A CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622, was administered to adult male C57Bl/6J mice at one month after controlled cortical impact to remove chronically activated microglia, and the inhibitor was withdrawn 1-week later to allow for microglial repopulation. Following TBI, the repopulated microglia displayed a ramified morphology similar to that of sham uninjured mice, whereas microglia in vehicle-treated TBI mice showed the typical chronic posttraumatic hypertrophic morphology. PLX5622 treatment limited TBI-associated neuropathological changes at 3 months post-injury; these included a smaller cortical lesion, reduced hippocampal neuron cell death, and decreased NOX2- and NLRP3 inflammasome-associated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, delayed depletion of chronically activated microglia after TBI led to widespread changes in the cortical transcriptome and altered gene pathways involved in neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroplasticity. Using a variety of complementary neurobehavioral tests, PLX5622-treated TBI mice also had improved long-term motor and cognitive function recovery through 3 months post-injury. Together, these studies demonstrate that chronic phase removal of neurotoxic microglia after TBI using CSF1R inhibitors markedly reduce chronic neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration, as well as related motor and cognitive deficits.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is a debilitating neurological disorder that can seriously impact the patient's quality of life. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is induced after severe TBI and contributes to neurological deficits and on-going neurodegenerative processes. Here, we investigated the effect of breaking the neurotoxic neuroinflammatory loop at 1-month after controlled cortical impact in mice by pharmacological removal of chronically activated microglia using a CSF1R inhibitor, PLX5622. Overall, we show that short-term elimination of microglia during the chronic phase of TBI followed by repopulation results in long-term improvements in neurological function, suppression of neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress pathways, and a reduction in persistent neurodegenerative processes. These studies are clinically relevant and support new concepts that the therapeutic window for TBI may be far longer than traditionally believed if chronic and evolving microglial-mediated neuroinflammation can be inhibited or regulated in a precise manner.","Henry, Rebecca J; Ritzel, Rodney M; Barrett, James P; Doran, Sarah J; Jiao, Yun; Leach, Jennie B; Szeto, Gregory L; Wu, Junfang; Stoica, Bogdan A; Faden, Alan I; Loane, David J",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2402-19.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32094203/,370
61696,Incidence of mortality due to rebound toxicity after 'treat and release' practices in prehospital opioid overdose care: a systematic review.,2019,"Climatic extreme events such as droughts (unpredictable), dry periods (predictable) or even flush floods, threaten freshwater ecosystems worldwide. The filtering mechanisms of these events and their strength on communities, however, can be different among regions. While time-for-adaptation theory defines whether or not water scarcity can be considered as disturbance, the stress-dominance theory predicts an increase in importance of environmental filtering and a decrease in the role of biotic interactions in communities with increasing environmental stress. Here, we tested whether environmental filtering (leading to trait convergence) or limiting similarity (leading to trait divergence) is the main assembly rule shaping the structure and trait composition of benthic diatom assemblages in Mediterranean (Portuguese) and continental (Hungarian) temporary and perennial streams. We assumed that the trait composition of diatom assemblages in the two stream types would be less different in the Mediterranean than in the continental region (addressed to time-for-adaptation theory). We also hypothesized that trait composition would be shaped by environmental filtering in the Hungarian streams while by biotic interactions in Portuguese streams (addressed to stress-dominance theory). Our results supported our first hypothesis since traits, which associated primarily to temporary streams were found only in the continental region. Our findings, however, only partially proved the stress-dominance hypothesis. In the continental region, where drying up of streams were induced by unpredictable droughts, biotic interactions were the main assembly rules shaping community structure. In contrast, environmental filtering was nearly as important as limiting similarity in structuring trait composition in the Mediterranean region during the predictable dry phase with no superficial flow. These analyses also highlighted that drought events (both predictable and unpredictable ones) have a complex and strong influence on benthic diatom assemblages resulting even in irreversible changes in trait composition and thereby in ecosystem functioning.","Várbíró, Gábor; Borics, Gábor; Novais, Maria Helena; Morais, Maria Manuela; Rimet, Frédéric; Bouchez, Agnès; Tapolczai, Kálmán; Bácsi, István; Usseglio-Polatera, Philippe; B-Béres, Viktória",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32887020/,370
65476,Development of prehospital care quality indicators for the Australian setting: a modified RAND/UCLA appropriateness method.,2021-07-21,"BACKGROUND Most currently used tools to diagnose septic arthritis are either not readily available or fail to provide real-time results. Reagent strip tests have identified infections in various body fluids. We hypothesized that combined leukocyte esterase and glucose strip tests can aid in diagnosing septic arthritis in native synovial fluid because (1) leukocyte esterase concentrations would be elevated at the infection site because of secretion by recruited neutrophils, and (2) glucose concentrations would be reduced because of bacterial metabolism. METHODS We prospectively investigated synovial fluid from consecutive patients with an atraumatic joint effusion who underwent arthrocentesis in our emergency department during a one-year period. Leukocyte esterase and glucose strip tests were performed on the synovial fluid. Synovial fluid leukocyte count, crystal analysis, Gram staining, culture, and glucose concentration results were also assessed. RESULTS Nineteen fluids were classified as septic and 127 as aseptic. Considering septic arthritis to be present when the leukocyte esterase reading was positive (++ or +++) and the glucose reading was negative (-) yielded a sensitivity of 89.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.9% to 98.7%), specificity of 99.2% (95% CI, 95.7% to 99.9%), positive predictive value of 94.4% (95% CI, 72.7% to 99.9%), negative predictive value of 98.4% (95% CI, 94.5% to 99.8%), positive likelihood ratio of 114, and negative likelihood ratio of 0.11. The synovial leukocyte counts and polymorphonuclear cell percentages were consistent with the semiquantitative readings on the leukocyte esterase strip tests, and the glucose concentrations were consistent with the glucose strip test results. CONCLUSIONS Combined leukocyte esterase and glucose strip tests can be a useful additional tool to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of septic arthritis.","Omar, Mohamed; Ettinger, Max; Reichling, Moritz; Petri, Maximilian; Lichtinghagen, Ralf; Guenther, Daniel; Suero, Eduardo M; Jagodzinski, Michael; Krettek, Christian",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

66375,Association of Inflammatory Markers with Mortality in COVID-19 Infection.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Biologic grafts used in ventral hernia repair are derived from various sources and undergo different post-tissue-harvesting processing, handling, and sterilization techniques. It is unclear how these various characteristics impact graft response in the setting of contamination. We evaluated four materials in an infected hernia repair animal model using fluorescence imaging and quantitative culture studies. METHODS One hundred seven rats underwent creation of a chronic hernia. They were then repaired with one synthetic polyester control material (n = 12) and four different biologic grafts (n = 24 per material). Biologic grafts evaluated included Surgisis (porcine small intestinal submucosa), Permacol (crosslinked porcine dermis), Xenmatrix (noncrosslinked porcine dermis), and Strattice (noncrosslinked porcine dermis). Half of the repairs in each group were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus at 10(4) CFU/ml and survived for 30 days without systemic antibiotics. Animals then underwent fluorescence imaging and quantitative bacterial studies. RESULTS All clean repairs remained sterile. Rates of bacterial clearance were as follows: polyester synthetic 0%, Surgisis 58%, Permacol 67%, Xenmatrix 75%, and Strattice 92% (P=0.003). Quantitative bacterial counts had a similar trend in bacterial clearance: polyester synthetic 1×10(6) CFU/g, Surgisis 4.3×10(5) CFU/g, Permacol 1.7×10(3) CFU/g, Xenmatrix 46 CFU/g, and Strattice 31 CFU/g (P=0.001). Fluorescence imaging was unable to detect low bacterial fluorescence counts observed on bacterial studies. CONCLUSION Biologic grafts, in comparison to synthetic material, are able to clear a Staphylococcus aureus contamination; however, they are able to do so at different rates. Bacterial clearance correlated to the level of residual bacterial burden observed in our study. Post-tissue-harvesting processing, handling, and sterilization techniques may contribute to this observed difference in ability to clear bacteria.","Harth, K C; Broome, A-M; Jacobs, M R; Blatnik, J A; Zeinali, F; Bajaksouzian, S; Rosen, M J",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1534-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21298542/,370

Here, we delineate the intricate relationship between breast cancer and COVID-19. Breast cancer and COVID-19 share involvement of common comorbidities, hormonal signalling pathways, gender differences, rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). We also shed light on the possible effects of therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes. Briefly, we conclude that breast cancer patients are more susceptible for COVID-19 in comparison with their normal counterparts. Women are more resistant for the occurrence and severity of COVID-19. Increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are being correlated with occurrence and severity of COVID-19, but higher expression of ACE2 and lower expression of TMPRSS2 are prognostic markers for overall and disease free survival in breast cancer. The ACE2 inhibitors and ibuprofen therapies for COVID-19 treatment may aggravate the clinical condition of the breast cancer patients through chemo-resistance and metastasis. Most of the available therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 were also found to exert positive effects on breast cancer outcomes. Besides drugs in clinical trend, TMPRSS2 inhibitors, estrogen supplementation, androgen deprivation and DPP-IV inhibitors may also be used to treat breast cancer patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, drug-drug interactions suggest that some of the drugs used for the treatment of COVID-19 may modulate the drug metabolism of anticancer therapies which may leads to adverse drug reaction events.","Parmar, Hamendra Singh; Nayak, Aakruti; Gavel, Pramod Kumar; Jha, Hemchandra; Bhagwat, Shivani; Sharma, Rajesh",Current cancer drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1568009621666210216102236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33593260/,370

Using a newly designed real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay specific for the nucleocapsid (N) gene of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and turkey coronaviruses (TCoV), coronaviruses were identified in 37% of the intestinal samples collected from diseased turkey flocks. The full-length spike (S) gene of these viruses was amplified, cloned and sequenced from three samples. The French S sequences shared 98% identity at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels, whereas they were at most 65% and 60% identical with North American (NA) TCoV and at most 50% and 37% identical with IBV at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Higher divergence with NA TCoV was observed in the S1-encoding domain. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene revealed that the newly detected viruses form a sublineage genetically related with, but significantly different from, NA TCoV. Additionally, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the N gene, located on the 5' and 3' sides of the S gene in the coronavirus genome, were partially sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both the NA TCoV and French TCoV (Fr TCoV) lineages included some IBV relatives, which were however different in the two lineages. This suggested that different recombination events could have played a role in the evolution of the NA and Fr TCoV. The present results provide the first S sequence for a European TCoV. They reveal extensive genetic variation in TCoV and suggest different evolutionary pathways in North America and Europe.","Maurel, S; Toquin, D; Briand, F X; Queguiner, M; Allee, C; Bertin, J; Ravillion, L; Retaux, C; Turblin, V; Morvan, H; Eterradossi, N",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2011.551936; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21500038/,370

The changing geopolitical landscape has led to its resurgence in recent years. The public rejection of traditional forms of torture that rely on the infliction of physical pain has paradoxically increased the reliance on psychological methods of torture. This critical commentary aims to define and characterize psychological torture (PT) while exploring practical, legal, ethical and therapeutic implications relevant to clinicians and policymakers. Psychological torture comes in a range of forms. It is being increasingly justified and adopted by legitimate authorities in the name of national security. The emphasis on the avoidance of physical pain leads to the assumption that PT does not produce the levels of suffering and harm that are associated with physically violent forms of torture. This same assumption has allowed for the implication of mental health professionals in theorizing and providing legitimacy for the actions of perpetrators. Psychological torture is still poorly defined with limited understanding of its long-term psychiatric impact on those who are subjected to it. The role of mental health professionals in preventing or addressing psychological torture remains ambiguous and needs to be reinforced.","El-Khoury, Joseph; Haidar, Riwa; Barkil-Oteo, Andres",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020961800; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985299/,370

However, no study has evaluated these apps. The objective of this study was to develop a reliable measure and rate the quality of COVID-19 mobile health apps, to eventually provide a roadmap for future mHealth app development. In this study, we used COVID-related keywords to identify apps for iOS and Android devices. 13 apps (13.5% of the total number of apps identified) were selected for evaluation. App quality was assessed independently using MARS by two reviewers. Search queries yielded a total of 97 potentially relevant apps, of which 13 met our final inclusion criteria. Kendall's coefficient of concordance value for the inter-rater agreement was 0.93 (p = .03). COVID-19 GOV PK app had the highest average MARS score (4.7/5), and all of the apps had acceptable MARS scores (> 3.0). This study suggests that most COVID-related apps meet acceptable criteria for quality, content, or functionality, and they must highlight esthetic and interesting features for overall quality improvement to be welcomed by users.","Salehinejad, Simin; Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh R; Hajesmaeel Gohari, Sadrieh; Bahaadinbeigy, Kambiz; Fatehi, Farhad",Informatics for health & social care,https://doi.org/10.1080/17538157.2020.1837838; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164594/,370

Goal-directed neonatal hemodynamic management lacks end-organ monitoring strategies to assess the adequacy of perfusion. Our aim is to develop a clinically viable, continuous metric of renovascular reactivity to gauge renal perfusion during shock. We present the renovascular reactivity index (RVx), which quantifies passivity of renal blood volume to spontaneous changes in arterial blood pressure. We tested the ability of the RVx to detect reductions in renal blood flow. Hemorrhagic shock was induced in 10 piglets. The RVx was monitored as a correlation between slow waves of arterial blood pressure and relative total hemoglobin (rTHb) obtained with reflectance near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) over the kidney. The RVx was compared with laser-Doppler measurements of red blood cell flux, and renal laser-Doppler measurements were compared with cerebral laser-Doppler measurements. Renal blood flow decreased to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline at perfusion pressures of 60, 45, and 40 mmHg, respectively, whereas in the brain these decrements occurred at pressures of 30, 25, and 15 mmHg, respectively. The RVx compared favorably to the renal laser-Doppler data. Areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves using renal blood flow thresholds of 50% and 25% of baseline were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.87) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92).

81378,EMS Curriculum Should Educate Beyond a Technical Scope of Practice: Position Statement and Resource Document.,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a safe non-invasive and nonionizing medical imaging modality that is used to visualize the structure of human anatomy. Conventional (high-field) MRI scanners are very expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, which limit their use in many developing countries. This study is part of a project that aims at addressing these challenges and is carried out by teams from Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the USA. These are working on developing affordable, portable and low-field MRI scanners to diagnose children in developing countries with hydrocephalus. The challenges faced by the teams are that the low-field MRI scanners currently under development are characterized by low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and long scan times. METHODS We propose an algorithm called adaptive-size dictionary learning algorithm (AS-DLMRI) that integrates information-theoretic criteria (ITC) and Dictionary learning approaches. The result of the integration is an adaptive-size dictionary that is optimal for any input signal. AS-DLMRI may help to reduce the scan time and improve the SNR of the generated images, thereby improving the image quality. RESULTS We compared our proposed algorithm AS-DLMRI with adaptive patch-based algorithm known as DLMRI and non-adaptive CSMRI technique known as LDP. DLMRI and LDP have been used as the baseline algorithms in other related studies. The results of AS-DLMRI are consistently slightly better in terms of PSNR, SNR and HFEN than for DLMRI, and are significantly better than for LDP. Moreover, AS-DLMRI is faster than DLMRI. CONCLUSION Using a dictionary size that is appropriate to the input data could reduce the computational complexity, and also the construction quality since only dictionary atoms that are relevant to the task are included in the dictionary and are used during the reconstruction. However, AS-DLMRI did not completely remove noise during the experiments with the noisy phantom. Our next step in our research is to integrate our proposed algorithm with an image denoising function.","Ahishakiye, Emmanuel; Van Gijzen, Martin Bastiaan; Tumwiine, Julius; Obungoloch, Johnes",BMC medical imaging,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-020-00474-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32600272/,370

88369,Airway Management for Emergent Surgeries during COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-01,"INTRODUCTION The introduction of molecular techniques has enabled better understanding of the etiology of respiratory tract infections in children. The objective of the study was to analyze viral coinfection and its relationship to clinical severity. METHODS Hospitalized pediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory infection were studied during the period between 2009-2010. Clinical and epidemiological data, duration of hospitalization, need for oxygen therapy, bacterial coinfection and need for mechanical ventilation were collected. Etiology was studied by multiplex PCR and low-density microarrays for 19 viruses. RESULTS A total of 385 patients were positive, 44.94% under 12 months. The most frequently detected viruses were RSV-B: 139, rhinovirus: 114, RSV-A: 111, influenza A H1N1-2009: 93 and bocavirus: 77. Coinfection was detected in 61.81%, 36.36% with 2 viruses, 16.10% and 9.35% with 3 to 4 or more. Coinfection was higher in 2009 with 69.79 vs. 53.88% in 2010. Rhinovirus/RSV-B on 10 times and RSV-A/RSV-B on 5 times were the most detected coinfections. Hospitalization decreased with greater number of viruses (P<0,001). Oxygen therapy was required by 26.75% (one virus was detected in 55.34% of cases). A larger number of viruses resulted in less need for oxygen (P<0,001). Ten cases required mechanical ventilation, 4 patients with bacterial coinfection and 5 with viral coinfection (P=0,69). CONCLUSIONS An inverse relationship was found between the number of viruses detected in nasopharyngeal aspirate, the need for oxygen therapy and hospitalization days. More epidemiological studies and improved quantitative detection techniques are needed to define the role of viral coinfections in respiratory disease and its correlation with the clinical severity.","Martínez-Roig, A; Salvadó, M; Caballero-Rabasco, M A; Sánchez-Buenavida, A; López-Segura, N; Bonet-Alcaina, M",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2014.01.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24666712/,370

Merr., Trigonella foenum-graceum L., and Moringa oleifera Lam. considered to induce galactagogue activity. This research aimed to evaluate the galactagogue activity of PHF and its effects on α-lactalbumin (LALBA) as well as aquaporin (AQP) gene expression at messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels in mammary glands of lactating rats. METHODS Thirty lactating Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), each has 7 pups. Group I was treated orally with distilled water as negative control. Groups II, III, and IV were orally administered with PHF at 26.25, 52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day, respectively. Group V was treated with domperidone 2.7 mg/kg/day, orally as positive control. The treatment was performed at third day until fifteenth day of parturition. The observed parameters include the galactagogue activity indicating by milk yield of lactating rats, the pup weight changes and lactating rats body weight changes during lactating period, mRNA expression of LALBA and AQP using quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and histopathological analysis of mammary glands at the end of treatment period. RESULT The result showed that the PHF groups (52.5 and 105 mg/kg/day) and domperidone were significantly increased milk production of lactating rats (p < 0.05). The levels of mRNA expression of LALBA and AQPs were significantly upregulated by 105 mg/kg/day of PHF or 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone administration (p < 0.0001). Histopathological analysis of mammary glands shows that alveoli diameter was increase 14.59 and 19.33% at 105 mg/kg of PHF and 2.7 mg/kg of domperidone treatment, respectively. CONCLUSION The study suggested that PHF has potentially to induce galactagogue activity on lactating period through upregulation of LALBA and AQP genes at the mRNA level.","Mustofa,; Yuliani, Fara Silvia; Purwono, Setyo; Sadewa, Ahmad Hamim; Damayanti, Ema; Heriyanto, Didik Setyo",BMC complementary medicine and therapies,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-020-03152-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243201/,370
98440,Should children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now?,2021-01-05,"STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study of thirteen patients undergoing 5-level anterior spinal surgery for cervical myelopathy. OBJECTIVE While limited literature exists in reviewing the treatment of high cervical pathology extending caudally, we believe long segment surgery beginning at C2-3 can be accomplished with good success and is an option more patients may benefit from. We aim to describe the technique in accessing the C2-C3 disk space and efficacy of treating multilevel disease beginning at the C2 vertebral body. This includes an extensive technical report and surgical pearls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Compression at the level of C2 can be daunting to access because of steep approach required. Few studies have described the technique in reaching the C2 level, with less information describing the efficacy of a 5-level anterior fusion starting at C2. METHODS Patients who underwent surgery between 2000 and 2016 were identified utilizing the department billing database and ICD codes. Patients age, operative indications, levels treated, length of hospital stay, fusion outcome, and operative complications were explored. Independent analysis of fusion was performed. RESULTS The average length of hospital stay was 3.9 days. Eight patients reported significant improvement of hand weakness, numbness, and/or gait at 6 months follow-up. The most frequent complication was dysphagia (23%). One patient experienced recurrent symptoms secondary to nonunion, and another patient suffered a postoperative neurological worsening because of anterior spinal artery syndrome. CONCLUSION This retrospective review discusses the technique to visualize and fully decompress C2-C3 spinal segments. In addition, we explored the efficacy and perioperative risk in long segment anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.","Spurgas, Morgan P; Entezami, Pouya; Thomas, James; DiRisio, Darryl J",Clinical spine surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/bsd.0000000000001245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369912/,370

OBJECTIVES We compared the viral diagnostic yield for influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) from the recently developed nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (NPFS) with nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) collected in parallel from 196 hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection during the peak period of influenza A and RSV activity in Hong Kong. Specimens were tested by RT-PCR for influenza A and RSV and viral load determined. They were also tested by direct immunofluorescence (DIF) for influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza types 1-3 and adenovirus. RESULTS Both NPA and NPFS had excellent sensitivity (100%) for detecting influenza A by RT-PCR but NPA was slightly more sensitive than NPFS for detecting RSV by both RT-PCR (100% vs. 92.3%) and DIF (87.2% vs. 84.6%) and for detecting influenza A by DIF (90.2% vs. 82.9%). Viral load for influenza A in NPA and NPFS was not significantly different but that for RSV was higher in NPA. CONCLUSION NPA remains the optimal specimen for diagnosis of respiratory infections by RT-PCR and DIF. However, collection of NPFS is easier to perform in an out-patient setting, was more acceptable to parents and less likely to generate aerosols than NPA engendering potentially less infection control hazard.","Chan, K H; Peiris, J S M; Lim, W; Nicholls, J M; Chiu, S S",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2007.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18242124/,370
107793,An inquiry into COVID-19 is needed now.,2021-01-25,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic progressive neurological disorder that has few distinctive biomarkers associated with disease progression or response to therapy. This research investigated whether non-invasive imaging correlated with animal behavior and morphological indicators of disease in response to serum levels of [Met5]-enkephalin. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, adult female C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to receive daily injections of 0.1 mg/kg naltrexone (NTX) (= low dose naltrexone, LDN), 10 mg/kg Opioid Growth Factor (OGF) (chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin) or saline beginning at the time of disease induction. Daily composite behavior scores were recorded over a 30-day period based on tail tone, gait, righting reflex, and limb strength. Prior to disease onset (day 7), and at peak disease (day 18), mice were imaged and tissues (blood and spinal cord) collected at day 30 for serum analyses of OGF and morphology. Serum OGF levels of EAE mice treated with saline were significantly reduced from baseline and from normal mice. Longitudinal cohort data demonstrated an increase in fractional anisotropy in all cohorts by day 18. There was a significant decrease in radial diffusivity in the saline group seen at day 18 whereas the axial diffusivity was not altered amongst treatment groups. Treatment with OGF or LDN resulted in mean diffusivity rates that were comparable to baseline (normal) levels at days 7 and 18. Luxol fast blue staining of the lumbar spinal cords demonstrated a 16 % reduction in myelin staining in saline treated EAE animals when compared to OGF and LDN treated EAE mice. Immunohistochemistry with Olig2 (pan-oligodendrocyte marker) and myelin basic protein (MBP) revealed that OGF and LDN treatment restored the area (%) of MBP and number of oligodendrocytes to that of normal spinal cord (∼75 %). Saline treated EAE mice had more demyelination and fewer oligodendrocytes than normal mice. Collectively, these data suggest that a panel of biomarkers including imaging, serum biomarker levels, and behavior correlate with progression of disease, and may begin to validate use of specific non-invasive markers for MS.","Patel, Chirag; Meadowcroft, Mark D; Zagon, Ian S; McLaughlin, Patricia J",Brain research bulletin,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2020.10.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141073/,370

The number of surgical procedures performed in the United States continues to rise, and surgical patients are initially seen with increasingly complex comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately half of SSIs are deemed preventable using evidence-based strategies. Objective To provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI. Evidence Review A targeted systematic review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1998 through April 2014. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendation and to provide explicit links between them. Of 5759 titles and abstracts screened, 896 underwent full-text review by 2 independent reviewers. After exclusions, 170 studies were extracted into evidence tables, appraised, and synthesized. Findings Before surgery, patients should shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before the operative day. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines and timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the agents is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. In cesarean section procedures, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered before skin incision. Skin preparation in the operating room should be performed using an alcohol-based agent unless contraindicated. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Topical antimicrobial agents should not be applied to the surgical incision. During surgery, glycemic control should be implemented using blood glucose target levels less than 200 mg/dL, and normothermia should be maintained in all patients. Increased fraction of inspired oxygen should be administered during surgery and after extubation in the immediate postoperative period for patients with normal pulmonary function undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients as a means to prevent SSI. Conclusions and Relevance This guideline is intended to provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI and should be incorporated into comprehensive surgical quality improvement programs to improve patient safety.","Berríos-Torres, Sandra I; Umscheid, Craig A; Bratzler, Dale W; Leas, Brian; Stone, Erin C; Kelz, Rachel R; Reinke, Caroline E; Morgan, Sherry; Solomkin, Joseph S; Mazuski, John E; Dellinger, E Patchen; Itani, Kamal M F; Berbari, Elie F; Segreti, John; Parvizi, Javad; Blanchard, Joan; Allen, George; Kluytmans, Jan A J W; Donlan, Rodney; Schecter, William P",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2017.0904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28467526/,370

AIMS To describe the national and regional temporal trends in emergency department (ED) admissions for myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, before, during and after the first national lockdown. METHODS The weekly numbers of ED admissions for MI and stroke were collected from the OSCOUR® network, which covers 93.3% of all ED admissions in France. National and regional incidence rate ratios from 02 February until 31 May (2020 versus 2017-2019) were estimated using Poisson regression for MI and stroke, before, during and after lockdown. RESULTS A decrease in ED admissions was observed for MI (-20% for ST-segment elevation MI and-25% for non-ST-segment elevation MI) and stroke (-18% for ischaemic and-22% for haemorrhagic) during the lockdown. The decrease became significant earlier for stroke than for MI. No compensatory increase in ED admissions was observed at the end of the lockdown for these diseases. Important regional disparities in ED admissions were observed, without correlation with the regional levels of COVID-19 cases. The impact of lockdown on ED admissions was particularly significant in six regions (Ile-de France, Occitanie, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur, Nouvelle Aquitaine, Hauts-de-France and Bretagne). CONCLUSIONS The decrease in ED admissions for MI and stroke observed during the lockdown was probably caused by fear of COVID-19 and augmented by the lockdown, and was heterogeneous across the French territory. ED admissions were slow to return to the usual levels from previous years, without a compensatory increase. These results underline the need to reinforce messages directed at the population to encourage them to seek care without delay in case of cardiovascular symptoms.","Olié, Valérie; Carcaillon-Bentata, Laure; Thiam, Marie-Michèle; Haeghebaert, Sylvie; Caserio-Schönemann, Céline",Archives of cardiovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acvd.2021.01.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893038/,370

An impediment to identifying novel pharmacotherapies is the incomplete understanding of paracrine signalling. Oxytocin has been highlighted as a potential paracrine mediator of BPH. To better understand oxytocin signalling, we investigated the effects of exogenous oxytocin on both stromal cell proliferation, and inherent spontaneous prostate contractions using primary models derived from human prostate tissue. We show that the Oxytocin Receptor (OXTR) is widely expressed in the human prostate, and co-localises to contractile cells within the prostate stroma. Exogenous oxytocin did not modulate prostatic fibroblast proliferation, but did significantly (p < 0.05) upregulate the frequency of spontaneous contractions in prostate tissue, indicating a role in generating smooth muscle tone. Application of atosiban, an OXTR antagonist, significantly (p < 0.05) reduced spontaneous contractions. Individual tissue responsiveness to both exogenous oxytocin (R2 = 0.697, p < 0.01) and atosiban (R2 = 0.472, p < 0.05) was greater in tissue collected from older men. Overall, our data suggest that oxytocin is a key regulator of inherent spontaneous prostate contractions, and targeting of the OXTR and associated downstream signalling is an attractive prospect in the development of novel BPH pharmacotherapies.","Lee, Sophie N; Kraska, Jenna; Papargiris, Melissa; Teng, Linda; Niranjan, Birunthi; Hammar, Johanna; Ryan, Andrew; Frydenberg, Mark; Lawrentschuk, Nathan; Middendorff, Ralf; Ellem, Stuart J; Whittaker, Michael; Risbridger, Gail P; Exintaris, Betty",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85439-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737570/,370

METHODS Hand hygiene practice and glove use amongst 206 hospital health and support workers, stratified according to years of working experience, were observed. RESULTS The number of observed episodes for hand hygiene was 1037 and for glove use 304. Compliance with hand hygiene was 74.7% and with glove use 72.4%. In approximately two-third of episodes, participants washed their hands after each patient contact; though, 78.5% failed to rub their hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds. The major break in compliance with glove use was failure to change gloves between procedures on the same patient. In 28.6% of observed glove use episodes, participants did not wear gloves during procedures that exposed them to blood, body fluids, excretion, non-intact skin or mucous membranes. Significant differences in performance scores on antiseptic hand rub were found between the two types of hospital and on glove use between the three groups of work experience: ≤ 5, 6-10, >10 years. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Education and reinforcement of proper hand hygiene practice and glove use among hospital health and support workers is needed.","Chau, Janita P-C; Thompson, David R; Twinn, Sheila; Lee, Diana T F; Pang, Sharon W M",Journal of clinical nursing,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03586.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21492278/,370

Data were collected through a survey six months after the de facto end of the outbreak and a total of 855 subjects completed the surveys and were included in the analysis. The results suggested that the public's preventive (hand hygiene) and avoidance (avoiding hospitals even when sick) behaviors that were frequently practiced during the pandemic were influenced by their social determinants both direct and indirect pathways. Health communication such as information seeking and processing mediated the effect of social determinants on the behaviors and information seeking was found to have the most significant mediating effect on the relationship between the practice of both preventive and avoidance behaviors and social determinants such as education and age. The results of the present study will deepen our understanding of PHEP by identifying key factors that influence the public's behavioral responses as well as providing information to public health emergency management and health risk communication officials to implement strategies necessary in improving PHEP.,"Lee, Minjung; Ju, Youngkee; You, Myoungsoon",Health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2019.1636342; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31262197/,370

124404,Detection of Nipah virus RNA in fruit bat (Pteropus giganteus) from India.,2012,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global health issue that encroaches beyond parameters of age, gender, sexual orientation and is the subject of extensive scholarly inquiry. Research on IPV in heterosexual couples, in particular on heterosexual women, has been prolific. However, there is a dearth of literature to document the distinct experiences of gay and bisexual men, despite the evidence of prevalence of IPV as reported equal or higher to heterosexual women. Studies have found that one in four gay men and four in 10 bisexual men have experienced IPV in their lifetime. This scoping review examines studies between 1931 and 2019 that had a predominant focus on violence among gay and bisexual men. Four electronic databases were searched in 2019. Arksey and O'Malley's framework was utilized to extract 28 studies using a range of research designs that represented 13,224 sexual minority male participants. Across studies, gay and bisexual men were observed to experience IPV similarly to heterosexual couples involving psychological, physical, and sexual violence. However, as a marginalized and sexual minority group, they experience distinctive features of violence including sexual orientation outing, unprotected sexual intercourse, homophobia, internalized homophobia, and difficulties accessing minority men-focused services. Minority stress theory is posited as a useful lens in understanding the above features. In keeping with previous scholarship, a paucity of knowledge on gay and bisexual men's experience of IPV was observed, and additional research is recommended.","Callan, Aisling; Corbally, Melissa; McElvaney, Rosaleen","Trauma, violence & abuse",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838020970898; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33205700/,370
125144,Comparison of the performance of battery-operated fluid warmers.,2018,"BACKGROUND The intraoperative blood loss is estimated daily in the operating room and is mainly done by visual techniques. Due to local standards, the surgical sponge colours can vary (e.g. white in US, green in Germany). The influence of sponge colour on accuracy of estimation has not been in the focus of research yet. MATERIAL AND METHODS A blood loss simulation study containing four ""bleeding"" scenarios each per sponge colour were created by using expired whole blood donation samples. The blood donations were applied to white and green surgical sponges after dilution with full electrolyte solution. Study participants had to estimate the absorbed blood loss in sponges in all scenarios. The difference to the reference blood loss was analysed. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to investigate other influence factors such as staff experience and sponge colour. RESULTS A total of 53 anaesthesists participated in the study. Visual estimation correlated moderately with reference blood loss in white (Spearman's rho: 0.521; p = 3.748*10-16) and green sponges (Spearman's rho: 0.452; p = 4.683*10-12). The median visually estimated blood loss was higher in white sponges (250ml IRQ 150-412.5ml) than in green sponges (150ml IQR 100-300ml), compared to reference blood loss (103ml IQR 86-162.8). For both colour types of sponges, major under- and overestimation was observed. The multivariate statistics demonstrates that fabric colours have a significant influence on estimation (p = 3.04*10-10), as well as clinician's qualification level (p = 2.20*10-10, p = 1.54*10-08) and amount of RBL to be estimated (p < 2*10-16). CONCLUSION The deviation of correct blood loss estimation was smaller with white surgical sponges compared to green sponges. In general, deviations were so severe for both types of sponges, that it appears to be advisable to refrain from visually estimating blood loss whenever possible and instead to use other techniques such as e.g. colorimetric estimation.","Piekarski, Florian; Gerdessen, Lara; Schmitt, Elke; Tanner, Linda; Wunderer, Florian; Neef, Vanessa; Meybohm, Patrick; Zacharowski, Kai; Raimann, Florian Jürgen",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085701/,370

129294,COVID-19 is not a driver of clinically significant viral wheeze and asthma.,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND Remote ischemic preconditioning is a simple therapy that may reduce cardiac and kidney injury. We undertook a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of this therapy on markers of heart and kidney injury after cardiac surgery. METHODS Patients at high risk of death within 30 days after cardiac surgery were randomly assigned to undergo remote ischemic preconditioning or a sham procedure after induction of anesthesia. The preconditioning therapy was three 5-minute cycles of thigh ischemia, with 5 minutes of reperfusion between cycles. The sham procedure was identical except that ischemia was not induced. The primary outcome was peak creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB) within 24 hours after surgery (expressed as multiples of the upper limit of normal, with log transformation). The secondary outcome was change in creatinine level within 4 days after surgery (expressed as log-transformed micromoles per litre). Patient-important outcomes were assessed up to 6 months after randomization. RESULTS We randomly assigned 128 patients to remote ischemic preconditioning and 130 to the sham therapy. There were no significant differences in postoperative CK-MB (absolute mean difference 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.07 to 0.36) or creatinine (absolute mean difference 0.06, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.23). Other outcomes did not differ significantly for remote ischemic preconditioning relative to the sham therapy: for myocardial infarction, relative risk (RR) 1.35 (95% CI 0.85 to 2.17); for acute kidney injury, RR 1.10 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.78); for stroke, RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.34 to 3.07); and for death, RR 1.47 (95% CI 0.65 to 3.31). INTERPRETATION Remote ischemic precnditioning did not reduce myocardial or kidney injury during cardiac surgery. This type of therapy is unlikely to substantially improve patient-important outcomes in cardiac surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

The aim of this paper is to report current knowledge of headache in IIH and to identify therapeutic options. BACKGROUND Disability in IIH is predominantly driven by headache; thus, headache management is an urgent and unmet clinical need. At present, there is currently no scientific evidence for the directed use of abortive or preventative headache therapy. METHODS A detailed search of the scientific literature and narrative review was performed. RESULTS Headache in IIH is driven by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) and reduction of ICP has been reported in some studies to reduce headache. Despite resolution of papilledema and normalization of raised ICP, a majority suffer persistent post-IIH headache. The lack of evidence-based management approaches leaves many untreated. Where clinicians attempt to manage IIH headache, they use off-label therapies to target the prevailing headache phenotype. A recent prospective open-label study demonstrated the effective use of a calcitonin gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody therapy in IIH for persistent post-IIH headache. CONCLUSIONS There is overwhelming evidence of the headache burden in IIH. Studies are required to investigate the biological foundations of headache related to ICP and to develop treatments specifically directed to manage headache in IIH.","Mollan, Susan P; Grech, Olivia; Sinclair, Alexandra J",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106464/,370

This ethnography was conducted within the framework of critical medical anthropology with a relational approach. Fieldwork was carried out over a period of 11 months (2016-2017) in Cuzamá, a municipality in the former henequen-producing area of Yucatán. During this period, the researcher resided in and lived alongside the community. The research was primarily conducted with eight significant actors (four men and four women from 25 to 40 years old), as well as other secondary and tertiary actors, through individual interviews, group interviews, ""informal"" conversations, and above all participant observation. The results show that in terms of representations, alcohol consumption is primarily discussed from a place of negativity. Although it leads to and is in fact associated with certain health problems, in terms of practices, alcohol consumption is seen as the source of physical, emotional, and relational health benefits. This is evidenced in popular knowledge regarding alcohol consumption, which is characterized by discontinuity and ambivalence more than continuity.","Moreno Cabrera, Sergio Andrés",Salud colectiva,https://doi.org/10.18294/sc.2020.2533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147385/,370
140941,Paediatric trainees' training experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a national survey.,2021-02-26,"OBJECTIVES Early neurological deterioration (END) is a common condition associated with poor outcome after acute ischemic stroke. We studied association between blood pressure (BP) variability and development of END. METHODS In this retrospective observational study, we studied a consecutive series of patients hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke within 24 h of onset. The primary outcome of interest was the development of END according to predefined criteria within the first 72 h of stroke onset. During this period, the mean, maximum (max), and minimum (min) values for the SBP and DBP were measured. The following parameters of BP variability were calculated for the SBP and DBP: the difference between the maximum and minimum (max-min), the SD, and the coefficient of variation. RESULTS Of the 1161 patients enrolled in the study (mean age, 67.5 ± 13.3 years; 59.6% men), 210 (18.1%) developed END. All of the BP variability parameters were linearly associated with END independent of mean BP and potential clinical variables (P values < 0.05 on likelihood ratio tests for trend), except for SBPmax-min. Among the other BP parameters, SBPmean, SBPmax, DBPmax, and DBPmin were independently associated with END. After adjustments for potential confounders, the odds for END increased 14-21% with each increase of one standard deviation in the BP variability parameter. CONCLUSION BP variability is independently and linearly associated with the development of neurologic deterioration in acute stage of ischemic stroke.","Chung, Jong-Won; Kim, Nayoung; Kang, Jihoon; Park, Su Hyun; Kim, Wook-Joo; Ko, Youngchai; Park, Jung Hyun; Lee, Ji Sung; Lee, Juneyoung; Yang, Mi Hwa; Jang, Myung Suk; Oh, Chang Wan; Kwon, O-Ki; Jung, CheolKyu; Kim, Beom Joon; Han, Moon-Ku; Gorelick, Philip B; Bae, Hee-Joon",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000000675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237556/,370

Previous studies have been predominantly focused on its degradation at low concentrations, while the remediation of BaP pollution with high concentrations was neglected. Additionally, the metabolic pathways associated with its anaerobic degradation remain unclear. As a first attempt, super-efficient systems for BaP anaerobic degradation were established, and the corresponding metabolic pathways were elucidated in this study. The results showed that the BaP removal rate in BaP-only system with initial concentrations of 200 mg/L reached 3.09 mg/(L·d) within 45 days. Co-solvent, acetone promoted anaerobic BaP degradation (4.252 mg/(L·d)), while dichloromethane showed a newly-discovered co-metabolic effect. In the system with 500 mg/L of BaP and dichloromethane addition, the removal rate increased drastically (14.64 mg/(L·d)) at 400 mg/L turn point of BaP.

Our aim was to assess the prevalence of anal sphincter defects and the association with incontinence in women undergoing POP surgery. METHODS Cross-sectional study of 200 women scheduled for POP surgery. They answered yes/no and graded any symptoms of fecal and flatal incontinence on a visual analog scale (0-100). 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound was used to assess internal (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) defects. A defect of ≥30° in ≥4 of 6 slices on tomographic imaging was regarded significant. The association between incontinence and sphincter defects was tested with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS The prevalence of any sphincter defect was 50/200 (25%). Combined IAS/EAS defect was found in 19/200 (9.5%) women, 8/200 (4.0%) had isolated IAS, and 23/200 (11.5%) had isolated EAS defects. In women with defect and intact IAS, 37% and 11% reported fecal incontinence, respectively, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-7.0), p = .147 and in women with defect versus intact EAS, 36% and 9% had fecal incontinence, aOR 4.0 (95% CI, 1.5-10.8), p = .005.

153751,"COVID-19, remote working and paediatric training: what can we learn?",2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND We recently reported on preclinical and feasibility studies (Innovation, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study [IDEAL] phase 0-1) of the development of robotic kidney transplantation (RKT) with regional hypothermia. This paper presents the IDEAL phase 2a studies of technique development. OBJECTIVES To describe the technique of RKT with regional hypothermia developed at two tertiary care institutions (Vattikuti Urology Institute and Medanta Hospital). We report on the safety profile and early graft function in these patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients who underwent live-donor RKT at Medanta Hospital following a 3-yr planning/simulation phase at the Vattikuti Urology Institute. Demographic details, and perioperative and postoperative outcomes are reported for the initial 25 recipients who have completed a minimum 6-mo follow-up. SURGICAL PROCEDURE Positioning and port placement were similar to that used for robotic radical prostatectomy. Allograft cooling was achieved by ice slush delivered through a GelPOINT device. The accompanying video details the operative technique. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary outcome was posttransplant graft function. Secondary outcomes included technical success or failure and complication rates. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Fifty patients underwent RKT successfully, 7 in the phase 1 and 43 in the phase 2 stages of the study. For the initial 25 patients, mean console, warm ischemia, arterial, and venous anastomotic times were 135, 2.4, 12, and 13.4 min, respectively. All grafts were cooled to 18-20 °C with no change in core body temperature. All grafts functioned immediately posttransplant and the mean serum creatinine level at discharge was 1.3mg/dl (range: 0.8-3.1mg/dl). No patient developed anastomotic leaks, wound complications, or wound infections. At 6-mo of follow-up, no patient had developed a lymphocele detected on CT scanning. Two patients underwent re-exploration, and one patient died of congestive heart failure (1.5 mo posttransplant). CONCLUSIONS RKT with regional hypothermia is safe and reproducible when performed by a team skilled in robotic surgery. PATIENT SUMMARY RKT is safe and effective when performed by surgeons experienced in robotic techniques.","Menon, Mani; Sood, Akshay; Bhandari, Mahendra; Kher, Vijay; Ghosh, Prasun; Abaza, Ronney; Jeong, Wooju; Ghani, Khurshid R; Kumar, Ramesh K; Modi, Pranjal; Ahlawat, Rajesh",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.12.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24388099/,370

An apparent absorption is defined to quantify the difference between total attenuation (resulting from both absorption and scattering) and attenuation exclusively due to scattering. A power-law model is then used to describe the frequency-dependent apparent absorption as a function of pore diameter and density. The frequency response of the studied porous structures to a Gaussian pulse is studied to determine the frequency range over which the system can be considered linear. The results show that for low scattering regimes (normalized frequency $<$ 0.80), the system and its apparent absorption can be considered linear. Hence, the total attenuation coefficient results from the summation of scattering and absorption coefficients. However, for highly scattering regimes, the system can no longer be considered linear and the apparent absorption vs. frequency deviates from a linear trend. As the pore density increases, the apparent absorption coefficient increases as well.","Yousefian, Omid; Karbalaeisadegh, Yasamin; Muller, Marie",Physics in medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/abb934; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937603/,370
156396,Airway Management for Emergent Surgeries during COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-01-01,"Importance Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended for children and younger adults but not older adults or those with prior HPV exposure, leaving a large portion of the population at risk for HPV-mediated disease. Emerging data suggest a possible role for vaccination as an adjuvant treatment for individuals with HPV-related clinical disease. Objective To systematically review the literature regarding HPV vaccination for secondary disease prevention after treatment of active clinical disease across disease sites to serve as a platform for the management of HPV-related disease of the head and neck. Evidence Review A systematic search from August 3 to 21, 2015, of the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Biosis Citation Index, Current Contents Connect, Scientific Library Online, and Global Health databases used PRISMA guidelines to identify 326 relevant articles related to adjuvant use of HPV vaccination. Primary search terms were (HPV vaccine OR human papillomavirus vaccine OR papillomarvirus vaccines OR alphapapillomavirus vaccine) AND (HPV OR human papillomavirus OR alphapapillomavirus OR papillomaviridae OR virus warts OR wart virus) AND (recurrence OR relapse OR reoccurrence OR recurrences OR relapses OR relapsing). Forty-five full texts in English were reviewed, with 19 articles included in the final review. In some studies, subpopulations of individuals with HPV DNA positivity and/or seropositivity were extracted for inclusion. Included studies were assessed for bias and separated based on the presence of active clinical disease or HPV DNA positivity or seropositivity. Findings Nineteen studies with 22 474 unique patients were included in the review. When HPV vaccination was used as an adjuvant treatment for active clinical disease, 9 of 12 studies reported decreased disease recurrence, decreased disease burden, or increased intersurgical interval. In contrast, none of the 7 studies of vaccination in individuals with HPV DNA positivity and/or seropositivity without clinical disease reported improved outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance Differences between adjuvant vaccination in HPV-mediated clinical disease and vaccination in HPV DNA-positive and/or HPV-seropositive populations posit underlying differences in disease and immune processes. These data suggest that additional evaluation of adjuvant HPV vaccination in individuals with active clinical disease is warranted.","Dion, Gregory R; Teng, Stephanie; Boyd, Leslie R; Northam, Antonia; Mason-Apps, Charlotte; Vieira, Dorice; Amin, Milan R; Branski, Ryan C",JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2016.4736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334393/,370

156897,Symptoms and responses to critical incidents in paramedics who have experienced childhood abuse and neglect.,2012,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the most common clinical infectious disease threatening the safety of human life. Herein, we provided a sensitive and specific method for detection and differentiation of RSV subgroups A (RSVA) and B (RSVB) with colorimetric toehold switch sensors in a paper-based cell-free system. In this method, we applied the toehold switch, an RNA-based riboswitch, to regulate the translation level of β-galactosidase (lacZ) gene. In the presence of target trigger RNA, the toehold switch sensor was activated and the expressed LacZ hydrolyzed chromogenic substrates to produce a colorimetric result that can be observed directly with the naked eye in a cell-free system. In addition, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) was used to improve the sensitivity by amplifying target trigger RNAs. Under optimal conditions, our method produced a visible result for the detection of RSVA and RSVB with the detection limit of 52 aM and 91 aM, respectively. The cross-reaction of this method was validated with other closely related respiratory viruses, including human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, we used the paper-based carrier material that allows stable storage of our detection elements and rapid detection outside laboratory. In conclusion, this method can sensitively and specifically differentiate RSVA and RSVB and generate a visible colorimetric result without specialized operators and sophisticated equipment. Based on these advantages above, this method serves as a simple and portable detector in resource-poor areas and point-of-care testing (POCT) scenarios.","Cao, Mengcen; Sun, Qiuli; Zhang, Xu; Ma, Yi; Wang, Jufang",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113173; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773383/,370
157442,Development of an education campaign to reduce delays in pre-hospital response to stroke.,2017,"BACKGROUND Because etomidate impairs adrenal function and blunts the cortisol release associated with surgical stimulus, we hypothesized that patients induced with etomidate suffer greater mortality and morbidity than comparable patients induced with propofol. METHODS We evaluated the electronic records of 31,148 ASA physical status III and IV patients who had noncardiac surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. Among these, anesthesia was induced with etomidate and maintained with volatile anesthetics in 2616 patients whereas 28,532 were given propofol for induction and maintained with volatile anesthetics. Two thousand one hundred forty-four patients given etomidate were propensity matched with 5233 patients given propofol and the groups compared on 30-day postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, cardiovascular and infectious morbidities, vasopressor requirement, and intraoperative hemodynamics. RESULTS Patients given etomidate had 2.5 (98% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-3.4) times the odds of dying than those given propofol. Etomidate patients also had significantly greater odds of having cardiovascular morbidity (odds ratio [OR] [98% CI]: 1.5 [1.2-2.0]), and significantly longer hospital stay (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.78-0.87]). However, infectious morbidity (OR [98% CI]: 1.0 [0.8-1.2]) and intraoperative vasopressor use (OR [95% CI] 0.92: [0.82-1.0]) did not differ between the agents. CONCLUSION Etomidate was associated with a substantially increased risk for 30-day mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and prolonged hospital stay. Our conclusions, especially on 30-day mortality, are robust to a strong unmeasured binary confounding variable. Although our study showed only an association between etomidate use and worse patients' outcomes but not causal relationship, clinicians should use etomidate judiciously, considering that improved hemodynamic stability at induction may be accompanied by substantially worse longer-term outcomes.","Komatsu, Ryu; You, Jing; Mascha, Edward J; Sessler, Daniel I; Kasuya, Yusuke; Turan, Alparslan",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318299a516; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24257383/,370
158206,"Tics, TikTok and COVID-19.",2021-03-12,"Existing methods for RNA diagnostics, such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), mainly rely on nucleic acid amplification (NAA) and RT processes, which are known to introduce substantial issues, including amplification bias, cross-contamination, and sample loss. To address these problems, we introduce a confinement effect-inspired Cas13a assay for single-molecule RNA diagnostics, eliminating the need for NAA and RT. This assay involves confining the RNA-triggered Cas13a catalysis system in cell-like-sized reactors to enhance local concentrations of target and reporter simultaneously, via droplet microfluidics. It achieves >10 000-fold enhancement in sensitivity when compared to the bulk Cas13a assay and enables absolute digital single-molecule RNA quantitation. We experimentally demonstrate its broad applicability for precisely counting microRNAs, 16S rRNAs, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA from synthetic sequences to clinical samples with excellent accuracy. Notably, this direct RNA diagnostic technology enables detecting a wide range of RNA molecules at the single-molecule level. Moreover, its simplicity, universality, and excellent quantification capability might render it to be a dominant rival to RT-qPCR.","Tian, Tian; Shu, Bowen; Jiang, Yongzhong; Ye, Miaomiao; Liu, Lei; Guo, Zhonghui; Han, Zeping; Wang, Zhang; Zhou, Xiaoming",ACS nano,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c08165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33498106/,370
160166,Self-collection combined with pooled testing: how reliable to accept as evidence?,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS With the increasing emphasis on developing effective telemedicine approaches in Otolaryngology, this study explored whether a single composite image stitched from a digital otoscopy video provides acceptable diagnostic information to make an accurate diagnosis, as compared with that provided by the full video. STUDY DESIGN Diagnostic survey analysis. METHODS Five Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physicians reviewed the same set of 78 digital otoscope eardrum videos from four eardrum conditions: normal, effusion, retraction, and tympanosclerosis, along with the composite images generated by a SelectStitch method that selectively uses video frames with computer-assisted selection, as well as a Stitch method that incorporates all the video frames. Participants provided a diagnosis for each item along with a rating of diagnostic confidence. Diagnostic accuracy for each pathology of SelectStitch was compared with accuracy when reviewing the entire video clip and when reviewing the Stitch image. RESULTS There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy for physicians reviewing SelectStitch images and full video clips, but both provided better diagnostic accuracy than Stitch images. The inter-reader agreement was moderate. CONCLUSIONS Equal to using full video clips, composite images of eardrums generated by SelectStitch provided sufficient information for ENTs to make the correct diagnoses for most pathologies. These findings suggest that use of a composite eardrum image may be sufficient for telemedicine approaches to ear diagnosis, eliminating the need for storage and transmission of large video files, along with future applications for improved documentation in electronic medical record systems, patient/family counseling, and clinical training.

The combined nasal and throat swab is used widely, but its diagnostic performance is uncertain. MethodsIn a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study conducted in secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, we evaluated the combined nasal and throat swab with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in consecutive patients admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. Diagnostic performance of the index and serial tests was evaluated for a primary outcome of confirmed or probable COVID-19, and a secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. The diagnosis was adjudicated by a panel, who recorded clinical, laboratory and radiological features blinded to the test results. ResultsWe enrolled 1,369 consecutive patients (68 [53-80] years, 47% women) who underwent a total of 3,822 tests (median 2 [1-3] tests per patient). The primary outcome occurred in 36% (496/1,369), of whom 65% (323/496) and 35% (173/496) had confirmed and probable COVID-19, respectively. The index test was positive in 255/496 (51%) patients with the primary outcome, giving a sensitivity and specificity of 51.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48.8 to 54.1%) and 99.5% (95% CI 99.0 to 99.8%). Sensitivity increased in those undergoing 2, 3 or 4 tests to 60.1% (95% CI 56.7 to 63.4%), 68.3% (95% CI 64.0 to 72.3%) and 77.6% (95% CI 72.7 to 81.9%), respectively. The sensitivity of the index test was 78.9% (95% CI 74.4 to 83.2%) for the secondary outcome of confirmed COVID-19 on serial testing. ConclusionsIn patients admitted to hospital, a single combined nasal and throat swab with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 has excellent specificity, but limited diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.

We study the incidence and the evolution of self-disclosure temporally as important events unfold throughout the pandemic’s timeline. Using a BERT-based supervised learning approach, we label a dataset of over 31 million COVID-19 related tweets for self-disclosure. We map users’ self-disclosure patterns, characterize personal revelations, and examine users’ disclosures within evolving reply networks. We employ natural language processing models and social network analyses to investigate self-disclosure patterns in users’ interaction networks as they seek social connectedness and focused conversations during COVID-19 pandemic. Our analyses show heightened self-disclosure levels in tweets following the World Health Organization’s declaration of pandemic worldwide on March 11, 2020. We disentangle network-level patterns of self-disclosure and show how self-disclosure characterizes temporally persistent social connections. We argue that in pursuit of social rewards users intentionally self-disclose and associate with similarly disclosing users. Finally, our work illustrates that in this pursuit users may disclose intimate personal health information such as personal ailments and underlying conditions which pose privacy risks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Umar, P.; Akiti, C.; Squicciarini, A.; Rajtmajer, S.","European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86514-6_17,370

Phylogenetic analysis of 79 genomes we generated from across Arizona revealed a minimum of 9 distinct introductions throughout February and March. We show that >80% of our sequences descend from clades that were initially circulating widely in Europe but have since dominated the outbreak in the United States. In addition, we show that the first reported case of community transmission in Arizona descended from the Washington state outbreak that was discovered in late February. Notably, none of the observed transmission clusters are epidemiologically linked to the original travel-related cases in the state, suggesting successful early isolation and quarantine. Finally, we use molecular clock analyses to demonstrate a lack of identifiable, widespread cryptic transmission in Arizona prior to the middle of February 2020.","Ladner, J. T.; Larsen, B.

METHODS: MEDLINE (accessed from PubMed), Science Direct, and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched in English from December 01, 2019 to August 15, 2020, using MESH terms and related keywords. After reading the title and the abstract, unrelated studies were excluded. The full texts of the studies were evaluated by authors, independently, and the quality of the studies was determined. Then, the data were extracted and reported. RESULTS: 12 studies were included. Five studies investigated the risks factors associated with burnout; none could establish a causal relationship because of their methodology. No study examined any intervention to prevent or reduce burnout, and the provided recommendations were based on the authors' experiences and opinions. None of the studies followed up the participants, and all assessments were done according to the participants’ self-reporting and declaration. Assessing burnout in the HCPs working in the frontline wards was performed in four studies; others evaluated burnout among all HCPs working in the regular and frontline wards. CONCLUSION: Paying attention to the mental health issues, reducing the workload of HCPs through adjusting their work shifts, reducing job-related stressors, and creating a healthy work environment may prevent or reduce the burnout.","Sharifi, Mehrdad; Asadi-Pooya, Ali Akbar; Mousavi-Roknabadi, Razieh Sadat",Arch Acad Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7812159/,370

Al-though it is a minor procedure, there is no consensus on the optimal repair technique. The readmission rate is surprisingly high due to postoperative pain, wound-related complications, and long-term results in terms of recurrence and chronic pain is not well investigated. The overall objective of this thesis was to improve early and long-term postoperative outcomes after repair for umbilical or epigastric hernias. The present thesis consisted of one RCT, one protocol article for a running RCT, and two register-based cohort studies. An abdominal binder had no analgesic effects or impact on seroma formation. We await early and late post-operative outcomes from a running RCT studying clinical effect of closing the hernia defect (inclusion is expected to end in October 2015). The two cohort studies included in the present theses found that mesh repair halved the long-term risk of recurrence compared with sutured repair. Mesh repair did not increase the risk of chronic pain or rate of reoperation for complications.","Christoffersen, Mette Maria Willaume",Danish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26522486/,370

189502,[COVID-19 : Intensive care management].,2020-04-29,"INTRODUCTION Vaccination remains a key strategy to living endemically with COVID-19. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was first granted interim authorisation for use in Singapore in December 2020. With overseas studies published about the safety and side effect profiles of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines focusing mainly on non-Asian populations, we described the side effects of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination experienced by the healthcare workers (HCWs) in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. METHODS Data were obtained from the Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) at the National University Hospital in Singapore, which monitored staff for any adverse effects within 30 minutes post vaccination on-site and any adverse effects after that. A cross-sectional study among the vaccinated HCWs was conducted using an online survey, which established basic demographics, histories of allergies or atopic disorders, and adverse events encountered after dose 1 and dose 2 of vaccination. RESULTS No anaphylaxis was reported. Most common symptom was giddiness (32.7%) experienced by HCWs within 30 minutes. Adverse events attended post-vaccination by OHC were generally mild and self-limiting. From the survey, odds of experiencing an adverse event after dose 2 was significantly higher than after the first dose, especially for fever/chills (odds ratio [OR] 22.5). Fever/chills, injection site reactions, headache, aches and pains, and feeling unwell were significantly more common in HCWs below 60 years compared to those ≥60 years. An allergy to food (adjusted OR 2.7) and a history of eczema/sensitive skin (adjusted OR 2.6) were associated with a skin reaction not at injection site. CONCLUSION The side effects experienced after Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are generally self-limiting and mild, with no anaphylaxis reported.","Lim, See Ming; Chan, Hwang Ching; Santosa, Amelia; Quek, Swee Chye; Liu, Eugene Hern Choon; Somani, Jyoti","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625758/,370
190262,A survey on the impact of COVID-19 on incomes and practice patterns of private-sector physicians in Singapore.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used for spontaneous pneumothorax (SP). In recent years, thoracic surgeons have attempted single incision or single port surgery with the development of surgical technology and skills. Theoretically, single port surgery is expected to provide benefits such as less pain and early recovery. The purpose of this study was to determine the benefits of single port surgery in SP. METHODS The 107 patients with SP who underwent surgery, between July 2013 and May 2015, were reviewed retrospectively. The patients with secondary pneumothorax, who underwent open procedures and lacking of medical records were excluded. Visual analog scale (VAS), paresthesia and clinical outcomes were reviewed in 86 patients (46 patients: three-port, 40 patients: 11.5 mm guided single-port). RESULTS The mean age was 23.4 years in three-port and 22.4 in single-port (P=0.247). The height and body weight were not significantly difference between two groups. The mean operation time was 39 minutes (mins) in the three-port and 37.3 mins in the single port without statistical difference (P=0.204). The pain score in the single port surgery was significantly lower after postoperative day (POD) 1 (P=0.028). However chest tube duration time was significantly shorter in the single port group (P<0.001). After exclusion of the patients with chest tube removal within postoperative 1 day, the pain score was not significantly different at the POD 1 between two groups (P=0.176). The pain score between two groups were not different at 1 week after discharge. CONCLUSIONS The pain score reduction was found 1 day after operation in the single port group. However, the chest tube duration time was significantly shorter in the single port group and the pain score was not different at 1 week after discharge. Considering young age in primary SP, the benefit of single port surgery in SP was minimal.","Jeon, Hyun Woo; Kim, Young-Du",Journal of thoracic disease,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27867569/,370
192006,Estimating the impact of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site surgery has rapidly progressed from the animal laboratory to clinical use since mass production of multichannel ports began in 2007. Indeed, it has now been shown to be feasible and safe for many commonly performed operations. METHODS This study cohort comprised 22 unselected patients with abdominal wall hernias of varying types: multiply recurrent inguinal (n = 2), suprapubic (n = 1), ventral/incisional (n = 17), and parastomal hernias (n = 2), who underwent laparoendoscopic single-site ventral hernia repair between December 2009 and February 2011. Standard dissecting instruments and a 52 cm/5.5 mm/ 30 degree angle laparoscope were used. RESULTS Patients included 14 men and 8 women, with a median age of 56 (range, 32 to 78) years and a mean body mass index of 31.5 +/- 4.7 kg/m2. The mean mesh size was 460 cm2 (range, 225 to 884 cm2). Mean operation time was 125 minutes for ventral/incisional hernias and 270 minutes for parastomal hernias. No conversions to multiport or open surgeries were necessary. There was no mortality or morbidity, and no recurrence at 6- to 18-month follow-up. The mean satisfaction score was 2.7 (range, 2 to 3) with no patients reporting dissatisfaction with the procedure. CONCLUSION This series, though relatively small, represents a diverse group of patients with varying abdominal wall hernias, including parastomal hernias. These successful laparoendoscopic single-site surgeries, with no complications, demonstrate safety and efficacy, albeit in a specialized hernia center. This study is a prelude to the eventual validation of laparoendoscopic single-site hernia surgery with prospective randomized controlled trials.","Tran, Hanh",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23477172/,370

194827,"Adapting to the ""New Normal"" in Orthopaedic Trauma During COVID-19.",2020-08-01,"During routine harvest of murine resident peritoneal cells for macrophage function assays the authors recently noted that mice showed a 3-4-fold spontaneous increase in number of peritoneal cells within 1 week of being placed in one of their animal rooms. While the mice appeared clinically normal, the collected macrophages had highly convoluted membranes, showed enhanced spontaneous tumor cell killing, and showed increased erythrophagocytosis. Histopathologic findings included mild peritonitis and occasional foci of individual hepatocyte necrosis. The results of routine murine serologic studies and bacterial cultures of the peritoneal cavity were negative. Immunosuppressed mice placed in this room showed severe hepatic necrosis within 4 days, and ultrastructural particles characteristic of corona virus could be demonstrated in the necrotic foci. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was isolated from these livers. Untreated mice showed positive MHV titers, as detected by the enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) after 21 days in the room. This episode demonstrates that MHV have profound effects on macrophage parameters while causing few clinical signs or histopathologic alterations. Secondly, the complement fixation assay for MHV as included in routine viral screens appears relatively insensitive for detecting outbreaks of MHV.","Boorman, G A; Luster, M I; Dean, J H; Campbell, M L; Lauer, L A; Talley, F A; Wilson, R E; Collins, M J",The American journal of pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6275707/,370

194979,Impact of COVID-19 on a Tertiary Otolaryngology Practice in Singapore.,2020-11-01,"Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) has shown great potential as a new viral vector for vaccination. However, the prototypic rVSV vector described previously was found to be insufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation when assessed for neurovirulence in nonhuman primates. Here, we describe the attenuation, neurovirulence, and immunogenicity of rVSV vectors expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag. These rVSV vectors were attenuated by combinations of the following manipulations: N gene translocations (N4), G gene truncations (CT1 or CT9), noncytopathic M gene mutations (Mncp), and positioning of the gag gene into the first position of the viral genome (gag1). The resulting N4CT1-gag1, N4CT9-gag1, and MncpCT1-gag1 vectors demonstrated dramatically reduced neurovirulence in mice following direct intracranial inoculation. Surprisingly, in spite of a very high level of attenuation, the N4CT1-gag1 and N4CT9-gag1 vectors generated robust Gag-specific immune responses following intramuscular immunization that were equivalent to or greater than immune responses generated by the more virulent prototypic vectors. MncpCT1-gag1 also induced Gag-specific immune responses following intramuscular immunization that were equivalent to immune responses generated by the prototypic rVSV vector. Placement of the gag gene in the first position of the VSV genome was associated with increased in vitro expression of Gag protein, in vivo expression of Gag mRNA, and enhanced immunogenicity of the vector. These findings demonstrate that through directed manipulation of the rVSV genome, vectors that have reduced neurovirulence and enhanced immunogenicity can be made.","Cooper, David; Wright, Kevin J; Calderon, Priscilla C; Guo, Min; Nasar, Farooq; Johnson, J Erik; Coleman, John W; Lee, Margaret; Kotash, Cheryl; Yurgelonis, Irene; Natuk, Robert J; Hendry, R Michael; Udem, Stephen A; Clarke, David K",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17942549/,370

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is planning a revision of the 2000 and 2003 guidance documents on clinical investigation of new medicinal products for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to achieve consistency with current knowledge in the field. This manuscript summarizes the key output from a collaborative workshop, organized by the Cardiovascular Round Table and the European Affairs Committee of the European Society of Cardiology, involving clinicians, academic researchers, trialists, European and US regulators, and pharmaceutical industry researchers. Specific questions in four key areas were selected as priorities for changes in regulatory guidance: patient selection, endpoints, methodologic issues and issues related to the research for novel agents. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) should be studied separately for therapies aimed at the specific pathophysiology of either condition, particularly for treatment of the acute phase, but can be studied together for other treatments, especially long-term therapy. Unstable angina patients should be excluded from acute phase ACS trials. In general, cardiovascular death and reinfarction are recommended for primary efficacy endpoints; other endpoints may be considered if specifically relevant for the therapy under study. New agents or interventions should be tested against a background of evidence-based therapy with expanded follow-up for safety assessment. In conclusion, new guidance documents for randomized controlled trials in ACS should consider changes regarding patient and endpoint selection and definitions, and trial designs. Specific requirements for the evaluation of novel pharmacological therapies need further clarification.","Bueno, Héctor; de Graeff, Pieter; Richard-Lordereau, Isabelle; Emmerich, Joseph; Fox, Keith Aa; Friedman, Carola P; Gaudin, Christophe; El-Gazayerly, Amany; Goldman, Samantha; Hemmrich, Melanie; Henderson, Robert A; Himmelmann, Anders; Irs, Alar; Jackson, Neville; James, Stefan K; Katus, Hugo A; Laslop, Andrea; Laws, Ian; Mehran, Roxana; Ong, Seleen; Prasad, Krishna; Roffi, Marco; Rosano, Giuseppe Mc; Rose, Martin; Sinnaeve, Peter R; Stough, Wendy Gattis; Thygesen, Kristian; Van de Werf, Frans; Varin, Claire; Verheugt, Freek Wa; de Los Angeles Alonso García, Maria",European heart journal.

Routine pathologic and microbiologic investigations, as well as immunohistochemical staining for detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) antigen, were performed on 99 calves that died or were euthanized within 60 days after arrival. Major disease conditions identified included fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia (49%), caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia or arthritis (or both) caused by Mycoplasma bovis (36%), viral respiratory disease (19%), BVDV-related diseases (21%), Histophilus somni myocarditis (8%), ruminal bloat (2%), and miscellaneous diseases (8%). Viral infections identified were BVDV (35%), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (9%), bovine herpesvirus-1 (6%), parainfluenza-3 virus (3%), and bovine coronavirus (2%). Bacteria isolated from the lungs included M. bovis (82%), Mycoplasma arginini (72%), Ureaplasma diversum (25%), Mannheimia haemolytica (27%), Pasteurella multocida (19%), H. somni (14%), and Arcanobacterium pyogenes (19%). Pneumonia was the most frequent cause of mortality of beef calves during the first 2 months after arrival in feedlots, representing 69% of total deaths. The prevalence of caseonecrotic bronchopneumonia caused by M. bovis was similar to that of fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia, and together, these diseases were the most common causes of pneumonia and death. M. bovis pneumonia and polyarthritis has emerged as an important cause of mortality in Ontario beef feedlots.","Gagea, Mihai I; Bateman, Kenneth G; van Dreumel, Tony; McEwen, Beverly J; Carman, Susy; Archambault, Marie; Shanahan, Rachel A; Caswell, Jeff L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566254/,370

203581,Salivary gland disease in the era of COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) has pointed out that urban taxi drivers and their passengers are at higher risk of transmitting coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) due to frequent contact among many people. Facemask wearing is one of the preventive measures recommended to control the transmission of the virus. A lack of evidence of the proportion of facemask wearing among taxi drivers and associated factors in Ethiopia, including Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, hinders the design of targeted interventions to advocate for facemask use. This study was designed to address this gap. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town from July to August, 2020. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling technique after proportionally allocating the sample size from the total number of taxi drivers working in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. The data were collected by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. The collected data were checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analyses were employed using 95% CI (confidence interval). From bivariate logistic regression analysis, variables with p-value < 0.250 were retained into multivariable logistic regression analysis. Then, from the multivariable analysis, variables with p-value < 0.050 were declared as factors significantly associated with facemask wearing among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. MAIN FINDINGS: The proportion of taxi drivers who wore a facemask was 54.68% [95%CI: 50.10-59.7%]. The majority (58.3%) of drivers were using cloth facemasks, followed by N95 facemasks (24.5%) and surgical facemasks (17.3%). Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, more than two-thirds (69.8%) of them had a good knowledge about COVID-19 and 67.6% of taxi drivers had a positive attitude towards taking precautions against transmission of COVID-19. Three-fourths (74.1%) of the taxi drivers believed that wearing a facemask could prevent COVID-19. More than half (52.5%) felt discomfort when wearing a facemask. Almost three-fourths (72.2%) of taxi drivers felt that the presence of local government pressure helped them to wear a facemask. We found that marital status [AOR = 3.14, 95%CI: 1.97-5.01], fear of the disease [AOR = 2.1, 95%CI: 1.28-3.47], belief in the effectiveness of a facemask [AOR = 5.6, 95%CI: 3.1-10.16] and feeling government pressure [AOR = 3.6, 95%CI: 2.16-6.13] were factors significantly associated with wearing a facemask. CONCLUSION: We found that the proportion of facemask wearers among taxi drivers was relatively low in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. In order to increase that number, government bodies should work aggressively to encourage more taxi drivers to wear a facemask. We also recommend that government and non-government organizations work very closely together to implement strategies that promote facemask use, including increasing the availability of inexpensive facemasks, and monitoring and controlling facemask use.","Natnael, Tarikuwa; Alemnew, Yeshiwork; Berihun, Gete; Abebe, Masresha; Andualem, Atsedemariam; Ademe, Sewunet; Tegegne, Belachew; Adane, Metadel",PLoS One,,370

Its spread after its origin in the city of Wuhan, China has resulted in a pandemic with the collapse of the health system in several countries, some with enormous social impact and expressive number of deaths as seen in Italy and Spain. Extreme intra and extra-hospital measures have been implemented to decrease the transmission and dissemination of the COVID-19. Regarding the surgical practice, a huge number of procedures considered non-essential or elective were cancelled and postponed until the pandemic is resolved.

COVIDSurg collaborative,2021,"Although our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still fragmentary, the information so far accrued on the tropism and life cycle of its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, together with the emerging clinical data, suffice to indicate that the severe acute pulmonary syndrome is the main, but not the only manifestation of COVID-19. Necropsy studies are increasingly revealing underlying endothelial vasculopathies in the form of micro-haemorrhages and micro-thrombi. Intertwined with defective antiviral responses, dysregulated coagulation mechanisms, abnormal hyper-inflammatory reactions and responses, COVID-19 is disclosing a wide pathophysiological palette. An additional property in categorising the disease is the combination of tissue (e.g. neuro- and vasculo-tropism) with organ tropism, whereby the virus preferentially attacks certain organs with highly developed capillary beds, such as the lungs gastrointestinal tract, kidney and brain. These multiple clinical presentations confirm that the acute respiratory syndrome as described initially is increasingly unfolding as a more complex nosological entity, a multiorgan syndrome of systemic breadth. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19, the focus of this review, reflect this manifold nature of the disease.","Barrantes, Francisco J",Brain Behav Immun Health,,370
205789,Evolving Nurse Leadership Role in 2020,2020,"It is general wisdom that likely charged colloidal particles repel each other when suspended in liquids. This is in perfect agreement with mean field theories being developed more than 60 years ago. Accordingly, it was a big surprise when several groups independently reported long-ranged attractive components in the pair potential U(r) of equally charged colloids. This so-called like-charge attraction (LCA) was only observed in thin sample cells while the pair-interaction in unconfined suspensions has been experimentally confirmed to be entirely repulsive. Despite considerable experimental and theoretical efforts, LCA remains one of the most challenging mysteries in colloidal science. We experimentally reinvestigate the pair-potential U(r) of charged colloidal particles with digital video microscopy and demonstrate that optical distortions in the particles images lead to slightly erroneous particle positions. If not properly taken into account, this artefact pretends a minimum in U(r) which was in the past misleadingly interpreted as LCA. After correcting optical distortions we obtain entirely repulsive pair interactions which show good agreement with linearized mean field theories.","Baumgartl, Joerg; Arauz-Lara, Jose Luis; Bechinger, Clemens",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0605106v1.pdf,370

208541,Reply: Failure of Free Flaps in Head and Neck Oncology Surgery in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The patient panels of graduating residents must be reassigned by the end of residency. This process affects over 1 million patients annually within the specialty of family medicine. The purpose of this project was to implement a structured, year-end reassignment system in a family medicine residency program. METHODS: Our structured reassignment process took place from December 2017 through June 2020. Panel lists of current, active patients were generated and residents were responsible for reassigning their own panels during a panel reassignment night. We created a tip sheet that addressed patient complexity and continuity, a risk stratification algorithm based on patients' medical and social complexity, and a tool that tracked the number of patients assigned to each future provider. Outcome measures included a resident satisfaction survey administered in 2018-2020 and patient-provider continuity measured with a run chart from December 2016 through August 2020. RESULTS: The resident survey response rate was 75%. Seventy-three percent felt the panel reassignment night was very helpful; 87% thought the reassignment timeline was extremely reasonable, and 87% indicated that they had the necessary information to reassign their patients. Residents also felt confident that their patients were reassigned appropriately (33% extremely confident, 67% somewhat confident). Patient continuity improved with a 13-point run above the median, indicating nonrandom variation. Patient continuity remained above the median until the impact of COVID-19 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: Our structured reassignment process was received positively by residents and resulted in improved patient continuity.","Compton, Rebekah; Sebring, Amanda; Dalrymple, Sarah; Rollins, Lisa K",Fam Med,,370

In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic, the key regulatory measures are taken by the infection control authority of the hospital. The Donabedian model suggests that this process is considered as structure, process, and outcome review measures. Structural changes include surveillance, screening measures, creation of outpatient clinics for COVID-suspected patients, and separate isolated bay for collection of the nasopharyngeal swab. Structural processes also include the creation of separate intensive care units (ICUs) and theaters for infected patients, negative pressure gradient in the operating room (OR), and sites where aerosol generation could occur. Creation of operational pathways such as intubation in the ICU and in the OR should be included in this. The process involves training of HCWs at various levels on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Provision of adequate numbers of PPE and cleaning solutions and establishing the diagnostic pathways such as the antigen test, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, or nucleic acid amplification test are part of the processes set up by any organization. Outcome analysis involves rates of HCW infection from COVID care wards and ICU, patients testing positive at screening, and patients who may test positive after they undergo treatment at the facility. Long-term outcome measure may include mortality and length of hospital stay.","Kumar, L.; Satheesan, K. N.; Ramachandran, M. A.",Indian Journal of Respiratory Care,,370

The lockdown data were compared with 2018 and 2019 observed data. PM10 values during lockdown were reduced by 3.75 to 4.5 times as compared with previous 2 years. Similarly, four-fold reduction of PM2.5 and SPM values was observed during lockdown. The gaseous pollutants like NO2 and O3 are within safe limit. Overall air quality index (AQI) improved significantly during lockdown. Similarly, there was drastic reduction in the majority of the nutrient parameters in the coastal water. Different heavy metal concentration in the coastal sediments samples also showed strong reduction during lockdown sampling in comparison with other two sampling. This proves that the coastal environment has its efficient self-cleaning potentials if there is considerable reduction in the anthropogenic as well as industrial activities. Diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton also increased. The results were validated using statistical techniques like analysis of variance and least significance difference (LSD).","Chanchpara, Amit; Sonpal, Vasavdutta; Mehta, Gauravkumar; Sahoo, Tarini Prasad; Thorat, Ravikumar Bhagwan; Ray, Sanak; Haldar, Soumya",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,370

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC, especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastatic BC.","Juanjuan, Li; Santa-Maria, Cesar Augusto; Hongfang, Feng; Lingcheng, Wang; Pengcheng, Zhang; Yuanbing, Xu; Yuyan, Tan; Zhongchun, Liu; Bo, Du; Meng, Lan; Qingfeng, Yang; Feng, Yao; Yi, Tu; Shengrong, Sun; Xingrui, Li; Chuang, Chen",Clin Breast Cancer,,370

238890,World Malaria Day 2021: Commemorating 15 Years of Contribution by the United States President's Malaria Initiative,2021,"Digital contact tracing apps for COVID, such as the one developed by Google and Apple, need to estimate the risk that a user was infected during a particular exposure, in order to decide whether to notify the user to take precautions, such as entering into quarantine, or requesting a test. Such risk score models contain numerous parameters that must be set by the public health authority. In this paper, we show how to automatically learn these parameters from data. Our method needs access to exposure and outcome data. Although this data is already being collected (in an aggregated, privacy-preserving way) by several health authorities, in this paper we limit ourselves to simulated data, so that we can systematically study the different factors that affect the feasibility of the approach. In particular, we show that the parameters become harder to estimate when there is more missing data (e.g., due to infections which were not recorded by the app), and when there is model misspecification. Nevertheless, the learning approach outperforms a strong manually designed baseline. Furthermore, the learning approach can adapt even when the risk factors of the disease change, e.g., due to the evolution of new variants, or the adoption of vaccines.","Murphy, Kevin; Kumar, Abhishek; Serghiou, Stylianos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08415v2.pdf,370

We find slightly increased infection prevalence among non-O types. Risk of intubation was decreased among A and increased among AB and B types, compared with type O, while risk of death was increased for type AB and decreased for types A and B. We estimate Rh-negative blood type to have a protective effect for all three outcomes.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei. Methods: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients' recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata. Results: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined. Conclusion: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long. In addition to re-evaluating the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, this study provided a model for monitoring outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries across the world.","Yu, Bin; Chen, Xinguang; Rich, Shannan; Mo, Qiqing; Yan, Hong",,,370

It is determined that the main challenges of our time, which exacerbate the problem of disinformation, are Russia's information policy and the COVID-19 pandemic. The main institutions and regulations of Europe, which are aimed at overcoming the spread of false information in the media, are analyzed. The experience of France is mentioned, which created a powerful legal mechanism to prevent misinformation and combat its manifestations. The current state of US information security and the effectiveness of the US policy of combating disinformation are described. Special attention is paid to the issues of media and cyber education of the population. The latest trends in the institutionalization of countering misinformation and disinformation in Ukraine and ways to improve the strengthening of information security in the country are studied. It is established that Ukraine, as a direct participant in the information war, is obliged to support and involve at the national level European initiatives to strengthen information security and cyber security. The first steps include updating the legislation on information, increasing the role of information security in national security acts, approving the Strategy for Counteracting Disinformation and the Strategy for Ensuring Information Security, and institutionalizing the fight against misinformation and disinformation. © 2021, Journal of Legal, Ethical and Regulatory Issues.

258410,Is this the end of the Oral and Maxillofacial Toolbox? A retrospective analysis of funding for acute OMFS soft tissue trauma provision within the UK,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreaks have become common in large nursing homes, placing not only residents but also staff and community members at risk for infection. However, the relationship between larger nursing homes and the community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been documented. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between county average nursing home bed size and presence of certificate of need (CON) laws, which influence nursing home size, with county-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence over time. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using county-level data from March 11 through June 12, 2020. PARTICIPANTS: All US counties with at least one nursing home (n = 2,883). MAIN MEASURES: The main explanatory variables were county average nursing home bed size and presence of a CON law. The main outcome was the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases on each day of the study period adjusted for county population size and density, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, total nursing home bed supply, other health care supply measures, epidemic stage, and census region. KEY RESULTS: By June 12, a between-county difference in average nursing home size equal to 1 bed was associated with 3.92 additional SARS-COV-2 cases (95% CI = 2.14 to 5.69; P < 0.001), on average, and counties subject to CON laws had 104.53 additional SARS-CoV-2 cases (95% CI = 7.68 to 201.38; P < 0.05), on average. Counties with larger nursing homes also demonstrated higher growth in the frequency of SARS-COV-2 throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: At the county level, average nursing home size and CON law presence was associated with a greater frequency of SARS-CoV-2 cases. Controlling the impact of the coronavirus 2019 pandemic may require additional resources for communities with larger nursing homes and more attention towards long-term care policies.","Kosar, Cyrus M; Rahman, Momotazur",J. gen. intern. med,,370
263068,Virtual Visits and the Future of No-Shows,2020,"BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents major challenges. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is used to diagnose a current infection, but its utility as a reference standard is constrained by sampling errors, limited sensitivity (71% to 98%), and dependence on the timing of specimen collection. Chest imaging tests are being used in the diagnosis of COVID-19 disease, or when RT-PCR testing is unavailable. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest imaging (computed tomography (CT), X-ray and ultrasound) in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and The Stephen B. Thacker CDC Library. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 5 May 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of all designs that produce estimates of test accuracy or provide data from which estimates can be computed. We included two types of cross-sectional designs: a) where all patients suspected of the target condition enter the study through the same route and b) where it is not clear up front who has and who does not have the target condition, or where the patients with the target condition are recruited in a different way or from a different population from the patients without the target condition. When studies used a variety of reference standards, we included all of them. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We screened studies and extracted data independently, in duplicate. We also assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns independently, in duplicate, using the QUADAS-2 checklist and presented the results of estimated sensitivity and specificity, using paired forest plots, and summarised in tables. We used a hierarchical meta-analysis model where appropriate. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 84 studies, falling into two categories: studies with participants with confirmed diagnoses of COVID-19 at the time of recruitment (71 studies with 6331 participants) and studies with participants suspected of COVID-19 (13 studies with 1948 participants, including three case-control studies with 549 cases and controls). Chest CT was evaluated in 78 studies (8105 participants), chest X-ray in nine studies (682 COVID-19 cases), and chest ultrasound in two studies (32 COVID-19 cases). All evaluations of chest X-ray and ultrasound were conducted in studies with confirmed diagnoses only. Twenty-five per cent (21/84) of all studies were available only as preprints, 15/71 studies in the confirmed cases group and 6/13 of the studies in the suspected group. Among 71 studies that included confirmed cases, 41 studies had included symptomatic cases only, 25 studies had included cases regardless of their symptoms, five studies had included asymptomatic cases only, three of which included a combination of confirmed and suspected cases. Seventy studies were conducted in Asia, 2 in Europe, 2 in North America and one in South America. Fifty-one studies included inpatients while the remaining 24 studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings. Risk of bias was high in most studies, mainly due to concerns about selection of participants and applicability. Among the 13 studies that included suspected cases, nine studies were conducted in Asia, and one in Europe. Seven studies included inpatients while the remaining three studies were conducted in mixed or unclear settings. In studies that included confirmed cases the pooled sensitivity of chest CT was 93.1% (95%CI: 90.2 - 95.0 (65 studies, 5759 cases); and for X-ray 82.1% (95%CI: 62.5 to 92.7 (9 studies, 682 cases). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the ROC plots was considerable. Two studies evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound and both reported zero false negatives (with 10 and 22 participants having undergone ultrasound, respectively). These studies only reported True Positive and False Negative data, therefore it was not possible to pool and derive estimates of specificity. In studies that included suspected cases, the pooled sensitivity of CT was 86.2% (95%CI: 71.9 to 93.8 (13 studies, 2346 participants) and specificity was 18.1% (95%CI: 3.71 to 55.8). Heterogeneity judged by visual assessment of the forest plots was high. Chest CT may give approximately the same proportion of positive results for patients with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection: the chances of getting a positive CT result are 86% (95% CI: 72 to 94) in patient with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 82% (95% CI: 44 to 96) in patients without. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty resulting from the poor study quality and the heterogeneity of included studies limit our ability to confidently draw conclusions based on our results. Our findings indicate that chest CT is sensitive but not specific for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients, meaning that CT may not be capable of differentiating SARS-CoV-2 infection from other causes of respiratory illness. This low specificity could also be the result of the poor sensitivity of the reference standard (RT-PCR), as CT could potentially be more sensitive than RT-PCR in some cases. Because of limited data, accuracy estimates of chest X-ray and ultrasound of the lungs for the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be carefully interpreted. Future diagnostic accuracy studies should avoid cases-only studies and pre-define positive imaging findings. Planned updates of this review will aim to: increase precision around the accuracy estimates for CT (ideally with low risk of bias studies); obtain further data to inform accuracy of chest X rays and ultrasound; and continue to search for studies that fulfil secondary objectives to inform the utility of imaging along different diagnostic pathways.","Salameh, Jean-Paul; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Hooft, Lotty; Islam, Nayaar; McGrath, Trevor A; van der Pol, Christian B; Frank, Robert A; Prager, Ross; Hare, Samanjit S; Dennie, Carole; Spijker, René; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Jenniskens, Kevin; Korevaar, Daniël A; Cohen, Jérémie F; Van den Bruel, Ann; Takwoingi, Yemisi; van de Wijgert, Janneke; Damen, Johanna Aag; Wang, Junfeng; McInnes, Matthew Df",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,370

Large retrospective studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro, and in vivo analyses, we report that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as 4 days post-infection reduces morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.","Ho, Jessica Sook Yuin; Mok, Bobo Wing-Yee; Campisi, Laura; Jordan, Tristan; Yildiz, Soner; Parameswaran, Sreeja; Wayman, Joseph A; Gaudreault, Natasha N; Meekins, David A; Indran, Sabarish V; Morozov, Igor; Trujillo, Jessie D; Fstkchyan, Yesai S; Rathnasinghe, Raveen; Zhu, Zeyu; Zheng, Simin; Zhao, Nan; White, Kris; Ray-Jones, Helen; Malysheva, Valeriya; Thiecke, Michiel J; Lau, Siu-Ying; Liu, Honglian; Zhang, Anna Junxia; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Liu, Wen-Chun; Jangra, Sonia; Escalera, Alba; Aydillo, Teresa; Melo, Betsaida Salom; Guccione, Ernesto; Sebra, Robert; Shum, Elaine; Bakker, Jan; Kaufman, David A; Moreira, Andre L; Carossino, Mariano; Balasuriya, Udeni B R; Byun, Minji; Albrecht, Randy A; Schotsaert, Michael; Garcia-Sastre, Adolfo; Chanda, Sumit K; Miraldi, Emily R; Jeyasekharan, Anand D; TenOever, Benjamin R; Spivakov, Mikhail; Weirauch, Matthew T; Heinz, Sven; Chen, Honglin",Cell,,370

Thus, achieving not just vaccine equality (i.e., similar allocation of vaccine supply proportional to its population across jurisdictions) but equity (i.e., preferential access and administra-tion to those who have been most affected by COVID-19 disease) is an important goal. The CDC social vulnerability index (SVI) uses 15 indicators grouped into four themes that comprise an overall SVI measure, resulting in 20 metrics, each of which has national and state-specific county rankings. The 20 metric-specific rankings were each divided into lowest to highest tertiles to categorize counties as low, moderate, or high social vulnerability counties. These tertiles were combined with vaccine administration data for 49,264,338 U.S. residents in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) who received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose during December 14, 2020-March 1, 2021. Nationally, for the overall SVI measure, vaccination coverage was higher (15.8%) in low social vulnerability counties than in high social vulnerability counties (13.9%), with the largest coverage disparity in the socioeconomic status theme (2.5 percentage points higher coverage in low than in high vulnerability counties). Wide state variations in equity across SVI metrics were found. Whereas in the majority of states, vaccination coverage was higher in low vulnerability counties, some states had equitable coverage at the county level. CDC, state, and local jurisdictions should continue to monitor vaccination coverage by SVI metrics to focus public health interventions to achieve equitable coverage with COVID-19 vaccine.","Hughes, Michelle M; Wang, Alice; Grossman, Marissa K; Pun, Eugene; Whiteman, Ari; Deng, Li; Hallisey, Elaine; Sharpe, J Danielle; Ussery, Emily N; Stokley, Shannon; Musial, Trieste; Weller, Daniel L; Murthy, Bhavini Patel; Reynolds, Laura; Gibbs-Scharf, Lynn; Harris, LaTreace; Ritchey, Matt D; Toblin, Robin L",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,370

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May-August 2020 among diagnosed patients of chronic diseases residing in a COVID-19 hotspot of urban Jodhpur, Rajasthan, and availing health services from primary care facility. Telephonic interviews of participants were conducted to determine their health literacy using HLS-EU-Q47 questionnaire, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviour as per World Health Organization recommendations, and compliance to prescribed pharmacological and physical activity recommendations for chronic disease. RESULTS: All the 605 diagnosed patients of chronic diseases availing services from primary care facility were contacted for the study, yielding response rate of 68% with 412 agreeing to participate. Insufficient health literacy was observed for 65.8% participants. Only about half of participants had scored above median for COVID-19 awareness (55.1%) and preventive behavior (45.1%). Health literacy was observed to be significant predictor of COVID-19 awareness [aOR: 3.53 (95% CI: 1.81-6.88)]; COVID-19 preventive behavior [aOR: 2.06, 95%CI; 1.14-3.69] and compliance to pharmacological management [aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.47-6.35] but not for physical activity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 awareness, preventive behavior, and compliance to pharmacological management is associated with health literacy among patients of chronic disease availing services from primary health facility. Focusing on health literacy could thus be an essential strategic intervention yielding long term benefits.","Gautam, Vaishali; S, Dileepan; Rustagi, Neeti; Mittal, Ankit; Patel, Mehul; Shafi, Shazia; Thirunavukkarasu, Prasanna; Raghav, Pankaja",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,370

Electronic systems improve the safety of chemotherapy administration and allow easily accessible patient information and data collection. AIM: To integrate the electronic healthcare delivery systems at a metropolitan hospital and a rural outreach haematology clinic to facilitate streamlined and safe outpatient care. METHOD: The MOSAIQ v2.64(Elekta) system utilized at St Vincent's Hospital was introduced at a linked rural outreach haematology clinic. The two separate comprehensive practice management systems incorporating all patient information were consolidated into one, becoming accessible from both sites. RESULTS: The electronic systems were successfully integrated between the two sites in October 2017. Electronic chemotherapy prescribing at the Griffith site is now guided by inbuilt, pharmacist-reviewed protocols thereby improving the safety and flexibility of remote prescribing. The centralised EHR has improved streamlined care during patient transitions between the two hospitals with enhanced continuity of documentation and management. Increases in total clinic patients and appointment numbers are demonstrable since implementation, and sustained during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a novel example of the successful implementation of a centralised electronic healthcare record and chemotherapy prescribing system in a haematology setting shared between a metropolitan service and a rural outreach hospital clinic. This has positive implications for the safety and efficiency of healthcare delivery at the rural site applicable to all linked rural Australian clinics, as well as allowing data collection to assist future planning of the service.

273395,393 Reducing plastic waste in Paeds ED,2020,"BackgroundSeveral community-based studies have assessed the ability of different symptoms to identify COVID-19 infections, but few have compared symptoms over time (reflecting SARS-CoV-2 variants) and by vaccination status. MethodsUsing data and samples collected by the COVID-19 Infection Survey at regular visits to representative households across the UK, we compared symptoms in new PCR-positives and comparator test-negative controls. ResultsFrom 26/4/2020-7/8/2021, 27,869 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive episodes occurred in 27,692 participants (median 42 years (IQR 22-58)); 13,427 (48%) self-reported symptoms (""symptomatic positive episodes""). The comparator group comprised 3,806,692 test-negative visits (457,215 participants); 130,612 (3%) self-reported symptoms (""symptomatic negative visit""). Reporting of any symptoms in positive episodes varied over calendar time, reflecting changes in prevalence of variants, incidental changes (e.g. seasonal pathogens, schools re-opening) and vaccination roll-out. There was a small increase in sore throat reporting in symptomatic positive episodes and negative visits from April-2021. After May-2021 when Delta emerged there were substantial increases in headache and fever in positives, but not in negatives. Although specific symptom reporting in symptomatic positive episodes vs. negative visits varied by age, sex, and ethnicity, only small improvements in symptom-based infection detection were obtained; e.g. adding fatigue/weakness or all eight symptoms to the classic four symptoms (cough, fever, loss of taste/smell) increased sensitivity from 74% to 81% to 90% but tests per positive from 4.6 to 5.3 to 8.7. ConclusionsWhilst SARS-CoV-2-associated symptoms vary by variant, vaccination status and demographics, differences are modest and do not warrant large-scale changes to targeted testing approaches given resource implications. SummaryWithin the COVID-19 Infection Survey, recruiting representative households across the UK general population, SARS-CoV-2-associated symptoms varied by viral variant, vaccination status and demographics.

281695,"The Next Pandemic: Prepare for ""Disease X""",2020,"BACKGROUND: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a complex cardiovascular disease whose development involves the dysregulation of adaptive immune responses. Though it has been proven that T cells associate with inflammation in the development of ACS, the function of B cells in disease remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to reveal the diversity of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire of patients with ACS. METHODS: We conducted a pilot study to sequence the immune repertoire of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ACS, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina (UA), and quantitatively characterized BCR repertoires by bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: We found that patients with AMI and UA had lower BCR repertoire diversity compared with controls with normal coronary arteries (NCA). Lower percentages of productive unique BCR nt sequences and higher percentages of top 200 unique BCR sequences were identified in AMI and UA patients than NCA controls. Patients had various preferential usage of V and J genes from B cell clones in accordance with the disease severity of coronary arteries. AMI patients had distinct CDR3 amino acids, and their frequency differed among patients with ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that differential BCR signatures represent an imprint of distinct repertoires among ACS patients. This study thereby opens up the prospect of studying disease-relevant B cells to better understand and treat ACS.","Weng, Ruiqiang; Liu, Sudong; Gu, Xiaodong; Zhong, Zhixiong",Genes &amp; genomics (Online),,370
288317,Maxillofacial education in the time of COVID-19: the West Midlands experience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a predilection for infecting the mucosa of the upper and lower airways. Otolaryngologists and supporting health care workers (HCWs) are particularly at high risk of becoming infected while treating patients as many in-office procedures and surgeries are Aerosol Generating Medical Procedures (AGMP). Based on a review of the literature and various guidelines, recommendations are made to mitigate the risk to health care workers of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while providing clinical care. RECOMMENDATIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic all elective and non-time sensitive Otolaryngology procedures should be deferred to mitigate the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs. For non-AGMPs in all patients, even COVID-19 positive patients Level 1 PPE (surgical mask, gown, gloves and face shield or goggles) is sufficient. If local prevalence is favourable and patients are asymptomatic and test negative for SARS-CoV-2, Level 1 PPE can be used during short duration AGMPs, with limited risk of infected aerosol spread. For AGMPs in patients who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a minimum of Level 2 PPE, with adequate protection of mucosal surfaces, is recommended (N95/FFP2 respirator, gown, double gloves, goggles or face shield and head cover). For long duration AGMPs that are deemed high-risk in COVID-19 positive patients, Level 3 PPE can provide a higher level of protection and be more comfortable during long duration surgeries if surgical hoods or PAPRs are used. It is recommended that these procedures are performed in negative pressure rooms, if available. It is essential to follow strict donning and doffing protocols to minimize the risk of contamination. CONCLUSIONS: By following strict infection prevention recommendations, the risk of HCWs becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 while treating patients can be minimized. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves rapidly, these recommendations should serve as guidance and need to be interpreted based on local factors and availability of healthcare resources.","Lammers, Marc J W; Lea, Jane; Westerberg, Brian D",J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,370
288970,Maintaining trauma center operational readiness during a pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health concern. Accurate and rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical for disease control. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a nucleic acid amplification assay similar to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the former being a simple, low cost, and rapid method. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the RT-LAMP assay with RT-PCR using the Loopamp&#8482; SARS-CoV-2 Detection Kit. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and fifty-one nasopharyngeal swab and 88 sputum samples obtained from individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: RT-LAMP had high specificity (98.5 % (95 % CI: 96.9-100 %)), sensitivity (87.0 % (95 % CI: 82.8-91.3 %)), positive predictive value (97.9 % (95 % CI: 96.1-99.7 %)), negative predictive value (90.2 % (95 % CI: 86.4-94.0 %)), and concordance rate (93.3 % (95 % CI: 90.1-96.5 %)). Nasopharyngeal and sputum samples positive in RT-LAMP contained as few as 10.2 and 23.4 copies per 10 µL, respectively. RT-LAMP showed similar performance to RT-PCR for samples with cycle threshold value below 36.

(Special section on COVID-19.),2020,"We carried out an international online survey about changes in everyday mobility during the COVID-19 outbreak in 21 languages, collecting more than 11,000 responses from more than 100 countries In this paper, we present our analysis about commuting travels of the responses between 23 March and 12 May 2020 from the fourteen countries with 100 or more responses, namely Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechia, Germany, Hungary, Iran, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Thailand, and the UK Home office is used typically by between 40% and 60% of working respondents Among people with workplaces with possibility for home office, the percentage is between 60% and 80% Among people with workplaces where presence is essential, the percentage does not typically go beyond 30% This result potentially implies an ultimate magnitude of a strong home office measure Among those who continued to commute but switched commuting transport modes from public transport to others, the COVID-19 infection risk in public transport is the reason that is most often referred to, but many of those who changed to private cars and to bicycles report reduced travel time, too Measures to encourage the use of active travel modes where possible are strongly recommended, as this would potentially mitigate undesirable modal shift towards private motorized modes triggered by perception of infection risks while travelling with public transport © 2021, TU Delft All rights reserved","Shibayama, T.; Sandholzer, F.; Laa, B.; Brezina, T.",European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research,,370
290560,Can COVID-19 Mortality be Predicted in the Emergency Room?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan and rapidly spread globally. The speed and scope of the spread of COVID-19 makes it urgent to define clinical characteristics, serological and radiological changes of the affected patients. METHODS: Seven patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University Yuedong Hospital from January 2020 to March 2020 were retrospectively enrolled and their clinical features, serological and radiological longitudinal changes were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 7 patients, all (100%) had a clear epidemiological history. The most common symptoms were respiratory symptoms 6 (85.7%), and only 2 (28.6%) of the patients had fever at their first visit. The cohort included 4 (57.1%) common types and 3 (42.9%) severe types. Two (28.6%) common type patients developed to severe type in a short time. All of the 7 patients (100%) had abnormal liver function, normal renal function, and normal procalcitonin. The detection time of specific antibody in 7 patients was 5 - 13 days after symptoms. Before the specific antibody could be detected, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased in 2 (28.6%) common type cases transferred to severe type cases accompanied with obvious progress in pulmonary imaging. The phenomenon of decreased albumin and elevated globulin occurred in 6 patients (85.7%). The predominant pattern of lung lesions observed was bilateral (71.4%) and mainly near the pleura at the first diagnosis. Bilateral pulmonary involvement occurred in 6 cases (85.7%) during the course of disease. In 4 cases (57.1%) with obvious pulmonary lesions, the absolute value of lymphocytes decreased, albumin decreased, and globulin increased during the course of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Serum specific antibodies can be detected within 2 weeks of onset. Close observation of the dynamic changes of absolute value of blood lymphocytes, serum albumin, and globulin which were related to pulmonary imaging changes in patients will contribute to assessment of COVID-19.","Yang, Zhiwei; Yu, Mingxue; Li, Ganwen; Liu, Guirong; Xie, Jinjun; Song, Hongzhong; Li, Gang; Jie, Yusheng",Clin. lab,,370
292125,COVID-19: minimising contaminated aerosol spreading during CPAP treatment,2020,"Introduction Au cours de la première vague de la COVID 19 de nombreux soignants ont été contaminés. Dans cette situation sanitaire inédite et dans un contexte d’incertitude sur l’évolution de la maladie, les conséquences physiques et psychologiques possibles nous ont conduites à proposer un bilan à distance en hôpital de jour à tous les soignants dépistés positifs en PCR Covid 19 dans l’établissement. En complément d’un bilan somatique et d’ateliers de groupe (chorale et jeu Trivial-Covid), il s’agissait d’accueillir la parole du soignant, de donner la possibilité de verbaliser l’impact de la maladie dans la vie familiale (contamination des proches, rejet, soutien…) et professionnelle (surcharge de travail, abandon de poste..), de mettre en mot les émotions du vécu de la maladie. Les objectifs étaient de repérer le trauma, les troubles de stress aigus, les troubles de stress post-traumatique (TSPT), et proposer un suivi si nécessaire. Matériels et méthodes Parmi les 142 soignants concernés, 120 ont accepté le bilan entre fin avril et début juillet, 2 mois environ après le diagnostic de Covid-19. Un entretien avec une psychologue a été systématiquement proposé (1 seul refus). Les entretiens ont permis un recueil semi-qualitatif d’items cliniques. Un suivi à distance a été proposé systématiquement, et accepté par 60 (50 %), en groupe de parole, et/ou en entretien individuel. Résultats L’entretien psychologique a été très bien accepté et le nombre d’items cliniques repérés variaient entre 1-5 (76 %) et 6-10 (24 %). Les émotions post-traumatiques les plus fréquemment retrouvées étaient I’inquiétude (78 %), et la peur ou terreur (61 %). La culpabilité (23 %), la tristesse (22,5 %), les situations de rejet (20 %), la colère (17,5 %), le sentiment de solitude (16,6 %) étaient également souvent présentes. Plus rarement, honte (6 %), humiliation (6 %), et stigmatisation (5 %) étaient retrouvées. De façon plus inquiétante, des TSPT ont été repérés, symptômes d’éveil avec angoisse majeure (48 %), humeur négative (15 %), symptômes envahissants (14 %), symptômes d’évitement (6 %), et dissociatifs (4 %). Des idées de mort ont été verbalisées par 44 personnes (36,6 %). Malgré un suivi envisagé pour 60 personnes, seuls 12 soignants ont été revus par les psychologues (1 à 6 séances), et 3 adressés à l’extérieur. Conclusion Dans une population soignante très hétérogène, l’entretien psychologique proposé en HDJ a été accepté par la quasi-totalité des soignants. Une verbalisation des émotions a permis de repérer un taux important d’émotions post-traumatiques, de TSPT, et des idées morbides. Les entretiens psychologiques ont participé à une prise de soin des soignants très importante dans ce contexte, et ont possiblement évité la persistance des symptômes. Malgré un accueil initial très favorable du suivi à distance, seuls 15 soignants ont été revus. Mais l’évaluation globale de cette prise en charge multi disciplinaire était excellente (99/110 réponses notation≥9/10). Ces résultats incitent à la diffusion de cette prise en charge pour le personnel soignant en période de crise.","Phalip-le Besnerais, J.; Dunoyer, S.; Bresson, A.; Khuong-Josses, M.

300222,A Web-Based Lifestyle Intervention Aimed at Improving Cognition in Patients With Cancer Returning to Work in an Outpatient Setting: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,2021,"BACKGROUND: Older patients often have iron deficiency anemia before surgery, which can be effectively treated with intravenous iron supplementation (IVIS). Anemia and blood transfusions are associated with an increased risk of delirium. The aim of this research was to assess the effectiveness and safety of using IVIS in a prehabilitation program. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients &#8805;70 y who underwent abdominal surgery between November 2015 and June 2018 were included in this single-center prospective cohort study. All patients were prehabilitated; however, only anemic patients received a single dose of 1000 mg intravenous iron (ferric carboxymaltose) to increase preoperative hemoglobin levels (IVIS group). Nonanemic patients received standard care (SC). The hemoglobin levels (primary outcome) were assessed at the outpatient clinic visit, at admission, and at discharge. Secondary outcomes were postoperative delirium, postoperative anemia, blood transfusion, complications other than delirium, and length of hospital stay. All outcomes were compared between the IVIS group and SC group. RESULTS: Of all patients (n = 248), 97 anemic patients received IVIS (39%). Of the anemic patients, 50 patients (52%) had iron deficiency. Initial differences in hemoglobin concentrations between the IVIS group and SC group at T1 and T2 (7.2 versus 8.8; P < 0.001 and 7.4 versus 8.6; P = 0.023, respectively) were no longer present at discharge (6.6 versus 7.2; P = 0.35). No statistically significant differences were observed for all secondary outcomes between the IVIS group and the SC group. No infusion-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Adding IVIS to prehabilitation programs is safe and diminishes differences in these concentrations between preoperatively anemic and nonanemic patients. IVIS may be worthwhile as an additional component of prehabilitation programs. Results merit further investigation.","Janssen, Ties L; Steyerberg, Ewout W; van Gammeren, Adriaan J; Ho, Gwan H; Gobardhan, Paul D; van der Laan, Lijckle",J Surg Res,,370
303046,Concurrent Antibiotic Therapy in Disseminated Strongyloidiasis,2020,"Importance: Accumulating evidence suggests that children infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more likely to manifest mild symptoms and are at a lower risk of developing severe respiratory disease compared with adults. It remains unknown how the immune response in children differs from that of adolescents and adults. Objective: To investigate the association of age with the quantity and quality of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used 31â¯426 SARS-CoV-2 antibody test results from pediatric and adult patients. Data were collected from a New York City hospital from April 9 to August 31, 2020. The semiquantitative immunoglobin (Ig) G levels were compared between 85 pediatric and 3648 adult patients. Further analysis of SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles was performed on sera from 126 patients aged 1 to 24 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rates and IgG levels were evaluated in patients from a wide range of age groups (1-102 years). SARS-CoV-2 IgG level, total antibody (TAb) level, surrogate neutralizing antibody (SNAb) activity, and antibody binding avidity were compared between children (aged 1-10 years), adolescents (aged 11-18 years), and young adults (aged 19-24 years). Results: Among 31â¯426 antibody test results (19â¯797 [63.0%] female patients), with 1194 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 11.0 [5.3] years) and 30â¯232 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 49.2 [17.1] years), the seroprevalence in the pediatric (197 [16.5%; 95% CI, 14.4%-18.7%]) and adult (5630 [18.6%; 95% CI, 18.2%-19.1%]) patient populations was similar. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG level showed a negative correlation with age in the pediatric population (r = -0.45, P < .001) and a moderate but positive correlation with age in adults (r = 0.24, P < .001). Patients aged 19 to 30 years exhibited the lowest IgG levels (eg, aged 25-30 years vs 1-10 years: 99 [44-180] relative fluorescence units [RFU] vs 443 [188-851] RFU). In the subset cohort aged 1 to 24 years, IgG, TAb, SNAb and avidity were negatively correlated with age (eg, IgG: r = -0.51; P < .001). Children exhibited higher median (IQR) IgG levels, TAb levels, and SNAb activity compared with adolescents (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 191 [82-349] RFU; P < .001) and young adults (eg, IgG levels: 473 [233-656] RFU vs 85 [38-150] RFU; P < .001). Adolescents also exhibited higher median (IQR) TAb levels, IgG levels, and SNAb activity than young adults (eg, TAb levels: 961 [290-2074] RFU vs 370 [125-697]; P = .006). In addition, children had higher antibody binding avidity compared with young adults, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that SARS-CoV-2 viral specific antibody response profiles are distinct in different age groups. Age-targeted strategies for disease screening and management as well as vaccine development may be warranted.","Yang, He S; Costa, Victoria; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Acker, Karen P; Yee, Jim; Chen, Zhengming; Karbaschi, Mohsen; Zuk, Robert; Rand, Sophie; Sukhu, Ashley; Klasse, P J; Cushing, Melissa M; Chadburn, Amy; Zhao, Zhen",JAMA Netw Open,,370

This descriptive cross-sectional study explored the current use of virtual visits in providing care among primary care providers in southwestern Ontario during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the anticipated level of utilization post-pandemic. It also explored clinicians' perceptions of the available support tools and resources and challenges to incorporating virtual visits within primary care practices. METHODS: Primary care physicians and nurse practitioners currently practicing in the southwestern part of Ontario were invited to participate in an online survey. The survey invite was distributed via email, different social media platforms, and newsletters. The survey questions gathered clinicians' demographic information and assessed their experience with virtual visits, including the proportion of visits conducted virtually (before, during the pandemic, and expected volume post-pandemic), overall satisfaction and comfort level with offering virtual visits using modalities, challenges experienced, as well as useful resources and tools to support them in using virtual visits in their practice. RESULTS: We received 207 responses, with 96.6% of respondents offering virtual visits in their practice. Participants used different modalities to conduct virtual visits, with the vast majority offering visits via phone calls (99.5%). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians who offered virtual visits have conducted an average of 66.4% of their visits virtually, compared to an average of 6.5% pre-pandemic. Participants anticipated continuing use of virtual visits with an average of 43.9% post-pandemic. Overall, 74.5% of participants were satisfied with their experience using virtual visits, and 88% believed they could incorporate virtual visits well within the usual workflow. Participants highlighted some challenges in offering virtual care. For example, 58% were concerned about patients' limited access to technology, 55% about patients' knowledge of technology, and 41% about the lack of integration with their current EMR, the increase in demand over time, and the connectivity issues such as inconsistent Wi-Fi/Internet connection. There were significant differences in perception of some challenges between clinicians in urban vs, rural areas. Clinicians in rural areas were more likely to consider the inconsistent Wi-Fi and limited connectivity as barriers to incorporating virtual visits within the practice setting (58.8% vs. 40.2%, P = 0.030). In comparison, clinicians in urban areas were significantly more concerned about patients overusing virtual care services (39.4% vs. 21.6%, P = 0.024). As for support tools, 47% of clinicians advocated for virtual care standards outlined by their profession's college. About 32% identified change management support and technical training as supportive tools. Moreover, 39% and 28% thought local colleagues and in-house organizational support are helpful resources, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the adoption of virtual visits has exponentially increased during the pandemic, with a significant interest in continuing to use virtual care options in the delivery of primary care post-pandemic. The study sheds light on tools and resources that could enhance operational efficiencies in adopting virtual visits in primary care settings and highlights challenges that, when addressed, can expand the health system capacity and sustained use of virtual care.","Mohammed, Heba Tallah; Hyseni, Lirije; Bui, Victoria; Gerritsen, Beth; Fuller, Katherine; Sung, Jihyun; Alarakhia, Mohamed",PLoS One,,370

Each was in a ""hot spot"" where the outbreak overwhelmed the capacities of the hospitals. Professor Antonino Spinelli of Milan dealt with the sudden increase in COVID-19 patients that threatened to push all other emergencies and urgent cancer cases aside. Providers lacked the personal protective equipment to be adequately safe in the environment. In Madrid, Dr Julio Mayol recounted how 10%-15% of the workers in his hospital were incapacitated by the virus, many of them doctors providing direct care to patients. The disease is so prevalent that all emergency patients are treated as though they have the infection. Having practices in Saudi Arabia and Spain, Dr Delia Cortés-Guiral saw how the former country controlled the epidemic through a strict lockdown of travel and closure of holy pilgrimage sites and social gatherings.

The long-term consequences of delaying procedures in response to COVID-19 remains unknown. We developed a high-throughput approach to understand the impact of delaying procedures on patient health outcomes using electronic health record (EHR) data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR data from Vanderbilt University Medical Center's (VUMC) Research and Synthetic Derivatives. Elective procedures and non-urgent visits were suspended at VUMC between March 18, 2020 and April 24, 2020. Surgical procedure data from this period were compared to a similar timeframe in 2019. Potential adverse impact of delay in cardiovascular and cancer-related procedures was evaluated using EHR data collected from January 1, 1993 to March 17, 2020. For surgical procedure delay, outcomes included length of hospitalization (days), mortality during hospitalization, and readmission within six months. For screening procedure delay, outcomes included 5-year survival and cancer stage at diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 416 surgical procedures that were negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Using retrospective data, we found 27 significant associations between procedure delay and adverse patient outcomes. Clinician review indicated that 88.9% of the significant associations were plausible and potentially clinically significant. Analytic pipelines for this study are available online. CONCLUSION: Our approach enables health systems to identify medical procedures affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate the effect of delay, enabling them to communicate effectively with patients and prioritize rescheduling to minimize adverse patient outcomes.","Zheng, Neil S; Warner, Jeremy L; Osterman, Travis J; Wells, Quinn S; Shu, Xiao-Ou; Deppen, Stephen A; Karp, Seth J; Dwyer, Shon; Feng, QiPing; Cox, Nancy J; Peterson, Josh F; Stein, C Michael; Roden, Dan M; Johnson, Kevin B; Wei, Wei-Qi",J Biomed Inform,,370

A total of 36 patients had hypoxemic pneumonia (23.1%) due to COVID-19. Thirty of these cases (83.3%) were imported by travelers returning mainly from metropolitan France and Spain. Patients were screened for co-infection with other pathogens at admission: 31 (86.1%) by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16 (44.4%) by cytobacteriological examination of sputum culture. Five patients (13.9%) were found to have co-infection: 1 with influenza virus A H1N1 (pdm09) associated with Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 with Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with Haemophilus influenzae, 1 with Human Coronavirus 229E, 1 with Rhinovirus, and 1 with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with co-infection had higher D-dimer levels than those without co-infection (1.36 [1.34-2.36] µg/mL vs 0.63 [0.51-1.12] µg/mL, Pâ=â.05).The incidence of co-infection in our cohort was higher than expected (13.9%).

A total of 36 patients had hypoxemic pneumonia (23.1%) due to COVID-19. Thirty of these cases (83.3%) were imported by travelers returning mainly from metropolitan France and Spain. Patients were screened for co-infection with other pathogens at admission: 31 (86.1%) by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16 (44.4%) by cytobacteriological examination of sputum culture. Five patients (13.9%) were found to have co-infection: 1 with influenza virus A H1N1 (pdm09) associated with Branhamella catarrhalis, 1 with Streptococcus pneumoniae associated with Haemophilus influenzae, 1 with Human Coronavirus 229E, 1 with Rhinovirus, and 1 with methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with co-infection had higher D-dimer levels than those without co-infection (1.36 [1.34-2.36] µg/mL vs 0.63 [0.51-1.12] µg/mL, Pâ=â.05).The incidence of co-infection in our cohort was higher than expected (13.9%).

The ACE-CoV study was designed to assess this question. The study was conducted in the Covid-Clinic-Toul cohort, which contains data about all patients hospitalized at Toulouse University hospital, France with a SARS-CoV-2 infection since March, 2020. We selected the patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (heart failure or coronary disease) and/or arterial hypertension. We conducted a subgroup analysis in patients with arterial hypertension. ACEI/ARB exposures at admission were assessed. The outcome was composite: admission to intensive care unit, need of mechanical ventilation or death during the 14 days after admission to hospital. We used logistic regression models with propensity scores (PS) weighted by overlap weighting (OW) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Between March 2020 and April 20, 2020, the Covid-Clinic-Toul included 263 patients. Among them, 111 were included in the ACE-CoV study population. In OW-PS-adjusted analyses, the association of exposure to ACEIs or ARBs with outcome occurrence was OR: 1.56 (95% CI: 0.73-3.33). It was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.68-1.45) for ACEIs and 1.64 (95% CI: 0.77-3.50) for ARBs. Analyses with weighting by the IPTW-PS method gave similar results. Results were similar when considering the subgroup of patients with arterial hypertension. The ACE-CoV study found no association between exposure to ACEIs or ARBs and unfavorable outcome in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 with a history of cardiovascular disease/arterial hypertension.","Lafaurie, Margaux; Martin-Blondel, Guillaume; Delobel, Pierre; Charpentier, Sandrine; Sommet, Agnès; Moulis, Guillaume",Fundam. clin. pharmacol,,370

329978,US-European and ASEAN strategic plan on COVID-19: a proposed multilateral diplomacy,2021,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected health care services worldwide due to lockdowns, prevention measures, and social distancing. During this period, patients, including older adults and those with chronic conditions, need ways to obtain medical attention other than going physically to the clinic, such as telemedicine services. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate attitudes toward telemedicine during the COVID-19 lockdown in Israel, assess willingness to use such services in the future, and evaluate the extent to which consumers have changed their minds regarding these services. Method: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted among adults (age 20-90) using social media networks (N = 693). Data were collected using an online questionnaire explicitly designed to measure attitudes toward telemedicine. Results: Most of the participants had to use telemedicine during the lockdown and were satisfied therewith. The majority also stated that they would continue using telemedicine in the future. However, only a third stated that they had changed their minds regarding telemedicine. The main predictors of willingness to use telemedicine in the future were the necessity of using such services during lockdown, preference for going to a clinic, and satisfaction with telemedicine, alongside gender and having a chronic illness. Importantly, we found that a preference for visiting the clinic was negatively correlated with willingness to use telemedicine in the future. Education and being single were predictors of the change of mind regarding telemedicine. Participants with chronic conditions are more likely to use these services, and specific attention should be directed to their needs. A small portion of the study sample prefers live appointments with a physician. Conclusions: Telemedicine use is rapidly changing. It is vital for health care providers to identify non-telemedicine users and their common characteristics. Monitoring patients' attitudes regarding telemedicine is essential in the future after the pandemic ends. Targeted outreach plans should be formulated. These plans should be directed at identifying barriers to using telemedicine, and they should generate specific, focused plans.","Reicher, Sima; Sela, Tal; Toren, Orly",Front Public Health,,370

In addition, many patients with COVID-19 infection have suffered liver damage which might contribute to a worse prognosis. We conducted a clinical epidemiological analysis to investigate the association of overweight/obesity and abnormal liver function (ALF) with hospitalized duration in patients infected with COVID-19. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with diagnosed COVID-19 (22 women & 36 men; average age: 49.2 ± 13.1 yr) were included, and their clinical data were collected at The Second Affiliated and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang. Overweight/obesity was determined as body mass index (BMI) &#8805;24 kg/m2, ALF was determined as alanine aminotransferase >40 U/L, and prolonged hospitalization was lasting more than the median value of the hospitalized days (19 days) in this population. RESULTS: The proportions of prolonged hospitalization were elevated in patients with overweight/obesity and ALF compared with those without overweight/obesity (62.1% versus 26.1%, P = 0.010) and those without ALF (70.6% versus 41.5%, P = 0.043). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the hospitalized duration was increased from the patients with neither overweight/obesity nor ALF to those with either overweight/obesity or ALF, and to those with both of overweight/obesity and ALF (mean with 95% confidence interval: 16.4 [14.5-18.3] versus 25.3 [21.6-29.1] versus 28.3 [24.6-32.0], P for trend = 0.001). Being discharged from hospital in time was inversely and independently associated with BMI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.63-0.90, P for trend = 0.002) and ALT (HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99, P for trend = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Present findings suggested that overweight/obesity and/or ALF contributed to predicting a probability of prolonged hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 infection, to whom extra attentions and precautions should be paid during clinical treatments.","Hu, Xiang; Pan, Xiaoqiong; Zhou, Wei; Gu, Xuejiang; Shen, Feixia; Yang, Bo; Hu, Zhen",Int J Obes (Lond),,370

The most popular search engine worldwide is Google, and since March 2020, COVID-19 has been a global trending search term. Misinformation related to COVID-19 from these searches is a problem, and hence, it is of high importance to assess the quality of health information over the internet related to COVID-19. The objective of our study is to examine the quality of COVID-19 related health information over the internet using the DISCERN tool. Methods: The keywords included in assessment of COVID-19 related information using Google's search engine were ""Coronavirus,"" ""Coronavirus causes,"" ""Coronavirus diagnosis,"" ""Coronavirus prevention,"" and ""Coronavirus management"". The first 20 websites from each search term were gathered to generate a list of 100 URLs. Duplicate sites were excluded from this search, allowing analysis of unique sites only. Additional exclusion criteria included scientific journals, nonoperational links, nonfunctional websites (where the page was not loading, was not found, or was inactive), and websites in languages other than English. This resulted in a unique list of 48 websites. Four independent raters evaluated the websites using a 16-item DISCERN tool to assess the quality of novel coronavirus related information available on the internet. The interrater reliability agreement was calculated using the intracluster correlation coefficient. Results: Results showed variation in how the raters assigned scores to different website categories. The .com websites received the lowest scores. Results showed that .edu and .org website category sites were excellent in communicating coronavirus related health information; however, they received lower scores for treatment effect and treatment choices. Conclusion: This study highlights the gaps in the quality of information that is available on the websites related to COVID-19 and study emphasizes the need for verified websites that provide evidence-based health information related to the novel coronavirus pandemic.","Joshi, Ashish; Kajal, Fnu; Bhuyan, Soumitra S; Sharma, Priya; Bhatt, Ashruti; Kumar, Kanishk; Kaur, Mahima; Arora, Arushi",ScientificWorldJournal,,370
346103,Factors Associated With Risk for Care Escalation Among Patients With COVID-19 Receiving Home-Based Hospital Care,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and the UK government's subsequent coronavirus action plan have fundamentally impacted on every aspect of healthcare. One area that is severely affected is ear, nose and throat (ENT)/laryngology where speech and language therapists (SLTs) engage in a diverse range of practice with patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems, and head and neck cancers (HNCs). A large majority of these patients are in high-risk categories, and many specialized clinical practices are vulnerable. In addition, workforce and research issues are challenged in both the immediate context and the future. AIMS: To discuss the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for SLTs in ENT/laryngology with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. METHODS & PROCEDURES: The relevant sections of the World Health Organisation's (WHO) health systems building blocks framework (2007) were used to structure the study. Expert agreement was determined by an iterative process of multiple-group discussions, the use of all recent relevant policy documentation, and other literature and shared documentation/writing. The final paper was verified and agreed by all authors. MAIN CONTRIBUTION: The main threats to ENT/laryngology SLT clinical services include increased patient complexity related to COVID-19 voice and airway problems, delayed HNC diagnosis, reduced access to instrumental procedures and inequitable care provision. The main clinical opportunities include the potential for new modes of service delivery and collaborations, and harnessing SLT expertise in non-instrumental assessment. There are several workforce issues, including redeployment (and impact on current services), training implications and psychological impact on staff. Workforce opportunities exist for service innovation and potential extended ENT/SLT practice roles. Research is threatened by a reduction in immediate funding calls and high competition. Current research is affected by very limited access to participants and the ability to conduct face-to-face and instrumental assessments. However, research opportunities may result in greater collaboration, and changes in service delivery necessitate robust investigation and evaluation. A new national set of research priorities is likely to emerge. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The immediate impact of the pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. It is unclear when any of these areas will resume operations and whether permanent changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities will follow. However, significant opportunity exists in the post-COVID era to re-evaluate current practice, embrace opportunities and evaluate new ways of working. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject ENT/laryngology SLTs manage patients with a range of conditions, including voice disorders, airway problems and HNCs. The diverse scope of clinical practice involves highly specialized assessment and treatment practices in patients in high-risk categories. A large majority of active research projects in this field are patient focused and involve instrumental assessment. The COVID-19 pandemic has created both opportunities and threats for ENT SLT clinical services, workforce and research. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides a discussion of the threats and opportunities from the COVID-19 pandemic for ENT/laryngology SLT with specific reference to clinical practice, workforce and research leadership. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to all aspects of clinical delivery, workforce and research for ENT/laryngology SLT. Changes to clinical practice, professional remits and research priorities are of indeterminant duration at this time, and some components could be permanent. Significant clinical practice, workforce and research opportunities may exist in the post-COVID era.","Patterson, Joanne M; Govender, Roganie; Roe, Justin; Clunie, Gemma; Murphy, Jennifer; Brady, Grainne; Haines, Jemma; White, Anna; Carding, Paul",Int. j. lang. commun. disord,,370

359068,A Mobile Health Intervention (LifeBuoy App) to Help Young People Manage Suicidal Thoughts: Protocol for a Mixed-Methods Randomized Controlled Trial,2020,"Recent World Health Organization guidance has aimed to provide pragmatic guidance acknowledging the role of sequential nasopharyngeal swabs taken >24 hours apart for SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk populations. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are known to have an altered immune milieu which may be associated with a delay in viral clearance. Here, a cross-sectional observational study of 138 patients admitted with SARS-CoV-2 infection at two large regional hospitals in Scotland, UK examined the median time to two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 in an inpatient population. The median time from admission to the first of two consecutive negative nasopharyngeal swabs was 18 days (range = 1-44) in patients with CKD, compared with 11 days (range: 1-71) in patients without CKD (P = .0007). Multivariable linear regression analysis using explanatory variables of age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 disease severity, key comorbidities and renal function showed that declining estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently associated with prolonged time to viral clearance. Our data suggest that patients with CKD who are admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 take longer to achieve sequential negative nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results than those without CKD. This has implications for renal service provision, discharge planning and hospital capacity as well as a direct impact on patients due to extended hospital stay, anxiety and stigmatisation.","O039,; Sullivan, Eoin D; Lees, Jennifer S; Howie, Katie L; Pugh, Dan; Gillis, Keith A; Traynor, Jamie P; Macintyre, Iain; Mark, Patrick B",Nephrology (Carlton),,370

First European marketing authorizations were delivered in 2006. They are ""copies"" of biologically manufactured medicines, mostly proteins. Taking into account the intrinsic variability related to the biological manufacture process, some variation of the chemical structure of the finished compound may be observed. They impact especially the glycosylation residues but not the amino-acid sequence (for proteins). For this reason, the marketing authorization application dossier has to involve, as opposed to the generic medicine procedure, the demonstration of the therapeutic equivalence in at least one clinical indication of the princeps medicine. Introduction of biosimilar medicines of monoclonal antibodies has represented a remarkable event in the domain of rheumatology, gastroenterology and dermatology with infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab biosimilars and in cancerology domains with rituximab, trastuzumab and bevacizumab biosimilars. Biosimilar medicines availability reduces the risk of drug supply rupture of princeps but their main impact is the economic one allowing cost reduction of costly princeps biological medicines. With the acquired clinical experience, the initial fears concerning switch form princeps to a biosimilar for a given patient has progressively disappeared.","Lechat, P",Bull. acad. natl. med,,370

This study revealed the amount of pomegranate fruit lost on the farm and the causes of loss and estimated the impacts of losses. The direct measurement method, which involved sorting and counting of individual fruit, was used since physical identification of the causes of fruit losses on individual fruit was necessary for data collection. Furthermore, qualitative data were collected by physical observation during harvesting and interaction with farm workers. At the case study farm in Wellington, Western Cape Province of South Africa, a range of 15.3–20.1% of the harvested crop was considered lost, as the quality fell below marketable standards for retail sales. This amounted to an average of 117.76 tonnes of pomegranate fruit harvested per harvest season in the case study farm, which is removed from the value chain and sold mainly at a low value for juicing and other purposes and translates to an estimated R10.5 million ($618,715.34) economic loss to the farmer. Environmental factors are the main causes of on-farm fruit losses. In the three pomegranate cultivars studied, sunburn and crack were identified as the leading cause of fruit loss, accounting for about 43.9% of all on-farm fruit losses. The lost fiber, carbohydrate, protein, iron and ascorbic acid contents associated with lost fruit were estimated to meet the daily recommended nutrition intake of 2, 9, 4, 2 and 24 people, respectively. Strategies to control and reduce pomegranate fruit losses and waste at the farm level should focus on environmental factors and mechanical damage since they account for the highest sources of fruit losses. This will ensure improved revenue to farmers, sustainable use of natural resources, reduction of the environmental impacts of the fruit industry, and more availability of quality fruit for nutritional security.","Ikechukwu Kingsley, Opara Olaniyi Amos Fawole Kelly Candice Opara Umezuruike Linus",Sustainability,,370

However, when threat is uncertain and continuous, as in the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, fear can become chronic and burdensome. To identify predictors of fear of the coronavirus, we conducted an online survey (N = 439) three days after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic (i.e., between March 14 and 17, 2020). Fear of the coronavirus was assessed with the newly developed Fear of the Coronavirus Questionnaire (FCQ) consisting of eight questions pertaining to different dimensions of fear (e.g., subjective worry, safety behaviors, preferential attention), and an open-ended question. The predictors included psychological vulnerability factors (i.e., intolerance of uncertainty, worry, and health anxiety), media exposure, and personal relevance (i.e., personal health, risk for loved ones, and risk control). We found four predictors for the FCQ in a simultaneous regression analysis: health anxiety, regular media use, social media use, and risks for loved ones (R2 = .37). Furthermore, 16 different topics of concern were identified based participants' open-ended responses, including the health of loved ones, health care systems overload, and economic consequences. We discuss the relevance of our findings for managing people's fear of the coronavirus.","Mertens, Gaëtan; Gerritsen, Lotte; Duijndam, Stefanie; Salemink, Elske; Engelhard, Iris M",J Anxiety Disord,,370
381416,Preparing Telemedicine for the Frontlines of Healthcare Equity,2020,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators whose dysregulations can be involved in tumorigenesis. ß-catenin, the main agent in the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway, controls various genes and its over-expression has been discovered in different kinds of cancers including Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Extensive research demonstrated that the Wnt signaling is one of the major affected pathways in HCC. This study aimed to find miRNA targeting ß-catenin gene by bioinformatic approaches and confirm this correlation to propose new therapeutic targets for HCC. Prediction of miRNAs targeting 3'-Untranslated Regions (UTR) of ß-catenin mRNA, were done using different types of credible bioinformatic databases. The luciferase assay was also recruited for further confirmation of the bioinformatic predictions. In the first step, the expression of ß-catenin was assessed in the HepG2 cell line by real-time PCR technique. Next, transduction of HepG2 cells were done by lentiviral vectors containing the desired miRNA. Then, the expression level of miRNA and the ß-catenin gene were evaluated. Based on the results obtained from different bioinformatic databases, miR-214 was selected as the potential miRNA with the highest probability in targeting ß-catenin. Furthermore, Luciferase assay results confirmed the accuracy of our bioinformatic prediction. In line with our hypothesis, after the overexpression of miR-214 in HepG2 cells, ß-catenin gene expression was reduced significantly. Gathered results indicate the miRNAs role in the down-regulation of their target genes. Hence, the results propose that miR-214 can prevent HCC development by suppressing ß-catenin and may supply a newfound approach towards HCC therapy in humans.","Karimkhanloo, Hamzeh; Mohammadi-Yeganeh, Samira; Hadavi, Razie; Koochaki, Ameneh; Paryan, Mahdi",Mol.

This anatomy is well depicted at imaging, and management is often dictated by what structures are involved. Coccydynia is a common condition that is known to be difficult to evaluate and treat. However, imaging can aid in determining potential causes of pain to help guide management. Commonly, coccydynia (coccygodynia) occurs after trauma and appears with normal imaging features at static neutral radiography, but dynamic imaging with standing and seated lateral radiography may reveal pathologic coccygeal motion that is predictive of pain. In addition, several findings seen at cross-sectional imaging in patients with coccydynia can point to a source of pain that may be subtle and easily overlooked. Radiology can also offer a role in management of coccygeal region pain with image-guided pain management procedures such as ganglion impar block. In addition to mechanical coccyx pain, a host of other conditions involving the sacrococcygeal region may cause coccydynia, which are well depicted at imaging. These include neoplasm, infection, crystal deposition, and cystic formations such as pilonidal cyst. The authors review a variety of coccydynia causes, their respective imaging features, and common management strategies.©RSNA, 2020.","Skalski, Matthew R; Matcuk, George R; Patel, Dakshesh B; Tomasian, Anderanik; White, Eric A; Gross, Jordan S",Radiographics,,370

400078,Spheres of Influence and Strategic Advocacy for Equity in Medicine,2021,"This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille",Ann. med.-psychol,,370

Reacting to the pandemic and adaptation in the ""new normal"" have been challenging tasks. Exiting the pandemic can lead to some after-shock effects such as ""disruption tails."" While the research community has undertaken considerable efforts to predict the pandemic's impacts and examine supply chain adaptive behaviors during the pandemic, little is known about supply chain management in the course of pandemic elimination and post-disruption recovery. If capacity and inventory management are unaware of the after-shock risks, this can result in highly destabilized production-inventory dynamics and decreased performance in the post-disruption period causing product deficits in the markets and high inventory costs in the supply chains. In this paper, we use a discrete-event simulation model to investigate some exit strategies for a supply chain in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model can inform managers about the existence and risk of disruption tails in their supply chains and guide the selection of post-pandemic recovery strategies. Our results show that supply chains with postponed demand and shutdown capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic are particularly prone to disruption tails. We then developed and examined two strategies to avoid these disruption tails. First, we observed a conjunction of recovery and supply chain coordination which mitigates the impact of disruption tails by demand smoothing over time in the post-disruption period. Second, we found a gradual capacity ramp-up prior to expected peaks of postponed demand to be an effective strategy for disruption tail control.","Ivanov, Dmitry",Ann Oper Res,,370

METHOD: We managed the first 280 patients suspected to have COVID-19 through a rapid care circuit and virological diagnosis in our infectious disease reference hospital in Marseille, France. Rapid viral detection was performed on sputum and nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: Over our study period, no SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Results were obtained within approximately 3 h of the arrival of patient samples at the laboratory. Other viral infections were identified in 49% of the patients, with most common pathogens being influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus and common coronaviruses, notably HKU1 and NL63. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of COVID-19 is critical to isolate confirmed cases and prevent further transmission. Early rule-out of COVID-19 allows public health containment measures to be adjusted by reducing the time spent in isolation.","Amrane, Sophie; Tissot-Dupont, Hervé; Doudier, Barbara; Eldin, Carole; Hocquart, Marie; Mailhe, Morgane; Dudouet, Pierre; Ormières, Etienne; Ailhaud, Lucie; Parola, Philippe; Lagier, Jean-Christophe; Brouqui, Philippe; Zandotti, Christine; Ninove, Laetitia; Luciani, Léa; Boschi, Céline; La Scola, Bernard; Raoult, Didier; Million, Matthieu; Colson, Philippe; Gautret, Philippe",Travel Med Infect Dis,,370

SUMMARY ANSWER: MAR services, and hence treatments for infertile couples, were stopped in most European countries for a mean of 7 weeks. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: With the outbreak of COVID-19 in Europe, non-urgent medical care was reduced by local authorities to preserve health resources and maintain social distancing. Furthermore, ESHRE and other societies recommended to postpone ART pregnancies as of 14 March 2020. STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: A structured questionnaire was distributed in April among the ESHRE Committee of National Representatives, followed by further information collection through email. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: The information was collected through the questionnaire and afterwards summarised and aligned with data from the European Centre for Disease Control on the number of COVID-19 cases per country. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: By aligning the data for each country with respective epidemiological data, we show a large variation in the time and the phase in the epidemic in the curve when MAR/ART treatments were suspended and restarted. Similarly, the duration of interruption varied. Fertility preservation treatments and patient supportive care for patients remained available during the pandemic. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Data collection was prone to misinterpretation of the questions and replies, and required further follow-up to check the accuracy. Some representatives reported that they, themselves, were not always aware of the situation throughout the country or reported difficulties with providing single generalised replies, for instance when there were regional differences within their country. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The current article provides a basis for further research of the different strategies developed in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Such conclusions will be invaluable for health authorities and healthcare professionals with respect to future similar situations.

412595,The influence of 2020 coronavirus lockdown on presentation of oral and maxillofacial trauma to a central London hospital,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 infection is spreading rapidly worldwide. Efficacious antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. Here, we discovered that protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and verteporfin, two FDA-approved drugs, completely inhibited the cytopathic effect produced by SARS-CoV-2 infection at 1.25 µmol/Land 0.31 µmol/L respectively, and their EC50 values of reduction of viral RNA were at nanomolar concentrations. The selectivity indices of PpIX and verteporfin were 952.74 and 368.93, respectively, suggesting broad margin of safety. Importantly, PpIX and verteporfin prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice adenovirally transduced with human ACE2. The compounds, sharing a porphyrin ring structure, were shown to bind viral receptor ACE2 and interfere with the interaction between ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain of viral S protein. Our study suggests that PpIX and verteporfin are potent antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection and sheds new light on developing novel chemoprophylaxis and chemotherapy against SARS-CoV-2.","Gu, Chenjian; Wu, Yang; Guo, Huimin; Zhu, Yuanfei; Xu, Wei; Wang, Yuyan; Zhou, Yu; Sun, Zhiping; Cai, Xia; Li, Yutang; Liu, Jing; Huang, Zhong; Yuan, Zhenghong; Zhang, Rong; Deng, Qiang; Qu, Di; Xie, Youhua",,,370
413092,"COVID-19: Why Declining Biodiversity Puts Us at Greater Risk for Emerging Infectious Diseases, and What We Can Do",2020,"OBJECTIVE: the aim was to evaluate nurses' self-efficacy, confidence and nurse-patient interaction during caring of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional design with online survey was used with a Self-efficacy scale, Self-confidence scale and Caring nurse-patient interaction scale: 23- item Version-Nurse (CNPI-23 N). RESULTS: A sample of 120 nurses participated in the current study. The results showed that the participants had a moderate level of self-efficacy, self-confidence and interaction (M = 28.84 (SD= 7.7), M =47.41 (SD= 9.0) and M= 93.59 (SD=16.3) respectively). Positive relationships were found between nurse' self-efficacy, self-confidence and nurse-patient interaction (r = 0.81, P < 0.0001 and 0.79, P ï¼0.0001 respectively). Significant differences were found in self-efficacy according to years of experience, academic qualifications and position (F = 2.10, P = 0.003, F = 3.60, P = 0.002 and F = 2.60, P =0.007 respectively). Furthermore, the results indicated that there was a significant difference in self-confidence and nurse-patient interaction also. CONCLUSION: Nurse educators and administrators should develop and implement further strategies such as continuing education and training, compensatory payment, organizational support and availability of protective measures to increase their self-efficacy, self-confidence and interaction with COVID-19 patients.","Abu Sharour, Loai; Bani Salameh, Ayman; Suleiman, Khaled; Subih, Maha; El-Hneiti, Mamdouh; Al-Husaami, Mahmoud; Al Dameery, Khloud; Al Omari, Omor",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,370

422453,Pandemic Loss,2020,"BACKGROUND: Sexual minority men who use drugs have high sexual HIV transmission risk. Sexual interactions may also increase COVID-19 risk.This study compared marijuana use, other illegal drugs use (i.e. cocaine/crack, methamphetamine, MDMA/ecstasy, GHB, and ketamine) and sexual behavior with casual partners among sexual minority cismen active on social networking and dating applications before and during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: This cohort-control study compared 455 adult respondents (surveyed May 6th to 17th, 2020) and a matched sample selected from 65,707 respondents surveyed pre-COVID. Participants were recruited on social networking and dating applications and completed surveys online. RESULTS: The proportion reporting marijuana use declined significantly in the COVID cohort (34.5 % versus 45.7 % pre-COVID,p < .001) as did their illegal drug use (11.0 % versus 22.9 % pre-COVID, p < .001). While the number of casual partners per month was stable, the proportion reporting condomless anal sex with casual partners declined significantly during COVID (26.4 % versus 71.6 % pre-COVID, p < .001). The effect of illegal drug use (excluding marijuana) on number of casual partners per month (aRR = 1.45 pre-COVID versus 2.84, p < .01) and odds of condomless anal sex (aOR = 2.00 pre-COVID versus 5.22, p = .04) were significantly greater in the COVID cohort. CONCLUSIONS: While the proportion of participants reporting drug use and condomless anal sex with casual partners declined in the COVID cohort, the association between drug use and sexual behavior was magnified. Sexual minority men who use drugs are significantly more likely to engage in sexual behaviors that place them at risk for HIV and COVID-19 transmission.","Starks, Tyrel J; Jones, S Scott; Sauermilch, Daniel; Benedict, Matthew; Adebayo, Trinae; Cain, Demetria; Simpson, Kit N",Drug Alcohol Depend,,370
422616,The three-dimensional evaluation of positional change in mandibular condyle after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy,2020,"We have worked to develop a Clinical Information Network (CIN) in Kenya as an early form of learning health systems (LHS) focused on paediatric and neonatal care that now spans 22 hospitals. CIN's aim was to examine important outcomes of hospitalisation at scale, identify and ultimately solve practical problems of service delivery, drive improvements in quality and test interventions. By including multiple routine settings in research, we aimed to promote generalisability of findings and demonstrate potential efficiencies derived from LHS. We illustrate the nature and range of research CIN has supported over the past 7 years as a form of LHS. Clinically, this has largely focused on common, serious paediatric illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea with dehydration with recent extensions to neonatal illnesses. CIN also enables examination of the quality of care, for example that provided to children with severe malnutrition and the challenges encountered in routine settings in adopting simple technologies (pulse oximetry) and more advanced diagnostics (eg, Xpert MTB/RIF). Although regular feedback to hospitals has been associated with some improvements in quality data continue to highlight system challenges that undermine provision of basic, quality care (eg, poor access to blood glucose testing and routine microbiology). These challenges include those associated with increased mortality risk (eg, delays in blood transfusion). Using the same data the CIN platform has enabled conduct of randomised trials and supports malaria vaccine and most recently COVID-19 surveillance. Employing LHS principles has meant engaging front-line workers, clinical managers and national stakeholders throughout. Our experience suggests LHS can be developed in low and middle-income countries that efficiently enable contextually appropriate research and contribute to strengthening of health services and research systems.","English, Mike; Irimu, Grace; Akech, Samuel; Aluvaala, Jalemba; Ogero, Morris; Isaaka, Lynda; Malla, Lucas; Tuti, Timothy; Gathara, David; Oliwa, Jacquie; Agweyu, Ambrose",,,370

Além do M. tuberculosis, agente responsável pela doença em humanos, outra manifestação importante é a tuberculose em bovinos causada pelo M. bovis, que também apresenta importância epidemiológica, devido à transmissão para o homem pela ingestão de alimentos contaminados, e a escassez de dados com relação à sua prevalência na população. Programas de controle da doença nos rebanhos bovinos existem em todo o mundo, e os maiores índices da doença encontram-se nos países em desenvolvimento. Estes programas estão baseados na identificação dos animais positivos, por meio de testes de tuberculina e sacrifício dos mesmos. Lesões encontradas em exames post-mortem podem ser submetidas a estudos bacteriológicos para o isolamento e identificação do agente e histopatológicos para a caracterização da lesão, os quais demandam meses para a sua conclusão. Com o advento da biologia molecular, novos métodos são propostos para a diminuir o tempo do diagnóstico de meses para poucos dias. Com o intuito de proporcionar um panorama das novas metodologias moleculares, como a técnica de PCR, empregadas no diagnóstico da tuberculose bovina, realizou-se uma revisão bibliográfica, apresentando as vantagens e dificuldades das mesmas.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) seem to be more prone to a severe course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to comorbidities and an altered immune system. The study's aim was to identify factors predicting mortality among SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with CKD. METHODS: We analyzed 2817 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients enrolled in the Lean European Open Survey on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and identified 426 patients with pre-existing CKD. Group comparisons were performed via Chi-squared test. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, predictive factors for mortality were identified. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to patients without CKD revealed a higher mortality (140/426, 32.9% versus 354/2391, 14.8%). Higher age could be confirmed as a demographic predictor for mortality in CKD patients (> 85 years compared to 15-65 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 6.49, 95% CI 1.27-33.20, p = 0.025). We further identified markedly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (> 2 × upper limit of normal, aOR 23.21, 95% CI 3.66-147.11, p < 0.001), thrombocytopenia (< 120,000/µl, aOR 11.66, 95% CI 2.49-54.70, p = 0.002), anemia (Hb < 10 g/dl, aOR 3.21, 95% CI 1.17-8.82, p = 0.024), and C-reactive protein (&#8805; 30 mg/l, aOR 3.44, 95% CI 1.13-10.45, p = 0.029) as predictors, while renal replacement therapy was not related to mortality (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 0.68-1.93, p = 0.611). CONCLUSION: The identified predictors include routinely measured and universally available parameters. Their assessment might facilitate risk stratification in this highly vulnerable cohort as early as at initial medical evaluation for SARS-CoV-2.","Pilgram, Lisa; Eberwein, Lukas; Wille, Kai; Koehler, Felix C; Stecher, Melanie; Rieg, Siegbert; Kielstein, Jan T; Jakob, Carolin E M; Rüthrich, Maria; Burst, Volker; Prasser, Fabian; Borgmann, Stefan; Müller, Roman-Ulrich; Lanznaster, Julia; Isberner, Nora; Tometten, Lukas; Dolff, Sebastian",Infection,,370

PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A case-control study of 70 women with POI matched by age and body mass index with 70 controls. MEASUREMENTS: All were submitted to whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to analyse body composition. In the POI group, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, transaminases and C-reactive protein levels were measured, as well as the thickness of the carotid artery intima-media complex. RESULTS: Total mass, fat mass, lean mass (total, percentage and index) and the android/gynoid (A/G) ratio were similar in both groups; however, bone mineral content was lower (P < .001) in the POI group. Lean and fat mass indexes were 14.19 ± 1.63 and 11.04 ± 3.58, respectively, and the percentage of gynoid to android fat was higher (51.17 ± 6.71% versus 47.74 ± 9.19%; A/G ratio = 0.93 ± 0.15) in the POI group. In addition, the increase in total mass correlated positively with glucose and ALT levels and negatively with HDL-cholesterol. Increased A/G ratio was the measurement most frequently associated with cardiovascular risk markers. CONCLUSION: The body composition of women with POI using hormone therapy is similar to that of women with normal ovarian function with regard to lean and fat mass content and fat distribution. In women with POI, the higher the A/G ratio, the worse the cardiovascular risk markers.","Freitas, Alberto T A; Donovan Giraldo, Andrea E; Pravatta Rezende, Gabriela; Yela, Daniela A; Jales, Rodrigo M; Benetti-Pinto, Cristina L",Clin. endocrinol,,370

Subject and methods: We used data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation with projection information from January-August 2020. A multivariate analysis of logistic regression was performed. The following factors were analyzed (per day): number of beds needed for the hospital services, number of intensive care units (ICU) beds required, number of ventilation devices, number of both hospital and ICU admissions due to COVID-19. Nagelkerke's R2 coefficient of determination was used to evaluate the model's predictive ability. The quality of the model's fit was assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow and the chi-square tests. Results: Among the evaluated countries, Italy presented greater need for ICU beds/day (&#8804; 98; OR = 2315.122; CI 95% [334.767-16,503.502]; p < 0.001) and daily ventilation devices (&#8804; 118; OR = 1784.168; CI 95% [250.217-12,721.995]; p < 0.001). It is expected that both Italy and Spain have a higher ICU admission rate due to COVID-19 (n = 14/day). Spain will need more beds/day (&#8804; 357; OR = 146.838; CI 95% [113.242-190.402]; p < 0.001) and probably will have a higher number of daily hospital admissions (n = 48/day). All the above-mentioned factors have an important impact on patients' mortality due to COVID-19 in all four countries. Conclusions: Further investments in hospitals' infrastructure, as well as the development of innovative devices for patient's ventilation, are paramount to fight the pandemic in the USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany.","Cobre, Alexandre de Fátima; Böger, Beatriz; Vilhena, Raquel de Oliveira; Fachi, Mariana Millan; Dos Santos, Josiane Marlei Muller Fernandes; Tonin, Fernanda Stumpf",Z Gesundh Wiss,,370

SUMMARY: Drug utilization trends for 7 medications used to treat patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 at 47 New York hospitals were identified. The data demonstrated sharp increases in aggregate utilization of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine and the number of patients receiving either drug beginning on March 15, with a notable 20% median increase per day through March 31. The net quantity of drug charge units per day for midazolam, propofol, ketamine, cisatracurium, and fentanyl also increased during the study period. Following peak utilization, use of all study drugs decreased at different times throughout April 2020. The data were used to provide information to various stakeholders in the drug supply chain during the initial surge of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: This analysis describes the increased use, beginning in mid-March 2020, of hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, midazolam, propofol, ketamine, cisatracurium, and fentanyl in 47 hospitals in New York State. The increased utilization of supportive therapy drugs was consistent with the surge in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. These data and observations can help clinicians, health-system leaders, manufacturers, wholesalers, and policymakers understand the impact of current and future pandemics on the drug supply chain.","Dabestani, Arash; DeAngelo, Dawn; Chhay, Sophia R; Larson, Bayli J; Ganio, Michael C",Am J Health Syst Pharm,,370

We identify factors indicating COVID-19 positivity in non-hospitalized patients and prognosticators of moderate-to-severe disease. METHODS: Appeals conducted in April-June 2020 in social media, collaborating medical societies and patient advocacy groups recruited 20,476 participants &#8805;18 years who believed they had COVID-19 exposure. Volunteers consented on-line and reported height, weight, concomitant illnesses, medication and supplement use, residential, occupational or community COVID-19 exposure, symptoms and symptom severity on a 4-point scale. Of the 12,117 curated analytic population 2279 reported a COVID-19 viral test result: 865 positive (COVID+) and 1414 negative (COVID-). RESULTS: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever best distinguished COVID+ from COVID-participants (OR 6.07, 95% CI: 4.39 to 8.47). COVID + subjects with BMI&#8805;30, concomitant respiratory disorders or an organ transplant had increased risk of moderate-to- severe dyspnoea. Race and anti-autoimmunity medication did not affect moderate-to-severe dyspnea risk. CONCLUSIONS: The triad of anosmia, ageusia and fever differentiates COVID-19. Elevated risks of severe symptoms outside the hospital were most evident among the obese and those with pulmonary comorbidity. Race and use of medication for autoimmune disease did not predict severe disease. These findings should facilitate rapid COVID-19 diagnosis and triage in settings without testing.","Dreyer, Nancy A; Reynolds, Matthew; DeFilippo Mack, Christina; Brinkley, Emma; Petruski-Ivleva, Natalia; Hawaldar, Kalyani; Toovey, Stephen; Morris, Jonathan",Travel Med Infect Dis,,370

464596,Reshaping head and neck reconstruction policy during the COVID-19 pandemic peak: Experience in a front-line institution,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Opioid use is prevalent in the United Kingdom and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic it had been recognized that the safety of opioids was an important issue to be monitored by the UK medicines regulatory agency. With the emergence of COVID-19, this requirement has been even greater. This review was undertaken to determine the impact of the pandemic on safety and surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom. RECENT FINDINGS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the surveillance of opioids in the United Kingdom continued, although primary research was often conducted with data prior to the pandemic. Of those studies that were conducted while the pandemic was ongoing, access to opioids (or opioid substitution therapy) and the subsequent effect on patient safety was the main theme. SUMMARY: In the United Kingdom, changes in accessibility to the healthcare system and how healthcare providers operated during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had unintended consequences on use and safety of opioids, due to the shift in focus to preventing COVID-19 from overwhelming the healthcare system. The findings from this review support the need to continue surveillance in the United Kingdom, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid utilization and safety.","Osborne, Vicki",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,370

Confronted by the exigencies of the Covid-19 surge that struck New York, he questions the task force's decision not to give any degree of preference to health care workers who might become ill. He posits that they are due a compensatory ethic and some deference given the risks they have assumed, often with inadequate protective gear. Reflecting on his ambivalence, he asks if his change of heart reflects the impact of experiential learning or the erosion of nomos-or governing norms-described by Thucydides when the plague struck Athens.","Fins, Joseph J",Hastings Cent Rep,,370

467383,A Method to Decrease Exposure to Aerosols for Percutaneous Tracheostomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which may exacerbate complications of this new viral infection. Metformin is an anti-hyperglycemic agent with host-directed immune-modulatory effects, which relieve exaggerated inflammation and reduce lung tissue damage. The current systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the potential mechanism of action and the efficacy of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science up to July 30, 2020. The following keywords were used: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""metformin"", and ""antidiabetic drug"". Results: Fourteen studies were included in our systematic review. Three of them were observational with 6,659 participants. Decreasing insulin resistance, reduction of some inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-&#945;, modulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and improving neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio are some of the potential mechanisms of metformin in COVID-19 patients with DM. Nine out of fourteen articles revealed the positive effect of metformin on the prognosis of COVID-19 in diabetic or even non-diabetic patients. Moreover, different studies have shown that metformin is more effective in women than men. Conclusions: The use of metformin may lead to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2, especially in diabetic women. Further observational studies should be conducted to clarify the effects of metformin as a part of the treatment strategy of COVID-19.","Zangiabadian, Moein; Nejadghaderi, Seyed Aria; Zahmatkesh, Mohammad Mahdi; Hajikhani, Bahareh; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi; Nasiri, Mohammad Javad",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),,370

The large variety of dissimilar and country-dependent epidemiological factors, in fact, makes extremely difficult to understand their influence on the epidemic trends within a unique and coherent framework. We present a geometric framework to characterize, in an integrated and low-dimensional fashion, the epidemic plume-like trajectories traced by the infection rate, $I$, and the fatality rate, $D$, in the $(I,D)$ plane. Our analysis enables the definition of an epidemiometric system based on three geometric observables rating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic events via scales analogous to those for the magnitude and the intensity of seismic events. Being exquisitely geometric, our framework can be applied to classify other epidemic data and secondary waves, raising the possibility of designing epidemic alerts or early warning systems to enhance public and governmental responses to a rapidly emerging outbreak.","Bonamassa, Ivan; Strinati, Marcello Calvanese; Chan, Adrian; Gotesdyner, Ouriel; Gross, Bnaya; Havlin, Shlomo; Leo, Mario",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10450v1.pdf,370

OBJECTIVE: The current paper presented a review of the early literature concerning emerging nursing challenges during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic search of the published literature between January and May 2020 was carried out in Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar to identify relevant quantitative and qualitative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two original articles were retrieved, the majority of which were survey studies from China. Synthesis of the evidence resulted in four overarching themes including ""being physically and mentally drained in the face of fear and uncertainty,"" ""shortage of personal protective equipment and usability issues,"" ""psychosomatic disturbances among nurses,"" and ""moderators to mitigate nurses' challenges."" CONCLUSIONS: Providing care for demanding COVID-19 patients, nurses experienced a gruelling situation, during which a significant amount of psychological and physical distress was inflicted to them. However, receiving proper support from their organization and society could improve the condition substantially.

481976,Leveraging Remote Research Associates During a Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, pneumonia cases of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Identified as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the number of cases grew rapidly by human-to-human transmission in Wuhan. Social media, especially Sina Weibo (a major Chinese microblogging social media site), has become an important platform for the public to obtain information and seek help. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who asked for help on Sina Weibo. METHODS: We conducted data mining on Sina Weibo and extracted the data of 485 patients who presented with clinical symptoms and imaging descriptions of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. In total, 9878 posts seeking help on Sina Weibo from February 3 to 20, 2020 were analyzed. We used a descriptive research methodology to describe the distribution and other epidemiological characteristics of patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection. The distance between patients' home and the nearest designated hospital was calculated using the geographic information system ArcGIS. RESULTS: All patients included in this study who sought help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan, with a median age of 63.0 years (IQR 55.0-71.0). Fever (408/485, 84.12%) was the most common symptom. Ground-glass opacity (237/314, 75.48%) was the most common pattern on chest computed tomography; 39.67% (167/421) of families had suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed family members; 36.58% (154/421) of families had 1 or 2 suspected and/or laboratory-confirmed members; and 70.52% (232/329) of patients needed to rely on their relatives for help. The median time from illness onset to real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing was 8 days (IQR 5.0-10.0), and the median time from illness onset to online help was 10 days (IQR 6.0-12.0). Of 481 patients, 32.22% (n=155) lived more than 3 kilometers away from the nearest designated hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that patients seeking help on Sina Weibo lived in Wuhan and most were elderly. Most patients had fever symptoms, and ground-glass opacities were noted in chest computed tomography. The onset of the disease was characterized by family clustering and most families lived far from the designated hospital. Therefore, we recommend the following: (1) the most stringent centralized medical observation measures should be taken to avoid transmission in family clusters; and (2) social media can help these patients get early attention during Wuhan's lockdown. These findings can help the government and the health department identify high-risk patients and accelerate emergency responses following public demands for help.","Huang, Chunmei; Xu, Xinjie; Cai, Yuyang; Ge, Qinmin; Zeng, Guangwang; Li, Xiaopan; Zhang, Weide; Ji, Chen; Yang, Ling",J Med Internet Res,,370

489110,Microsurgical procedures during COVID-19 pandemic: the VITOM® 3D-HD exoscopic system as alternative to the operating microscope to properly use personal protective equipment (PPE),2020,"Objective: All respiratory care represents some risk of becoming an Aerosol Generating Procedure (AGP) during COVID-19 patient management. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Environmental Control/Engineering is advised. High Velocity Nasal Insufflation (HVNI) and High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) deliver High Flow Oxygen (HFO) therapy, established as a competent means of supporting oxygenation for acute respiratory distress patients, including that precipitated by COVID-19. Although unlikely to present a disproportionate particle dispersal risk, AGP from HFO continues to be a concern. Previously, we published a preliminary model. Here, we present a subsequent high-resolution simulation (higher complexity/reliability) to provide a more accurate and precise particle characterization on the effect of surgical masks on patients during HVNI, Low-Flow Oxygen therapy (LFO2), and tidal breathing. Methods: This in-silico modeling study of HVNI, LFO2, and tidal breathing presents ANSYS Fluent Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations that evaluate the effect of Type I surgical mask use over patient face on particle/droplet behavior. Results: This in-silico modeling simulation study of HVNI (40Lâmin-1) with a simulated surgical mask suggests 88.8% capture of exhaled particulate mass in the mask, compared to 77.4% in LFO2 (6Lâmin-1) capture, with particle distribution escaping to the room (>1m from face) lower for HVNI+Mask versus LFO2+Mask (8.23% versus 17.2%). The overwhelming proportion of particulate escape was associated with mask-fit designed model gaps. Particle dispersion was associated with lower velocity. Conclusions: These simulations suggest employing a surgical mask over the HVNI interface may be useful in reduction of particulate mass distribution associated with AGPs.This article is protected by copyright.

491177,Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis Associated with Empagliflozin Use in the Course of the SARS-Cov-2 Pandemic,2020,"In order to define public health policies, simple, inexpensive and robust detection methods for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are vital for mass-testing in resource limited settings. The current choice of molecular methods for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes nucleic acid-based testing (NAT) for viral genetic material and antigen-based testing for viral protein identification. Host exposure is detected using antibody detection assays. While NATs require sophisticated instrument and trained manpower, antigen tests are plagued by their low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, a test offering sensitive detection for presence of infection as a colorimetric readout holds promise to enable mass testing in resource constrained environments by minimally trained personnel. Here we present a novel HRPZyme Assisted Recognition of Infection by Optical Measurement (HARIOM) assay which combines specificity of NATs with sensitivity of enzymatic assays resulting in enhanced signal to noise ratios in an easily interpretable colorimetric readout. Using this assay, we could detect up to 102 copies of synthetic viral RNA spiked in saliva as a detection matrix. Validating our assay on suspected human subjects, we found concordance with PCR based readouts with visible colorimetric distinction between positive and negative samples in less than an hour. We believe that this assay holds the potential to aid in mass screening to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection by facilitating colorimetric detection with minimal resources and less trained personnel.","Ahmad, Mohd; Sharma, Pooja; Kamai, Asangla; Agrawal, Anurag; Faruq, Mohammed; Kulshreshtha, Ankur",Biosens Bioelectron,,370

Efforts to define ways to assess functionality of health systems have however varied, with many not translating into concrete policy action and influence on system development. We present an approach to provide countries with information on the functionality of their systems in a manner that will facilitate movement towards universal health coverage. We conceptualise functionality of a health system as being a construct of four capacities: access to, quality of, demand for essential services and its resilience to external shocks. We test and confirm the validity of these capacities as appropriate measures of system functionality. We thus provide results for functionality of the 47 countries of the WHO African Region based on this. The functionality of health systems ranges from 34.4 to 75.8 on a 0-100 scale. Access to essential services represents the lowest capacity in most countries of the region, specifically due to poor physical access to services. Funding levels from public and out-of-pocket sources represent the strongest predictors of system functionality, compared with other sources. By focusing on the assessment on the capacities that define system functionality, each country has concrete information on where it needs to focus, in order to improve the functionality of its health system to enable it respond to current needs including achieving universal health coverage, while responding to shocks from challenges such as the 2019 coronavirus disease. This systematic and replicable approach for assessing health system functionality can provide the guidance needed for investing in country health systems to attain universal health coverage goals.","Karamagi, Humphrey Cyprian; Tumusiime, Prosper; Titi-Ofei, Regina; Droti, Benson; Kipruto, Hillary; Nabyonga-Orem, Juliet; Seydi, Aminata Binetou-Wahebine; Zawaira, Felicitas; Schmets, Gerard; Cabore, Joseph Waogodo",,,370

SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates antigen-specific antibody responses. Multiple serologic tests have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. However, which antigens are most suitable for serological testing remains poorly understood. Specifically, which antigens have the highest sensitivity and specificity for serological testing and which have the least cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses are currently unknown. Previous studies have shown that the S1 domain of the spike (S) protein has very low cross-reactivity between epidemic coronaviruses and common human coronaviruses, whereas the S2 domain of the S protein, and the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) show low-level cross-reactivity. Therefore, S1 is considered more specific than the native homotrimer of the S protein, and the receptor-binding domain as an antigen to test patient antibodies is more sensitive than the native N protein. In addition, an increasing number of studies have used multi-antigen protein arrays to screen serum from convalescent patients with COVID-19. Antigen combinations demonstrated improved performance as compared to each individual antigen. For rapid antigen detection, the sensitivity of the test is higher in the first week of onset of the disease with high viral loads. Highly sensitive and specific immunological diagnostic methods for antibodies or those that directly detect viral antigens in clinical samples would be beneficial for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Li, Dandan; Li, Jinming",J. clin. microbiol,,370

Due to constant evolution of respiratory bacteria and viruses, development of drug resistance and emerging pathogens, it constitutes a considerable health care threat. To enable development of novel strategies to control pneumonia, a better understanding of the complex mechanisms of interaction between host cells and infecting pathogens is vital. Here, we review the roles of host cell and bacterial-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in these interactions. We discuss clinical and experimental as well as pathogen-overarching and pathogen-specific evidence for common viral and bacterial elicitors of community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Finally, we highlight the potential of EVs for improved management of pneumonia patients and discuss the translational steps to be taken before they can be safely exploited as novel vaccines, biomarkers, or therapeutics in clinical practice.","Jung, Anna Lena; Schmeck, Bernd; Wiegand, Marie; Bedenbender, Katrin; Benedikter, Birke J",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,,370

Existing physiologic scoring systems have traditionally been used for outcome prediction, clinical research, quality of care analysis, and benchmarking in the intensive care unit (ICU) environment. However, there is limited experience with scoring systems in the ED, while early and aggressive intervention in critically ill patients in the ED is becoming increasingly important. Development and implementation of physiologic scoring systems specific to this setting is potentially useful in the early recognition and prognostication of illness severity. A few existing ICU physiologic scoring systems have been applied in the ED, with some success. Other ED specific scoring systems have been developed for various applications: recognition of patients at risk for infection; prediction of mortality after critical care transport; prediction of in-hospital mortality after admission; assessment of prehospital therapeutic efficacy; screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome; and prediction of pediatric hospital admission. Further efforts at developing unique physiologic assessment methodologies for use in the ED will improve quality of patient care, aid in resource allocation, improve prognostic accuracy, and objectively measure the impact of early intervention in the ED.","Hargrove, Jenny; Nguyen, H Bryant",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16137387/,370

Ischemic stroke (IS) is now one of the well-documented additional clinical manifestation of COVID-19. Most COVID-19 related IS cases have been categorized as cryptogenic or embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), which are most often suspected to have an undiagnosed cardioembolic source. COVID-19 is known to also cause cardiac dysfunction, heart failure, and atrial arrhythmias (AA), but the long-term impact of this cardiac dysfunction on stroke incidence is unknown. With millions afflicted with COVID-19 and the ever-rising infection rate, it is important to consider the potential long-term impact of COVID-19 on possible future IS incidence. Accomplishing these goals will require novel strategies that allow for diagnosis, data capture, and prediction of future IS risk using tools that are adaptable to the evolving clinical challenges such that patient care delivery and research.","Elfasi, Aisha; Echevarria, Franklin; Rodriguez, Robert; Roman Casul, Yoram A.; Khanna, Anna Yuzefovich; Mankowski, Robert T.; Simpkins, Alexis N.",eNeurologicalSci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405650221000174; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405650221000174?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ensci.2021.100325; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553699/,370

Males and females, 18 years of age and older presenting with a diagnosis of displaced or nondisplaced, intracapsular, or extracapsular hip fracture, underwent standard of care—comparative analysis of the patient's characteristics and clinical outcomes. The primary study outcomes included age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index, the onset of injury, date of arrival, payer, the primary type of injury and comorbidities, mechanism of injury, treatment received, postoperative complications, days in an intensive care unit (ICU), discharge disposition, pre- and postinjury functional status, and COVID-19 test. Age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index were similar in the patients in 2019 compared to 2020. The patients' average age was 76 years old, 80% reported Hispanic ethnicity, and 63% of the patients were females. Most injuries (90%) occurred due to falls. On average, patients in 2020 presented 4.8 days after the injury onset as compared to 0.7 days in 2019 (p < 0.05). There was an increase in displaced fractures in 2019 compared to 2020 and an increase in patients' disposition into rehabilitation facilities compared to skilled nursing facilities. Despite the delay in presentation, length of stay, days in the ICU, or functional outcomes of the patients were not affected. Although the patients showed a delayed presentation after hip fracture, this does not appear to significantly interfere with the short-term or the 6-month mortality outcomes of the patients, suggesting the possibility of guided delayed care during times of national emergency and increased strain in hospital resources.","Serra-Torres, Michael; Barreda, Raul; Weaver, David; Torres-Reveron, Annelyn",Adv Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8822004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643668/,370

METHODS: In the current study, the variant PEDV strain HM2017 was isolated and purified and a viral growth curve was constructed according to the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). HM2017 were amplify with RT-PCR and analyzed by phylogeny analysis. Animal pathogenicity experiment was carried to evaluate the HM2017 clinical assessment. RESULTS: Genome-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that PEDV strain HM2017 was clustered into the variant subgroup GII-a that is currently circulating in pig populations in China. The highest median tissue culture infectious dose of strain HM2017 after 15 passages in Vero cells was 1.33 × 10(7) viral particles/mL. Strain HM2017 was highly virulent to suckling piglets, which exhibited clinical symptoms at 12 h post-infection (hpi) (i.e., weight loss at 12–84 hpi, increased body temperatures at 24–48 hpi, high viral loads in the jejunum and ileum, and 100% mortality by 84 hpi).

An important issue is the assessment of within-country heterogeneity for geographically extensive countries. The aim of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal changes in health status in Russia and to compare these regional changes with global trends. METHODS: The index, which considers the infant mortality rate and the male and female life expectancy at birth, was used for this purpose. Homogeneous territorial groups were identified using principal component analysis and multivariate ranking procedures. Trend analysis of individual indicators included in the index was also performed to assess the changes over the past 20 years (1990–2017). RESULTS: The study indicated a trend towards convergence in health indicators worldwide, which is largely due to changes in infant mortality. It also revealed that the trend of increasing life expectancy in many regions of Russia is not statistically significant. Significant interregional heterogeneity of health status in Russia was identified according to the application of typological ranking. The regions were characterized by similar index values until the mid-1990s. CONCLUSIONS: The strong spatial inequality in health of population was found in Russia. While many regions of Russia were comparable to the countries in the high-income group in terms of GDP, the progress in health was less pronounced. Perhaps this can be explained by intraregional inequality, expressed by significant fluctuations in income levels.

Although not crowded in a confined space like a bus or a metro car, bike-sharing users are exposed to the bike surface and take the transmission risk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, how to meet user demand and avoid virus spreading has become an important issue for bike-sharing. METHODS: Based on the trip data of bike-sharing in Nanjing, China, this study analyzes the travel demand and operation management before and after the pandemic outbreak from the perspectives of stations, users, and bikes. Semi-logarithmic difference-in-differences model, visualization methods, and statistic indexes are applied to explore the transportation service and risk prevention of bike-sharing during the pandemic. RESULTS: Pandemic control strategies sharply reduced user demand, and commuting trips decreased more significantly. Some stations around health and religious places become more important. Men and older adults may be more dependent on bike-sharing systems. The declined trips reduce user contacts and transmission risk. Central urban areas have more user close contacts and higher transmission risk than suburban areas. Besides, a new concept of user distancing is proposed to decrease transmission risk and the number of idle bikes. CONCLUSIONS: This paper is the first research focusing on both user demand and transmission risk of bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study evaluates the mobility role of bike-sharing during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also provides insights into curbing the viral transmission within the city.","Hua, Mingzhuang; Chen, Xuewu; Cheng, Long; Chen, Jingxu",J Transp Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603960/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214140521002942; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214140521002942; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jth.2021.101264,370

METHODS: We used data on daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, recovered cases and deaths from the official website of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission to build compartmental models for three phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. We incorporated the hospital-bed capacity of both designated and Fangcang shelter hospitals. We used the models to assess the success of the strategy adopted in Wuhan to control the COVID-19 epidemic. FINDINGS: Based on the 13 348 Fangcang shelter hospitals beds used in practice, our models show that if the Fangcang shelter hospitals had been opened on 6 February (a day after their actual opening), the total number of COVID-19 cases would have reached 7 413 798 (instead of 50 844) with 1 396 017 deaths (instead of 5003), and the epidemic would have lasted for 179 days (instead of 71). CONCLUSION: While the designated hospitals saved lives of patients with severe COVID-19, it was the increased hospital-bed capacity of the large number of Fangcang shelter hospitals that helped slow and eventually stop the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan. Given the current global pandemic of COVID-19, our study suggests that increasing hospital-bed capacity, especially through temporary hospitals such as Fangcang shelter hospitals, to isolate groups of people with mild symptoms within an affected region could help curb and eventually stop COVID-19 outbreaks in communities where effective household isolation is not possible.","Li, Juan; Yuan, Pei; Heffernan, Jane; Zheng, Tingting; Ogden, Nick; Sander, Beate; Li, Jun; Li, Qi; Bélair, Jacques; Kong, Jude Dzevela; Aruffo, Elena; Tan, Yi; Jin, Zhen; Yu, Yong; Fan, Meng; Cui, Jingan; Teng, Zhidong; Zhu, Huaiping",Bull World Health Organ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33293743/; https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.258152,370

Among them, three emerging pathogenic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and a newly identified CoV (2019-nCoV), once caused or continue to cause severe infections in humans, posing significant threats to global public health. SARS-CoV infection in humans (with about 10% case fatality rate) was first reported from China in 2002, while MERS-CoV infection in humans (with about 34.4% case fatality rate) was first reported from Saudi Arabia in June 2012. 2019-nCoV was first reported from China in December 2019, and is currently infecting more than 70000 people (with about 2.7% case fatality rate). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses, using bats as their natural reservoirs, and then transmitting through intermediate hosts, leading to human infections. Nevertheless, the intermediate host for 2019-nCoV is still under investigation and the vaccines against this new CoV have not been available. Although a variety of vaccines have been developed against infections of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, none of them has been approved for use in humans. In this review, we have described the structure and function of key proteins of emerging human CoVs, overviewed the current vaccine types to be developed against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and summarized recent advances in subunit vaccines against these two pathogenic human CoVs. These subunit vaccines are introduced on the basis of full-length spike (S) protein, receptor-binding domain (RBD), non-RBD S protein fragments, and non-S structural proteins, and the potential factors affecting these subunit vaccines are also illustrated.

One of the most effective and widely used means of protection was the FFP2 respirator. Unfortunately, this crisis created a shortage of these masks, prompting hospitals to explore opportunities to reuse them after decontamination. An approach for assessing the filtration efficiency of decontaminated FFP2 masks has been proposed and applied to evaluate the possibilities of their safe reuse. The decontamination processes adopted are those based on moist heat or hydrogen peroxide. The approach introduces efficiency measures that define the filtration and protection capacity of the masks, which characterize both chemical and structural changes, and encompasses many techniques including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The test protocol was applied to mask samples that had endured different decontamination cycles and the results of their efficiency measures were compared to brand-new masks performances. The main result was that chemical and structural characterization of the decontaminated masks have shown no substantial change or deformation of their filter media structures. Indeed, the respiratory resistance test has shown that the results of both the FFP2 masks that have undergone a hydrogen peroxide disinfection cycle or a steam autoclave cycle remained constant with a small variation of 10 Pa from the EN149 standard. The chemical characterization, on the other hand, has shown that the filter media of the decontaminated masks remains unchanged, with no detectable chemical derivatives in its constituents.","moussa, b.; Omokhtar, B.; hmami, F.; El mabrouk, K.; El alami, L.; Arhoune, B.; Belahcen, M.

It begins with an overview of the current knowledge on the biology, pathophysiology, and epidemiology of COVID-19. It then presents the state of smoking and vaping during the pandemic by summarizing the published data on prevalence, use patterns, product availability/accessibility, sales records, and motivation to quit before- and after the start of the pandemic. It highlights the state of evidence on the association of tobacco product use with COVID-19 infection and transmission rates, symptom severity, and clinical outcomes. Also discussed are proposed biological mechanisms and behavioral factors that may modulate COVID-19 risk in tobacco product users. Furthermore, competing hypotheses on the protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19 as well as the claimed “smokers’ paradox” are discussed. Considerations and challenges of COVID-19 vaccination in tobacco product users are underscored. Collectively, the present data show an ‘incomplete’ but rapidly-shaping picture on the association of tobacco product use and COVID-19 infection, disease course, and clinical outcomes. Evidence is also growing on the mechanisms by which tobacco product use may contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology. While we await definitive conclusions on the relative risk of COVID-19 infection in tobacco product users, compelling data confirm that many comorbidities associated with/caused by smoking predispose to COVID-19 infection, severe disease, and poor prognosis. Additionally, it is becoming increasing clear that should smokers get the disease, they are more likely to have serious health consequences.","Besaratinia, Ahmad",Carcinogenesis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34223886/; https://doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgab061,370

Our results indicate that, prior to significant public health interventions, the reproductive numbers for a majority (10) of these outbreaks are similar, with median posterior estimates ranging between 1.4 and 2.8. These estimates provide a view which is complementary to that provided by those based on traditional line listing data. The genomic-based view is arguably less susceptible to biases resulting from differences in testing protocols, testing intensity, and import of cases into the community of interest. In the analyses reported here, the genomic data primarily provides information regarding which samples belong to a particular outbreak. We observe that once these outbreaks are identified, the sampling dates carry the majority of the information regarding the reproductive number. Finally, we provide genome-based estimates of the cumulative case counts for each outbreak, which allow us to speculate on the amount of unreported infections within the populations housing each outbreak. These results indicate that for the majority (7) of the populations studied, the number of recorded cases is much bigger than the estimated cumulative case counts, suggesting the presence of unsequenced pathogen diversity in these populations.","Vaughan, T.

Multiple respiratory viruses (including 15 common viruses) were screened by validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays and confirmed by sequencing. Demographic data and the distribution of viral infections were also examined. RESULTS: Of 700 samples, 547 (78.1%) tested positive for viral infections. The picornaviruses (PIC), which included rhinovirus (RV) and enterovirus (EV), were the most common (34.0%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (28.3%), human bocavirus (HBoV) (19.1%), adenovirus (ADV) (13.7%), human coronaviruses (HCoV) (10.7%), influenza A and B (8.9%), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1–3) (7.9%), and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (5.0%). PIC (RV/EV) and RSV were the most prevalent etiological agents of SARI in both cities. The total and age-matched prevalence of RSV, HCoV, and hMPV among SARI children under 5 years old were significantly higher in Beijing than in Shanghai. Different age and seasonal distribution patterns of the viral infections were found between Beijing and Shanghai. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection was tested and shown to be the most prevalent etiological agent among children with SARI in either the Beijing or the Shanghai area, while showing different patterns of viral and epidemiological profiles. Our findings provide a better understanding of the roles of geographic location and climate in respiratory viral infections in hospitalized children with SARI.","Zhao, Yanjie; Lu, Roujian; Shen, Jun; Xie, Zhengde; Liu, Gaoshan; Tan, Wenjie",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4385-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429710/,370

However, unlike clustering patterns of the complete gene sequences of human and camel MERS-CoVs, the 4a and 4b protein coding regions did not constitute species-specific phylogenetic groups. Moreover, given the estimated evolutionary rates of the complete, 4a, and 4b gene sequences, the 4a and 4b proteins might be less affected by species-specific innate immune pressures.

Here we report that either pharmacological inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase with amitriptyline, imipramine, fluoxetine, sertraline, escitalopram, or maprotiline, or genetic downregulation of the enzyme prevents infection of cultured cells or freshy isolated human nasal epithelial cells with SARS-CoV-2 or pseudoviral pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 particles expressing spike, a bona fide system mimicking SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection activates acid sphingomyelinase and triggers a release of ceramide on the cell surface. Neutralization or consumption of surface ceramide reduces infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Treating volunteers with a low dose of amitriptyline prevents infection of freshly isolated nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The data justify clinical studies investigating whether amitriptyline, a safe drug used clinically for almost 60 years, or other antidepressants that functionally block acid sphingomyelinase prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Carpinteiro, Alexander; Edwards, Michael J.; Hoffmann, Markus; Kochs, Georg; Gripp, Barbara; Weigang, Sebastian; Adams, Constantin; Carpinteiro, Elisa; Gulbins, Anne; Keitsch, Simone; Sehl, Carolin; Soddemann, Matthias; Wilker, Barbara; Kamler, Markus; Bertsch, Thomas; Lang, Karl S.; Patel, Sameer; Wilson, Gregory C.; Walter, Silke; Hengel, Hartmut; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Lang, Philipp; Kornhuber, Johannes; Becker, Katrin Anne; Ahmad, Syed A.; Fassbender, Klaus; Gulbins, Erich",Cell Rep Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120301865?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163980/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2020.100142; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666379120301865,370

It is crucial to involve patients in planning, developing and monitoring the optimal e-Health solution. This research aims to describe patient-centered innovation in an early developmental stage of the WOMEN-UP solution. We conducted a qualitative study through a self-developed questionnaire in 22 women with SUI, to define system requirements from a patient’s perspective. The first prototype of the WOMEN-UP solution was developed. It was tested by 9 patients in a usability study (think-aloud protocol and retrospective interviews). Patient preferences regarding the possible use of an e-Health solution with serious games for PFMT were: (1) to receive feedback about PFMT; (2) convenient home-use; (3) increasing motivation; (4) available in medical centers. Identified usability aids (31) reassured our design-development plan, which considered the biofeedback and serious games as key factors. Patient’s perspective detected some unexpected issues related to the calibration and serious games, involving a change in the ongoing development to get an improved WOMEN-UP solution; the value of patient-centered innovation during the development of an e-Health solution for PFMT (WOMEN-UP solution).

Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice, following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two-dose heterologous vaccination regimens than single-dose regimens. Neutralising titres after heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1(+) CD4 T cells, which is superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine technologies.","Spencer, Alexandra J.; McKay, Paul F.; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Ulaszewska, Marta; Bissett, Cameron D.; Hu, Kai; Samnuan, Karnyart; Blakney, Anna K.; Wright, Daniel; Sharpe, Hannah R.; Gilbride, Ciaran; Truby, Adam; Allen, Elizabeth R.; Gilbert, Sarah C.; Shattock, Robin J.; Lambe, Teresa",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001897/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23173-1,370

The salt coating on the fiber surface dissolves upon exposure to virus aerosols and recrystallizes during drying, destroying the pathogens. When tested with tightly sealed sides, salt-coated filters showed remarkably higher filtration efficiency than conventional mask filtration layer, and 100% survival rate was observed in mice infected with virus penetrated through salt-coated filters. Viruses captured on salt-coated filters exhibited rapid infectivity loss compared to gradual decrease on bare filters. Salt-coated filters proved highly effective in deactivating influenza viruses regardless of subtypes and following storage in harsh environmental conditions.

650222,What is the best treatment option for head and neck cancers in COVID-19 pandemic? A rapid review,2020-09-18,"Background: Disease surveillance is a critical function of public health, provides essential information about disease burden, clinical and epidemiologic parameters of disease, and is an important element to effective and timely case and contact tracing. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the essential role these functions have to preserve public health. Syndromic surveillance, electronic laboratory reporting in the meaningful use program, and the growth of the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) have created linkages between hospitals, commercial labs, and public health that can collect and organize data, often through EHR and order workflows, to improve the timeliness and completeness of reporting. In theory, the standard data formats and exchange methods provided by meaningful use should enable rapid healthcare data exchange in the setting of disruptive healthcare events like a pandemic. In reality, access to data remains challenging, and even if available, often lack conformity to regulated standards. Objective: We sought to use regulated interoperability standards already in production to generate regional bed capacity awareness, enhance the capture of epidemiological risk factors and clinical variables among COVID-19 tested patients, and reduce the administrative burden of reporting for stakeholders in a manner that could be replicated by other public health agencies. Methods: Following a public health order mandating data submission, we developed technical infrastructure to combine multiple data feeds from electronic health record systems. We measured the completeness of each feed, and the match rate between feeds. Results: A cloud-based environment was created that received data from electronic lab reporting, consolidated clinical data architecture, and bed capacity data feeds from sites. Data governance was planned from the project beginning to aid in consensus and principles for data use. 88,906 total persons from CCDA data among 14 facilities, and 408,741 persons from ELR records among 88 facilities, were submitted. Fields routinely absent from ELR feeds included travel histories, clinical symptoms, and comorbidities. CCDA data provided an improvement in the quality of data available for surveillance and was highly complete with <5% for all records types with the exception of patient cell phone. 90.1% of records could be matched between CCDA and ELR feeds. Conclusions: We describe the development of a city-wide public health data hub for the surveillance of COVID-19 infection. We were able to assess the completeness of existing ELR feeds, augment these feeds with CCDA documents, establish secure transfer methods for data exchange, develop cloud-based architecture to enable secure data storage and analytics, and produced meaningful dashboards for the monitoring of capacity and disease burden. We see this public health and clinical data registry as an informative example of the power of common standards across electronic records, and a potential template for future extension of the use of standards to improve public health surveillance.","Hota, B.; Casey, P.; McIntyre, A.

The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in the incidence and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine uptake in various sociodemographic and population group strata in Israel. METHODS: We analysed nationwide publicly available, aggregated data on PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths between March 2020 and February 2021, as well as the first three months of COVID-19 immunisation according to sociodemographics, including population group and residential socioeconomic status (SES). We computed incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19. Comparisons between towns with predominantly Arab, ultra-Orthodox Jewish (the minorities), general Jewish populations, and according to SES, were conducted using generalised linear models with negative binomial distribution. FINDINGS: Overall, 774,030 individuals had SARS-CoV-2 infection (cumulative incidence 84•5 per 1,000 persons) and 5687 COVID-19 patients had died (mortality rate 62•8 per 100,000 persons). The highest mortality rate was found amongst the elderly. Most (>75%) individuals aged 60 years or above have been vaccinated with BNT162b2 vaccine. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in towns with predominantly Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations than in the general Jewish population, and in low SES communities. COVID-19 mortality rate was highest amongst Arabs. Conversely, vaccine uptake was lower amongst Arab and ultra-Orthodox Jewish populations and low SES communities. INTERPRETATION: Ethnic and religious minorities and low SES communities experience substantial COVID-19 burden, and have lower vaccine uptake, even in a society with universal accessibility to healthcare. Quantifying these inequalities is fundamental towards reducing these gaps, which imposes a designated apportion of resources to adequately control the pandemic.

Here, we performed a head-to-head comparison of the hemocompatibility of a centrifugal cardiac assist system—the Centrimag, with that of the latest generation of an intravascular microaxial system—the Impella 5.5. Specifically, hemolysis, platelet activation, microparticle (MP) generation, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) degradation were evaluated for both devices. Freshly obtained porcine blood was recirculated within device propelled mock loops for 4 hours, and alteration of the hemocompatibility parameters was monitored over time. We found that the Impella 5.5 and Centrimag exhibited low levels of hemolysis, as indicated by minor increase in plasma free hemoglobin. Both devices did not induce platelet degranulation, as no alteration of β-thromboglobulin and P-selectin in plasma occurred, rather minor downregulation of platelet surface P-selectin was detected. Furthermore, blood exposure to shear stress via both Centrimag and Impella 5.5 resulted in a minor decrease of platelet count with associated ejection of procoagulant MPs, and a decrease of vWF functional activity (but not plasma level of vWF-antigen). Greater MP generation was observed with the Centrimag relative to the Impella 5.5. Thus, the Impella 5.5 despite having a lower profile and higher impeller rotational speed demonstrated good and equivalent hemocompatibility, in comparison with the predicate Centrimag, with the advantage of lower generation of MPs.","Roka-Moiia, Yana; Li, Mengtang; Ivich, Adriana; Muslmani, Sami; Kern, Karl B.; Slepian, Marvin J.",ASAIO J,https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000001283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33003068/,370

Much progress has been made in vaccine development, and vaccination will become an inevitable trend in the fight against this pandemic. However, the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination still remains uncertain. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was used in Wen Juan Xing survey platform. All the respondents were divided into healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the key sociodemographic, cognitive, and attitude associations among the samples of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers. Results: A total of 2,580 respondents completed the questionnaire, including 1,329 healthcare workers and 1,251 non-healthcare workers. This study showed that 76.98% of healthcare workers accepted the COVID-19 vaccine, 18.28% workers were hesitant, and 4.74% workers were resistant. Among the non-healthcare workers, 56.19% workers received the COVID-19 vaccine, 37.57% workers were hesitant, and 6.24% workers were resistant. Among the healthcare workers, compared with vaccine recipients, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.12–2.07); vaccine-resistant individuals were more likely to live in the suburbs (AOR = 2.81, 95% CI: 1.44–3.99) with an income of 10,000 RMB or greater (AOR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.03–3.90). Among the non-healthcare workers, vaccine-hesitant individuals were more likely to be female (AOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.31–2.11); vaccine-resistant individuals were also more likely to be female (AOR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.16–3.02) and older than 65 years (AOR = 4.96, 95% CI: 1.40–7.62). There are great differences between healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers in their cognition and attitude toward vaccines. Conclusions: Our study shows that healthcare workers are more willing to be vaccinated than non-healthcare workers.

To understand these impacts, exploratory factor analysis and choice models with latent variables are estimated utilizing data collected from an online survey representing the population in the greater Portland metropolitan region. The results indicate that each factor has a unique profile in terms of significant socio-demographic variables. A novel contribution of this research is to study the impact on home deliveries of non-traditional variables like health and safety concerns and the presence of household members with disabilities during a pandemic.

656114,Evaluation of an interactive virtual surgical rotation during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021-04-24,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal infectious disease of domestic cats caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a mutant type of FCoV that is characterized by causing fibrinous serositis with effusions in the pleural and abdominal cavities (wet form) and/or granulomatous-necrotizing inflammatory lesions in several organs (dry form). There have been numerous studies on FIP worldwide, whereas information about this disease in Thailand is still limited. Most studies involving molecular surveillance and evaluation of FCoV field strains have examined the genetic diversity of the spike and accessory ORF3c coding regions. Of these, the S gene is more divergent and is responsible for the two FCoV serotypes, while ORF3c harbors mutations that result either in early termination or destruction of the protein. In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and genetic relationships among the current Thai and global FCoV strains in the accessory and nucleocapsid genes using a virus-specific PCR method. Comparative sequence analysis suggested that the Thai FCoV isolates were most closely related to strains reported in the Netherlands, the USA, and China. In the ORF3ab sequences, some Thai strains were more than 99% identical to the DF-2 prototype strain. Truncation of the 3a gene product was found in Thai FCoV strains of group 2. Amino acid deletions were observed in the N, ORF3c, and ORF7b proteins of Thai FCoV sequences. The accessory gene sequence divergence may be responsible for driving the periodic emergence and continued persistence of FCoVs in Thai domestic cat populations. Our findings provide updated information about the molecular characteristics of the accessory and nucleocapsid genes of FCoV strains in circulation that were not previously documented in this country.

Little is known regarding host proteins required for their propagation. We identified human proteins that interact with the glycoproteins (GPs) of a prototypic arenavirus and hantavirus and show that the lectin ERGIC-53 - a cargo receptor required for cellular glycoprotein trafficking within the early exocytic pathway - associates with arenavirus, hantavirus, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, and filovirus GPs. ERGIC-53 binds to arenavirus GPs through a lectin-independent mechanism, traffics to arenavirus budding sites, and is incorporated into arenavirus particles. ERGIC-53 is required for arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus propagation; in its absence, GP-containing virus particles form, but are noninfectious due, in part, to their inability to attach to host cells. Thus, we have identified a class of pathogen-derived ERGIC-53 ligands, a lectin-independent basis for their association with ERGIC-53, and a role for ERGIC-53 in the propagation of several highly pathogenic RNA virus families.","Klaus, Joseph; Eisenhauer, Philip; Russo, Joanne; Mason, Anne; Do, Danh; King, Benjamin; Taatjes, Douglas; Cornillez-Ty, Cromwell; Boyson, Jonathan E.; Thali, Markus; Zheng, Chunlei; Liao, Lujian; Yates, John R.; Zhang, Bin; Ballif, Bryan A.; Botten, Jason",Cell Host & Microbe,http://www.cell.com/article/S1931312813003727/pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1931312813003727; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2013.10.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312813003727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24237698/,370
657122,Accelerating Clinical Evaluation of Repurposed Combination Therapies for COVID-19,2020-08-21,"Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs, has been particularly tailored for treatment of coronavirus infections. However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH(3) cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH(3) cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of I (K(DR)) elicitation with effective IC(50) values of 10.1 or 2.8 μM, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of I (K(DR)) on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 μM. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of I (K(DR)) was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of I (K(DR)) failed to be overcome by further addition of either α,β-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K(+) current with the IC(50) value of 2.5 μM. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of I (K(M)) elicited by long-lasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporation-induced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC(50) value of 5.8 μM. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined I (K(DR)) amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both I (K(DR)) and I (K(M)) occurring in a non-genomic fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which in vivo cellular functions are seriously perturbed.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Liu, Ping-Yen; Gao, Zi-Han; Lee, Shih-Wei; Lee, Wen-Kai; Wu, Sheng-Nan",Front Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792942/,370

657810,An Underused Treatment Strategy: Voter Enfranchisement,2020-10-19,"Introduction The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had immense impact on people and institutions, including the number of admissions to hospitals for surgery. Our aim in this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on surgeries in a single institution located in Fukuoka, Japan, between 2019 and 2020. Methods We quantified the numbers of surgeries in both years according to three sites of injury (indoor, outdoor, and unknown), 14 disease categories, and 9 primary diseases using patients’ medical records. We also compared the hospital cost per day in each month from March to November in both 2019 and 2020 and compared the change in these costs between the two years. Results The number of admissions in 2020 was 1,187 cases vs 1,282 cases in 2019. The average patients’ age was higher in 2020 vs 2019 (69.7 ± 0.5 vs 67.5 ± 0.5 years, respectively; p = 0.004), with no gender differences (2020: 705 women and 482 men; 2019: 716 women and 566 men). We found no significant differences in the number of admissions by month between 2019 and 2020. The percentages of outdoor injuries were significantly lower in 2020 vs 2019 (29.8% vs 37.9%, respectively; p = 0.004), and we found significantly different rates when comparing 2020 and 2019 for degenerative disease (42.6% vs 37.4%; p = 0.007), trauma related to falls (34.4% vs 30.2%; p = 0.02), chronic disease (1.9% vs 3.7%; p = 0.005), and sports injuries (0.8% vs 3.7%; p < 0.0001). The rate of sports-related injury was significantly lower in 2020 (1.6%) than in 2019 (7.7%) (p < 0.0001). The daily hospital charge was $10,517.09 (US dollars) in 2020 vs $11,225.32 in 2019, and the charges in the months of April and June were significantly higher in 2020 vs 2019 (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, for April and June, respectively). Both the number and rate of upper limb fractures were higher in 2020. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting some hospitals’ revenue. Although the charges per day were sufficient in our institution in 2020, compared with 2019, some hospital beds were unused during this phase of the pandemic. Hospitals may increase the revenue by mixing both short-term and long-term patients’ hospital stays effectively.","Bekki, Hirofumi; Arizono, Takeshi; Tagata, Ryuji; Inokuchi, Akihiko; Hamada, Takahiro; Imamura, Ryuta",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33987059/,370

OBJECTIVES: To assess clinical profiles of pediatric COVID-19. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis was undertaken using clinical data of sixteen children (11 months-14 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and March 17, 2020 at Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei province, China. RESULTS: All children had positive epidemiologic histories, 12 (12/16, 75 %) involving family units. The illnesses were either mild (5/16, 31.3 %) or ordinary (11/16, 68.8 %), presenting as follows: asymptomatic (8/16, 50 %), fever and/or cough (8/16, 50 %). Four asymptomatic patients (4/16, 25 %) in ordinary cases had chest computed tomography (CT) abnormalities. Leukocyte counts were normal in 14 cases(88 %), but 2 patients (12.5 %) had leukopenia, and 1 (6.3 %) was lymphopenic. There were 11 patients with chest CT abnormalities, some nodular, others small patchy and others ground-glass opacities. In asymptomatic children, the median time to SRAS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test(NAT) positivity once exposed to a family member with confirmed infection was 15.5 days (range, 10–26 days). The median time to first NAT-negative conversion was 5.5 days (range, 1–23 days). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 in children of Xiangyang city is often family acquired and not serious, with favorable outcomes. Asymptomatic children can be diagnosed as pneumonia because of chest CT abnormalities. It is essential to actively screen this segment of the population.","Song, Wenliang; Li, Junhua; Zou, Ning; Guan, Wenhe; Pan, Jiali; Xu, Wei",J Clin Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361323/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301190; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104377; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301190,370

Overexpression of cholinesterases has been emphatically connected to ‘Alzheimer’s disease because of the unreasonable hydrolysis of acetylcholine and butyrylcholine. Certain plant phytochemicals, for example, beta-carotenoids, lutein, neoxanthin, and viola-xanthine from Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Var. esculentum (ESC) and Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. Var. cerasiforme (CER) has been utilized altogether as a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ‘Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, this research sought to investigate the drug-likeness of the individual carotenoids as detailed for cholinesterase inhibition in the treatment of ‘Alzheimer’s disease. Four potential cholinesterase inhibitors from ESC and CER were retrieved from the PubChem database. Investigation of their drug-likeness, toxicity prediction, molecular docking, and dynamic simulations were carried out using Molinspiration, PreADMET V.2.0, Patchdock server, and Schrodinger Maestro software respectively. Neoxanthin was ranked the safest with a greater tendency to inhibit the cholinesterases with high binding affinity. In addition, its stability after simulation in a mimicked biological environment suggests its relevance as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of ‘Alzheimer’s disease through the inhibition of cholinesterases.","Bakare, Olalekan Olanrewaju; Fadaka, Adewale Oluwaseun; Akanbi, Musa Oyebowale; Akinyede, Kolajo Adedamola; Klein, Ashwil; Keyster, Marshall",BMC Mol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592924/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12860-021-00386-2,370

In Mexico, families who depend upon informal employment face increased threats to their wellbeing, and households who in addition have young children may face long-term consequences. The Mexican government has not yet taken actions, but a coalition of non-governmental organizations is advocating in partnership with academic institutions for social protection actions such as a cash transfer and basic services subsidies for families with young children, subsisting from the informal sector economy. To facilitate governmental action, we estimated the costs for implementation of these recommendations.

Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (five of them non-synonymous) characterized the SARS-CoV-2 sequences, none of them affecting N-glycosylation sites. These two lineages, and the presence of two well defined clusters inside Lineage 1, revealed that a sustained community transmission was ongoing way before the first COVID-19 case found in Lombardy.","Alteri, C.; Cento, V.; Piralla, A.; Costabile, V.; Tallarita, M.; Colagrossi, L.; Renica, S.; Giardina, F.; Novazzi, F.; Gaiarsa, S.; Matarazzo, E.; Antonello, M.; Vismara, C.; Fumagalli, R.; Epis, O.

Next, we built a clinical model(CM), three radiomics models (adrenal gland model[AM], periadrenal fat model[PM] and fusion of adrenal gland and periadrenal fat model[FM])and radiomics nomogram(RN)after radiomics features extracted to predict disease progression in patients with COVID-19. Results: The auto-segmentation framework yielded a dice value of 0.79 in the training set. CM, AM, PM, FM and RN obtained AUCs of 0.712, 0.692, 0.763, 0.791 and 0.806, respectively in the training set. FM and RN had better predictive efficacy than CM (P < 0.0001) in the training set. RN showed that there was no significant difference in the validation set(mean absolute error [MAE] = 0.04) and test set (MAE = 0.075) between predictive and actual results. Decision curve analysis showed that if the threshold probability was more than 0.3 in the validation set or between 0.4 and 0.8 in the test set, it could gain more net benefits using RN than FM and CM.

COVID-19 pandemic and epidemic control measures including lockdowns impaired access to health care services. We examined the effect of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on mood status and management of Fabry disease patients. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study between October 2020 and December 2020. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate the mood statuses of FD patients and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4) to assess patient adherence. We also examined age and sex-matched control group to compare mood status. RESULTS: A total of 68 (Male 48.5 %, mean age 37.0) FD patients were under regular follow-up in our institution, 59 of those patients were taking ERT every other week. Two of our patients had reported having a COVID-19 infection, and both of them recovered. 25 patients reported to miss an ERT for a median of one dose, 16 of these 25 patients have reported that they did not come to the hospital because of infection fear. Half of the patients had adopted home-based infusion; they arranged a nurse for home-based infusion therapy by their own means. According to MMAS-4 FD patients had good adherence to their therapy (Median score 0, range 0-2). Mood status of FD patients and controls are shown in Table 1. Both HADS depression and anxiety scores were higher in the control group compared to FD patients. Additionally, abnormal scores were more prevalent for HADS depression scores in controls (Figure 1). CONCLUSION: We found that the mood status of FD patients was better than the control group. Traumatic growth may be an important factor to explain this finding. Their adherence to therapy was good. Home-based therapy was the preferred method by the patients. Government-supported home therapy programs might be beneficial for FD patients to increase adherence to the therapy.","Dincer, Mevlut Tamer; Karaca, Cebrail; Sarac, Betul; Ahmadzada, Saffa; Bakir, Alev; Alagoz, Selma; Kiykim, Ertugrul; Trabulus, Sinan; Seyahi, Nurhan",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab080.0027,370

In absence of official recommendations, implementing daily multidisciplinary team (MDT) COVID-19 meetings was urgently needed. Our aim was to describe our initial institutional standard operating procedures for implementing these meetings, and their impact on daily practice. Methods: All consecutive patients who were hospitalized in our institution due to COVID 19, from March 31 to April 15, 2020, were included. Criteria to be presented at MDT meetings were defined as a proven COVID-19 by PCR or strongly suspected on CT scan, requiring hospitalization and treatment not included in the standard of care. Three investigators identified the patients who met the predefined criteria and compared the treatment and outcomes of patients with predefined criteria that were presented during MDT meeting with those not presented during MDT meeting. COVID-19 MDT meeting implementation and adhesion were also assessed by a hospital medical staff survey. Results: 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were examined in our hospital. Of these, 230 (87%) were hospitalized in a COVID-19 unit, 91 (40%) of whom met predefined MDT meeting criteria. Fifty (55%) patients were presented at a MDT meeting versus 41 (45%) were not. Complementary exploration and inclusion in the CorImmuno cohort were higher in MDT meeting group (respectively 35 vs 15%, p=0.03 and 80 versus 49%, p = 0.0007). Prescription of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate was higher in group of patients not presented during MDT meeting (24 vs 51%, p= 0.007). Almost half of the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were not presented at MDT meeting, which can be partly explained by technical software issues. Conclusions: Multidisciplinary COVID-19 meetings helped implementing a single standard of care, avoided using treatments that were untested or currently being tested, and facilitated the inclusion of patients in prospective cohorts and therapeutic trials.","Rolland-Debord, Camille; Canellas, Anthony; Choinier, Pascaline; Milon, Audrey; Debrix, Isabelle; Blin, Emmanuelle; Belaube, Nicolas; Mattioni, Sarah; Millet, Floriane; Nadal, Martine; Petit-Hoang, Camille; Rigaud, Pierre; Rech, Jean Simon; Siguier, Martin; Sroussi, Deborah; Denis, Michel; Amiel, Corinne; Fartoukh, Muriel; Georgin-Lavialle, Sophie; Lassel, Ludovic; Parrot, Antoine; Cadranel, Jacques",Respir Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023794/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resmer.2021.100828; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590041221000179; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590041221000179?v=s5,370

There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control.

The regulation process of coronavirus pathogenesis through molecular mechanism comprise virus-host interactions linked to viral entry, replication and transcription, escape, and immune system control. Recognizing coronavirus infections and COVID-19 through epigenetics lens will lead to potential alteration in gene expression thus limiting coronavirus infections. Focusing on epigenetic therapies reaching clinical trials, clinically approved epigenetic-targeted agents, and combination therapy of antivirals and epigenetic drugs is currently considered an effective and valuable approach for viral replication and inflammatory overdrive control.","El Baba, Ranim; Herbein, Georges",Clin Epigenetics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32758273/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-020-00912-7,370

683036,Anatomy of a pandemic: Emergency departments woefully unprepared for bird flu outbreak,2006-08-23,"BACKGROUND: Epidemic chronic diseases pose significant challenges to the improvement of healthcare in China and worldwide. Despite increasing international calls for the inclusion of evidence-based decision-making (EBDM) processes in chronic disease prevention and control programming as well as policymaking, there is relatively little research that assesses the current capacity of physicians and the factors that influence that capacity in China. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was conducted in community health centres (CHCs) in Shanghai, China, using multistage cluster sampling. An evidence-based chronic disease prevention (EBCDP) evaluation tool was employed to assess physician EBCDP awareness, adoption, implementation and maintenance based on the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and using a 7-point Likert scale. Linear regression analysis was used to assess associations between each EBCDP aspect and overall EBCDP status with participant characteristics or organizational factors. RESULT: A total of 892 physicians from CHCs in Shanghai, China, were assessed. The physicians perceived their awareness (mean = 4.90, SD = 1.02) and maintenance (mean = 4.71, SD = 1.07) of EBCDP to be relatively low. Physicians with relatively lower job titles and monthly incomes (> 9000 RMB) tended to have relatively higher scores for the awareness, adoption, and implementation of EBCDP (P < 0.05). Those who had participated in one program for chronic disease prevention and control were less likely to adopt (b = − 0.284, P = 0.007), implement (b = − 0.292, P = 0.004), and maintain (b = − 0.225, P = 0.025) EBCDP than those who had participated in more programs. Physicians in general practice (Western medicine) had a lower level of awareness of EBCDP than those in other departments (P < 0.0001). Physician from CHCs located in suburban areas had lower scores for awareness (b = − 0.150, P = 0.047), implementation (b = − 0.171, P = 0.029), and maintenance (b = − 0.237, P = 0.002) that those from urban CHCs. Physicians in CHCs affiliated with universities had higher scores on all four EBCDP aspects that those in CHCs not affiliated with a university. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence illustrating EBCDP practices among physicians in CHCs with various personal and organizational characteristics, respectively. More methods should be provided to increase the awareness of such physicians regarding EBCDP to stimulate the use of EBCDP for their patients and in connection with other public health priorities.","Fan, Feng; Wang, Zhaoxin; Yu, Dehua; Chen, Chen; Shen, Delei; Yu, Zhaohu; Liu, Xin; Zhou, Huining; Shi, Jianwei",BMC Fam Pract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698768/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-020-01212-y,370

Therefore, rapid, simpler, and more accurate diagnostic tests are urgently needed to diagnose the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 IgM/ IgG rapid antibody test results in symptomatic patients with COVID-19 and their chest computed tomography (CT) data. Methods: A total of 320 patients admitted to our hospital for different durations due to COVID-19 were included in the study. Serum samples were obtained within 0 to 7 days from COVID-19 patients confirmed by RT-PCR and chest CT scan. According to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results, the patients included in the study were divided into two groups: PCR positive group (n=46), and PCR negative group (n=274). Results: Of the 320 COVID-19 serum samples, IgM, IgG, and IgM/IgG were detected in 9.4%, 3.1%, and 17.8% within one week respectively. IgG/IgM antibodies were not detected in 69.7% of the patients. In the study, it was determined that 249 (77.8%) of 320 patients had positive chest CT scans. Four (5.6%) of 100 patients with negative chest CT scan had IgM positive and 2 (2.8%) had both IgM/ IgG positive. IgM was detected in 23 (9.2%), IgG in 1 (0.4%) and IgM/IgG in 35 (14%) of chest CT scan positive patients. The rate of CT findings in patients with antibody positivity (n=97) was found to be significantly higher than those with antibody negativity. Conclusions: The results of the present study show the accurate and equivalent performance of serological antibody assays and chest CT in detecting SARS-CoV-2 0 to 7 days from the onset of COVID19 symptoms. When the RT-PCR is not available, we believe that the combination of immunochromatographic test and chest CT scan can increase diagnostic sensitivity for COVID-19.","Ozturk, A.; Bozok, T.; Simsek Bozok, T.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251772; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.15.21251772v1?rss=1,370

687447,Rabies Vaccine Disposition: Trends in Vaccination Among Israeli Travelers.,2021-08-16,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in China has become an urgent health and economic challenge. The objective of the current work was to evaluate the efficacy of the combined complex of Sitagliptin (SIT) with melittin (MEL) against SARS-CoV-2 virus. SIT-MEL nano-conjugates were optimized by a full three-factor bi-level (2(3)) factorial design. In addition, SIT concentration (mM, X1), MEL concentration (mM, X2), and pH (X3) were selected as the critical factors. Particle size (nm, Y1) and zeta potential (mV, Y2) were assessed as responses. Characterization of the optimized formula for Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) was carried out. The optimized formula showed particle size and zeta potential values of 77.42 nm and 27.67 mV, respectively. When compared with SIT and MEL, the combination of SIT-MEL complex has shown anti-viral potential against isolate of SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 values of 8.439 μM with significant improvement (p < 0.001). In addition, the complex showed IC50 in vitro 3CL-protease inhibition with IC50 7.216 µM. Molecular docking has revealed that formula components have good predicted pocket accommodation of the SARS-CoV-2 3-CL protease. An optimized formulation of SIT-MEL could guarantee both enhanced delivery to the target cells and the enhanced cellular uptake with promising activities against SARS-CoV-2.","Al-Rabia, Mohammed W.; Alhakamy, Nabil A.; Ahmed, Osama A.

The models are intended for use in virtual clinical trials (VCT) for task-specific optimization of chest x-ray (CXR) imaging. Approach: Images of COVID-19 patients confirmed by computed tomography were used to segment areas of increased attenuation in the lungs, all compatible with ground glass opacities and consolidations. Using a modeling methodology, the segmented pathologies were converted to polygonal meshes and adapted to fit the lungs of a previously developed polygonal mesh thorax phantom. The models were then voxelized with a resolution of [Formula: see text] and used as input in a simulation framework to generate radiographic images. Primary projections were generated via ray tracing while the Monte Carlo transport code was used for the scattered radiation. Realistic sharpness and noise characteristics were also simulated, followed by clinical image processing. Example images generated at 120 kVp were used for the validation of the models in a reader study. Additionally, images were uploaded to an Artificial Intelligence (AI) software for the detection of COVID-19. Results: Nine models of COVID-19 associated pathologies were created, covering a range of disease severity. The realism of the models was confirmed by experienced radiologists and by dedicated AI software. Conclusions: A methodology has been developed for the rapid generation of realistic 3D models of a large range of COVID-19 pathologies. The modeling framework can be used as the basis for VCTs for testing detection and triaging of COVID-19 suspected cases.","Rodríguez Pérez, Sunay; Coolen, Johan; Marshall, Nicholas W.; Cockmartin, Lesley; Biebaû, Charlotte; Desmet, Jeroen; De Wever, Walter; Struelens, Lara; Bosmans, Hilde",J Med Imaging (Bellingham),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447646/; https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jmi.8.s1.013501,370
689295,Biosafety at Home: How to Translate Biomedical Laboratory Safety Precautions for Everyday Use in the Context of COVID-19,2020-06-26,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of action of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium-Pinelliae Rhizoma (CRP-PR) in treating gastric cancer (GC) by using pharmacology network. METHODS: Based on oral bioavailability and drug-likeness, the main active components of CRP-PR were screened using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). DisGeNET Database was used to establish target databases for GC. Cytoscape software was used to construct a visual interactive network diagram of “Active Component-Target” and screen out the key targets. The STRING database was used to construct a protein interaction network. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed on the key targets. Additionally, TCGA and HPA databases were used for key target verification. RESULTS: Thirty-seven active components of CRP-PR were screened. The results of network analysis showed that the main components include 8-octadecenoic acid, stigmasterol, ferulic acid, and naringenin of the CRP-PR herb pair. The key targets of the PPI network mainly involved GAPDH, MAPK3, JUN, STAT3, GSK3B, SIRT1, ERBB2, and SMAD2. GO enrichment analysis involves 540 biological processes, 118 cellular components, and 171 molecular functions. CRP-PR components were predicted to exert their therapeutic effect on the tumor signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and estrogen signaling pathway. The validation of the key genes in the TCGA and HPA database showed that most of the key target verification results were consistent with this article. CONCLUSION: CRP-PR can treat GC by mediating PI3K-Akt signal pathway, MAPK signal pathway, and other biological processes such as tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, and vascular regeneration, which embodies the synergistic effect of multi-components, multi-targets, and multi-channels, and provides the theoretical basis and research ideas for further study of CRP-PR in treating GC. 8-octadecenoic acid, stigmasterol, ferulic acid, and naringenin may be the material basis for the treatment of GC.","Song, Siyuan; Huang, Wenjie; Lu, Xiaona; Liu, Jiatong; Zhou, Jiayu; Li, Ye; Shu, Peng",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953786/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6667560,370
690132,Emerging Trends in Clinical Tropical Medicine Research,2019-05-13,"The design for vaccines using in silico analysis of genomic data of different viruses has taken many different paths, but lack of any precise computational approach has constrained them to alignment methods and some alignment-free techniques. In this work, a precise computational approach has been established wherein two new mathematical parameters have been suggested to identify the highly conserved and surface-exposed regions which are spread over a large region of the surface protein of the virus so that one can determine possible peptide vaccine candidates from those regions. The first parameter, w, is the sum of the normalized values of the measure of surface accessibility and the normalized measure of conservativeness, and the second parameter is the area of a triangle formed by a mathematical model named 2D Polygon Representation. This method has been, therefore, used to determine possible vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2 by considering its surface-situated spike glycoprotein. The results of this model have been verified by a parallel analysis using the older approach of manually estimating the graphs describing the variation of conservativeness and surface-exposure across the protein sequence. Furthermore, the working of the method has been tested by applying it to find out peptide vaccine candidates for Zika and Hendra viruses respectively. A satisfactory consistency of the model results with pre-established results for both the test cases shows that this in silico alignment-free analysis proposed by the model is suitable not only to determine vaccine targets against SARS-CoV-2 but also ready to extend against other viruses.","Biswas, Subhamoy; Manna, Smarajit; Nandy, Ashesh; Basak, Subhash C.",Int J Pept Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10989-021-10251-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34276265/,370
