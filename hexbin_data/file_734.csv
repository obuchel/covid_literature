Dissemination into the peritoneum and throughout the abdomen can be due to a primary peritoneal cancer or other primary malignancies that have metastasized, including (but not limited to) colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, appendiceal cancer, ovarian cancer, and mesothelioma. Patients with gastrointestinal (GI) or gynecologic malignancies with peritoneal carcinomatosis may have dismal survival due to a high disease burden within the abdominal cavity. Some studies suggest the average survival for patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin is 18–48 months, for high-grade appendiceal adenocarcinoma 12–36 months, and for low-grade appendiceal neoplasms >60 months. As the understanding of peritoneal malignancies and peritoneal carcinomatosis evolved, it may now be acceptable to treat this as locoregional disease.","Berri, Richard N.; Ford, Jennifer M.",Textbook of Gastrointestinal Oncology,734,1

Separated and specific actions were directed at accident prevention, and the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of occupational diseases. As industrialization has advanced, the complexity of safety and health problems and challenges has substantially grown, calling for more comprehensive approaches. Such development has expanded the scope, as well as blurred the borders between specific activities. In the modern world of work, occupational safety and health are part of a complex system that involves innumerable interdependencies and interactions. These are, for instance, safety, health, well-being, aspects of the occupational and general environment, corporate policies and social responsibility, community policies and services, community social environment, workers’ families, their civil life, lifestyles and social networks, cultural and religious environments, and political and media environments.","Radandt, Siegfried; Rantanen, Jorma; Renn, Ortwin",Risks in Modern Society,734,1

How to better recover the original RNA transcripts from those fragments (RNA-Seq assembly) is still a difficult task. For example, RNA-Seq assembly tools typically require hyper-parameter tuning to achieve good performance for particular datasets. This kind of tuning is usually unintuitive and time-consuming. Consequently, users often resort to default parameters, which do not guarantee consistent good performance for various datasets. Results: Here we propose BOAssembler, a framework that enables end-to-end automatic tuning of RNA-Seq assemblers, based on Bayesian Optimization principles. Experiments show this data-driven approach is effective to improve the overall assembly performance. The approach would be helpful for downstream (e.g. gene, protein, cell) analysis, and more broadly, for future bioinformatics benchmark studies.

Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists with a transparent approach enable their analysands/patients to participate in the course of the analytic work. Transparency and participation jointly facilitate the shared reflection on internal and interactive processes. These processes may take the form of introjective identification. Transparency and participation create an atmosphere in which the dyad has a better grasp of unconscious aspects in the introjective identification. After clarification of the terms transparency and participation and the theoretical background, a case report is presented showcasing crucial interactions in which the mechanism of introjective identification and the internal dramaturgy of both participants is demonstrated. The case report is connected to the theoretical part in the concluding remarks. In the analytic situation the process of introjective identification bridges the gap between the analysand’s and the analyst’s unconscious themes: as a result the psychoanalyst can discover unconscious affects reaching the inner world originally stemming from the unconscious of the analysand/patient. A fertile interplay emerges within the analyst, which can be communicated to the analysand and is then present in the dyadic analytic experience. Transparency and participation are valuable technical means to discover and understand the unconscious part of introjective identification in all its ramifications.","Dreyer, Karl-Albrecht",Forum Psychoanal,734,1

We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV). A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici‐, parvo‐ and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host fitness suggest that these viruses do not affect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health effects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity.","Packer, C.; Altizer, S.; Appel, M.; Brown, E.; Martenson, J.; O'Brien, S.

For these queries only data that strictly respect all user’s conditions is returned. XML documents are generally semi-structured. Due to the non-existence or lack of knowledge of the model of the document being queried, when exact queries are used, there is a high risk of obtaining an empty result (in the case of too specific queries) or too large (in the case of too vague queries). In contrast to exact queries, requests with preferences aim to return only the most relevant results in order to avoid empty or too important results as much as possible. To achieve this goal, requests with preferences generally consist of two parts: the first part is used to express strict constraints and the second part to express preferences or wishes. The satisfaction of both parts increases the relevance of the corresponding results. This paper presents XQuery preference, an extension of the XQuery language, that allows to express requests with preferences relating to both the values and the structure of an XML document. A representation model of such requests based on the Generalized Tree Pattern (GTP) model is also proposed in order to allow an evaluation of these requests through a tree pattern matching process. Integration of the proposed language in open source implementations of XQuery like BaseX, Berkeley DB XML, eXist-db, Galax and much more, will allow users to get much more relevant responses to their concerns.","Tchoupé Tchendji, Maurice; Kenfack, Patrik Joslin",Open Source Systems,734,1

The developed classifier is effective, as it shows a prediction accuracy of 75.6% for the medical action classification task and of more than 90% for three related classification tasks.

Mainstream process mining tools are designed for intra-organizational settings, insofar as they assume that an event log is available for processing as a whole. The use of such tools for inter-organizational process analysis is hampered by the fact that such processes involve independent parties who are unwilling to, or sometimes legally prevented from, sharing detailed event logs with each other. In this setting, this paper proposes an approach for constructing and querying a common artifact used for process mining, namely the frequency and time-annotated Directly-Follows Graph (DFG), over multiple event logs belonging to different parties, in such a way that the parties do not share the event logs with each other. The proposal leverages an existing platform for secure multi-party computation, namely Sharemind. Since a direct implementation of DFG construction in Sharemind suffers from scalability issues, we propose to rely on vectorization of event logs and to employ a divide-and-conquer scheme for parallel processing of sub-logs. The paper reports on experiments that evaluate the scalability of the approach on real-life logs.","Elkoumy, Gamal; Fahrenkrog-Petersen, Stephan A.; Dumas, Marlon; Laud, Peeter; Pankova, Alisa; Weidlich, Matthias","Enterprise, Business-Process and Information Systems Modeling",734,1

We focus on graphs whose edge numbers do not exceed the vertex numbers too much, that is, graphs with few cycles. Intuitively, dense subgraphs should be placed early in the ordering, in order to finish many edges soon. However, our main “calculation trick” is to compare the objective function with the case when (almost) every vertex is the right end of exactly one edge. The deviations from this case are described by “charges” that can form “dipoles”. This reformulation enables us to derive polynomial algorithms and NP-completeness results for relevant special cases, and FPT results.","Damaschke, Peter",Combinatorial Algorithms,734,1

The methodology that organizations who provide home health and personal home care services are using to respond to this pandemic has not yet been characterized. In this report, we describe our approach to comprehensive outbreak suppression and report an initial case series of COVID-19 positive patients receiving home-based services. We implemented enhanced infection control procedures across our affiliates, and we communicated these protocols to our offices using multi-faceted methods. Using custom built software applications enabling us to track patient and employee cases and exposures, we leveraged current public health recommendations to identify cases and to suppress transmission. In the 100-day period between January 20, 2020 and April 30, 2020, our affiliates provided services to 67 COVID-19 positive patients (<0.3% of census). Twenty patients were referred to home health post hospitalization for COVID-19 related illness, whereas 47 were found to have COVID-19 while living in community settings. Of those who were found to have COVID-19 in the community, 17 (39%) required subsequent hospitalization. Hospitalized patients had an average age of 74.5 ± 18, and 53% were male. There were 13 deaths (76%) among those hospitalized from the community with COVID-19 related illness. A highly coordinated and frequently communicated approach to infection control, case identification and employee screening can be performed by home health and personal home care organizations. Studies that further assess risks and predictors of illness severity in home-based COVID-19 patients are needed.","Mills, William R.; Sender, Susan; Reynolds, Karen; Lichtefeld, Joseph; Romano, Nicholas; Price, Melissa; Phipps, Jennifer; White, Leigh; Howard, Shauen; Domico, Rexanne",Home Health Care Manag Pract,734,1

The respiratory system is a portal of entry for micro-organisms. Viruses are responsible for the majority of upper respiratory tract infections, while bacteria are responsible for the majority of the lower respiratory tract infections. The urinary tract is a sterile system. Infection of the urinary tract can be exogenous or endogenous. Urinary tract infection is expressed as bladder infection — frequency, urgency, and burning. The cardio-vascular system represents one of the normally sterile anatomical areas. Invasion of the blood stream by bacteria may occur from breaches in the skin or mucous membranes. Infection of any organ system may be associated with a bacteraemia, for example, pneumococcal pneumonia can often be diagnosed by the presence of lung pathology and a positive blood culture. Certain diseases are typically characterized by the blood spread of organisms during particular phases of the illness, such as, typhoid, and measles.","Jamison, Jennifer R.",Man Meets Microbes,734,1

Comprehensive health care must be provided in all of these areas to be effective. An unwanted infectious agent that does not cause clinically evident signs could still have a major adverse impact on research results if allowed to disseminate. As a result, the program for providing health care must include detection and care of individual mice that are ill, routine colony surveillance to guard against the undetected entry and spread of previously excluded infectious agents, and a response plan if such agents are detected. Such programs result in humane care of animals and the best protection of experimental repeatability and validity. As infectious agents, detection and treatment methods, and the research environment evolve, the veterinary and husbandry staff caring for research animals must strive to keep themselves educated and informed. Animal health and QA programs are not static but are always a work in progress and must also evolve in response to the challenges and needs of the research community.","J.

It also discusses other health hazards that may be encountered when working with mice, such as bites and allergies. Selected transmission of human infectious agents to mice is also briefly described in the chapter. Of the many latent viruses present in the mouse, only the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM) naturally infects man. A review of the literature attests to the ease with which the LCM can be transmitted from animals to man. Although its expression can vary greatly, the LCM virus infection appears most frequently as a mild influenza-like syndrome, with or without apparent involvement of the central nervous system. In one epidemic of the non-meningitic LCM virus infection caused by exposure to infected hamsters, an influenza-like illness was described with typical symptoms of retro-orbital headache, severe myalgia, malaise, anorexia, and aching pain in the chest. A variety of rodent hosts are included in the transmission cycle of the rickettsial disease in nature. The house mouse is the natural host of Rickettsia akari, which is the causative agent of rickettsialpox and a member of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae. Another rickettsial disease—murine typhus or endemic typhus—is transmitted to man by rat fleas; rats and mice are its natural reservoirs. Rickettsia mooseri—the causative agent—has not been isolated from natural infections in laboratory mice. Clinical signs, diagnosis, and control in man are similar to those described for rickettsialpox.","Fox, James G.; Brayton, James B.",Diseases,734,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected from medical records, and a detailed oral physical examination was performed on 663 critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Data were statistically analysed using univariate and logistic regression models relating the development of VAP with the oral findings. RESULTS: At oral physical examination, the most frequent findings were tooth loss (568–85.67%), coated tongue (422–63.65%) and oral bleeding (192–28.96%). Patients with a coated tongue or oral bleeding on the first day of ICU hospitalization developed more VAP than did patients without these conditions (20.14 vs 13.69%, p = 0.02; 23.44 vs 15.50%, p = 0.01, respectively). In the logistic regression, a coated tongue and oral bleeding were considered independent risk factors for VAP development (OR = 1.61 (1.03–2.51) and OR = 1.69 (1.08–2.66), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a coated tongue and oral bleeding in ICU admission could be considered markers for the development of VAP. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results of this paper reinforce the importance of proper maintenance of oral hygiene before intubation, which may lead to a decrease in the incidence of VAP in the ICU.","Takahama Jr, Ademar; de Sousa, Vitoria Iaros; Tanaka, Elisa Emi; Ono, Evelise; Ito, Fernanda Akemi Nakanishi; Costa, Priscila Paganini; Pedriali, Maria Beatriz Bergonse Pereira; de Lima, Heliton Gustavo; Fornazieri, Marco Aurélio; Correia, Leticia Sassaki; Cardoso, Lucienne Tibery Queiroz; de Maio Carrilho, Claudia Maria Dantas",Clin Oral Investig,734,1

The computational model is shown to be complete in the sense that not only does an involutory Turing machine always compute an involution but also every involutory computable function can be computed by an involutory Turing machine. As any involution is injective (hence reversible), any involutory Turing machine forms a standard reversible Turing machine that is backward deterministic. Furthermore, the existence of a universal involutory Turing machine is shown under an appropriate redefinition of universality given by Axelsen and Glück for reversible Turing machines.

We posit that the unique relational nature of entrepreneurial finance may make it highly susceptible to such a shock owing to the need for face-to-face interaction between investors and entrepreneurs. The article explores this conjecture by scrutinising a real-time data source of equity investments. Our findings suggest that the volume of new equity transactions in the United Kingdom has declined markedly since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. It appears that seed finance is the main type of entrepreneurial finance most acutely affected by the crisis, which typically goes to the most nascent entrepreneurial start-ups facing the greatest obstacles obtaining finance.

The EU has experienced a number of crises in the early 2000s, the breakaway of one of its members in 2019, and is challenged by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The latter crisis exhibits, on the one hand, the need for social coherence and unified policies, and on the other, has prompted the physical closure of borders, and divergent responses by domestic political elite. One such reaction—the adopted strengthening of power for Hungary’s Prime Minister—has prompted an international outcry and re-heated the debate of the democratic backtracking of some of the new EU member-states. Analyzing the process of European Enlargement and the changing sentiments about European Integration in a number of East European countries, this symposium brings to the fore important questions about the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe. Although there is a general consensus that both the East and the West have benefited and continue to benefit from their reunion, it is nevertheless the case that the quick assimilation of liberal values has led to policies seen as threatening the liberal democracy model of the EU that we need to address in order to preserve the stability of the Union.

In such scenarios, considering the differing importance of applications while scheduling tasks is done by assigning priorities to the tasks. However, priorities may lead to starvation in highly utilized systems. A solution is offered by aging mechanisms that raise the priority of long waiting tasks. As modern systems are often dynamic in nature, we developed a two-level aging mechanism and analyzed its effect in the context of 6 dynamic scheduling algorithms for heterogeneous systems. In the context of task scheduling, aging refers to a method that increases the priority of a task over its lifetime. We used a task-based runtime system to evaluate the mechanism on a real system in two scenarios. The results show a speed up of the average total makespan in 9 out of 12 conducted experiments when aging is used with the cost of additional waiting time for the applications/jobs with higher priority. However, the job/application with the highest priority is still finished first in all cases. Considering the scheduling algorithms, Minimum Completion Time, Sufferage, and Relative Cost benefit in both experiments by the aging mechanism. Additionally, no algorithm significantly dominates all other algorithms when total makespans are compared.","Becker, Thomas; Schüle, Tobias",Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2020,734,1

Our approach tackles two challenges of traditional HTMs: (1) potentially high abort rates, (2) missing support for unbounded transactions. By enhancing a simulator with a transactional memory and our TMU, we demonstrate that our TMU achieves speedups of up to 4.2 and reduces abort rates by a factor of up to 11.6 for some of the STAMP benchmarks.","Piatka, Christian; Amslinger, Rico; Haas, Florian; Weis, Sebastian; Altmeyer, Sebastian; Ungerer, Theo",Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2020,734,1

By formulating an Integer Linear Program (ILP), task mapping and scheduling is determined concurrently while considering power-off dependencies among cores in the same PD and the power-gating break-even time. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches aiming at design phases where task mapping and scheduling has been frozen, our proposed approach shifts joint exploration into earlier design phases, creates more power-gating opportunities for PD partitions, and thus identifies better trade-offs in terms of energy consumption and design costs.","Wang, Bo; Imtiaz, Aneek; Falk, Joachim; Glaß, Michael; Teich, Jürgen",Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2020,734,1

These are highly efficient for certain workloads but difficult to handle from the software engineering perspective. Even state-of-the-art database management systems do not exploit all heterogeneous hardware components, as their characteristics differ significantly. They are thus hard to integrate within a coherent database architecture. To address this problem, we propose a design concept that is based on a layered system software architecture: He..ro DB transforms a data-flow graph that describes the data-processing application to a task-based execution plan. Task implementations for the different computing resources and a reasonable degree of parallelism are chosen automatically based on available resources. The concept can cover any hardware configuration and application scenario. It is versatile and offers opportunities for independent optimization on each layer.","Müller, Michael; Leich, Thomas; Pionteck, Thilo; Saake, Gunter; Teubner, Jens; Spinczyk, Olaf",Architecture of Computing Systems - ARCS 2020,734,1

PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the epidemiology, incidence, patterns, management, and outcomes of TPF in multinational level 1 trauma centers. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients with TPF between 2010 and 2016 at two trauma centers in Qatar and Germany. RESULTS: A total of 2112 patients presented with traumatic pelvic injuries, of which 1814 (85.9%) sustained TPF, males dominated (76.5%) with a mean age of 41 ± 21 years. In unstable pelvic fracture, the frequent mechanism of injury was motor vehicle crash (41%) followed by falls (35%) and pedestrian hit by vehicle (24%). Apart from both extremities, the chest (37.3%) was the most commonly associated injured region. The mean injury severity score (ISS) of 16.5 ± 13.3. Hemodynamic instability was observed in 44%. Blood transfusion was needed in one third while massive transfusion and intensive care admission were required in a tenth and a quarter of cases, respectively. Tile classification was possible in 1228 patients (type A in 60%, B in 30%, and C in 10%). Patients with type C fractures had higher rates of associated injuries, higher ISS, greater pelvis abbreviated injury score (AIS), massive transfusion protocol activation, prolonged hospital stay, complications, and mortality (p value < 0.001). Two-thirds of patients were managed conservatively while a third needed surgical fixation. The median length of hospital and intensive care stays were 15 and 5 days, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 4.7% (86 patients). CONCLUSION: TPF is a common injury among polytrauma patients. It needs a careful, systematic management approach to address the associated complexities and the polytrauma nature.","Abdelrahman, Husham; El-Menyar, Ayman; Keil, Holger; Alhammoud, Abduljabbar; Ghouri, Syed Imran; Babikir, Elhadi; Asim, Mohammad; Muenzberg, Matthias; Al-Thani, Hassan",J Orthop Surg Res,734,1

A main preoperative feature is right ventricular failure, which represents a risk factor for postoperative low cardiac output syndrome. Levosimendan has a potentially beneficial effect. This retrospective study included consecutive GUCH patients with surgeries in a tertiary cardiothoracic centre between 01-01-2013 and 01-10-2017, to test the hypothesis that the postoperative use of levosimendan might be associated with shorter time of mechanical ventilation, when compared with the use of milrinone. To adjust for bias related to the probability of treatment assignment, it uses the inverse propensity score weighting methodology. RESULTS: Overall 363 patients had GUCH surgeries during the study period, their mean age was 31.39 ± 15.31 years, 87 patients were eligible for analysis in the Levosimendan group and 117 in the Milrinone group. The propensity score used pre- and intraoperative variables and resulted in a good balance between covariates. The Levosimendan group included patients with higher preoperative risk scores, a higher prevalence of left and right ventricular failure, who required more often the addition of epinephrine, renal replacement therapy, prolonged mechanical ventilation and intensive care stay. However, after propensity score weighting, patients in the Levosimendan group had shorter durations of mechanical ventilation (average treatment effect − 37.59 h IQR [− 138.85 to − 19.13], p = 0.01) and intensive care stay (average treatment effect − 3.11 days IQR [− 10.03 to − 1.48], p = 0.009). The number of days of additional epinephrine support was shorter and the vasoactive inotropic scores lower. CONCLUSION: We report a beneficial effect in terms of duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care stay, and on inotropic requirements of the use of levosimendan following GUCH surgeries. The use of levosimendan in this setting requires validation at a larger scale.","Mauriat, Philippe; Bojan, Mirela; Soulie, Sylvie; Foulgoc, Hélène; Tafer, Nadir; Ouattara, Alexandre",Ann Intensive Care,734,13

Recent years have seen a great progress of applying RL in addressing decision-making problems in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). However, since the goal of traditional RL algorithms is to maximize a long-term reward function, exploration in the learning process may have a fatal impact on the patient. As such, a short-term goal should also be considered to keep the patient stable during the treating process. METHODS: We use a Supervised-Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithm to address this problem by combining the long-term goal-oriented characteristics of RL with the short-term goal of supervised learning. We evaluate the differences between SAC and traditional Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in addressing the decision making problems of ventilation and sedative dosing in ICUs. RESULTS: Results show that SAC is much more efficient than the traditional AC algorithm in terms of convergence rate and data utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The SAC algorithm not only aims to cure patients in the long term, but also reduces the degree of deviation from the strategy applied by clinical doctors and thus improves the therapeutic effect.","Yu, Chao; Ren, Guoqi; Dong, Yinzhao",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,734,1

In swine, this viral evolution has resulted in the emergence of multiple H1 and H3 influenza A virus (IAV) lineages in the United States (US) pig populations. The heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy is a promising way to deal with diverse IAV infection in multiple animal models. However, whether or not this vaccination strategy is applicable to US swine to impart immunity against infection from North American strains of IAV is still unknown. We performed a vaccination-challenge study to evaluate the protective efficacy of using multivalent inactivated vaccine and/or a live attenuated IAV vaccine (LAIV) in pigs following multiple prime-boost vaccination protocols against a simultaneous H1N1 and H3N2 IAV infection. Our data show that pigs in the heterologous prime-boost vaccination group had more favorable outcomes consistent with a better response against virus challenge than non-vaccinated pigs. Additionally, delivering a multivalent heterologous inactivated vaccine boost to pigs following a single LAIV administration was also beneficial. We concluded the heterologous prime boost vaccination strategy may potentiate responses to suboptimal immunogens and holds the potential applicability to control IAV in the North American swine industry. However, more studies are needed to validate the application of this vaccination approach under field conditions.","Li, Chong; Culhane, Marie R.; Cheeran, Maxim; Galina Pantoja, Lucina; Jansen, Micah L.; Amodie, Deborah; Mellencamp, Martha A.; Torremorell, Montserrat",Vet Res,734,11

While executing the commands, the stack machines collect the information for the backward execution in the auxiliary stacks for the update history of the variables and the history of jumps. The commands for the backward execution is obtained by reversing the commands for the forward execution by replacing each command with the corresponding reversed command.

It then addresses the question of why it remains difficult to operationalize appropriate responses and the concepts of disinhibition (Latour and for Stiegler) and autoimmunity (Derrida) offer possible explanations. To counter these difficulties, the idea of a modest ethics and from within theology, the dynamic between proximity and distance and then panentheism are presented as solutions. Each links back to key ideas from New Materialism such as distributed agency and mini or local transcendences and the concept of God who is ‘beyond in the midst’.

The model is estimated using daily bitcoin price data from 2013 until 2020 whereby three types of agents are considered: mean–variance optimizers, speculators and fundamentalists, respectively. While mean–variance optimizers trade on the basis of conditional first and second moments of the return distribution, speculators engage in trend chasing and buy when prices are rising and sell when prices are declining. Fundamentalists trade on the basis of fundamental factors that can impact the value of bitcoin. The fractions of agents engaging in one strategy over another shows statistically substantial variation during high and low bitcoin price volatility regimes. Estimation results reveal the following. First, unlike in traditional asset classes, there is evidence of mean–variance optimizers. Second, there is evidence of speculators who engage in ‘bandwagon behavior’ and buy bitcoins during price appreciations and sell bitcoins during price declines. Finally, there is evidence of fundamentalists who trade bitcoins when fundamental factors deviate from their long-run trends. Remarkably, these fundamentalists exhibit contrarian-type behaviors during low price volatility regimes while behaving more like fundamental traders during high price volatility regimes.","Koutmos, Dimitrios; Payne, James E.",Rev Quant Finan Acc,734,1

We built upon this pilot study to further investigate this research question during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, 164 YA (18-30 years) and 171 OA (60-80 years) responded to an online survey about their preferences, feelings, and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic across 13-days during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States. Both YA and OA preferred to read positive over negative news about the coronavirus, but OA were even more likely than YA to prefer the positive news article. No age differences in the fear of contraction were found, but OA engaged in more health-protective behaviors compared to YA. Additionally, media engagement was related to fear for both age groups, with social media engagement, specifically, emerging as a key moderating factor for protective behavior change. Although OA may not fear or seek out negative information related to a health concern; they still engage in more protective health behaviors compared to YA. In this study, positivity effects are shown to exist within a health-related event, but OA appeared to still attend to enough negative information about COVID-19 to avoid impairing their health protective behaviors.","Villalba, Anthony; Stanley, Jennifer; Turner, Jennifer; Vale, Michael",Innov Aging,734,1

Although massively engaged initially, the Israeli trauma systems had continued functioning almost normally throughout the COVID-19 crisis.","Maqungo, Sithombo; Duma, Mlekeleli; Laubscher, Maritz; Davidson, Amit; Bala, Miklosh; Weil, Yoram A.",OTA Int,734,7

While different global regions experienced different levels of COVID-19 activity and had different resources with which to deal with the pandemic, there were many consistent approaches to injury care and musculoskeletal trauma management. Understanding these approaches is necessary to improve current and future strategies to taking care of orthopaedic trauma patients in an infectious disease outbreak. This supplement focuses on approaches to musculoskeletal trauma care during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 19 countries from 6 continents. This work represents a collaborative work of member societies of the International Orthopaedic Trauma Association (IOTA), an international association of orthopaedic societies dedicated to the promotion of musculoskeletal trauma care through advancements in patient care, research, and education.

We recently demonstrated that a distinct microtubule-targeting drug, plinabulin—a clinical-stage novel agent—modulates dendritic cell maturation and enhances anti-tumor immunity. Here, we investigated the effects of plinabulin on macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo. Plinabulin monotherapy induced significant tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing subcutaneous MC38 colon cancer. Importantly, the regressing tumors were characterized by an increase in M1-like/M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) ratio. The efficacy of plinabulin remained unaltered in T cell-deficient Rag2(−/−) mice, suggesting an important role of macrophages in driving the drug's anti-tumor effect. Exposure of murine and healthy human macrophages to plinabulin induced polarization toward the M1 phenotype, including increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80, CD86 and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12. M2-associated immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10 and IL-4 were reduced. This pro-inflammatory M1-like skewing of TAMs in response to plinabulin was dependent on the JNK pathway. Functionally, plinabulin-polarized human M1 macrophages directly killed HuT 78 tumor cells in vitro. Importantly, plinabulin induced a functional M1-like polarization of tumor infiltrating macrophages in murine tumors as well as in tumor samples from ovarian cancer patients, by preferentially triggering M1 proliferation. Our study uncovers a novel immunomodulatory effect of plinabulin in directly triggering M1 polarization and proliferation as well as promoting TAM anti-tumoral effector functions.","Natoli, Marina; Herzig, Petra; Pishali Bejestani, Elham; Buchi, Melanie; Ritschard, Reto; Lloyd, G.

The present review aimed to discuss the research progress of BBR-mediated photodynamic actions. The following key words were searched in several databases: ‘Berberine’ combined with ‘photodynamic therapy’, ‘sonodynamic therapy (SDT)’, ‘ultraviolet’, ‘reactive oxygen’ and ‘singlet oxygen’. The results demonstrated that both type I and type II reactions participated in the photodynamic progression of BBR derivatives. In addition, the photochemical characteristics of BBR derivatives were affected by the polarity, pH and O(2) content of solvents. DNA binding increases the lifespan of the photoexcited BBR state and generation of singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)). The chemical properties of substituents in different positions of the BBR skeleton are pivotal for its photochemical properties, particularly the methylenedioxy group at the C-2 and C-3 positions. BBR is a promising agent for mediating both PDT- and SDT-treated diseases, particularly in tumors. However, further studies are required to validate their biological effects. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of BBR-PDT remain unclear and warrant further investigation. The structural modification and targeted delivery of BBR have made it possible to broaden its applications; however, experimental verification is required. Overall, BBR acts as a sensitizer for PDT and has promising development prospects.","An, Ya-Wen; Jin, Hong-Tao; Yuan, Bo; Wang, Jian-Chun; Wang, Cheng; Liu, Han-Qing",Oncol Lett,734,1

The proposed SUGPDS is a quick and smart tool in supervising, managing, and controlling various faults and issues and maintaining the reliability, stability, and uninterrupted flow of electricity. First, the SUGPDS model is analyzed using a distributed parameter approach. Then, the proper arrangement of the system required for the implantation of SUGPDS is demonstrated using figures. The Phasor data concentrator plays an essential role in developing the detection and classification report for identification and classification. Finally, smart sensing and switching device installed at a different location isolated the faulty phase from a healthy network. This approach helps to decrease power consumption. Hence, SUGPDS has super abilities compared to the underground power distribution system.

A systematic exploration of the state space, both for visual features and for reactive interactions with the environment is made possible. We define a notion of test coverage for parameter configurations based on combinatorial testing and low dispersion sequences. Using fuzzing on parameter configurations, our automatic test generator can maximize coverage of various behaviors and find problematic cases.

Currently, they are passing through another crisis, which is of much larger dimension, in terms of its impact and uncertainty. It is therefore of interest to examine how they are responding to the crisis created by the pandemic of Covid-19. Cooperatives all over the world are responding and trying to do their best to protect their members and workers from the adverse impact of Covid-19. While the reporting on their activities seems to be not up to the desired level, based on the information from the reporting cooperatives, we can say that cooperatives are certainly responding keeping in mind the values and principles they are structured upon. In the Asia Pacific region, cooperatives are primarily trying to focus on relief measures and providing social and economic protection to their members and workers. They are partnering with state and/or responding to state mandates to an appreciative extent. Some cooperatives are exhibiting a much longer term and futuristic response trying to insulate their businesses from continued economic uncertainties and adjust their approach to business as well as meeting the needs of the members, to the ‘new normal’, that of living with the virus.

The pandemic has further challenged the existing domestic order in democracies and autocracies, and, more fundamentally, the circulation-based modus operandi of the present world order. This concluding chapter reviews the central findings on the Thucydidean regressive process while also pointing out how epidemic diseases can further accelerate the overall regressive slide based on Thucydides description of the Plague of Athens. For the Thucydidean model presented in this work, the confusion and unpredictability brought about by irrational decomposition of political spaces create a ripe environment for diseases to spread. At the same time, for Thucydides, regression was a contagious process transmitting from polity to polity in a manner similar to the spread of a disease from human to human.

All techniques used for changing a gene in a cell are based on cutting of double-stranded DNA through DNA endonucleases at specific site. DNA nucleases used for genome editing are composed of programmable DNA binding domains to bind with target sequence followed by DNA cleavage domain to break double-stranded DNA that excites error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR) at specific genome locations. Programmable nucleases enabled researchers to manipulate practically any genomic sequence, provided opportunities to create cell lines and animal models to study human diseases, and also promoting new possibilities of treating human diseases by gene therapy. Four genome editing technologies, meganucleases, zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) based on the above-mentioned principle have been developed so far and have been used successfully for the correction of disease-causing mutations, for addition of therapeutic gene and the deletion of specific genes from the specific sites in the genome. Genome editing revolutionized the scientific world and have intense impact on various fields of biotechnology, such as biopharmaceutical production, agriculture, creation of transgenic organisms and cell lines, regulation and function of the genome, etc. All four genome editing techniques, their history, principles, advantages, disadvantages, and applications, with a special focus on CRISPR/Cas, have been discussed in this chapter.","Munawar, Nayla; Ahmad, Aftab",CRISPR Crops,734,1

We do not have to explain the human economy in the context of only social rules or natural laws independently from each other. Not only can we use both social rules and physical laws to assess the constraints and possibilities for future energy and economic scenarios, we absolutely must. In assessing the current state of society and possible future trajectories, we can and should update our assessments and narratives to be consistent with observations. There are many ways to think about what the future might hold, and many ways to be wrong. This chapter summarizes a set of four different broad trajectories for the future, ranging from continuous growth and technological advancement to collapse. In this chapter the reader is asked to contemplate and continue a discussion whether we can understand why certain policies and forms of economic organization endure more than others. Can we control, or should we kill the economic superorganism that seems to pursue economic growth and increasing energy consumption? We are caught in a conundrum. On one hand the individualistic and profit-seeking structure of the economic superorganism is what drives innovation, creativity, and the ability to both create and solve energy and environmental problems. We seem to want this feature. On the other hand, the biophysical nature of the superorganism means that physical limits and natural laws constrain its space of solutions such that we might not be able to solve all social and environmental problems simultaneously. We might not want these physical constraints, but we have to deal with them. The chapter includes thinking of this conundrum via a few tradeoffs: between increasing labor productivity and meaningful employment; between economic growth (and increasing consumption) and competing approaches (e.g., carbon prices, federal plans, divestment from fossil fuels) to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. It is these tradeoff conversations that can best prepare us for the future such that we are not as surprised or confused as we otherwise might be.","King, Carey W.",The Economic Superorganism,734,13

Early diagnosis and treatment are substantial to stop or handle the increase and spread of cancer cells in the body. Histopathological image diagnosis is a gold standard for detecting prostate cancer as it has different visual characteristics but interpreting those type of images needs a high level of expertise and takes too much time. One of the ways to accelerate such an analysis is by employing artificial intelligence (AI) through the use of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. The recent developments in artificial intelligence along with its sub-fields of conventional machine learning and deep learning provide new insights to clinicians and researchers, and an abundance of research is presented specifically for histopathology images tailored for prostate cancer. However, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that focus on prostate cancer using histopathology images. In this paper, we provide a very comprehensive review of most, if not all, studies that handled the prostate cancer diagnosis using histopathological images.

India has a high prevalence of VDD. We hypothesized that VDD as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) <20 ng/mL is associated with severe COVID-19 infection. Outcomes were assessed by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI)(1), the need for oxygen therapy, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and inflammatory markers. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was proven by RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV2. Serum 25OHD and PTH were measured in addition to the standard protocol for COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS v22.0. Patients with OSCI score < 5 were classified as mild and ≥5 as severe disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. A total of 410 patients (127 females, 9 pediatric, 17 asymptomatic) were included with a median age of 54 years (6–92 years) with 272(66.3%) having at least one co-morbid condition, including diabetes (190, 46.3%) and hypertension (164,40%). Patients with VDD (197,48%) were significantly younger (46.7±17.1 vs. 57.8±14.7 years) and had lesser prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (39.1% vs 52.4%, 29.4% vs 49.5%). Proportion of severe cases (26,13.2% vs. 31,14.6%), mortality (4, 2% vs. 11, 5.2%), oxygen requirement (68,34.5% vs.92,43.4), ICU admission (29, 14.7% vs. 42, 19.8%), need for inotropes (7,3.6% vs.12,5.7%) was not significantly different between patients with VDD and those with normal 25OHD level. The proportion of severe cases was similar across all 25OHD categories. There was no significant correlation between 25OHD levels and outcome OSCI, inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH). PTH levels positively correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010) and LDH (r0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with cholecalciferol with a median dose of 60000 IU. The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, baseline levels of 25OHD did not determine the severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 or levels of inflammatory markers.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform welfare assessment of lactating dairy goats and identify the most prevalent welfare issues on 30 farms across the Midwestern US. Thirty dairy goat farms (self-selected) were enrolled in the study if they shipped milk for human consumption (regardless of herd size). The number of lactating does on each farm ranged from 34 to 6,500 goats, with a median number of 158 lactating does (mean ± SD: 602 ± 1,708 lactating does). The protocol used was developed from available literature on goat welfare assessment but modified for use in the Midwestern US. Observations were made without handling the animals and included 22 animal-based indicators evaluated at the group- and individual-level. The observations were conducted during ~3–5 h during a milking session (either morning or afternoon) and time in the home pen. Principal components analysis (PCA) was carried out on the welfare assessment data from each farm. The first two dimensions of the PCA explained 34.8% of the variation. The PCA biplot indicated correlations between indicators. The most prevalent conditions observed across the 30 farms included any knee calluses (80.9%), any claw overgrowth (51.4%), poor hygiene (14.9%), skin lesions (8.9%), poor hair coat condition (8.3%) and any ear pathology (8.0%).

Second‐year medical students (M2s) serve as teaching assistants (TAs) for this course and their responsibilities include leading comprehensive review sessions prior to each set of exams. Historically, such reviews have taken place in small‐group classrooms, with groups of 10‐18 M1s rotating through a series of rooms, each hosting a rapid‐fire review of a specific topic, conducted by several TAs. In 2020, the virtual setting imposed by COVID‐19 restrictions demanded creativity to rethink the format of these review sessions, leading to the implementation of a large‐group, interactive format, with all M1s in the same remote video session, covering material at a slower pace. We here examine the effectiveness of this large‐group, interactive format. Methods: The first two review sessions of Structures 2020 mimicked the traditional style, with groups of M1s rotating through a series of 20‐minute Zoom sessions led by M2s TAs. For the last two review sessions, all students remained in one 3‐hour Zoom session, and TAs covered certain material at certain times, with more or less time allotted depending on the difficulty and amount of material. TAs also incorporated more interactivity with real time quizzes on high‐yield topics and direct practical questions through the review. We surveyed M1s regarding which format they preferred and also solicited qualitative feedback from M1s and TAs throughout Structures. Results: 55% of M1s preferred the large‐group format, with 23% preferring the traditional format and 23% expressing no preference. Many TAs also expressed preferences for the large‐group format. Qualitative feedback from M1s indicated that they appreciated the interactivity with quizzes and practical questions. Conclusion: In the remote environment, most students preferred a large‐group, interactive format over the small‐group rotation format. Main advantages observed were: 1) time flexibility: complex components of the session addressing challenging topics were covered more extensively and in‐depth; 2) In the large group, all M1s experience the session equally, including the answers to all questions from their classmates. Such interactivity is not compatible with the small group format and can be challenging in its compressed timeframe. 3) optimization of M2 TAs workforce: in the large session TAs are assigned with a section of the review and lead the review of their only once, for a short period of time, while in the small group format, TAs are required to repeat the review of their topic multiple times. The effectiveness of this format may have implications once in‐person instruction resumes; for example, review sessions could be conducted in a lecture hall, in an in‐person setting, or virtually, in a hybrid learning system, to facilitate the advantages of the large‐group interactive format.","Feldman, Nicola; Saade, Mia; Marayati, Naoum; Italiano, Tyler; Curcio, Daniella",FASEB J,734,1

METHODS: Stress in the skin around a suture both with and without support from an ARSD was evaluated using a finite element model. A single‐center, randomized split‐scar comparison trial using laser speckle contrast analysis was used to quantify the perfusion at elliptical wound closures in human patients both with and without an ARSD. RESULTS: The finite element model revealed that the ARSD promoted load transfer to the skin over a larger area, thus reducing the local stress and deformation in the skin around the suture site. Results from the split‐scar study showed a mean improvement of 25% perfusion units with the ARSD, and the improvement was statistically significant (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The reduction in local stress and enhanced perfusion around the suture site reveals the potential benefit of using an ARSD to enable more efficient healing by avoiding complications associated with both low perfusion and skin tearing, such as dehiscence, infection, and cheese wiring.","Stoecker, Allison; Lear, William; Johnson, Karsten; Bahm, Jared; Kruzic, Jamie J.",Health Sci Rep,734,12

Although excellent weight loss can be achieved, one major obstacle of LSG is weight regain due to sleeve dilatation. Banded sleeve gastrectomy (BLSG) has been described as an option to counteract sleeve dilatation and ameliorate weight loss over time. In a retrospective study, we analysed 25 patients who underwent BLSG using a MiniMizer® ring. Twenty five patients who had previously undergone a conventional LSG were selected for matched-pair analysis. Patient follow-up was 12 months in both groups. Mean preoperative BMI was 56.1 ± 7.2 kg/m(2) for BLSG and 57.0 ± 6.3 kg/m(2) for LSG, P = 0.522. Operative time was significantly shorter for BLSG (53 ± 27 min vs. 68 ± 20 min, P = 0.0025). Excess weight loss (%EWL) was equal in both groups with %EWL at 12 months of 58.0 ± 14.6 % for BSLG patients vs. 58.4 ± 19.2 % for LSG patients. There was no procedure-related mortality in either group. At 12 months postoperative, vomiting was significantly increased in BSLG patients (OR 6.75, P = 0.035). New onset reflux was equal in both groups (OR 0.67, P = 0.469). Ring implantation does not increase the duration of surgery or early surgical complications. Weight loss in the first follow-up year is not influenced, but the incidence of vomiting is raised after 12 months when patients start to increase eating volume.","Karcz, W Konrad; Karcz-Socha, Iwona; Marjanovic, Goran; Kuesters, Simon; Goos, Matthias; Hopt, Ulrich T; Szewczyk, Tomasz; Baumann, Tobias; Grueneberger, Jodok Matthias",Obesity surgery,734,25

It is assumed that the effects of free sugars on risk factors are less potent because they contain less fructose. We compared the effects of consuming fructose, glucose or their combination, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), on cardiometabolic risk factors. METHODS Adults (18-40 years; BMI 18-35 kg/m2) participated in a parallel, double-blinded dietary intervention during which beverages sweetened with aspartame, glucose (25% of energy requirements (ereq)), fructose or HFCS (25% and 17.5% ereq) were consumed for two weeks. Groups were matched for sex, baseline BMI and plasma lipid/lipoprotein concentrations. 24-h serial blood samples were collected at baseline and after the intervention. Primary outcomes were 24-h triglyceride AUC, LDL-cholesterol (C), and apolipoprotein (apo)B. Interactions between fructose and glucose were assessed post hoc. FINDINGS 145 subjects (26.0 ± 5.8 years; body mass index 25.0 ± 3.7 kg/m2) completed the study. As expected, the increase of 24-h triglycerides compared with aspartame was highest during fructose consumption (25%: 6.66 mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [1.90 to 11.63], P = 0.0013 versus aspartame), intermediate during HFCS consumption (25%: 4.68 mmol/Lx24h 95% CI [-0.18 to 9.55], P = 0.066 versus aspartame) and lowest during glucose consumption. In contrast, the increase of LDL-C was highest during HFCS consumption (25%: 0.46 mmol/L 95% CI [0.16 to 0.77], P = 0.0002 versus aspartame) and intermediate during fructose consumption (25%: 0.33 mmol/L 95% CI [0.03 to 0.63], P = 0.023 versus aspartame), as was the increase of apoB (HFCS-25%: 0.108 g/L 95%CI [0.032 to 0.184], P = 0.001; fructose 25%: 0.072 g/L 95%CI [-0.004 to 0.148], P = 0.074 versus aspartame). The post hoc analyses showed significant interactive effects of fructose*glucose on LDL-C and apoB (both P < 0.01), but not on 24-h triglyceride (P = 0.340). CONCLUSION A significant interaction between fructose and glucose contributed to increases of lipoprotein risk factors when the two monosaccharides were co-ingested as HFCS. Thus, the effects of HFCS on lipoprotein risks factors are not solely mediated by the fructose content and it cannot be assumed that glucose is a benign component of HFCS. Our findings suggest that HFCS may be as harmful as isocaloric amounts of pure fructose and provide further support for the urgency to implement strategies to limit free sugar consumption.","Hieronimus, Bettina; Medici, Valentina; Bremer, Andrew A; Lee, Vivien; Nunez, Marinelle V; Sigala, Desiree M; Keim, Nancy L; Havel, Peter J; Stanhope, Kimber L",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,734,24

Experiential workers, commonly known as 'peers' (workers with past or present drug use experience) are at the forefront of overdose response initiatives and are essential in creating safe spaces for people who use drugs (PWUD) in harm reduction. Working in overdose response environments can be stressful, with lasting emotional and mental health effects. There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. METHODS This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (n = 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. RESULTS Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. CONCLUSION Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.","Pauly, Bernadette Bernie; Mamdani, Zahra; Mesley, Lacey; McKenzie, Sophie; Cameron, Fred; Edwards, Denice; Howell, Amy; Knott, Michael; Scott, Tracy; Seguin, Ryan; Greer, Alissa M; Buxton, Jane A",The International journal on drug policy,734,24

Thus, emergency cardiac catheterization is needed. However, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is recommended for hemodynamically stable acute coronary syndrome patients with COVID-19 infection to be treated conservatively in an isolated hospital ward. Case presentation We report an 85-year-old patient with chief complaints of typical, squeezing chest pain in the past 4 h. The patient had a high fever, dyspnea, sore throat, and fatigue for 3 days. He had previously come into contact with COVID-19 positive relatives. The patient was hemodynamically stable and pulmonary auscultation revealed coarse rales in the entire lung. Electrocardiography (ECG) evaluation during the pain episode showed non-specific ST-T changes in lead V2-V5. After sublingual nitrate was administered, ECG evaluation during the pain-free period revealed a biphasic T wave inversion in lead V2 and V3. Laboratory workup showed elevated cardiac marker and leucopenia with neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Rapid immunochromatographic test and initial severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) evaluation from nasopharyngeal swab showed negative results. However, radiographic evaluations suggest the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. While waiting for the second RT-PCR evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with Wellens' syndrome with suspected COVID-19 infection. The patient was treated conservatively according to national guidelines and scheduled for elective cardiac catheterization. On the third day, the patient felt better and insisted on being discharged home. Ten days after discharged, the patient died of myocardial infarction.

The aim of this study is to explore the effects of crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal on the K+ channels encoded by hERG. The interaction of these components with the rapid delayed rectification of K+ currents (IKr) were studied using the perforated patch recording technique. Crocin and picrocrocin had no significant effects on IKr, but crocetin and safranal inhibited hERG K+ currents in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 36.35 μM and 37.86 μM, respectively. The maximum inhibitory effects were 37.74 ± 4.14% and 33.74 ± 4.81%, respectively, and the effects were reversible upon washout. The results demonstrate that crocetin and safranal significantly inhibit hERG K+ current, but crocin and picrocrocin do not. This suggests that crocetin and safranal may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias by inhibiting IKr.","Jin, Weiyue; Xue, Yurun; Xue, Yucong; Liang, Yingran; Zhang, Yixin; Zhang, Jianping; Chu, Xi; Wang, Hongfang; Guan, Shengjiang",General physiology and biophysics,734,19

A new incidence peak was reached in Germany in 2012, with more than 2800 reported cases. These viruses are transmitted from small mammals to human beings. The disease begins with high fever and non-pathognomonic manifestations that can end in shock and organ failure. METHODS This article is based on a selective literature search, on the authors' experiences at the National Referral Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections (Nationales Konsiliarlaboratorium für Hantaviren), and on published recommendations from Germany and abroad. RESULTS Two hantavirus species cause clinically relevant infections in Germany. Puumala virus, which is transmitted by bank voles, causes large outbreaks of disease every 2 to 3 years in the southwestern and western regions of Germany and in the Bavarian Forest. Dobrava-Belgrad virus, transmitted by striped field mice, causes infections in the north and east of the country. Serological tests are available for primary and confirmatory diagnosis; moreover, viral nucleic acids can be amplified in the early phase of illness and compared with the viral nucleic acids from the reservoir hosts of the corresponding type of infection. Infections with American types of hantavirus have ca. 35% case fatality, and hantaviruses from southeastern Europe and Asia are also highly pathogenic; in contrast, the febrile illnesses caused by hantaviruses in Germany are usually relatively mild. CONCLUSION When persons living in high-risk areas present with fever of unknown origin or with renal dysfunction of unknown origin, physicians should consider the possibility of a hantavirus infection and should initiate the appropriate diagnostic evaluation.","Krüger, Detlev H; Ulrich, Rainer G; Hofmann, Jörg",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,734,16

HSPs act as potent adjuvants, inducing a Th1 response, as well as antigen-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) via cross-presentation. Our previous work has demonstrated that Hsp70-like protein 1 (Hsp70L1), a new member of the Hsp70 subfamily, can act as a powerful Th1 adjuvant in a DC-based vaccine. Here we report the efficient induction of tumor antigen-specific T cell immune response by DCs pulsed with recombinant fusion protein of Hsp70L1 and Her2(341-456), the latter of which is a fragment of Her2/neu (Her2) containing E75 (a HLA-A2 restricted CTL epitope). The fusion protein Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456) promotes the maturation of DCs and activates them to produce cytokines, such as IL-12 and TNF-α, and chemokines, such as MIP-1α, MIP-1β and RANTES. Taken together, these results indicate that the adjuvant activity of Hsp70L1 is maintained in the fusion protein. Her2-specific HLA-A2.1-restricted CD8(+) CTLs can be generated efficiently either from the Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of healthy donors or from the splenocytes of immunized HLA-A2.1/K(b) transgenic mice by in vitro stimulation or immunization with DCs pulsed with the Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456) fusion protein. This results in more potent target cell killing in an antigen-specific and HLA-A2.1-restricted manner. Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from transgenic mice immunized with Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456)-pulsed DCs can markedly inhibit tumor growth and prolong the survival of nude mice with Her2(+)/HLA-A2.1(+) human carcinomas. These results suggest that Hsp70L1-Her2(341-456)-pulsed DCs could be a new therapeutic vaccine for patients with Her2(+) cancer.","Fu, Qiang; Wu, Yanfeng; Yan, Fang; Wang, Ning; Wang, Wenying; Cao, Xuetao; Wang, Yajie; Wan, Tao",Cellular & molecular immunology,734,1

Many explanations have been offered to explain this anomaly, but none have provided a satisfactory answer. We present an experimental approach to demonstrate explicitly for the example of a 5BaO ∙ 8SiO2 glass that the anomaly is not a real phenomenon, but instead an artifact arising from an insufficient heating time at low temperatures. Heating times much longer than previously used at a temperature 50 K below the peak nucleation rate temperature give results that are consistent with the predictions of the Classical Nucleation Theory.

In addition, the initiation of opioids for pain is associated with a more than doubling of pharmacy and all-cause medical costs. The high costs of chronic pain are particularly relevant for anesthesiologists because surgery represents an inciting event that can lead to chronic pain and long-term opioid use. While the presence of risk factors and an individual patient's postoperative pain trajectory may predict who is at high risk for chronic pain and opioid use after surgery, to date, there are few interventions proven to reduce these risks. One promising approach is the transitional pain service. Programs like this attempt to bridge the gap between acute and chronic pain management, provide continuity of care for complicated acute pain patients after discharge from the hospital, and offer interventions for patients who are on abnormal trajectories of pain resolution and/or opioid use. Despite awareness of chronic pain after surgery and the ongoing opioid epidemic, there are few examples of successful transitional pain service implementation in the USA. Key issues and concerns include financial incentives and the required investment from the hospital or healthcare system.

METHODS The authors analysed data from the Function, Living, Outcomes and Work (FLOW) Study which enrolled 1202 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members with COPD at baseline and re-evaluated 1051 subjects at 2-year follow-up. The authors tested the specific hypothesis that the development of specific non-respiratory impairments (abnormal body composition and muscle strength) and functional limitations (decreased lower extremity function, poor balance, mobility-related dyspnoea, reduced exercise performance and decreased cognitive function) will determine the risk of disability in COPD, after controlling for respiratory impairment (FEV(1) and oxygen saturation). The Valued Life Activities Scale was used to assess disability in terms of a broad range of daily activities. The primary disability outcome measure was defined as an increase in the proportion of activities that cannot be performed of 3.3% or greater from baseline to 2-year follow-up (the estimated minimal important difference). Multivariable logistic regression was used for analysis. RESULTS Respiratory impairment measures were related to an increased prospective risk of disability (multivariate OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.26 to 2.44 for 1 litre decrement of FEV(1) and OR 1.57 per 5% decrement in oxygen saturation; 95% CI 1.13 to 2.18). Non-respiratory impairment (body composition and lower extremity muscle strength) and functional limitations (lower extremity function, exercise performance, and mobility-related dyspnoea) were all associated with an increased longitudinal risk of disability after controlling for respiratory impairment (p<0.05 in all cases). Non-respiratory impairment and functional limitations were predictive of prospective disability, above-and-beyond sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status and respiratory impairment (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.65 to 0.75; p<0.001).

The underlying immune response is described with ""original antigenic sin"" (OAS) whereby previous infections influence the response to future virus encounters. We cite evidence for OAS-induced immunopathology in HIV-1 disease. We hypothesize that similar immune abnormalities can occur after infection with SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis is supported by recent analysis of the antibodies in infected patients demonstrating serological and B cell abnormalities. The concept of symmetrical clonal regulation developed earlier for the immune network illustrates the pathway suggested by our hypothesis and may be helpful to develop strategies avoiding severe coronavirus disease 2019.","Kohler, Heinz; Nara, Peter",Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,734,1

The British Nuclear Medicine Society (BNMS) COVID-19 survey assessed the impact of the first wave of pandemic on NM services in the UK. With COVID-19 resurge compounded by seasonal winter pressures, we reflect and share lessons learnt from the first wave of pandemic to guide future strategy. METHODS A questionnaire consisting of 34 questions was sent out to all BNMS members over 2 weeks in May 2020, to evaluate the impact of 'lockdown'. RESULTS One hundred thirty-eight members (92 sites) from a multidisciplinary background responded. There was a 65% reduction across all services; 97.6% of respondents reported some reduction in diagnostic procedures and 71.3% reduction in therapies; 85% worked with a reduced workforce. The North East of England, Greater London and South East and Wessex were most affected by staff absences. The North East reported the highest number of COVID-19 positive staff; London reported the greatest lack of testing. The reported time required to clear the backlog was 1-12 months. Seventy-one percent of participants used BNMS COVID-19 guidance. CONCLUSION The first wave caused a major disruption of NM service delivery and impacted on the workforce. The departmental strategies should tailor services to evolving local and regional differences in prevalence of COVID-19. A blanket shutdown of services with a 'one size fits all' strategy would likely have a severe impact on future delivery of NM and health services in general. Timely testing of staff and patients remains of paramount importance.","Dizdarevic, Sabina; Abdulla, Mahdi; Sewedy, Taha; Weston, Charlotte; Oxley, Caroline; Croasdale, Jilly; Redman, Stewart; Vinjamuri, Sobhan; Mayes, Christopher; Flux, Glen; Ward, Mike; Graham, Richard; Buscombe, John",Nuclear medicine communications,734,4

BC has been studied extensively over the years by structural, kinetic, and mutagenesis analyses. Here we report three new crystal structures of Escherichia coli BC at up to 1.9 Å resolution, complexed with different ligands. Two structures are wild-type BC in complex with two ADP molecules and two Ca(2+) ions or two ADP molecules and one Mg(2+) ion. One ADP molecule is in the position normally taken by the ATP substrate, whereas the other ADP molecule occupies the binding sites of bicarbonate and biotin. One Ca(2+) ion and the Mg(2+) ion are associated with the ADP molecule in the active site, and the other Ca(2+) ion is coordinated by Glu-87, Glu-288, and Asn-290. Our kinetic studies confirm that ATP shows substrate inhibition and that this inhibition is competitive against bicarbonate. The third structure is on the R16E mutant in complex with bicarbonate and Mg-ADP. Arg-16 is located near the dimer interface. The R16E mutant has only a 2-fold loss in catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments showed that the mutation significantly destabilized the dimer, although the presence of substrates can induce dimer formation. The binding modes of bicarbonate and Mg-ADP are essentially the same as those to the wild-type enzyme. However, the mutation greatly disrupted the dimer interface and caused a large re-organization of the dimer. The structures of these new complexes have implications for the catalysis by BC.","Chou, Chi-Yuan; Tong, Liang",The Journal of biological chemistry,734,16

CLINICAL FINDINGS-Marked soft tissue swelling in the cranial cervical area with corresponding cystic swellings in the pharynx were noted. The iguana was considered to be 50% under the expected body weight, given diet and husbandry conditions. The WBC count was markedly elevated, characterized by heterophilia and lymphocytosis. Surgical exploration of the cranial cervical area and histologic and microbial testing identified lymphoma with secondary infection as the cause of the swelling. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME-The tumor was initially treated with a single 10-Gy fraction of radiation directed at the masses in the neck. A vascular access port was placed in the ventral abdominal vein, and a canine chemotherapy protocol was modified for use in the iguana. During the course of treatment, the protocol was modified twice. At 1,008 days from the initiation of treatment, the iguana appeared to be in remission. CLINICAL RELEVANCE-To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of radiation with doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone to successfully manage lymphoma in a reptile. A vascular access port was used effectively for drug administration for an extended period. The doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone protocol appeared to be safe and effective in this iguana for the management of lymphoma.","Folland, Douglas W; Johnston, Matthew S; Thamm, Douglas H; Reavill, Drury",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,734,1

Here, we systematically explored the nanomechanical properties of a range of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) with different degrees of β-lactam resistance. Our observations indicated that the BLR bacteria had cell stiffness values almost 10× lower than that of β-lactam-susceptible bacteria, caused by reduced peptidoglycan biosynthesis. With the aid of numerical modeling and experimental measurements, we demonstrated that these stiffness findings can be used to develop programmable, stiffness-mediated antimicrobial nanowires that mechanically penetrate the BLR bacterial cell envelope. We anticipate that these stiffness-related findings will aid in the discovery and development of novel treatment strategies for BLR Gram-negative bacterial infections.","Liu, Lizhi; Chen, Sheng; Zhang, Xu; Xue, Zhenjie; Cui, Shengjie; Hua, Xiaoting; Yang, Baowei; Yan, Huiling; Liu, Cong; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Zengfeng; Yu, Wei; Wu, Fan; Xu, Wujun; Lehto, Vesa-Pekka; Yue, Tianli; Liu, Yan; Yu, Yunsong; Wang, Tie; Wang, Jianlong",Science advances,734,33

Syndrome-specific, diagnostic panels have potential to provide information about aetiology quickly. Available panels have been of limited use in lower respiratory tract infections due to slow turn-around-time, lack of quantification of important pathogens and lack of detection of resistance genes.Materials/methods: We evaluated the newly developed Biofire® Filmarray® Pneumonia Panel plus (Biomérieux). Eighty-eight consecutive lower respiratory tract samples were analyzed by both standard microbiological methods, as requested by the referring clinician, and by the panel. The agreement with standard methods, empirical treatment coverage and possible impact on isolation practices were assessed by comparing the results from standard diagnostic methods with the panel results in relation to clinical data and information of antimicrobial therapy.Results: Both qualitative and semi-quantitative results from the panel generally displayed good agreement with standard methods and by combining methods, a possible aetiology was detected in 73% of patients. Due to the panel approach, the panel detected viruses more frequently. In 25% of the 60 patients assessed for empirical treatment coverage, a pathogen not covered by current therapy was detected and in 30% of in-house patients the panel results were found to potentially influence clinical decisions related to isolation care.Conclusions: The new diagnostic panel shows promise in improving aetiological diagnostics of lower respiratory tract infections. Correctly applied it has potential to offer support in clinical decision-making within hours of sampling.","Edin, Alicia; Eilers, Hinnerk; Allard, Annika",Infectious diseases,734,1

Transient hypothyroxinaemia of prematurity was considered. Her respiratory status worsened on day 9, followed by refractory shock. She was treated for sepsis. Further evaluation for absent heart rate variability in response to vasopressor resistant shock led to the detection of hypocortisolism.

Since one of the aims in laparoscopic colorectal surgery is to reduce access trauma, one possible way is to further reduce the surgical site by the single-incision laparoscopic surgery technique (SLS). One of the main criticisms concerning the use of SLS is its questionable benefit combined with its technical demands for the surgeon. These questions were addressed by comparing SLS versus conventional laparoscopic multitrocar surgery (LMS) in benign and malignant conditions with respect to technical operative parameters and early postoperative outcome of the patients. Methods Between 2010 and 2013, we performed SLS for colorectal disease. Of the 111 patients who underwent colorectal resection, 47 patients were operated by SLS and 31 using the LMS technique. The collected data for our patients were compared according to operating time, postoperative morbidity and mortality, pain score numeric rating scale on day 1 and day 5 postoperatively and postoperative hospital stay. To complement the pain scores, the required pain medication for adequate pain relief on these days was given. Results There was no significant difference in age, BMI or sex ratio between the two groups. The intraoperative and early postoperative course was comparable as well. Postoperative hospital stay was the only parameter with a significant difference, showing an advantage for SLS. Conclusion SLS is a feasible surgical method and a technical option in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. However, we were not able to identify substantial advantages of SLS that would favor this technique.","Schneider, Bernd; Brockhaus, Anne Catharina; Gelos, Marcos; Rudroff, Claudia",Innovative surgical sciences,734,16

The complicated forms of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) can evolve to multiple-organ failure, including several coagulopathies related to a sudden worsening of respiratory status. This article aimed to review studies about hematological and hemostatic laboratory disorders directly related to COVID-19 and to discuss how SARS-CoV-2 causes these abnormalities. The coagulation cascade model is associated with both COVID-19 and pulmonary involvement. Laboratory changes are relevant to evaluate the coagulation state - D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT), platelet count and fibrinogen. Pregnants and patients in Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) need special attention. Prophylactic interventions for COVID-19 coagulopathy should consider patients at risk for thrombotic events and potential contraindications. The mechanisms exerted by SARS-CoV-2 that impairs hemostatic balance include endothelial injury, inflammation, activation of the immune and complement systems. For diagnosis of coagulopathy, mainly Ddimer, but also PT, APTT and FDP, should be evaluated in COVID-19 patients. Intervention possibilities vary between lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and Unfractionated Heparin (UFH). Up to now, there is sufficient evidence that acutelyill patients with risk factors for coagulopathies will benefit from thrombophylaxis during hospitalization and post-discharge, but not all patients.","Pena, Ana Luísa Batista; Oliveira, Rafael Arantes; Severo, Renata Gomes; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Current medicinal chemistry,734,1

However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy. OBJECTIVES Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease. APPROACH A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 <92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 °C) episodes. MAIN RESULTS Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05 to 3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8 to 25)) episodes over the following 12 hours. SIGNIFICANCE Continuous EMRR values are systematically different VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, has higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 hours. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","McCartan, Thomas A; Worrall, Amy P; Ó Conluain, Ruán; Alaya, Fátimah; Mulvey, Christopher; MacHale, Elaine; Brennan, Vincent; Lombard, Lorna; Walsh, Joanne; Murray, Myles; Costello, Richard W; Greene, Garrett",Physiological measurement,734,25

METHODS We retrospectively investigated 208 patients who underwent laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer between January 2007 and September 2014. After excluding 15 patients with unusual medical histories or surgical treatments, 193 were selected for this cohort study. We divided the patients into two cohorts: elderly patients (≥75 years old) and non-elderly patients (<74 years old). We compared these cohorts with respect to clinicopathological characteristics and intraoperative and postoperative parameters. RESULTS The overall complication rates were 11.4% (8 of 70 patients) in the elderly cohort and 8.1% (10 of 123 patients) in the non-elderly cohort (P = 0.449). In a univariate analysis, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) of ≥3, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3, operative time of ≥330 min, and intraoperative blood loss of ≥50 ml were found to correlate significantly with postoperative complications. In a multivariate analysis, CCI of ≥3 (P = 0.034), ASA score of 3 (P = 0.019), and intraoperative blood loss of ≥50 ml (P = 0.016) were found to be independent risk factors of postoperative complications. In contrast, age was not found to significantly affect the risk of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer can be successfully performed in elderly patients with an acceptable complication rate. This study suggested that high CCI, ASA score, and intraoperative blood loss volume were identified as independent predictors of postoperative complications after laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","Fujisaki, Muneharu; Shinohara, Toshihiko; Hanyu, Nobuyoshi; Kawano, Susumu; Tanaka, Yujiro; Watanabe, Atsushi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Surgical endoscopy,734,31

In terms of anatomy, during the abdominal aorta's dissection, it is possible to identify the periaortic adipose tissue and the periaortic parietal peritoneum lying over it, sealing the retroperitoneal space. They seem to be fragile layers, with apparently no biomechanical role in the abdomen. However, it is well known that most cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that reach the emergency department still alive present retroperitoneal bleeding contained by the above-mentioned two-layer combination, eventually allowing time for surgical treatment. In previous studies about aortic wall stress, tension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture prediction, only information concerning the vessel wall itself is highlighted. Therefore, the present work aims to study the biomechanical and histological properties of the periaortic tissue, comparing them to the same variables measured in aortic wall samples described in the medical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples of periaortic tissue were harvested from 27 individuals during necropsy. Smoking status and the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm were observed. Biomechanical uniaxial destructive tests were performed up to samples rupture. Values of failure stress, tension, and strain were obtained. Samples were also harvested for histological analysis. RESULTS Periaortic tissue presented less amount of collagen in smokers than in non-smokers (p = 0.017). The periaortic tissue seems to be more elastic than aortic walls described in the literature (strain: 0.75 ± 0.37). Analyzing periaortic tissue failure stress (56.8 ± 101.26 N/cm2) and tension (7.65 ± 4.99 N/cm), it has at least 52% and 55%, respectively of the stress and tension described in the medical literature for abdominal aortic aneurysm walls. CONCLUSIONS The periaortic tissue presents less collagen fibers in smokers than in non-smokers. The periaortic tissue seemed very delicate during an autopsy, but the study of its biomechanical properties showed that it presents more than half of the resistance of an abdominal aortic aneurysm wall. This information suggests this tissue might have a mechanical protective role against massive bleeding when it comes to an aortic rupture. Therefore this tissue's biomechanical information should be included in computational models on enlargement and rupture prediction of abdominal aortic aneurysms.","Gomes, Vivian Carla; Ferraz da Silva, Luiz Fernando; Silvestre, Gina Camillo; Queiroz, Alexandre; Marques, Michele Alberto; Zyngier, Selene Perrotti; Simão da Silva, Erasmo",Annals of vascular surgery,734,16

The last comprehensive systematic review estimating the prevalence of chronic pain in children and adolescents was published in 2011. Since then, the literature on paediatric chronic pain has grown substantially. This manuscript outlines a protocol for an updated systematic review to provide updated estimates of the prevalence of various forms of chronic pain in children and adolescence. The review will also examine the relationship between sociodemographic and psychosocial factors related to chronic pain prevalence. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will follow Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We will search EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO for observational studies published in English between 2009 and 2020 reporting population-based estimates of chronic non-disease-related pain prevalence in children or adolescents (age ≤19 years). Two independent reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts retrieved from the search based on predefined eligibility criteria. The full texts of relevant studies will then be assessed by two reviewers. Studies meeting inclusion criteria will be categorised according to the type of pain investigated: headache only, abdominal pain only, back pain only, musculoskeletal pain, combined pain, general pain and other pain. Data will be extracted using customised forms and studies will be assessed for risk of bias using a 10-item tool developed by Hoy et al (2012). A narrative synthesis will summarise the prevalence estimates of paediatric chronic pain and associated sociodemographic and psychosocial correlates. Meta-analyses and meta-regressions will be performed if the data permit. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required.

The influence of microneedle treatment on the dimensions of microchannels (dye binding, calcein imaging, histology, and confocal microscopy studies), transepidermal water loss, and skin permeability of vismodegib was also evaluated. Skin viscoelasticity was assessed using a rheometer, and microneedle geometry was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. Permeation studies of vismodegib through dermatomed porcine ear skin were conducted using vertical Franz diffusion cells. Skin irritation potential of vismodegib formulation was assessed using an in vitro reconstructed human epidermis model. Results of the in vitro permeation studies revealed significant enhancement in permeation of vismodegib through microneedle-treated skin.

This sharp expansion reflects convergence of 3 factors: (1) rapidly growing student and faculty interest in global health; (2) growing realization-powerfully catalyzed by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome epidemic, the emergence of other new infections, climate change, and globalization-that health problems are interconnected, cross national borders, and are global in nature; and (3) rapid expansion in resources for global health.

It presents a blueprint for a new school-wide global health program at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The mission of that program, Mount Sinai Global Health, is to enhance global health as an academic field of study within the Mount Sinai community and to improve the health of people around the world. Mount Sinai Global Health is uniting and building synergies among strong, existing global health programs within Mount Sinai; it is training the next generation of physicians and health scientists to be leaders in global health; it is making novel discoveries that translate into blueprints for improving health worldwide; and it builds on Mount Sinai's long and proud tradition of providing medical and surgical care in places where need is great and resources few.","Landrigan, Philip J; Ripp, Jonathan; Murphy, Ramon J C; Claudio, Luz; Jao, Jennifer; Hexom, Braden; Bloom, Harrison G; Shirazian, Taraneh; Elahi, Ebby; Koplan, Jeffrey P","The Mount Sinai journal of medicine, New York",734,1

To annotate such transcripts, dissecting their coding potential is a critical step. Computational approaches have been proven fruitful in this task; however, most current tools are designed/optimized for mammals and only a few of them have been tested on a limited number of plant species. In this work, we present NAMS webserver, which contains a novel coding potential classifier, NAMS, specifically optimized for plants. We have evaluated the performance of NAMS using a comprehensive dataset containing more than 3 million transcripts from various plant species, where NAMS demonstrates high accuracy and remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art software. Moreover, our webserver also furnishes functional annotations, aiming to provide users informative clues to the functions of their transcripts. Considering that most plant species are poorly characterized, our NAMS webserver could serve as a valuable resource to facilitate the transcriptomic studies.

METHODS With IRB approval and informed consent, 31 patients undergoing living related renal transplantation were analyzed. Under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation, stroke volume index and SVV were continuously monitored with FloTrac/Vigileo monitor. Right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) as well as CVP and PADP were continuously monitored with volumetric pulmonary artery catheter. Data of every 30 min interval were used for analysis. The relationship between RVEDVI and CVP, PADP, SVV was analyzed with non-linear regression and the goodness-of-fit was assessed with coefficient of determination (R(2)) of each regression curve. The ability of CVP, PADP and SVV to correctly differentiate RVEDVI <100, <120 or >138 ml/m(2), which were used to guide fluid administration, was also assessed with ROC analysis. RESULTS Three hundred forty-eight data sets were obtained and analyzed. The goodness of fit between RVEDVI and SVV (R(2)) = 0.48) was better than that between RVEDVI and CVP or PADP (R(2)) = 0.19 and 0.33, respectively). The area under the ROC curve of SVV was significantly high compared to CVP or PADP. CONCLUSIONS This study confirmed the theoretical framework of right ventricular preload and ventricular filling pressure and respiratory variation of stroke volume. The result also suggests that SVV can correctly predict preload status compared to pressure-based indices.","Toyoda, Daisuke; Fukuda, Mitsue; Iwasaki, Ririko; Terada, Takashi; Sato, Nobukazu; Ochiai, Ryoichi; Kotake, Yoshifumi",Journal of anesthesia,734,1

METHODS All children and adolescents who underwent arthroscopically-assisted repair of a Palmer 1B tear were identified and prospectively evaluated after a mean follow-up of 1.3 years. The postoperative assessment included documentation of clinical parameters, pain score (visual analogue scale, VAS), grip strength and completion of validated outcome scores (Modified Mayo Wrist Score, MMWS; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Inventory, DASH). A total of 12 patients (four males, eight females) with a mean age of 16.3 years at the time of surgery were evaluated. RESULTS The mean VAS decreased significantly from 7.0 to 1.7 after the procedure. We observed a significant increase of the MMWS after surgery; however, MMWS was still significantly lower at final follow-up when compared to the contralateral side. A mean postoperative DASH score of 16 indicated an excellent outcome after the procedure. DASH Sports and Work Modules showed fair and good overall outcomes in the short-term, respectively. Grip strength averaged 86 % of the contralateral side at final follow-up, with no significant difference being found between both sides. CONCLUSIONS Arthroscopically-assisted repair of peripheral TFCC tears in adolescents provided predictable pain relief and markedly improved functional outcome scores. Concomitant pathologies may have to be addressed at the same time to eventually achieve a satisfactory outcome. Sports participation, however, may be compromised in the short-term and should therefore be resumed six months postoperatively.","Farr, Sebastian; Zechmann, Ulrike; Ganger, Rudolf; Girsch, Werner",International orthopaedics,734,5

To date, ALT1 biological roles in human vascular endothelial cells have not been reported. METHODS ALT1 was knocked down by siRNAs. Cell proliferation was analyzed by cck-8. The existence and sequence of human ALT1 were identified by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The interaction between lncRNA and proteins was analyzed by RNA-Protein pull down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation, and mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS ALT1 was expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The expression of ALT1 was significantly downregulated in contact-inhibited HUVECs and in hypoxia-induced, growth-arrested HUVECs. Knocking down of ALT1 inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs by G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. We observed that angiotensin converting enzyme Ⅱ(ACE2) was a direct target gene of ALT1. Knocking-down of ALT1 or its target gene ACE2 could efficiently decrease the expression of cyclin D1 via the enhanced ubiquitination and degradation, in which HIF-1α and protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) might be involved. CONCLUSION The results suggested the human long non-coding RNA ALT1 is a novel regulator for cell cycle of HUVECs via ACE2 and cyclin D1 pathway.","Li, Wen; Wang, Rui; Ma, Jie-Yi; Wang, Mian; Cui, Jin; Wu, Wei-Bin; Liu, Rui-Ming; Zhang, Chun-Xiang; Li, Wen; Wang, Shen-Ming","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",734,31

Recent publications have been reviewed to present the state of the art of the diagnosis and management of these two challenging conditions and to try to foresee the next steps. The evaluation of patients with mobile kidney can be made relying on diagnostic criteria such as ultrasound with color Doppler and measurement of resistive index, conventional upright X-ray frames after a supine uro-computerized tomography scan and both static and dynamic nuclear medicine scans, always with evaluation in the sitting or erect position. Laparoscopic nephropexy emerges as the current treatment option combining both objectively controlled repositioning of the kidney and resolution of symptoms with minimal invasiveness, low morbidity, and short hospital stay. The use of robotics is presently limited by its higher cost, but may increase in the future. Downward renal mobilization and nephropexy is a safe and versatile technique which has been adopted as a unique strategy or more often in combination with other surgical maneuvers in order to cope with complex ureteral reconstruction.","Mogorovich, Andrea; Selli, Cesare; De Maria, Maurizio; Manassero, Francesca; Durante, Jacopo; Urbani, Lucio",Urologia,734,27

Electromagnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve can induce contractions of the diaphragm and potentially prevent and treat loss of muscular function. Recommended safety distance of electromagnetic coils is 1 m. The aim of this study was to investigate the magnetic flux density in a typical intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Simulation of magnetic flux density generated by a butterfly coil was performed in a Berlin ICU training center with testing of potential disturbance and heating of medical equipment. Approximate safety distances to surrounding medical ICU equipment were additionally measured in an ICU training center in Bern. Magnetic flux density declined exponentially with advancing distance from the stimulation coil. Above a coil distance of 300 mm with stimulation of 100% power the signal could not be distinguished from the surrounding magnetic background noise. Electromagnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerve for diaphragm contraction in an intensive care unit setting seems to be safe and feasible from a technical point of view with a distance above 300 mm to ICU equipment from the stimulation coil.","Kuhn, K Friedrich; Grunow, Julius J; Leimer, Pascal; Lorenz, Marco; Berger, David; Schefold, Joerg C; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Schaller, Stefan J",Scientific reports,734,31

Objective To identify cortical control sites for human blood pressure regulation. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing intracranial electrode implantation as a prelude to epilepsy surgery in the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center were potential candidates for this study. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older who had electrodes implanted in one or more of the regions of interest and in whom deep brain electrical stimulation was indicated for mapping of ictal onset or eloquent cortex as a part of the presurgical evaluation. Twelve consecutive patients were included in this prospective case series from June 1, 2015, to February 28, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures Changes in continuous, noninvasive, beat-by-beat blood pressure parameter responses from amygdala, hippocampal, insular, orbitofrontal, temporal, cingulate, and subcallosal stimulation. Electrocardiogram, arterial oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide, nasal airflow, and abdominal and thoracic plethysmography were monitored. Results Among 12 patients (7 female; mean [SD] age, 44.25 [12.55] years), 9 electrodes (7 left and 2 right) all in Brodmann area 25 (subcallosal neocortex) in 4 patients produced striking systolic hypotensive changes. Well-maintained diastolic arterial blood pressure and narrowed pulse pressure indicated stimulation-induced reduction in sympathetic drive and consequent probable reduction in cardiac output rather than bradycardia or peripheral vasodilation-induced hypotension. Frequency-domain analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variability showed a mixed picture. No other stimulated structure produced significant blood pressure changes. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that Brodmann area 25 has a role in lowering systolic blood pressure in humans. It is a potential symptomatogenic zone for peri-ictal hypotension in patients with epilepsy.","Lacuey, Nuria; Hampson, Johnson P; Theeranaew, Wanchat; Zonjy, Bilal; Vithala, Ajay; Hupp, Norma J; Loparo, Kenneth A; Miller, Jonathan P; Lhatoo, Samden D",JAMA neurology,734,1

Clinicians may use microbiological cultures to differentiate infectious and aseptic fever. However, their utility depends on the prevalence of infection; and false-positive results might adversely affect patient care. We sought to quantify the cost and utility of microbiological cultures in a cohort of ICU patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). METHODS We performed a secondary analysis of a cohort with spontaneous ICH requiring mechanical ventilation. We collected baseline data, measures of systemic inflammation, microbiological culture results for the first 48 h, and daily antibiotic usage. Two physicians adjudicated true-positive and false-positive culture results using standard criteria. We calculated the cost per true-positive result and used logistic regression to test the association between false-positive results with subsequent antibiotic exposure. RESULTS Overall, 697 subjects were included. A total of 233 subjects had 432 blood cultures obtained, with one true-positive (diagnostic yield 0.1 %, $22,200 per true-positive) and 11 false-positives. True-positive urine cultures (5 %) and sputum cultures (13 %) were more common but so were false-positives (6 and 17 %, respectively). In adjusted analysis, false-positive blood and sputum results were associated with increased antibiotic exposure. CONCLUSIONS The yield of blood cultures early after spontaneous ICH was very low. False-positive results significantly increased the odds of antibiotic exposure. Our results support limiting the use of blood cultures in the first two days after ICU admission for spontaneous ICH.","Elmer, Jonathan; Yamane, David; Hou, Peter C; Wilcox, Susan R; Bajwa, Ednan K; Hess, Dean R; Camargo, Carlos A; Greenberg, Steven M; Rosand, Jonathan; Pallin, Daniel J; Goldstein, Joshua N; Takhar, Sukhjit S",Neurocritical care,734,24

STUDY DESIGN Systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressures were continuously sampled at 0.5 Hz via umbilical artery catheter from birth through 72 h. The raw data were aligned by postnatal hour and underwent error correction. For each infant, the mean values of systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure were calculated for each postnatal hour. The slope and intercept of best-fit line for each of the three blood pressure parameters was then calculated. Infants that received inotropic medications, died in the first 14 days of life, or had IVH grade III or IV were excluded. RESULT Using 11.9 million valid data points from 35 infants (mean EGA=25.7 ± 1.5 weeks, mean birth weight=865 ± 201 g), we found independent associations of African-American race (P<0.01) and a complete course of antenatal steroids (P<0.01) with higher blood pressures at birth and a slower rate of increase. Acute chorioamnionitis was independently associated (P=0.02) with lower blood pressures at birth and a faster rate of increase. EGA and birth weight were not independently predictive of blood pressure parameters. CONCLUSION We found that (i) the estimated mean blood pressure at birth is ~33 mmHg in a cohort of very preterm infants, (ii) blood pressure gradually increases with postnatal age, (iii) systolic blood pressure increases at a faster rate than diastolic blood pressure, (iv) race, antenatal steroid exposure and chorioamnionitis are independent modulators of blood pressure whereas EGA and birth weight are not.","Vesoulis, Z A; El Ters, N M; Wallendorf, M; Mathur, A M",Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,734,16

A total of 41 patients were included in the study. Before the pandemic began they had been seen at our unit at weekly intervals. During lockdown from March 9, 2020, to May 18, 2020 subjects were not allowed to enter the hospital unless they needed urgency or emergency surgery, or oncological management. During the second lockdown, from October 19, 2020, to December 11, 2020 patients could be followed up at distance by direct outreach including telephoning contacts. Data obtained early after each lockdown were compared with those obtained prior to the pandemic. Data for the first lockdown show that pain intensified and there was an increase in the recurrence rate of wounds, of their severity, and of superimposed infections as compared with the prelockdown period. The risk of lower-limb amputation was also considerably greater. During the second and less restrictive lockdown, patients were followed up by telemedicine and data indicate that skin lesions had not worsened any further. The management of vascular wounds was impacted by the pandemic unfavorably with health care failures in the hospital as well as in the primary care settings. In conclusion, the treatment of vascular leg ulcers is challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic as this spreads worldwide. This seems to be in keeping with what happens for other diseases. The data we obtained indicate that the pandemic-related lockdown has a deleterious effect on vascular skin wounds, with an increase of severity and mortality risk. The impact appears to be proportional to the number and the degree of limitations imposed on people.","Sallustro, Marianna; Florio, Anna",The international journal of lower extremity wounds,734,24

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, our PNEE clinic switched to a telemedicine format, and we present here our experience with providing care to children and adolescents with PNEE in this format. METHODS The multidisciplinary clinic shifted to a telemedicine platform in March 2020 with the same joint provider format. Follow-up phone calls are completed at one and three months following the visit. Data are presented with descriptive statistics. Referral volume and outcomes data are compared to historical patients, including rates of diagnosis acceptance, linkage to counseling, and change in event frequency. RESULTS Twenty-three patients were scheduled to be seen via telemedicine or hybrid visits from March through June, twenty completed their visits. Sixteen (70%) were reached for follow-up at one month. Of those reached, twelve (75%) accepted the diagnosis, eight (50%) were linked with counseling, and fourteen (88%) with improvement in event frequency. Of the sixteen reached at three months, eleven (69%) had accepted the diagnosis, ten (63%) were linked with counseling, and all but two reported improvement in event frequency. In comparison, the previously published results showed 3-month rates of 75% of patients accepting the diagnosis, 76% linked with counseling, and 75% with improvement in event frequency. CONCLUSIONS Video telemedicine visits are a feasible and effective way to provide care for children and adolescents with PNEE. At 3 months, patients seen by telemedicine had similar acceptance rates, decreased connection to counseling, and increased rate of improvement in event frequency. This study suggests telemedicine may have some benefits over traditional clinic visits, such as improved show rates and access to clinic; so should be considered a reasonable alternative to in-person visits.","Fredwall, Megan; Terry, Debbie; Enciso, Laurie; Burch, Maggie Mary; Trott, Kristen; Albert, Dara V F",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,734,20

Needle decompression is the currently accepted first-line intervention but has not been well validated. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a properly placed and patent needle thoracostomy (NT) compared with standard tube thoracostomy (TT) in a swine model of tPTX. METHODS Six adult swine underwent instrumentation and creation of tPTX using thoracic CO2 insufflation via a balloon trocar. A continued 1 L/min insufflation was maintained to simulate an ongoing air leak. The efficacy and failure rate of NT (14 gauge) compared with TT (34F) was assessed in two separate arms: (1) tPTX with hemodynamic compromise and (2) tPTX until pulseless electrical activity (PEA) obtained. Hemodynamics was assessed at 1 and 5 minutes after each intervention. RESULTS A reliable and highly reproducible tPTX was created in all animals with a mean insufflation volume of 2441 mL. tPTX resulted in the systolic blood pressure declining 54% from baseline (128-58 mm Hg), cardiac output declining by 77% (7-1.6 L/min), and equalization of central venous pressure and wedge pressures. In the first arm, there were 19 tPTX events treated with NT placement. All NTs were patent on initial placement, but 5 (26%) demonstrated mechanical failure (due to kinking, obstruction, or dislodgment) within 5 minutes of placement, all associated with hemodynamic decline. Among the 14 NTs that remained patent at 5 minutes, 6 (43%) failed to relieve tension physiology for an overall failure rate of 58%. Decompression with TT was successful in relieving tPTX in 100%. In the second arm, there were 21 tPTX with PEA events treated initially with either NT (n = 14) or TT (n = 7). The NT failed to restore perfusion in nine events (64%), whereas TT was successful in 100% of events as a primary intervention and restored perfusion as a rescue intervention in eight of the nine NT failures (88%). CONCLUSION Thoracic insufflation produced a reliable and easily controlled model of tPTX. NT was associated with high failure rates for relief of tension physiology and for treatment of tPTX-induced PEA and was due to both mechanical failure and inadequate tPTX evacuation. This performance data should be considered in future NT guideline development and equipment design.","Martin, Matthew; Satterly, Steven; Inaba, Kenji; Blair, Kelly",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,734,22

In a rural area of South Africa with an annual incidence (2011-2015) of 5 and 7% per annum for 15-19 and 20-24-year olds respectively, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) could provide AGYW with a form of HIV prevention they can more easily control. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we describe findings from a study conducted in 2017 that assessed knowledge of and attitudes toward PrEP to better understand community readiness for an AGYW PrEP rollout. METHODS We used descriptive analysis of a quantitative demographic survey (n = 8,414 ages 15-86) to identify population awareness and early PrEP adopters. We also conducted semi-structured, in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 52 potential PrEP gatekeepers (health care workers, community leaders) to assess their potential influence in an AGYW PrEP rollout and describe the current sexual health landscape. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and iteratively coded to identify major themes. RESULTS PrEP knowledge in the general population, measured through a demographic survey, was low (n = 125/8,414, 1.49% had heard of the drug). Medicalized delivery pathways created hostility to AGYW PrEP use. Key informants had higher levels of knowledge about PrEP and saw it as a needed intervention. Community norms around adolescent sexuality, which painted sexually active youth as irresponsible and disengaged from their own health, made many ambivalent towards a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Health care workers discussed ways to shame AGYW if they tried to access PrEP as they feared the drug would encourage promiscuity and ""risky"" behaviour. Others interviewed opposed provision on the basis of health care equity and feared PrEP would divert both drug and human resources from treatment programs. CONCLUSIONS The health system in this poor, high-HIV incidence area had multiple barriers to a PrEP rollout to AGYW. Norms around adolescent sexuality and gatekeeper concerns that PrEP could divert health resources from treatment to prevention could create barriers to PrEP roll-out in this setting. Alternate modes of delivery, particularly those which are youth-led and demedicalize PrEP, must be explored.","Nakasone, Sarah E; Chimbindi, Natsayi; Mthiyane, Nondumiso; Nkosi, Busisiwe; Zuma, Thembelihle; Baisley, Kathy; Dreyer, Jaco; Pillay, Deenan; Floyd, Sian; Birdthistle, Isolde; Seeley, Janet; Shahmanesh, Maryam",AIDS research and therapy,734,10

Complete aneurysm occlusion, however, occurs in a delayed fashion with initial persistent filling of the aneurysm dome. We hypothesized that this transflow across metallic struts may be associated with thromboembolic events. METHODS Forty-one consecutive patients undergoing aneurysm treatment with the Pipeline Embolization Device and a comparison group of 78 Neuroform stent-mediated embolizations were studied. Patients' charts, procedure notes, platelet function, and anticoagulation state were analyzed. Serial magnetic resonance images were assessed for the presence of newly occurring diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesions at multiple postprocedure time ranges (average days post procedure [Pipeline Embolization Device/Neuroform]: T1=1, T2=73/107, T3=174, T4=277/335, and T5=409).

RESULTS Pipeline patients were more likely to have new ipsilateral FLAIR lesions at all time points studied (30.6% versus 7.2% of patients at T=2 and 34.5% versus 6.2% at T=4). The mean FLAIR burden was significantly increased for Pipeline patients (10.1 versus 0.7 mm at T=2 and 8.8 versus 1.9 mm at T=4). Overall 34% (14/41) of Pipeline patients experienced a new FLAIR lesion at anytime when compared with 10% (8/78) of Neuroform stent-coil patients. Postprocedural diffusion-weighted imaging did not predict future FLAIR lesions suggesting a nonprocedural cause. CONCLUSIONS The Pipeline Embolization Device is associated with increased rate of de novo FLAIR lesions occurring in a delayed fashion and distinct from perioperative diffusion-weighted imaging lesions. The cause and clinical effect of these lesions are unknown and suggest the need for prudent follow-up and evaluation.","Safain, Mina G; Roguski, Marie; Heller, Robert S; Malek, Adel M",Stroke,734,17

We make use of survey research conducted at various times on representative samples of Poles. Many studies have shown that in the face of destabilization and uncertainty, religious engagement gives hope and support, and therefore religiosity should be expected to increase during a pandemic. On the other hand, it can be assumed that a superficial and traditional religiosity, associated only with customary participation in Sunday religious practices, may weaken or even disappear when churches close. It emerges that both these phenomena can be observed in Polish society and, consequently, in the context of the pandemic, they are leading to religious polarization.","Bożewicz, Marta Boguszewski Rafał",Religions,734,24

In this paper, we examine how PE exit strategies are being affected by the on-going global pandemic. The current COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented exogenous shocks to nearly every economy and it is important to see how this uncertainty affects economic activities such as the PE exit decision. Using 20 years of PE fund data from across 79 countries, we find that the current COVID-19 global pandemic has significantly affected the PE exit decision and the effect is stronger than that of the recent financial crisis. Out of all the exit strategies, acquisition is the most popular, and COVID-19 exerts a significant negative impact on the others. We also find that COVID-19 has negatively affected deal values across all the exit strategies, limiting the profit potential for investors. Moreover, the paper provides evidence that PE investors tend to wait for a good time to exit rather than rushing to exit during an uncertain time such as this global pandemic.

No prospective epidemiological study has been published previously. METHODS We selected a cohort of 152 transplant recipients (cardiac, hepatic and renal transplant recipients). Median time from transplantation was 17 months (range 1-50). They were prospectively followed-up for RVI during 7 months (October to April). Clinical and microbiological evaluation (cell culture, shell vial and polymerase chain reaction technique) of each RVI episode was made. RESULTS We detected 81 RVI (0.91 episodes/patient/year). Complications were detected in 15/81 episodes (18.5%): acute bronchitis (10 cases), pneumonia (three cases; 3.7% of RVI episodes) and bacterial sinusitis (2 cases). In 4 of 81 episodes (5%), patients needed hospitalization. A respiratory virus was isolated in 17 of 68 nasopharyngeal samples (six respiratory syncytial virus, six influenza, four picornavirus, one adenovirus). Fever presented an 83% positive predictive value for the diagnosis of influenza virus infection among those with a positive microbiological isolation. There were no episodes of acute rejection coincidentally with RVI. Only 54% of the subjects had been previously vaccinated against influenza. CONCLUSIONS Incidence of RVI among solid organ transplant recipients is similar to general population but complications are higher. A relationship between RVI and rejection was not detected. The rate of influenza vaccination was lower than expected. The presence of fever in a transplant recipient with RVI strongly suggests influenza infection.","López-Medrano, Francisco; Aguado, Jose M; Lizasoain, Manuel; Folgueira, Dolores; Juan, Rafael San; Díaz-Pedroche, Carmen; Lumbreras, Carlos; Morales, Jose M; Delgado, Juan F; Moreno-González, Enrique",Transplantation,734,24

Surgeons have attempted to minimize the number of incisions via single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC), which offers benefits including improved cosmesis, possibly less postoperative pain, and improved patient satisfaction. However, studies show that there is an increased risk of operative complications-in particular bile duct injuries. We report 500 consecutive cases of SILC performed without bile duct injury. METHODS A retrospective study of 500 continuous cases of SILC performed by the same surgeon at a single institution was conducted. Data on patient demographics, operative details, and postoperative outcomes were collected and evaluated. Detailed analysis of surgical techniques specifically to reduce bile duct injury was performed and described in this study. RESULTS In total, 500 patients underwent SILC during the study period. Eight patients needed additional ports to complete the surgery, while one was converted to an open surgery. No serious intraoperative complications, such as bile duct injury, were encountered. CONCLUSION Our experience shows that with due care and caution during SILC, with particular attention towards achieving the critical view of safety and a standardized technique, bile duct injury in SILC can be avoided.","Li, Tony; Kim, Guowei; Chang, Stephen",Surgical endoscopy,734,8

The aim of this paper is to describe the prevalence and characteristics of prone-positioning pressure sores (PPPS) and analyze the related risk factors. METHODS: A case-control study was performed in Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid during the COVID-19 pandemic between April and May 2020. We enrolled 74 confirmed COVID-19 patients in critical care units with invasive mechanical ventilation who were treated with pronation therapy. There were 57 cases and 17 controls. Demographic data, pronation maneuver characteristics and PPPS features were analyzed. RESULTS: In the case group, a total number of 136 PPPS were recorded. The face was the most affected region (69%). Regarding the severity, stage II was the most frequent. The main variables associated with an increased risk of PPPS were the total number of days under pronation cycles, and PP maintained for more than 24â¯h. The prealbumin level at admission was significantly lower in the case group. All of the ulcers were treated with dressings. The most frequent acute complication was bleeding (5%). CONCLUSIONS: According to our study, PPPS are related to the characteristics of the maneuver and the previous nutritional state.

This issue is even more critical in the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital mental health interventions, such as those delivered via chatbots on mobile devices, offer the potential to achieve scalability of healthy-coping interventions by lowering cost and supporting prevention. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to conduct a proof-of-concept evaluation measuring the engagement and effectiveness of Atena, a psychoeducational chatbot supporting healthy coping with stress and anxiety, among a population of university students. METHODS: In a proof-of-concept study, 71 university students were recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic; 68% (48/71) were female, they were all in their first year of university, and their mean age was 20.6 years (SD 2.4). Enrolled students were asked to use the Atena psychoeducational chatbot for 4 weeks (eight sessions; two per week), which provided healthy-coping strategies based on cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and mindfulness techniques. The intervention program consisted of conversations combined with audiovisual clips delivered via the Atena chatbot. Participants were asked to complete web-based versions of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) at baseline and postintervention to assess effectiveness. They were also asked to complete the User Engagement Scale-Short Form at week 2 to assess engagement with the chatbot and to provide qualitative comments on their overall experience with Atena postintervention. RESULTS: Participants engaged with the Atena chatbot an average of 78 (SD 24.8) times over the study period. A total of 61 out of 71 (86%) participants completed the first 2 weeks of the intervention and provided data on engagement (10/71, 14% attrition). A total of 41 participants out of 71 (58%) completed the full intervention and the postintervention questionnaires (30/71, 42% attrition). Results from the completer analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety symptoms for participants in more extreme GAD-7 score ranges (t39=0.94; P=.009) and a decrease in stress symptoms as measured by the PSS-10 (t39=2.00; P=.05) for all participants postintervention. Participants also improved significantly in the describing and nonjudging facets, based on their FFMQ subscale scores, and asked for some improvements in the user experience with the chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the benefit of deploying a digital healthy-coping intervention via a chatbot to support university students experiencing higher levels of distress. While findings collected during the COVID-19 pandemic show promise, further research is required to confirm conclusions.","Gabrielli, Silvia; Rizzi, Silvia; Bassi, Giulia; Carbone, Sara; Maimone, Rosa; Marchesoni, Michele; Forti, Stefano",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,734,16

Combinations of social distancing, and test, trace, and isolate strategies can reduce the number of new infections per infected individual below 1, thus driving declines in case numbers, but may be both challenging and costly. These interventions must also be maintained until development and (now likely) mass deployment of a vaccine (or therapeutics), since otherwise, many susceptible individuals are still at risk of infection. We use a simple analytical model to explore how low levels of infection, combined with vaccination, determine the trajectory to community immunity. Understanding the repercussions of the biological characteristics of the viral life cycle in this scenario is of considerable importance. We provide a simple description of this process by modelling the scenario where the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] is maintained at 1. Since the additional complexity imposed by the strength and duration of transmission-blocking immunity is not yet clear, we use our framework to probe the impact of these uncertainties. Through intuitive analytical relations, we explore how the necessary magnitude of vaccination rates and mitigation efforts depends crucially on the durations of natural and vaccinal immunity. We also show that our framework can encompass seasonality or preexisting immunity due to epidemic dynamics prior to strong mitigation measures. Taken together, our simple conceptual model illustrates the importance of individual and vaccinal immunity for community immunity, and that the quantification of individuals immunized against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount.","Saad-Roy, Chadi M; Levin, Simon A; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Grenfell, Bryan T",J R Soc Interface,734,26

Prevalence of anxiety for survey 1 and survey 2 were 14.9% and 14% and depression were 19.6% and 15.3%, respectively. Increased odds of anxiety and depression were associated with disrupted routines and lower socioeconomic status in both surveys, whereas depression was inversely related to the novel preventive routine of avoiding going to crowded places in survey 1. The prevalences of anxiety and depression were higher than preceding public health/social crises. A heavier burden of psychiatric conditions was evidenced amongst people experiencing disrupted daily routines across different phases of the pandemic and without novel preventive routines in the early phase.","Hou, Wai Kai; Lee, Tatia Mei-Chun; Liang, Li; Li, Tsz Wai; Liu, Huinan; Tong, Horace; Ben-Ezra, Menachem; Goodwin, Robin",Transl Psychiatry,734,26

However, little is known about the virus-host interaction of COVID-19 in sperm cells. We are the first to address the connection between changes in multiple seminal biomarkers and reproductive function in male patients recovering from COVID-19. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, seminal ACE2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, apoptotic variables, and semen quality parameters were evaluated at 10-day intervals for a maximum follow-up time of 60 days among male patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 84) and healthy controls (CON; n = 105). At the baseline and the subsequent follow-ups, the COVID-19 group revealed significantly higher levels of seminal plasma ACE2 enzymatic activity, IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-ß, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#945;, IFN-Î³, ROS, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity as well as lower levels of SOD activity than those in the CON group (P < 0.05). These perturbations tended to persist over time and were correlated with significant impairments in semen volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, and the number of spermatozoa. We provide the direct experimental evidence that the male reproductive system could be targeted and damaged by the COVID-19 infection. These findings go beyond our current understanding of the disease, suggesting that the reproductive function of the patients recovering from the disease should be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more serious reproductive problems in the future, as they may develop a transient state of male subfertility like those with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","Hajizadeh Maleki, Behzad; Tartibian, Bakhtyar",Reproduction,734,26

We consider whether these legislator trades were in a time window, and of a nature, that would be consistent with trading ahead of the market. Towards this end, we assess the reactions of US industries to sudden COVID-related news announcements, concomitantly with an analysis of levels of investor attention to COVID. Results suggest that, at an industry-level, for legislator trading to be ""ahead of the market"" it needed to have been done prior to February 26, and involving the 15 industries we identify as having abnormal returns, especially medical and pharmaceutical products (positive); restaurants, hotels, and motels (negative); as well as services and utilities.

OBJECTIVE: This study examines the evidence behind this recommendation because severe injuries can result from motorcycle crashes and patients can benefit from treatment at higher-level trauma centers. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the National Trauma Data Bank 2015 dataset. We conducted descriptive analyses (univariate and bivariate) followed by adjusted multivariate analysis to examine the association between trauma center designation levels and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: A total of 28,821 patients with motorcycle injuries were included. Most patients were men (n = 25,361; 88%) and aged between 16 and 64 years (n = 26,989; 93.6%). Survival rates were higher in level II (n = 10,658; 95.3%) and III (n = 2,129; 95.5%) trauma centers compared to level I centers (n = 14,498; 94.6%). After adjusting for confounders, decreased survival to hospital discharge was noted for patients treated at level III trauma centers compared to those at level I centers (odds ratio 0.543; 95% confidence interval 0.390-0.729). No difference in survival was noted between level I and II centers. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with motorcycle crash-related injuries treated at higher-level trauma center (I or II) had increased survival. This warrants a re-evaluation and adjustment of the field triage criterion for such patients. Examining the evidence behind field triage guidelines in trauma systems is needed for improved patient outcomes.","Elsemesmani, Hussein; Bachir, Rana; El Sayed, Mazen J",J. emerg. med,734,6

Although nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs are the most commonly used biological samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, they have a number of limitations related to sample collection and healthcare personnel safety. In this context, saliva is emerging as a promising alternative to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Saliva collection, being a non-invasive approach with possibility for self-collection, circumvents to a great extent the limitations associated with the use of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. In addition, various salivary biomarkers including the salivary metabolomics offer a high promise to be useful for better understanding of COVID-19 and possibly in the identification of patients with various degrees of severity, including asymptomatic carriers.

Self-collected saliva or anterior nasal specimens (ANS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection are less invasive but the sensitivity of these specimen types has not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: During September-November 2020, 730 adults undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing at community testing events and homeless shelters in Denver provided self-collected saliva and ANS specimens before NPS collection and answered a short survey about symptoms and specimen preference. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR; viral culture was performed on a subset of specimens positive by rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of saliva and ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR was measured against NPS. Subgroup analyses included test outcomes by symptom status and culture results. RESULTS: Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR appeared higher for saliva than for ANS (85% vs. 80%) and among symptomatic participants than among those without symptoms (94% vs. 29% for saliva; 87% vs. 50% for ANS). Among participants with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 by any specimen type, sensitivity of saliva and ANS by rRT-PCR was 94% and 100%, respectively.

In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The most cost-effective control measure is determined through cost-effectiveness analysis. Numerical simulations of the overall system are implemented in MatLab ® for demonstration of the theoretical results.","Olaniyi, S; Obabiyi, O S; Okosun, K O; Oladipo, A T; Adewale, S O",Eur Phys J Plus,734,1

However, reports of coronavirus-induced myocarditis were scarce. The aim of this review was to summarise the published cases of myocarditis and describe their presentations, diagnostic processes, clinical characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL and OpenGrey on was performed on 3 June 2020. Studies of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 were included, and those only reporting cardiac injury or heart failure were excluded. Cases were ""confirmed"" myocarditis if diagnosed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) or histopathology. Those without were grouped as ""possible"" myocarditis. RESULTS: A total of 31 studies on 51 patients were included; 12 cases were confirmed myocarditis while 39 had possible myocarditis. The median age was 55 and 69% were male. The most common presenting symptoms were fever, shortness of breath, cough and chest pain. Electrocardiogram changes included non-specific ST-segment and T-wave changes and ventricular tachycardia. Most patients had elevated cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers. Left ventricular dysfunction and hypokinesis was common. CMR established the diagnosis in 10 patients, with features of cardiac oedema and cardiac injury. Five patients had histopathological examination. Some cases required mechanical ventilation and extracoporeal membrane oxygenation, and 30% of patients recovered but 27% died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 myocarditis was associated with ECG, cardiac biomarker and echocardiographic changes, and the manifestation could be severe leading to mortality.

Here, we show that exosomes produced by naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM-exo) contain anti-inflammatory microRNA-99a/146b/378a that are further increased in exosomes produced by BMDM polarized with IL-4 (BMDM-IL-4-exo). These exosomal microRNAs suppress inflammation by targeting NF-&#954;B and TNF-&#945; signaling and foster M2 polarization in recipient macrophages. Repeated infusions of BMDM-IL-4-exo into Apoe-/- mice fed a Western diet reduce excessive hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and thereby the number of myeloid cells in the circulation and macrophages in aortic root lesions. This also leads to a reduction in necrotic lesion areas that collectively stabilize atheroma. Thus, BMDM-IL-4-exo may represent a useful therapeutic approach for atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders by targeting NF-&#954;B and TNF-&#945; via microRNA cargo delivery.","Bouchareychas, Laura; Duong, Phat; Covarrubias, Sergio; Alsop, Eric; Phu, Tuan Anh; Chung, Allen; Gomes, Michael; Wong, David; Meechoovet, Bessie; Capili, Allyson; Yamamoto, Ryo; Nakauchi, Hiromitsu; McManus, Michael T; Carpenter, Susan; Van Keuren-Jensen, Kendall; Raffai, Robert L",Cell Rep,734,29

The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of pre-admission antithrombotic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and to investigate the potential association between antithrombotic therapy and ARDS, as disease clinical presentation, or in-hospital mortality. We enrolled 192 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to emergency department of five Italian hospitals. The study population was divided in two groups according to the evidence of ARDS at chest computed tomography at admission. Propensity score weighting adjusted regression analysis was performed to assess the risk ARDS at admission, and death during hospitalization, in patients treated or not with antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. ARDS was reported in 73 cases (38 %), who showed more likely hypertension compared to those without ARDS (57.8 % vs 49.6 %; P = 0.005). Thirty-five patients (18.5 %) died during the hospitalization. Not survived COVID-19 patients showed a statistically significant increased age (77 ± 8.31 vs 65.57 ± 8.31; P = 0.001), hypertension (77.1 % vs 53.5 %; P = 0.018) and coronary artery disease prevalence (28.6 % vs 10.2 %; P = 0.009).

Reports of unusual and severe thrombotic events, including cerebral and splanchnic venous thrombosis and other autoimmune adverse reactions such as immune thrombocytopenia or thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) in connection with some of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have caused a great deal of concern within the population and the medical community. This report is intended to provide practical answers following an overview of our knowledge on these thrombotic events that are extremely rare but have serious consequences. Vaccine hesitancy threatens to reverse the progress made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases. These adverse events must be put into perspective with an objective analysis of the facts and the issues of the vaccination strategy during this SARS-Cov-2 pandemic.

We reviewed the existing literature on COVID-19 to assess the incidence and mortality of dementia comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of pre-existing dementia comorbidities on COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for patients with preexisting dementia who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The statistical data on the prevalence and mortality of dementia comorbidities were examined. A fixed-or random-effect model was used to calculate the overall pooled risk estimates. Forest plots were generated to show the summarized results. RESULTS: A total of 265 articles were retrieved from the three databases. After removing duplicates and performing two screenings, 10 articles were selected for meta-analysis, including 119,218 participants. Overall, the meta-analysis of the 10 studies showed that the incidence of dementia in COVID-19 patients was (R: 9%, [95% CI: 6% to 13%]). Moreover, the meta-analysis of 9 studies showed that the mortality rate of individuals with dementia after being infected with COVID-19 was higher than that of individuals with no dementia (OR: 5.17 [95% CI: 2.31 to 11.59]). Substantial heterogeneity was observed in this meta-analysis. Significant publication bias was also found. CONCLUSION: Emerging literature shows that dementia comorbidities are a high risk factor for the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. Our results should have an impact on preventive interventions and encourage more targeted approaches to prioritize older people with specific risk factors, such as dementia.","Liu, Nanyang; Sun, Jiahui; Wang, Xiyuan; Zhao, Ming; Huang, Qianqian; Li, Hao",J. alzheimers dis,734,26

A Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I clinical trial was initiated at the Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Gaozhou, China) in February 2021. Healthy adults aged between 18 and 59 years and over 60 years were sequentially enrolled and randomly allocated into three subgroups (1:1:1) either to receive the vaccine (10, 25, and 50 µg) or placebo (V-01: Placebo = 4:1) intramuscularly with a 21-day interval by a sentinel and dose escalation design. The data showed a promising safety profile with approximately 25% vaccine-related overall adverse events (AEs) within 30 days and no grade 3 or worse AEs. Besides, V-01 provoked rapid and strong immune responses, elicited substantially high-titre neutralizing antibodies and anti-RBD IgG peaked at day 35 or 49 after first dose, presented with encouraging immunogenicity at low dose (10 µg) subgroup and elderly participants, which showed great promise to be used as all-aged (18 and above) vaccine against COVID-19. Taken together, our preliminary findings indicate that V-01 is safe and well tolerated, capable of inducing rapid and strong immune responses, and warrants further testing in Phase II/III clinical trials.","Zhang, Jikai; Hu, Zhongyu; He, Jianfeng; Liao, Yuyi; Li, Yuan; Pei, Rongjuan; Fang, Xin; Zeng, Peiyu; Fan, Renfeng; Ou, Zhiqiang; Deng, Jinglong; Zhou, Jian; Guan, Wuxiang; Min, Yuanqin; Deng, Fei; Peng, Hua; Zhang, Zheng; Feng, Chunyan; Xin, Baobao",Emerg Microbes Infect,734,15

So far, discussions about the ethics of this technology have focused on privacy concerns, efficacy, and uptake. However, important issues regarding power imbalances and vulnerability also warrant attention. As demonstrated in other forms of digital surveillance, vulnerable subpopulations pay a higher price for surveillance measures. There is reason to worry that some types of COVID-19 technology might lead to the employment of disproportionate profiling, policing, and criminalization of marginalized groups. It is, thus, of crucial importance to interrogate vulnerability in COVID-19 apps and ensure that the development, implementation, and data use of this surveillance technology avoids exacerbating vulnerability and the risk of harm to surveilled subpopulations, while maintaining the benefits of data collection across the whole population.

MATERIAL AND METHODS The confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and laboratory test reports of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who received a convalescent plasma transfusion. RESULTS A total of 24 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were transfused with ABO-compatible convalescent plasma were enrolled in the study. Convalescent plasma transfusion showed an effective clinical outcome in 14 of 24 patients (an effective rate of 58.3%). No patients had an adverse reaction to the transfusion. Compared with before convalescent plasma transfusion, the lymphocyte count after convalescent plasma transfusion increased to a normal level (median: 0.80×109/L vs. 1.12×109/L, P=0.004). Other laboratory indicators such as white blood cells, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase showed a decreasing trend after transfusion. CONCLUSIONS This retrospective observational clinical study showed that convalescent plasma therapy could have beneficial effects on patient outcomes. Recently, regulatory authorization has been given for the use of convalescent plasma therapy, and clinical guidelines have been developed for the collection and use of convalescent plasma and hyperimmune immunoglobulin in patients with COVID-19.","Huang, Shuang; Shen, Changxin; Xia, Chengliang; Huang, Xiaoxing; Fu, Yourong; Tian, Li",Med Sci Monit,734,26

This paper provides an overview and critical analysis of the rapid rise of such new forms of public-private cooperation, focusing on their manifestation in the European region in the first phase of the pandemic. Drawing on a review of international media and documents, we discuss three main domains of public health action in which private technology companies and public health authorities have converged: contact-tracing, epidemic modelling and public health communication to manage the 'infodemic' of misinformation about the new coronavirus. Critics have raised concerns about how the digital response to Covid-19 may threaten privacy and enable greater state surveillance and control, and the possibility that semi-automated decision-making may exacerbate existing discrimination and inequalities. Our analysis extends such critiques by considering what the digital response to Covid-19 reveals about tech corporations' growing power to influence public health agendas. We discuss how they promote technical solutions to public health challenges that are politically seductive, but that have uncertain effectiveness and societal implications that warrant critical scrutiny.","Storeng, Katerini Tagmatarchi; de Bengy Puyvallée, Antoine",Glob Public Health,734,26

This paper analyzes the impacts of COVID-19 on US agricultural exports to China, especially the added delays and uncertainty regarding China's food imports meeting the US-China phase one trade deal target. I present the views of US farmers and the general public toward China and argue that healthy US-China agricultural trade relations are not only critical for both countries but welcomed by US farmers. I also discuss the possible rise in nontariff barriers following the pandemic as well as trade policies that are increasingly intertwined with political tensions. Finally, I discuss how the US-China phase one trade deal could possibly lead to a more balanced bilateral agricultural trade portfolio with greater share of protein and retail food products.","Zhang, WenDong",Applied Economic Perspectives and Policy,734,1

Treatment in this subpopulation is complex due to the potential hepatotoxicity of some of the medicinal products used. Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

The inflammatory response elicited by the infection is partly directed against the placenta and fetus and is the putative pathogenic mechanism for fetal brain developmental abnormalities. Fetal brain abnormalities are generally irreversible after birth and increase risk for later mental disorders. Maternal immune activation in animals models this pathophysiology. SARS-CoV-2 produces maternal inflammatory responses during pregnancy similar to previously studied common respiratory viruses. METHOD: Choline, folic acid, Vitamin D, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are among the nutrients that have been studied as possible mitigating factors for effects of maternal infection and inflammation on fetal development. Clinical and animal studies relevant to their use in pregnant women who have been infected are reviewed. RESULTS: Higher maternal choline levels have positive effects on the development of brain function for infants of mothers who experienced viral infections in early pregnancy. No other nutrient has been studied in the context of viral inflammation. Vitamin D reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in some, but not all, studies. Active folic acid metabolites decrease anti-inflammatory cytokines. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have no effect. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D and folic acid are already supplemented in food additives and in prenatal vitamins. Despite recommendations by several public health agencies and medical societies, choline intake is often inadequate in early gestation when the brain is forming. A public health initiative for choline supplements during the pandemic could be helpful for women planning or already pregnant who also become exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Hoffman, M Camille; Freedman, Robert; Law, Amanda J; Clark, Alena M; Hunter, Sharon K",Clin Nutr ESPEN,734,1

The virus is composed of the spike, membrane and envelope. On physiological smell, odoriferous substances bind to proteins secreted by sustentacular cells in order to be processed by olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory disorder is one of the main manifestations of COVID-19, however, research is still required to clarify the mechanism involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to analyze current scientific evidence intended to elucidate the pathophysiological relationship between COVID-19 and the cause of olfactory disorders. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and ScienceDirect were used to compose this article. The research was conducted on November 24th, 2020. Original articles with experimental studies in human, animal and in vitro, short communications, viewpoint, published in the English language and between 2019 and 2020 were included, all related to the pathophysiological relationship between olfactory disorders and COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Both human cell receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are essential for the SARS-CoV-2 entrance. These receptors are mostly present in the olfactory epithelium cells, therefore, the main hypothesis is that anosmia is caused due to damage to non-neuronal cells which, thereafter, affects the normal olfactory metabolism. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging studies exhibit a relationship between a reduction on the neuronal epithelium and the olfactory bulb atrophy. Damage to non-neuronal cells explains the average recovery lasting a few weeks. This injury can be exacerbated by an aggressive immune response, which leads to damage to neuronal cells and stem cells inducing a persistent anosmia. Conductive anosmia is not sufficient to explain most cases of COVID-19 induced anosmia. CONCLUSION: Olfactory disorders such as anosmia and hyposmia can be caused by COVID-19, the main mechanism is associated with olfactory epithelium damage, targeting predominantly non-neuronal cells. However, neuronal cells can also be affected, worsening the condition of olfactory loss.","Las Casas Lima, Mateus Henrique de; Cavalcante, Ana Luiza Brusiquesi; Leão, Sydney Correia",Braz. j. otorhinolaryngol.

The problem with vaccination is the time it takes to develop an effective vaccine, validate its safety and manufacture it in large quantities. Facing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), we simply do not have the time to develop the vaccine before thousands of people die. Therefore, any treatment which can decrease the severe symptoms due to lung damage may help attenuate mortality rates. Inactivation of ACE2 during virus fusion into the host cell may be one of the underlying reasons for intense immunological reaction seen in the lung tissue. This overreaction is probably mediated through the bradykinin receptor activation. Noscapine, a medication used for the treatment of cough, has been shown to inhibit bradykinin enhanced cough response in man. As it is already marketed in a number of countries as a cough medicine, even for children, a suitable formulation with all the required licenses is available that can be rapidly utilized in preliminary trials.","Ebrahimi, Soltan A",Drug Dev Res,734,16

METHODS: Six different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, medRxiv and bioRxiv) were searched for articles related to COVID-19 and neurological complications in children. Studies/case series reporting neurological manifestations of COVID-19 in patients aged &#8804;18 years, as well as case reports, as neurological complications appear to be rare. The pooled estimate of various non-specific and specific neurological manifestations was performed using a random effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies/case series and five case reports (3707 patients) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review, from a total of 460 records. Headache, myalgia and fatigue were predominant non-specific neurological manifestations, presenting altogether in 16.7% cases. Total of 42 children (1%) were found to have been reported with definite neurological complications, more in those suffering from a severe illness (encephalopathy-25, seizure-12, meningeal signs-17). Rare neurological complications were intracranial hemorrhage, cranial nerve palsy, Guillain-Barré syndrome and vision problems. All children with acute symptomatic seizures survived suggesting a favorable short-term prognosis. CONCLUSION: Neurological complications are rare in children suffering from COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively characterize and quantify microvascular alterations in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with moderate-to-severe or critical COVID-19 (n = 23) were enrolled non-consecutively in this prospective, observational, cross-sectional, multi-center study. Fifteen healthy volunteers served as controls. All participants underwent intravital microscopy by sidestream dark field imaging to quantify vascular density, red blood cell velocity (VRBC), and glycocalyx dimensions (perfused boundary region, PBR) in sublingual microvessels. Circulating levels of endothelial and glycocalyx-associated markers were measured by multiplex proximity extension assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: COVID-19 patients showed an up to 90% reduction in vascular density, almost exclusively limited to small capillaries (diameter 4-6 µm), and also significant reductions of VRBC. Especially, patients on mechanical ventilation showed severe glycocalyx damage as indicated by higher PBR values (i.e., thinner glycocalyx) and increased blood levels of shed glycocalyx constituents. Several markers of endothelial dysfunction were increased and correlated with disease severity in COVID-19. PBR (AUC 0.75, p = 0.01), ADAMTS13 (von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease; AUC 0.74, p = 0.02), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A; AUC 0.73, p = 0.04) showed the best discriminatory ability to predict 60-day in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our data clearly show severe alterations of the microcirculation and the endothelial glycocalyx in patients with COVID-19. Future therapeutic approaches should consider the importance of systemic vascular involvement in COVID-19.","Rovas, Alexandros; Osiaevi, Irina; Buscher, Konrad; Sackarnd, Jan; Tepasse, Phil-Robin; Fobker, Manfred; Kühn, Joachim; Braune, Stephan; Göbel, Ulrich; Thölking, Gerold; Gröschel, Andreas; Pavenstädt, Hermann; Vink, Hans; Kümpers, Philipp",Angiogenesis,734,1

Simulation offers the ability to train large numbers of robots in parallel, and offers an abundance of data. However, no simulation is perfect, and robots trained solely in simulation fail to generalize to the real-world, resulting in a""sim-vs-real gap"". How can we overcome the trade-off between the abundance of less accurate, artificial data from simulators and the scarcity of reliable, real-world data? In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BDA), a novel approach to bridge the sim-vs-real gap in both directions -- real2sim to bridge the visual domain gap, and sim2real to bridge the dynamics domain gap. We demonstrate the benefits of BDA on the task of PointGoal Navigation.

This study used the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model to examine (a) whether workplace accommodations enable workers, particularly those with different impairments, to remain economically active; and (b) the predictors of the onset of work accommodations. Data from two waves of a large-scale longitudinal survey of disability in Great Britain, the Life Opportunities Survey (2009-2012) were analysed. 2307 workers with an impairment and 4308 workers without an impairment were followed up for a year. Work accommodations appear to enable workers with impairments to remain economically active, especially those with mental impairments. There was no difference in the employment rates of workers with and without mental impairments who had two or more work accommodations, in contrast to the 10% employment gap between workers with and without mental impairments who did not have any work accommodations. While there was no gender difference in the disability employment gap, barriers to employment related to caregiving were much greater for women compared to men. Moreover, only workers with incident pain impairments were associated with an increase in their work accommodations, not workers with incident mental impairments. Despite the evidence that workers with mental impairments could benefit considerably from workplace accommodations, they are less likely to have their workplace adjusted. The ICF model is particularly useful in analysing the role of work accommodations because it considers a much wider range of factors that are relevant not just to workers with different types of impairments, but are also relevant to the wider group of workers who use workplace accommodations.","Chandola, Tarani; Rouxel, Patrick",Soc Sci Med,734,16

Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged >28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms. Public health measures can be effectively used to identify target groups for prevention and treatment of mental health and emotional symptoms.

Its peculiar primary health care (PHC) system faces a burden due to the contagion occurring in the community environment. Then, the aim is to estimate the effect of the coverage of primary health care and social isolation on the evolution of confirmed cases and deaths by COVID-19, controlling sociodemographic, economic and health system aspects. METHODS: A time series design was designed with data on diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and their deaths as outcomes in the capital cities of the Northeast region of Brazil. Independent variables such as PHC coverage, hospital beds, social isolation, demographic density, Gini index and other indicators were analyzed. A Autoregressive Generalized Linear Model method was applied for model the relationship. RESULTS: We identified an exponential growth of cases (y = 0.00250.71x; p-value<0,001). However, there is a high variability in the occurrence of outcomes. PHC coverage&#8805;75% (&#967;2 = 9.27; p-value = 0.01) and social isolation rate (&#967;2 = 365.99; p-value<0.001) proved to be mitigating factors for the spread of COVID-19 and its deaths. Capitals with hospital beds &#8805; 3.2 per thousand inhabitants had fewer deaths (&#967;2 = 9.02; p-value = 0.003), but this was influenced by PHC coverage (&#967;2 = 30,87; p-value<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PHC mitigates the occurrence of Covid-19 and its deaths in a region of social vulnerability in Brazil together with social isolation. However, it is not known until when the system will withstand the overload in view of the low adhesion to social isolation, the lack of support and appropriate direction from the government to its population.","Costa de Assis, Sanderson José; Lopes, Johnnatas Mikael; Guedes, Marcello Barbosa Otoni Gonçalves; Sanchis, Geronimo José Bouzas; Araujo, Diego Neves; Roncalli, Angelo Giuseppe",PLoS One,734,26

This virus affects mainly the respiratory system, but the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is also a target, meanwhile SARS-CoV-2 was already detected in oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, rectum, and in fecal samples from COVID-19 patients. Prolonged GIT manifestations in COVID-19, mainly the diarrhea, were correlated with decreased richness and diversity of the gut microbiota, immune deregulation and delayed SARS-CoV-2 clearance. So, the bidirectional interactions between the respiratory mucosa and the gut microbiota, known as gut-lung axis, are supposed to be involved in the healthy or pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. In accordance, the intestinal dysbiosis is associated with increased mortality in other respiratory infections, due to an exacerbated inflammation and decreased regulatory or anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the lungs and in the gut, pointing to this important relationship between both mucosal compartments. Therefore, since the mucous membranes from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are affected, in addition to dysbiosis and inflammation, it is plausible to assume that adjunctive therapies based on the modulation of the gut microbiota and re-establishment of eubiosis conditions could be an important therapeutic approach for constraining the harmful consequences of COVID-19. Then, in this review, we summarized studies showing the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal system and the related digestive COVID-19 manifestations, in addition to the literature demonstrating nasopharyngeal, pulmonary and intestinal dysbiosis in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we showed the potential beneficial role of probiotic administration in other respiratory infections, and discuss the possible role of probiotics as an adjunctive therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","de Oliveira, Gislane Lelis Vilela; Oliveira, Camilla Narjara Simão; Pinzan, Camila Figueiredo; de Salis, Larissa Vedovato Vilela; Cardoso, Cristina Ribeiro de Barros",Front Immunol,734,5

This expansion shapes a potential near future of obesity conservative management, characterized by tailored combined therapeutic regimens, targeting not only weight loss but also improved overall health outcomes. The progress regarding the elucidation of the mechanisms which regulate the bodily energy equilibrium has led to medications which mimic hormonal adaptations that follow bariatric surgery, in the quest for a ""Medical bypass.""

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with HFpEF were classified based on the presence of RA enlargement (RA volume index >39 mL/m2 in men and >33 mL/m2 in women). Compared to patients with normal RA size (n=234), patients with RA dilation (n=67) showed a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), worse right ventricular (RV) systolic function, more severe pulmonary hypertension (PH), and higher prevalence of mild tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and impaired RA reservoir function, with increased hepatobiliary enzyme levels. AF was strongly associated with the presence of RA dilation (odds ratio [OR] 10.2, CI [4.00-26.1] current AF vs no AF and OR 3.38, CI 1.26-9.07, earlier AF vs no AF). Patients with RA dilation had more than two-fold increased risk of composite outcomes of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization (adjusted HR 2.01, 95% CI, 1.09-3.70-, p=0.02). The presence of RA dilation also displayed an additive prognostic value over left atrial dilation alone.

The underlying basis of this association is likely complex in nature. The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus. Given the high prevalence of obesity worldwide and a sex-biased mortality rate, we discuss the implications and relevance of our results for COVID-19.","Sarver, Dylan C; Wong, G William",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,734,20

The associations between sleep conditions and anxious and depressive symptoms among pregnant women remained to be investigated, particularly during the epidemic of COVID-19. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey on pregnant women was conducted at the time period of fast increasing cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. The Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) were applied to detect anxious and depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regressions models were established to explore the associations of sleep conditions with psychological symptoms. RESULTS: In total, 751 pregnant women were enrolled, with a mean age of 30.51 years (Standard deviation: 4.28). Overall, 82.7% of the respondents considered low risk of being infected by COVID-19. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 among pregnant women were 13.4% and 35.4%, respectively, but most of which were mild. Variables referred to poor sleep conditions were strongly associated with anxious and depressive symptoms, including random or late time of going to bed, difficulty in falling sleep, short sleep duration, and ordinary or poor subjective sleep quality. LIMITATIONS: Non-random sample restricted generalization of our findings to the whole population of pregnant women. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed a notable proportion of the pregnant women who exhibited mild anxiety and depression symptoms during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. Targeted interventions in improving sleep conditions might help alleviate gestational anxious and depressive symptoms.","Lin, Wei; Wu, Bo; Chen, Bin; Lai, Guiying; Huang, Shengbin; Li, Shaoli; Liu, Kefu; Zhong, Chuyan; Huang, Weikang; Yuan, Shixin; Wang, Yueyun",J. affect. disord,734,16

In addition, the outbreak of the COVID‐19 epidemic has plunged people into long‐term panic, and promoted the entire construction industry to think about a healthier and more sustainable living environment. To respond to the imbalance between energy supply and demand, an optimization analysis based on energy use is developed, assessing the energy efficiency of the window‐to‐wall ratio (WWR) design and calculating the energy consumption of three different types of residential buildings for both cooling and heating loads as well as for year‐round loads. Owing to its harsh climate and huge energy consumption, in this study, the Hot-summer and Cold‐winter (HSCW) zone of China was chosen as the experimental setting for the optimization analysis of WWR. Then, in the three main types of residential buildings, including detached houses, multi‐story dwellings and high‐rise dwellings, a correlation between WWRS and energy consumption in the cooling season, heating season and year‐round was built. The comparisons between the WWRS and energy consumption for different types of residential buildings are presented. The design optimization recommendation for WWRS are proposed. It has significant pos-itive meanings for the development of green and sustainably designed residential buildings that offer high levels of thermal comfort and energy efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: In this study, we combined in silico analysis and in vitro transwell experiments to identify a metastasis gene. Then, we used an in vivo experiment to validate the metastasis. Furthermore, a series of experiments such as FACS, Western blot, and ELISA were applied to explore the function of the metastasis gene. Results: LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) was confirmed as a metastasis gene, whose expression levels are correlated with the overall survival rate of HCC patients. We further showed that the knockout of LTBP4 in an HCC cell line increased cell proliferation, activated the cell cycle, and induced metastasis events. Moreover, we proved that LTBP4-KO could increase the percentage of active TGFß1 secreted by HCC cell lines, as well as the recruitment of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) by active TGFß1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), which further inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation and activated the immune suppression signal. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the LTBP4-TGFß1-MDSCs axis is a critical pathway for the immune suppression signals of HCC primary tumors.","Yang, Xiou; Ye, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Liuyan; Zhang, Xingguo; Shu, Peng",Onco Targets Ther,734,27

Most research on this important topic, however, focused on how patients view the relationship and not how the physicians see it. This research strives to bridge this gap, with the resolution of leading to an improved appreciation of this multifaceted relationship. METHODS: A survey of 328 actively practicing physicians from all four health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in Israel resulted in a hierarchical formation of components, indicating both the relative as well as absolute importance of each component in the formation of the patient-physician relationship. The sample conducted was a convenience one. Methodologically, we used two different complementary methods of analysis, with the primary emphasis on the Analytic Hierarchical Processing (AHP), a unique and advanced statistical method. RESULTS: The results provide a detailed picture of physicians' attitudes toward the patient-physician relationship. Research indicates that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. To date, this attitude was mostly referred to intuitively, without the required rigorous investigation provided by this paper. Specifically, the results indicate that physicians tend to consider the relationship with the patient in a rather pragmatic manner. Namely, while fairness, reliability, devotion, and serviceability received high scores from physicians, social interaction, friendship, familial, as well as appreciation received the lowest scores, indicating low priority for warmth and sociability in the trust relationship from the physician's perspective. The results showed good consistency between the AHP results and the ANOVA comparable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients who traditionally stress the importance of interpersonal skills, physicians stress the significance of the technical expertise and knowledge of health providers, emphasizing the role of competence and performance. Physicians evaluate the relationship on the basis of their ability to solve problems through devotion, serviceability, reliability, and trustworthiness and disregard the ""softer"" interpersonal aspects such as caring, appreciation, and empathy that have been found to be important to their patients. This illustrates a mismatch in the important components of relationship building that can lead to a loss of trust, satisfaction, and repeat purchase. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: We study the impact physicians' incentives have on the tangible relationship and discuss the significance of physician-patient relationship on satisfaction with the health service given. As a result policies leading to a more dynamic role must be given to the patient, who being well informed by the physician, can help in the decision making process. Policy schemes need to be implemented as a way of changing physicians' behavior, forcing them to better construct and utilize this dyadic relationship.","Berger, Ron; Bulmash, Ben; Drori, Netanel; Ben-Assuli, Ofir; Herstein, Ram",Isr J Health Policy Res,734,3

We report 3 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in which contrast-enhanced ultrasound was suggestive of consolidations with perfusion defects, at least in part caused by ischemic or necrotic changes and not only by inflammatory or atelectasis events.","Soldati, Gino; Giannasi, Gianfranco; Smargiassi, Andrea; Inchingolo, Riccardo; Demi, Libertario",J Ultrasound Med,734,24

Despite the concerted efforts of the scientific field, by April 25, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 had spread to over 192 countries/regions, causing more than 146 million confirmed cases including 31 million deaths. For now, an established treatment for patients with COVID-19 remains unavailable. The key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the mechanisms underlying its infectivity and pathogenicity. As a predominant focus, the coronavirus spike (S) protein is the key determinant of host range, infectivity, and pathogenesis. Thereby comprehensive understanding of the sophisticated structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein may provide insights into possible intervention strategies to fight this ongoing global pandemic. Herein, we summarize the current knowledge of the molecular structural and functional features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well as recent updates on the cell entry mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2, paving the way for exploring more structure-guided strategies against SARS-CoV-2.","Zhu, Chaogeng; He, Guiyun; Yin, Qinqin; Zeng, Lin; Ye, Xiangli; Shi, Yongzhong; Xu, Wei",J. med. virol,734,20

Since the emergence of COVID-19, a number of confirmed cases reported autoimmune manifestations. Herein, we reviewed the reported COVID-19 cases with associated autoimmune manifestations. METHODS: We searched PubMed database using all available keyword for COVID-19. All related studies between January 1st, 2020 to May 22nd, 2020 were reviewed. Only studies published in English language were considered. Articles were screened based on titles and abstract. All reports of confirmed COVID-19 patients who have associated clinical evidence of autoimmune disease were selected. RESULTS: Among 10006 articles, searches yielded, Thirty-two relevant articles for full-text assessment. Twenty studies meet the eligibility criteria. The twenty eligible articles reported 33 cases of confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis who developed an autoimmune disease after the onset of covid-19 symptoms. Ages of patients varied from a 6 months old infant to 89 years old female (Mean=53.9 years of 28 cases); five cases had no information regarding their age. The time between symptoms of viral illness and onset of autoimmune symptoms ranged from 2 days to 33 days (Mean of the 33 cases=9.8 days). Autoimmune diseases were one case of subacute thyroiditis (3%), two cases of Kawasaki Disease (6.1%), three cases of coagulopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome (9.1%), three cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (9.1%), eight cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (24.2%), and sixteen cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (48.5%). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has been implicated in the development in a range of autoimmune diseases which may shed a light on the association between autoimmune diseases and infections.","Saad, Mariam Ahmed; Alfishawy, Mostafa; Nassar, Mahmoud; Mohamed, Mahmoud; Esene, Ignatius N; Elbendary, Amira",Current rheumatology reviews (Online),734,1

We performed a comparative ultrastructural study of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells and in lungs from deceased COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 induces rapid death associated with profound ultrastructural changes in Vero cells. Type II pneumocytes in lung tissue showed prominent altered features with numerous vacuoles and swollen mitochondria with presence of abundant lipid droplets. The accumulation of lipids was the most striking finding we observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, both in vitro and in the lungs of patients, suggesting that lipids can be involved in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Considering that in most cases, COVID-19 patients show alteration of blood cholesterol and lipoprotein homeostasis, our findings highlight a peculiar important topic that can suggest new approaches for pharmacological treatment to contrast the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.","Nardacci, Roberta; Colavita, Francesca; Castilletti, Concetta; Lapa, Daniele; Matusali, Giulia; Meschi, Silvia; Del Nonno, Franca; Colombo, Daniele; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Zumla, Alimuddin; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Piacentini, Mauro; Falasca, Laura",Cell Death Dis,734,22

The aim of this study was to provide an approach to reduce the risk for malnutrition and improve patients' clinical outcomes. METHODS: Short age-adjusted Nutritional Risk Screening was performed with 94 non-intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted to the Giovanni Borea Civil Hospital in Sanremo. Forty-nine patients in the ICU were considered at risk for malnutrition without screening and were fed with enteral nutrition plus supplemental parenteral nutrition. In the non-ICU setting, patients underwent a personalized nutritional protocol, considering their conditions, which consisted of a high-protein and high-calorie pureed diet, oral nutritional supplements, and/or artificial nutrition or other personalized nutritional path. RESULTS: The nutritional treatment was well tolerated by the patients. Of the non-ICU patients, 19.1% died. They were mainly women, with higher body mass indices and older in age. Of the patients in the ICU, 53.1% died. Of the 94 non-ICU patients, 72 scored positive on at least one nutritional risk screening item (excluding age). Of the 94 non-ICU patients, 68 were >70 y of age. Non-ICU patients whose energy and protein needs were not met were older (P = 0.01) and had a higher death rate than patients whose needs were met (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This protocol should not be considered as a guideline; rather, it is intended to report the clinical experience of a nutrition team in an Italian reference center for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Nutritional strategies should be implemented to prevent worsening of clinical outcomes.","Formisano, Elena; Di Maio, Pasquale; Ivaldi, Cecilia; Sferrazzo, Elsa; Arieta, Lorenzina; Bongiovanni, Silvia; Panizzi, Loredana; Valentino, Elena; Pasta, Andrea; Giudice, Marco; Demontis, Stefania",Nutrition,734,29

Here, we consider drug repurposing as an attractive approach that can facilitate the drug discovery process by repurposing existing pharmaceuticals to treat illnesses other than their primary indications. We review current information concerning the global health issue of COVID-19 including promising approved drugs, e.g., human angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (hACEIs). Besides, we describe computational approaches to be used in drug repurposing and highlight examples of in-silico studies of drug development efforts against SARS-CoV-2. Alacepril and lisinopril were found to interact with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the host entranceway for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, through exhibiting the most acceptable rmsd_refine values and the best binding affinity through forming a strong hydrogen bond with Asn90, which is assumed to be essential for the activity, as well as significant extra interactions with other receptor-binding residues. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations followed by calculation of the binding free energy were also carried out for the most promising two ligand-pocket complexes from docking studies (alacepril and lisinopril) to clarify some information on their thermodynamic and dynamic properties and confirm the docking results as well. These results we obtained probably provided an excellent lead candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against COVID-19.

521218,521218,521218,Cohesion in Distancing,11.830841,1.5448768,2020,"BACKGROUND: In late December, 2019, patients presenting with viral pneumonia due to an unidentified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed. METHODS: We did next-generation sequencing of samples from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cultured isolates from nine inpatients, eight of whom had visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Complete and partial 2019-nCoV genome sequences were obtained from these individuals. Viral contigs were connected using Sanger sequencing to obtain the full-length genomes, with the terminal regions determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Phylogenetic analysis of these 2019-nCoV genomes and those of other coronaviruses was used to determine the evolutionary history of the virus and help infer its likely origin. Homology modelling was done to explore the likely receptor-binding properties of the virus. FINDINGS: The ten genome sequences of 2019-nCoV obtained from the nine patients were extremely similar, exhibiting more than 99·98% sequence identity. Notably, 2019-nCoV was closely related (with 88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China, but were more distant from SARS-CoV (about 79%) and MERS-CoV (about 50%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Notably, homology modelling revealed that 2019-nCoV had a similar receptor-binding domain structure to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues. INTERPRETATION: 2019-nCoV is sufficiently divergent from SARS-CoV to be considered a new human-infecting betacoronavirus. Although our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bats might be the original host of this virus, an animal sold at the seafood market in Wuhan might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans. Importantly, structural analysis suggests that 2019-nCoV might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in humans. The future evolution, adaptation, and spread of this virus warrant urgent investigation.

Retrospective cohort study. We used electronic patient records from 23 hospital emergency departments in ten countries grouped into 14 areas. We examined data on 2073 acute hospital presentations by 1795 unique children and adolescents through age 18. We examined the total number of emergency psychiatric hospital presentations and the proportion of children and adolescents presenting with severe self-harm as our two main outcome measures. In addition, we examined sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and clinical management variables for those presenting with self-harm. To compare the number of hospital presentations between 2020 and 2019 a negative binomial model was used. For other variables, individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses were carried out. Emergency psychiatric hospital presentations decreased from 1239 in 2019 to 834 in 2020, incident rate ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.62-0.73; p < 0.001. The proportion of children and adolescents presenting with self-harm increased from 50% in 2019 to 57% in 2020, odds ratio 1.33, 1.07-1.64; p = 0.009 but there was no difference in the proportion presenting with severe self-harm. Within the subpopulation presenting with self-harm the proportion of children and adolescents presenting with emotional disorders increased from 58 to 66%, odds ratio 1.58, 1.06-2.36; p = 0.025. The proportion of children and adolescents admitted to an observation ward also decreased from 13 to 9% in 2020, odds ratio 0.52, 0.28-0.96; p = 0.036.

Although social workers have made efforts to address people’s needs during the pandemic, it is worth examining the role they have played in safeguarding health equality. Focusing on the case of Hong Kong, we found that the profession was generally ill-prepared for the outbreak, and in particular, for confronting the attendant social inequalities. We identified three possible reasons for these findings: 1) non-governmental organizations were caught off-guard by the outbreak, 2) there was no clearly articulated intervention agenda to inform practitioners of the roles they should play in such a large-scale crisis, and 3) having become more formalized and standardized, social work services may have become less flexible in responding to emerging community needs. We conclude this article by suggesting three directions that could allow the profession to better pursue its mission during large-scale crises.","Kwan, Chi-Kin; Ling, Henry Wai-Hang; Cheung, Johnson Chun-Sing; Chui, Ernest Wing-Tak",Qual Soc Work,734,29

METHODS We distributed surveys to urology residency applicants and program directors (PDs) via the Urology Match 2021 Google Spreadsheet and email. The survey collected demographic information as well as SoMe activity, perceived pressure to use SoMe, match results, and attitudes regarding the utility of SoMe in the match process. RESULTS A total of 108/528 (20%) applicants registered for the 2021 match and 61/142 (43%) PDs completed the survey. More applicants than PDs felt that SoMe helped them gain better insight into residency programs or applicants, respectively. Fewer applicants than PDs felt that SoMe activity provided a benefit to them in the match process. No significant relationship was found between SoMe viewing frequency, posting frequency, or tweetorial use with match outcomes. The majority of PDs believed that SoMe played a more important role in the 2021 match process than previous years while 15% and 12% reported that an applicant's SoMe activity helped or hurt the chances of matching to their program respectively. CONCLUSIONS SoMe, particularly Twitter, was widely used in the 2021 match by both applicants and PDs.

ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin1-7. Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. The increased generation of angiotensin1-7 also triggers counter-regulatory protective effects through binding to G-protein coupled Mas receptors. Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis. Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2→Angiotensin1-7→Mas receptor axis. In the lungs, such dysregulation would favor the progression of inflammatory and thrombotic processes triggered by local angiotensin II hyperactivity unopposed by angiotensin1-7. In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin1-7 and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Verdecchia, Paolo; Cavallini, Claudio; Spanevello, Antonio; Angeli, Fabio",Eur J Intern Med,734,2

The setting was an emergency room (ER) in a large tertiary hospital and included primary and secondary MERS patients. METHODS: Rapid response teams conducted repeated assessments of IPC and monitored implementation of corrective measures using a detailed structured checklist. We ascertained the epidemiologic link between patients and calculated the secondary attack rate per 10,000 patients visiting the ER (SAR/10,000) in 3 phases of the outbreak. RESULTS: In phase I, 6 primary cases gave rise to 48 secondary cases over 4 generations, including a case that resulted in 9 cases in the first generation of secondary cases and 21 cases over a chain of 4 generations. During the second and third phases, the number of secondary cases sharply dropped to 18 cases and 1 case, respectively, from a comparable number of primary cases. The SAR/10,000 dropped from 75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 55-99) in phase I to 29 (95% CI, 17-46) and 3 (95% CI, 0-17) in phases II and III, respectively.

In the vein of a recent empirical literature, we reassess the impact of weather factors on Covid-19 daily cases in a panel of advanced and emerging countries between January the first and 28th May 2020. We consider 5 different meteorological factors and go further previous studies. In addition, we give a short-run and medium/long-run time perspective of the dramatic outcomes of the pandemic by both considering infected people (short-run) and fatalities (long-run). Our results reveal that the choice of delays and time perspective of the effects of climatic factors on the virus are crucial as well as Covid-19 outcomes can explain the discrepancies in the previous literature. For the first time, we use a dynamic panel model and consider two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: 1) direct/physical factors related to the survivals and durability dynamics of the virus in surfaces and outdoors and 2) an indirect factor through human behaviors and individual mobility - walking or driving outdoors - to capture the impact of climate on social distancing and thus on Covid-19 outcomes. Our model is estimated emph{per se} two different estimators and persistence, delays in patterns, nonlinearities and numerous specifications changes are taken into account with many robustness checks. Our work reveal that temperatures and, more interestingly, solar radiation - that has been clearly undervalued in previous studies - are significant climatic drivers on Covid-19 outbreak. Indirect effects through human behaviors ie interrelationships between climatic variables and people mobility are significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Since climate is per se purely exogenous, climate tend to strengthen the effect of mobility on virus spread. The net effect from climate on Covid-19 outbreak will thus result from the direct negative effect of climatic variables and from the indirect effect due to the interaction between mobility and them. Direct negative effects from climatic factors on Covid-19 outcomes - when they are significant - are partly compensated by positive indirect effects through human mobility. Suitable control policies should be implemented to control the mobility and social distancing. \","DAMETTE, O.; Mathonnat, C.; Goutte, S.",,734,20

We found cell viability was significantly declined accompanied by cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in LPS-treated A549 cells. MiR-30a-5p was down-regulated by LPS treatment and miR-30a-5p significantly protected A549 cells from LPS-induced injury by increasing cell viability, reducing cell apoptosis, promoting cell cycle progression, and inhibiting inflammatory reactions. Dual-luciferase activity demonstrated that RUNX2 was a direct target for miR-30a-5p and its expression was negatively and directly regulated by miR-30a-5p. Over-expression of RUNX2 weakened the inhibitory effect of miR-30a-5p on inflammatory injury. In vivo, over-expression of miR-30a-5p alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory responses and lung injury in LPS-administrated mice. Besides, miR-30a-5p repressed LPS-elevated phosphorylation levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), IκBα degradation, and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation. In conclusion, miR-30a-5p ameliorates LPS-induced inflammatory injury in A549 cells and mice via targeting RUNX2 and related signaling pathways, thereby influencing the progression of ARDS.","Li, Pibao; Yao, Yanfen; Ma, Yuezhen; Chen, Yanbin",Innate Immun,734,17

Then, this study aimed to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on May/June data in Ethiopia using regression model. In this study, I used Pearson correlation analysis and the linear regression model to predict COVID-19 new cases and new deaths based on the available data from 12th May to 10th June 2020 in Ethiopia. There was a significant positive correlation between COVID-19 new cases and new deaths with different related variables. In the regression models, the simple linear regression model was a better fit the data of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths than as compared with quadratic and cubic regression models. In the multiple linear regression model, variables such as the number of days, the number of new laboratory tests, and the number of new cases from AA city significantly predicted the COVID-19 new cases. In this model, the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths of COVID-19. The number of days, daily laboratory tests, and new cases from Addis Ababa city significantly predicted new COVID-19 cases, and the number of days and new recoveries significantly predicted new deaths from COVID-19. According to this analysis, if strong preventions and action are not taken in the country, the predicted values of COVID-19 new cases and new deaths will be 590 and 12 after two months (after 9th of August) from now, respectively.

In this study, we applied the Lagrangian method to model the disinfection performance of in-duct UV lamps on three bacteria: Pseudomonas alcaligenes, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli, respectively. For modeling, the airborne bacteria's inactivation was determined by critical survival fraction probability (CSFP) and maximal bearable UV dose (MBUD) methods, respectively. The results indicated that Lagrangian modeling utilizing the MBUD method needs to appropriately evaluate the maximal UV dose (D(mb)), which is bearable for airborne microorganisms. The disinfection efficacy obtained by using the CSFP method agreed well with experimental measurements. Within the Lagrangian framework, the recommended empirical value for critical survival fraction (F(sc)) was 0.4 for modeling the disinfection efficacy of in-duct UV lamps. Besides, the disinfection efficacies of in-duct UV lamps with full luminous length on P. alcaligenes and E. coli were 100% with Re within the range of 4.11 × 10(4) to 8.22 × 10(4). Moreover, the present numerical model was also applied for further validation with inactivation measurements of in-duct UV lamps performed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

METHODS: in this cross sectional study, HCWs who were working in SARS-CoV-2 Isolation Hospitals were interviewed. Estimating specific antibodies (IgM and IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 was carried out using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay targeting the Spike antigen of SARS-CoV-2 virus. RESULTS: Out of 111, 82 (74%) HCWs accepted to participate with a mean age of 31.5 ± 8.5 years. Anti-SARS-COV2 antibodies were detected in 38/82 (46.3%) of cases with a mean age of 31 years and female HCWs constituted 57.6% of cases. The highest rate of seropositivity was from the nurses (60.5%), and physicians (31.6%) with only (7.9%) technicians. Only 28/82 (34.1%) HCWs reported previous history of COVID19.

Approximately 30%, typically with more severe/enduring mental illness, reported additional challenges, and mental distress including: unmanageable child behaviours; fear of relapse/hospitalisation; financial difficulties; absence of child care; and a lack of routines. Service provision varied considerably across regions. The experiences within this case study highlight unique opportunities to address the multiple stresses of pre-emergency daily living. We also highlight how mental health services and governments might become more “pandemic ready” to more effectively support vulnerable families, including addressing service overload issues, optimising the use of digital technologies, and providing in-person contact and social supports where required.","Furlong, Mairead; McGilloway, Sinead; Mulligan, Christine; Killion, Mary G.; McGarr, Sharon; Grant, Anne; Davidson, Gavin; Donaghy, Mary",Front Psychiatry,734,1

Thanks to early flattening of the epidemiological curve, ventilator demand in Greece was kept lower than supply throughout the pandemic, allowing for unbiased comparison of the outcomes of patients undergoing early intubation vs. delayed or no intubation. Methods: We conducted an observational study including all adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 consecutively admitted in Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece between March 11, 2020 and April 15, 2020. Patients subsequently admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU) were categorized into the “early intubation” vs. the “delayed or no intubation” group. The “delayed or no intubation” group included patients receiving non-rebreather mask for equal to or more than 24 h or high-flow nasal oxygen for any period of time or non-invasive mechanical ventilation for any period of time in an attempt to avoid intubation. The remaining intubated patients comprised the “early intubation” group. Results: During the study period, a total of 101 patients (37% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the hospital. Fifty-nine patients (58% of the entire cohort) were exclusively hospitalized in general wards with a mortality of 3% and median length of stay of 7 days. Forty-two patients (19% female, median age 65 years) were admitted in the ICU; all with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Of those admitted in the ICU, 62% had at least one comorbidity and 14% were never intubated. Early intubation was not associated with higher ICU-mortality (21 vs. 33%), fewer ventilator-free days (3 vs. 2 days) or fewer ICU-free days than delayed or no intubation. Conclusions: A strategy of early intubation was not associated with worse clinical outcomes compared to delayed or no intubation. Given that early intubation may presumably reduce virus aerosolization, these results may justify further research with a randomized controlled trial.","Siempos, Ilias I.; Xourgia, Eleni; Ntaidou, Theodora K.; Zervakis, Dimitris; Magira, Eleni E.; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Routsi, Christina; Zakynthinos, Spyros G.",Front Med (Lausanne),734,11

The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27(th) March to 7(th) April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Newby, Jill M.; O’Moore, Kathleen; Tang, Samantha; Christensen, Helen; Faasse, Kate",PLoS One,734,16

This included descriptions of innovations and good practices, the management of COVID-19 in district health services and responses of communities to the outbreak. AIM: To synthesise the lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Africa region. METHODS: A thematic document analysis was conducted on twenty-seven short report publications from Botswana, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Findings: Eight major themes were derived from the data: community-based activities; screening and testing; reorganisation of health services; emergency care for COVID-19; maintenance of essential non-COVID-19 health services; caring for the vulnerable; use of information technology; and reframing training opportunities. Community health workers were a vital community resource, delivering medications and other supplies to homes, as well as following up on patients with chronic conditions. More investment in community partnerships and social mobilisation was proposed. Difficulties with procurement of test kits and turn-around times were constraints for most countries. Authors described how services were reorganised for focused COVID-19 activities, sometimes to the detriment of essential services and training of junior doctors. Innovations in use of internet technology for communication and remote consultations were explored. The contribution of family medicine principles in upholding the humanity of patients and their families, clear leadership and planning, multidisciplinary teamwork and continuity of care was emphasised even in the context of providing critical care. CONCLUSIONS: The community-orientated primary care approach was emphasised as well as long-term benefits of technological innovations.

Existing evidence shows their benefits in improving outcomes, especially for chronic disease patients. However, their use has not been as widespread as expected partly due to barriers faced in their adoption and use. We aimed to identify the types of barriers to a patient, provider, and caregiver adoption/use of ePHRs and to analyze their extent in chronic disease care. METHODS: A systematic search in Medline, PubMed, Science Direct, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) database was performed to find original studies assessing barriers to ePHR adoption/use in chronic care until the end of 2018. Two researchers independently screened and extracted data. We used the PHR adoption model and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology to analyze the results. The Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) version 2018 was used to assess the quality of evidence in the included studies. RESULTS: Sixty publications met our inclusion criteria. Issues found hindering ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care were associated with demographic factors (e.g., patient age and gender) along with key variables related to health status, computer literacy, preferences for direct communication, and patient’s strategy for coping with a chronic condition; as well as factors related to medical practice/environment (e.g., providers’ lack of interest or resistance to adopting ePHRs due to workload, lack of reimbursement, and lack of user training); technological (e.g., concerns over privacy and security, interoperability with electronic health record systems, and lack of customized features for chronic conditions); and chronic disease characteristics (e.g., multiplicities of co-morbid conditions, settings, and providers involved in chronic care). CONCLUSIONS: ePHRs can be meaningfully used in chronic disease care if they are implemented as a component of comprehensive care models specifically developed for this care. Our results provide insight into hurdles and barriers mitigating ePHR adoption/use in chronic disease care. A deeper understating of the interplay between these barriers will provide opportunities that can lead to an enhanced ePHR adoption/use.","Niazkhani, Zahra; Toni, Esmaeel; Cheshmekaboodi, Mojgan; Georgiou, Andrew; Pirnejad, Habibollah",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,734,1

The rapid development of therapies is of major importance. However, our lack of understanding of the molecular processes and host cell signaling events underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection hinder therapy development. We employed a SARS-CoV-2 infection system in permissible human cells to study signaling changes by phospho-proteomics. We identified viral protein phosphorylation and defined phosphorylation-driven host cell signaling changes upon infection. Growth factor receptor (GFR) signaling and downstream pathways were activated. Drug-protein network analyses revealed GFR signaling as key pathway targetable by approved drugs. Inhibition of GFR downstream signaling by five compounds prevented SARS-CoV-2 replication in cells, assessed by cytopathic effect, viral dsRNA production, and viral RNA release into the supernatant. This study describes host cell signaling events upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals GFR signaling as central pathway essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication. It provides with novel strategies for COVID-19 treatment.","Klann, Kevin; Bojkova, Denisa; Tascher, Georg; Ciesek, Sandra; Münch, Christian; Cinatl, Jindrich",bioRxiv,734,16

Previous studies explored acute and long-term care environments but not outpatient clinics. Objectives of this study were to track microbial movement throughout an outpatient clinic and evaluate the impact of a disinfectant spray intervention targeting high-touch point surfaces. Methods At the start of the clinic day, a harmless viral tracer was placed onto 2 fomites: a patient room door handle and front desk pen. Patient care, cleaning, and hand hygiene practices continued as usual. Facility fomites (n = 19), staff hands (n = 4), and patient hands (n = 3-4) were sampled after 2, 3.5, and 6 hours. Tracer concentrations at baseline (before intervention) were evaluated 6 hours after seeding. For the intervention trials, high-touch surfaces were cleaned 4 hours after seeding with an ethanol-based disinfectant and sampled 2 hours after cleaning. Results At 2, 3.5, and 6 hours after seeding, virus was detected on all surfaces and hands sampled, with examination room door handles and nurses’ station chair arms yielding the highest concentrations. Virus concentrations decreased by 94.1% after the disinfectant spray intervention (P = .001). Conclusions Microbes spread quickly in an outpatient clinic, reaching maximum contamination levels 2 hours after inoculation, with the highest contamination on examination room door handles and nurses’ station chairs. This study emphasizes the importance of targeted disinfection of high-touch surfaces.","Reynolds, Kelly A.; Sexton, Jonathan D.; Pivo, Trevor; Humphrey, Kyle; Leslie, Rachel A.; Gerba, Charles P.",American Journal of Infection Control,734,28

DESIGN: A scoping review of 140 sources (126 database, 14 grey literature) published between 2014 and 2019 yielded 162 measurement tools across a range of domains, users, and cultures. Database sources from Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus were extracted, in addition to grey literature obtained from knowledge experts and organisations relevant to digital media use in children. To be included, the source had to: (1) be an empirical investigation or present original research, (2) investigate a sample/target population that included children or young persons between the ages of 0 and 25 years of age, and (3) include at least one assessment method for measuring digital media use.

MEASURES: Basic information, level of risk of bias, study setting, paradigm, data type, digital media type, device, usage characteristics, applications or websites, sample characteristics, recruitment methods, measurement tool information, reliability and validity. RESULTS: Significant variability in nomenclature surrounding problematic use and criteria for identifying clinical impairment was discovered. Moreover, there was a paucity of measures in key domains, including tools for young children, whole families, disadvantaged groups, and for certain patterns and types of usage.

During the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak, healthcare workers formed a special population of patients. Although virus-specific IgG play important roles in virus neutralization and prevention against future infection, limited information is available regarding the long term persistence of IgG after infection with SARS-like coronavirus. METHODS: A long-term prospective cohort study followed 34 SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers from a hospital with clustered infected cases during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak in Guangzhou, China, with a 13-year follow-up. Serum samples were collected annually from 2003-2015. Twenty SARS-CoV-infected and 40 non-infected healthcare workers were enrolled in 2015, and their serum samples were collected. All sera were tested for IgG antibodies with ELISA using whole virus and a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, as a diagnostic antigen. RESULTS: Anti SARS-CoV IgG was found to persist for up to 12 years. IgG titers typically peaked in 2004, declining rapidly from 2004-2006, and then continued to decline at a slower rate. IgG titers in SARS-CoV-infected healthcare workers remained at a significantly high level until 2015. Patients treated with corticosteroids at the time of infection were found to have lower IgG titers than those without. CONCLUSIONS: IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can persist for at least 12 years. The presence of SARS-CoV IgG might provide protection against SARS-CoV and other betacoronavirus. This study provides valuable information regarding humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV and the 2019-nCoV.","Guo, Xiaoqin; Guo, Zhongmin; Duan, Chaohui; chen, Zeliang; Wang, Guoling; Lu, Yi; Li, Mengfeng; Lu, Jiahai",,734,18

EOs were evaluated for their anti-virulence activity using phenotypic methods as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Among the C. albicans isolates, biofilm, phospholipase and hemolysins were detected in 40.4, 86.5 and 78.8% of isolates, respectively. Jasmine oil showed the highest anti-biofilm activity followed by cinnamon, clove and rosemary oils. SEM and AFM analysis showed reduced adherence and roughness in the presence of EOs. For phospholipase, rosemary oil was the most inhibitory, followed by jasmine, cinnamon and clove oils, and for hemolysins, cinnamon had the highest inhibition followed by jasmine, rosemary and clove oils. A molecular docking study revealed major EO constituents as promising inhibitors of the Als3 adhesive protein, with the highest binding for eugenol, followed by 1,8-cineole, 2-phenylthiolane and cinnamaldehyde. In conclusion, EOs have a promising inhibitory impact on Candida biofilm, phospholipase and hemolysin production, hence EOs could be used as potential antifungals that impact virulence factors.","El-Baz, Ahmed M.; Mosbah, Rasha A.; Goda, Reham M.; Mansour, Basem; Sultana, Taranum; Dahms, Tanya E.
