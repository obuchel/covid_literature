470630,"[Internal medical emergencies in the pregnant patient : Peripartum sepsis, metabolic derailment, endocrinological emergencies and pulmonary edema]./ Internistische Notfälle bei der schwangeren Patientin : Peripartale Sepsis, Stoffwechselentgleisungen, endokrinologische Notfälle und Lungenödem",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for nurse leaders who ""embrace the interconnection"" between medicine and public health. The inequitable impact of COVID-19 on people of color demonstrates the importance of applying expertise from nursing practice and public health systems to work with communities and other professions on complex health issues. Yet, despite a clear need for improved population health, educational programs designed to produce Advanced Public Health Nurses, with skills to address complex system changes, have become increasingly scarce. PURPOSE: We put forward the perspective that the nation needs more advanced practice nurses prepared for leadership roles focused on the health of whole populations, marginalized communities, and the systems and policies that promote their health. DISCUSSION: We argue that opportunities should be expanded for nurses to attain education for these roles through increased investments in the Doctor of Nursing Practice model to prepare nurses for advanced public health specialty practice.","Bekemeier, Betty; Kuehnert, Paul; Zahner, Susan J; Johnson, Kathleen H; Kaneshiro, Jasmine; Swider, Susan M",Nurs. outlook,,989
