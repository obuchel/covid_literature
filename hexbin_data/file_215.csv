589,The advent of ECMO and pumpless extracorporeal lung assist in ARDS,2011,"Despite advances in critical care facilities and ventilation therapies acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high mortality rates. The condition can stem from a multitude of causes including pneumonia, septicemia and trauma ultimately resulting in ARDS. ARDS is characterized by respiratory insufficiency with severe hypoxemia or hypercapnia. The treatment strategy depends on the knowledge of the underlying disease. But lung-protective ventilation with adjusted positive end-expiratory pressure remains the most effective therapeutic tool despite advances in prone positioning, inhalation of nitric oxide and the use of steroids. Newer modalities including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (PECLA) are being increasingly introduced in critical care settings as rescue therapies in patients who fail to respond to conservative measures. We describe here the introduction and advances of both ECMO and PECLA in the management of ARDS.","Hamid, I A; Hariharan, A S; Shankar, N R Ravi",J Emerg Trauma Shock,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3132365/,215

10649,AutoPEWS: Automating Pediatric Early Warning Score Calculation Improves Accuracy Without Sacrificing Predictive Ability,2020-03-25,"INTRODUCTION: Pediatric hospital readmissions can represent gaps in care quality between discharge and follow-up, including social factors not typically addressed by hospitals. This study aimed to reduce the 30-day pediatric readmission rate on 2 general pediatric services through an intervention to enhance care spanning the hospital stay, discharge, and follow-up process. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed an intervention bundle based on a needs assessment and evidence-based models of transitional care. The intervention included pre-discharge planning with a transition coordinator, screening and intervention for adverse social determinants of health (SDH), medication reconciliation after discharge, communication with the primary care provider, access to a hospital-based transition clinic, and access to a 24-hour direct telephone line staffed by hospital attending pediatricians. These were implemented sequentially from October 2013 to February 2017. The primary outcome was the readmission rate within 30 days of index discharge. The length of stay was a balancing measure. RESULTS: During the intervention, the included services discharged 4,853 children. The pre-implementation readmission rate of 10.3% declined to 7.4% and remained stable during a 4-month post-intervention observation period. Among 1,394 families screened for adverse SDH, 48% reported and received assistance with ≥ 1 concern. The length of stay increased from 4.10 days in 2013 to 4.30 days in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: An intervention bundle, including SDH, was associated with a sustained reduction in readmission rates to 2 general pediatric services. Transitional care that addresses multiple domains of family need during a child’s health crisis can help reduce pediatric readmissions.","deJong, Neal A.; Kimple, Kelly S.; Morreale, Madlyn C.; Hang, Shona; Davis, Darragh; Steiner, Michael J.",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190252/,215
11205,Interventions to improve wellbeing among obstetricians and midwives at Cork University Maternity Hospital,2019-10-10,"The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is a major target for the evaluation of the cardiac sympathetic nerve system in patients with heart failure and Parkinson's disease. It is also used in the therapeutic applications against certain types of neuroendocrine tumors, as exemplified by the clinically used (123/131)I-MIBG as theranostic single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) agent. With the development of more advanced positron emission tomography (PET) technology, more radiotracers targeting NET have been reported, with superior temporal and spatial resolutions, along with the possibility of functional and kinetic analysis. More recently, fluorine-18-labelled NET tracers have drawn increasing attentions from researchers, due to their longer radiological half-life relative to carbon-11 (110 min vs. 20 min), reduced dependence on on-site cyclotrons, and flexibility in the design of novel tracer structures. In the heart, certain NET tracers provide integral diagnostic information on sympathetic innervation and the nerve status. In the central nervous system, such radiotracers can reveal NET distribution and density in pathological conditions. Most radiotracers targeting cardiac NET-function for the cardiac application consistent of derivatives of either norepinephrine or MIBG with its benzylguanidine core structure, e.g. (11)C-HED and (18)F-LMI1195. In contrast, all NET tracers used in central nervous system applications are derived from clinically used antidepressants. Lastly, possible applications of NET as selective tracers over organic cation transporters (OCTs) in the kidneys and other organs controlled by sympathetic nervous system will also be discussed.

11786,Thinking Outside the Box: A Low-cost and Pragmatic Alternative to Aerosol Boxes for Endotracheal Intubation of COVID-19 Patients,2020-06-08,"BACKGROUND: The relationship between biomarkers and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is understudied, especially in severe cases admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Compared with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), HAP might have different traits regarding biomarkers due to the previous history in hospitals. METHODS: A total of 593 adult patients were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study to determine the neutrophil/lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum lactate level upon admission to the ICU. According to diagnosis, patients were divided into two groups: non-infection and HAP. Discriminant analysis was performed based on better outcomes of diagnostic performance and severity evaluation. The diagnostic performance of each individual biomarker was assessed by constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under each ROC curve (AUROC). Multivariable analysis was also applied to determine the most appropriate prognostic factors. RESULTS: NLCR, PCT and CRP were markedly different between the non-infection and HAP groups. NLCR had a worse ability to discriminate severe infection (AUROC 0.626; 95% CI 0.581–0.671) than conventional markers such as CRP (0.685, 95% CI 0.641–0.730) and PCT (0.661, 95% CI 0.615–0.707). In addition, the AUROC of composite biomarkers, especially the combination of NLCR, CRP and WBC, was significantly greater than that of any single biomarker. CONCLUSIONS: NLCR was not comparable to conventional single biomarkers, such as CRP and PCT, for diagnosing or evaluating the severity of HAP. Composite biomarkers that have good accessibility, especially the combination of NLCR, CRP and WBC, could help with early diagnosis and severity evaluation.","Zheng, Nan; Zhu, Dongmei; Han, Yi",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7289235/,215

12241,Music-based interventions in palliative cancer care: a review of quantitative studies and neurobiological literature,2013-05-30,"Purpose Continuous treatment with FOLFOX therapy is associated with peripheral nerve toxicity, and to improve this inconvenient side effect various methods of administration are being investigated. A regimen of intermittent oxaliplatin administration by continuous infusion therapy, i.e., modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7) + bevacizumab, was designed with the goal of alleviating severe peripheral nerve disorders and hematological toxicity. A phase II clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen. Methods Previously untreated patients were assigned to mFOLFOX7 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2), levofolinate [l-LV] 200 mg/m(2), 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] 2400 mg/m(2)) + bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) administered every 2 weeks for 8 cycles, maintenance without oxaliplatin for 8 cycles, and reintroduction of mFOLFOX7 + bevacizumab for 8 cycles or until disease progression. Progression free survival (PFS) following the first dose (PFS 1) and following reintroduction of oxaliplatin (PFS 2) were used as indices for assessing the efficacy of intermittent administration. Results Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with median age of 64 years (range, 36–74). Median PFS 1 was 11.8 months (95 % confidence interval [CI], 9.5 to 13.7), median time to treatment failure was 10.3 months (95 % CI, 5.6 to 12.1), percentage of patients with neutropenia of grade 3 or higher was 7.8 %, and percentage with peripheral nerve disorders was 3.9 %. Response rate was 50 %, and 84.4 % of patients who started modified simplified LV5FU2 + bevacizumab were reintroduced to oxaliplatin. Conclusion By excluding 5-FU bolus administration and administering bevacizumab continuously the mFOLFOX7 + bevacizumab regimen with preplanned withdrawal of oxaliplatin showed high tolerability and prevented severe peripheral neuropathy and neutropenia without reducing efficacy.","Tezuka, Tohru; Hamada, Chikuma; Ishida, Hideyuki; Ooshiro, Mitsuru; Matsuoka, Hiroshi; Kawasaki, Shingo; Mishima, Hideyuki; Maeda, Kotaro; Sakamoto, Junichi; Koda, Keiji",Invest New Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771374/,215
14338,The Reliability and Compatibility of the Paper and Electronic Versions of the POLLEK Cohort Study Questionnaire,2020-10-29,"Nursing professionals face a high level of stress and burnout due to overloaded responsibilities, which may cause a low level of self-efficacy. From the perspective of nursing professionals, the research aims to understand what are the sources of stress and burnout which would reduce the self-efficacy and the unbalanced patient ratio and how would nursing professionals describe their experiences, sources of stress and burnout, and self-efficacy. Based on the snowball sampling strategy, 60 nursing professionals were invited for qualitative research data collection. Based on the lens of the self-efficacy approach, the results indicated that the environmental factors, including workplace bullying, family stress, misunderstanding of public members, and personal development and career enhancement took important roles in increasing their stress and burnout and in reducing their self-efficacy. The outcomes of this study discovered the social status and discrimination toward nursing professionals. Government leaders, policymakers, and researchers should take this research as an opportunity to reform their policy for human resource management and education for the respectfulness of medical and nursing professionals in the public health system.","Dos Santos, Luis Miguel",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7712145/,215

15142,Evaluating an Oncology Video Curriculum Designed to Promote Asynchronous Subspecialty Learning for Internal Medicine Residents,2021-01-29,"BACKGROUND: Intensive care units (ICU) are essential healthcare facility for life threatening conditions. Bacterial contamination of objects/instruments in ICU is an important source of nosocomial infections. This study is aimed to determine the level of bacterial contamination of instruments/objects which are commonly touched by healthcare workers and frequently come in contact with the neonates. METHODS: This hospital based prospective study was conducted in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. A total of 146 samples collected from surfaces of incubators, radiant warmers, suction tips, ventilators, stethoscopes, door handles, weighing machines, mothers’ beds, phototherapy beds, laryngoscope, telephone sets, blood pressure machine, etc. formed the material of the study. Isolation, identification and antibiotic susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was performed by standard techniques. Blood culture isolates from NICU patients during the study period were compared with the environmental isolates. RESULTS: Out of 146 samples, bacterial growth was observed in 109. A total of 119 bacterial isolates were retrieved from 109 samples. Three common potential pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli (n = 27), Klebsiella species (n = 21) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 18). Majority of E. coli and Klebsiella isolates were from incubators, suction tips and mothers’ beds. Majority of S. aureus isolates were cultured from radiant warmers. Among S. aureus isolates, 33.3% (6/18) were methicillin resistant. Majority of the bacterial isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and amikacin. Common potential pathogens isolated from blood culture of NICU patients were S. aureus and Klebsiella species. CONCLUSION: High degree of bacterial contamination of objects/instruments in NICU was recorded. Isolation of potential pathogens like E. coli, Klebsiella species and S. aureus is a major threat of nosocomial infections. Blood culture data of NICU reflects possibility of nosocomial infections from contaminated sites. Gentamicin and amikacin may be used for empirical therapy in suspected cases of nosocomial infections in NICU.","Bhatta, Dharm Raj; Hosuru Subramanya, Supram; Hamal, Deependra; Shrestha, Rajani; Gauchan, Eva; Basnet, Sahisnuta; Nayak, Niranjan; Gokhale, Shishir",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7847238/,215
16463,The Association of Insomnia with Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND: Rapid-onset paralytic agents are recommended to achieve muscle relaxation and facilitate tracheal intubation during rapid sequence induction in patients at risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. However, opioids are frequently used in this setting. The study’s objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of remifentanil compared to rapid-onset paralytic agents, in association with an hypnotic drug, for tracheal intubation in patients undergoing procedure under general anesthesia and at risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. METHODS: The REMICRUSH (Remifentanil for Rapid Sequence Induction of Anaesthesia) study is a multicenter, single-blinded, non-inferiority randomized controlled trial comparing remifentanil (3 to 4 μg/kg) with rapid-onset paralytic agents (succinylcholine or rocuronium 1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence induction in 1150 adult surgical patients requiring tracheal intubation during general anesthesia. Enrolment started in October 2019 in 15 French anesthesia units. The expected date of the final follow-up is October 2021. The primary outcome is the proportion of successful tracheal intubation without major complications. A non-inferiority margin of 7% was chosen. Analyses of the intent-to-treat and per-protocol populations are planned. DISCUSSION: The REMICRUSH trial protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of The Comité de Protection des Personnes Sud-Ouest et Outre-Mer II and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentations at scientific conferences and publications in peer-reviewed journals. The REMICRUSH trial is the first randomized controlled trial powered to investigate whether remifentanil with hypnotics is non-inferior to rapid-onset paralytic agents with hypnotic in rapid sequence induction of anesthesia for full stomach patients considering successful tracheal intubation without major complication.

We examined the extent to which country- and institution-related status signals drive such differences in scientific recognition. In a preregistered survey experiment, we asked 4,147 scientists from six disciplines (astronomy, cardiology, materials science, political science, psychology and public health) to rate abstracts that varied on two factors: (i) author country (high status vs lower status in science); (ii) author institution (high status vs lower status university). We found only weak evidence of country- or institution-related status bias, and mixed regression models with discipline as random-effect parameter indicated that any plausible bias not detected by our study must be small in size.","Nielsen, Mathias Wullum; Baker, Christine Friis; Brady, Emer; Petersen, Michael Bang; Andersen, Jens Peter",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009675/,215
16895,Inpatient Dermatology Consultations in a General Surgery Ward in a Tertiary Hospital in China: A Retrospective Study of 251 Patients,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Metabolic alkalosis is a frequently occurring problem during continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of switching from high to low bicarbonate (HCO(3)(−)) replacement fluid in alkalotic critically ill patients with acute kidney injury treated by CVVH and RCA. METHODS: A retrospective-comparative study design was applied. Patients who underwent CVVH with RCA in the ICU between 09/2016 and 11/2017 were evaluated. Data were available from the clinical routine. A switch of the replacement fluid Phoxilium(®) (30 mmol/l HCO(3)(−)) to Biphozyl(®) (22 mmol/l HCO(3)(−)) was performed as blood HCO(3)(−) concentration persisted ≥ 26 mmol/l despite adjustments of citrate dose and blood flow. Data were collected from 72 h before the switch of the replacement solutions until 72 h afterwards. RESULTS: Of 153 patients treated with CVVH during that period, 45 patients were switched from Phoxilium(®) to Biphozyl(®). Forty-two patients (42 circuits) were available for statistical analysis. After switching the replacement fluid from Phoxilium(®) to Biphozyl(®) the serum HCO(3)(−) concentration decreased significantly from 27.7 mmol/l (IQR 26.9–28.9) to 25.8 mmol/l (IQR 24.6–27.7) within 24 h (p < 0.001). Base excess (BE) decreased significantly from 4.0 mmol/l (IQR 3.1–5.1) to 1.8 mmol/l (IQR 0.2–3.4) within 24 h (p < 0.001). HCO(3)(−) and BE concentration remained stable from 24 h till the end of observation at 72 h after the replacement fluid change (p = 0.225). pH and PaCO(2) did not change significantly after the switch of the replacement fluid until 72 h. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis suggests that for patients developing refractory metabolic alkalosis during CVVH with RCA the use of Biphozyl(®) reduces external HCO(3)(−) load and sustainably corrects intracorporeal HCO(3)(−) and BE concentrations. Future studies have to prove whether correcting metabolic alkalosis during CVVH with RCA in critically ill patients is of relevance in terms of clinical outcome.

16949,Generalizable brain network markers of major depressive disorder across multiple imaging sites,2020-12-07,"Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by massive intracellular accumulation of cholesterol. In most cases, loss-of-function mutations in the NPC1 gene that encodes lysosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 are responsible for the disease, and more than half of the mutations are considered to interfere with the biogenesis or folding of the protein. We previously identified a series of oxysterol derivatives and phenanthridine-6-one derivatives as pharmacological chaperones, i.e., small molecules that can rescue folding-defective phenotypes of mutated NPC1, opening up an avenue to develop chaperone therapy for Niemann-Pick disease type C. Here, we present an improved image-based screen for NPC1 chaperones and we describe its application for drug-repurposing screening. We identified some azole antifungals, including itraconazole and posaconazole, and a kinase inhibitor, lapatinib, as probable pharmacological chaperones. A photo-crosslinking study confirmed direct binding of itraconazole to a representative folding-defective mutant protein, NPC1-I1061T. Competitive photo-crosslinking experiments suggested that oxysterol-based chaperones and itraconazole share the same or adjacent binding site(s), and the sensitivity of the crosslinking to P691S mutation in the sterol-sensing domain supports the hypothesis that their binding sites are located near this domain. Although the azoles were less effective in reducing cholesterol accumulation than the oxysterol-derived chaperones or an HDAC inhibitor, LBH-589, our findings should offer new starting points for medicinal chemistry efforts to develop better pharmacological chaperones for NPC1.","Shioi, Ryuta; Karaki, Fumika; Yoshioka, Hiromasa; Noguchi-Yachide, Tomomi; Ishikawa, Minoru; Dodo, Kosuke; Hashimoto, Yuichi; Sodeoka, Mikiko; Ohgane, Kenji",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7735562/,215
17471,Assessing standards for prevention of early onset group B streptococcal (GBS) disease in Ireland,2021-05-14,"PURPOSE: Recent work suggests patients with moderately depressed Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score in the Emergency Department (ED) who do not undergo immediate head CT (CTH) have delayed neurosurgical intervention and longer ED stay. The present study objective was to determine the impact of time to first CTH on functional neurologic outcomes in this patient population. METHODS: Blunt trauma patients presenting to our Level I trauma center (11/2015–10/2019) with first ED GCS 9–12 were retrospectively identified and included. Transfers and those with extracranial AIS ≥ 3 were excluded. The study population was stratified into Immediate (≤ 1 h) and Delayed (1–6 h) CTH groups based on time from ED arrival to first CTH. Outcomes included functional outcomes at hospital discharge based on the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). RESULTS: After exclusions, 564 patients were included: 414 (73%) with Immediate CTH and 150 (27%) Delayed CTH. Both groups arrived with median GCS 11 and alcohol/drug intoxication did not differ (p > 0.05). AIS Head/Neck was comparable (3[3–4] vs. 3[3–3], p = 0.349). Time to ED disposition decision and ED exit were significantly shorter after Immediate CTH (2.8[1.5–5.3] vs. 5.2[3.6–7.5]h, p < 0.001 and 5.5[3.3–8.9] vs. 8.1[5.2–11.7]h, p < 0.001). Functional outcomes were slightly worse after Immediate CTH (mRS 2[1–4] vs. 2[1–3], p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis of patients requiring neurosurgical intervention demonstrated a greater proportion of moderately disabled patients with a lower proportion of severely disabled or dead patients after Immediate CTH as compared to Delayed CTH (51 vs. 20%, p = 0.063 and 35 vs. 60%, p = 0.122). CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH shortened time to disposition decision out of the ED and ED exit. Patients requiring neurosurgical intervention after Immediate CTH had improved functional outcomes when compared to those undergoing Delayed CTH. These differences did not reach statistical significance in this single-center study and, therefore, a large, multicenter study is the next step in demonstrating the potential functional outcomes benefit of Immediate CTH after blunt head trauma.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Cowan, Shaun; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Wong, Monica D.; Inaba, Kenji; Demetriades, Demetrios",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8121018/,215

The reuse of medicines within the community pharmacy setting is not permitted in the UK but our multidisciplinary team anticipates that this position will change in the coming years as medication shortages and worries about environmental waste and financial losses from the destruction of unused medicines are brought to the fore. Indeed, for many stakeholders, the issue of waste is a strong feature of conversations about medicines reuse. In addition to this, stakeholders identify the numerous barriers to medicines reuse in the UK. This includes the current uncertainty about the quality of unused medicines returned to pharmacies, which could otherwise be reused. However, stakeholders have also been very willing to propose solutions to a range of existing barriers. Our commentary draws on stakeholder meetings to elaborate the range of views about medicines reuse within a UK context. The challenge is to move forward from these views to advance the technologies that will facilitate medicines reuse practically as well as legally.","Donyai, Parastou; McCrindle, Rachel; Hui, Terence K.

In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the biodiversity of Kidderia (Dall 1876) through molecular and morphological comparisons of Antarctic and Subantarctic taxa. The microbivalves of the genus Kidderia are small brooding organisms that inhabit intertidal and shallow subtidal rocky ecosystems. This genus represents an interesting model to test the vicariance and dispersal hypothesis in the biogeography of the SO. However, the description of Kidderia species relies on a few morphological characters and biogeographic records that raise questions about the true diversity in the group. Here we will define the specimens collected with genetic tools, delimiting their respective boundaries across provinces of the SO, validating the presence of two species of Kidderia. Through the revision of taxonomic issues and species delimitation, it was possible to report that the Antarctic species is Kidderia subquadrata and the species recorded in the Subantarctic islands Diego Ramirez, South Georgia and the Kerguelen Archipelago is Kidderia minuta. The divergence time estimation suggests the origin and diversification of Kidderia lineages are related to historical vicariant processes probably associated with the separation of the continental landmasses close to the late Eocene.

18096,High CPAP vs. NIPPV in preterm neonates — A physiological cross-over study,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers (also known as injuries, pressure sores, decubitus ulcers and bed sores) are localised injuries to the skin or underlying soft tissue, or both, caused by unrelieved pressure, shear or friction. Reactive surfaces that are not made of foam or air cells can be used for preventing pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of non‐foam and non‐air‐filled reactive beds, mattresses or overlays compared with any other support surface on the incidence of pressure ulcers in any population in any setting. SEARCH METHODS: In November 2019, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that allocated participants of any age to non‐foam or non‐air‐filled reactive beds, overlays or mattresses. Comparators were any beds, overlays or mattresses used. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and the certainty of the evidence assessment according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations methodology. If a non‐foam or non‐air‐filled surface was compared with surfaces that were not clearly specified, then the included study was recorded and described but not considered further in any data analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 studies (4653 participants) in this review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 198 participants). The average participant age ranged from 37.2 to 85.4 years (median: 72.5 years). Participants were recruited from a wide range of care settings but were mainly from acute care settings. Almost all studies were conducted in Europe and America. Of the 20 studies, 11 (2826 participants) included surfaces that were not well described and therefore could not be fully classified. We synthesised data for the following 12 comparisons: (1) reactive water surfaces versus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (three studies with 414 participants), (2) reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces (one study with 117 participants), (3) reactive water surfaces versus reactive air surfaces (one study with 37 participants), (4) reactive water surfaces versus reactive fibre surfaces (one study with 87 participants), (5) reactive fibre surfaces versus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces (four studies with 384 participants), (6) reactive fibre surfaces versus foam surfaces (two studies with 228 participants), (7) reactive gel surfaces on operating tables followed by foam surfaces on ward beds versus alternating pressure (active) air surfaces on operating tables and subsequently on ward beds (two studies with 415 participants), (8) reactive gel surfaces versus reactive air surfaces (one study with 74 participants), (9) reactive gel surfaces versus foam surfaces (one study with 135 participants), (10) reactive gel surfaces versus reactive gel surfaces (one study with 113 participants), (11) reactive foam and gel surfaces versus reactive gel surfaces (one study with 166 participants) and (12) reactive foam and gel surfaces versus foam surfaces (one study with 91 participants). Of the 20 studies, 16 (80%) presented findings which were considered to be at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcome: Pressure ulcer incidence We did not find analysable data for two comparisons: reactive water surfaces versus foam surfaces, and reactive water surfaces versus reactive fibre surfaces. Reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds (14/205 (6.8%)) may increase the proportion of people developing a new pressure ulcer compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds (3/210 (1.4%) (risk ratio 4.53, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 15.65; 2 studies, 415 participants; I(2) = 0%; low‐certainty evidence). For all other comparisons, it is uncertain whether there is a difference in the proportion of participants developing new pressure ulcers as all data were of very low certainty. Included studies did not report time to pressure ulcer incidence for any comparison in this review. Secondary outcomes Support‐surface‐associated patient comfort: the included studies provide data on this outcome for one comparison. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient comfort between alternating pressure (active) air surfaces and reactive fibre surfaces (one study with 187 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). All reported adverse events: there is evidence on this outcome for one comparison. It is uncertain if there is a difference in adverse events between reactive gel surfaces followed by foam surfaces and alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds (one study with 198 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). We did not find any health‐related quality of life or cost‐effectiveness evidence for any comparison in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is generally uncertain about the differences between non‐foam and non‐air‐filled reactive surfaces and other surfaces in terms of pressure ulcer incidence, patient comfort, adverse effects, health‐related quality of life and cost‐effectiveness. Reactive gel surfaces used on operating tables followed by foam surfaces applied on hospital beds may increase the risk of having new pressure ulcers compared with alternating pressure (active) air surfaces applied on both operating tables and hospital beds. Future research in this area should consider evaluation of the most important support surfaces from the perspective of decision‐makers. Time‐to‐event outcomes, careful assessment of adverse events and trial‐level cost‐effectiveness evaluation should be considered in future studies. Trials should be designed to minimise the risk of detection bias; for example, by using digital photography and adjudicators of the photographs being blinded to group allocation. Further review using network meta‐analysis will add to the findings reported here.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Rhodes, Sarah; McInnes, Elizabeth",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8179967/,215
18245,Use of H-1 Antihistamine in Dermatology: More than Itch and Urticaria Control: A Systematic Review,2021-04-12,"INTRODUCTION: This study will evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of a new intervention programme called teach-test-link-trace (TTLT) model in Tigrai, Ethiopia, where peer educators counsel about HIV (teach), perform house-to-house HIV testing (test) through pinprick HIV testing (H2H) or OraQuick HIV self-testing (HIVST), link HIV-positive patients to HIV care (link) and trace lost patients house-to-house (trace). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The four-arm cluster randomised trial will be conducted in five phases: Phase 1 will assess the acceptability of the TTLT model using a cross-sectional survey among adults aged 18 years irrespective of HIV status in 6909 households from 40 villages (kebeles). Phase 2 will assess effectiveness of the TTLT model through comparing intervention and control groups among HIV negative or unknown HIV status. The intervention groups will receive one of the three home-based interventions provided by peer educators: (1) demonstrate and distribute OraQuick HIV self-testing kits (HIVST), (2) perform pinprick HIV testing (H2H) and (3) offer a choice to either receive HIVST or H2H. The control group will receive the standard care in which nurses counsel and refer eligible household members to nearby health facilities to access existing HIV testing services. The primary outcomes of the interventions are proportion of individuals who know of their HIV status (first 90), link to HIV care and treatment (second 90) and meet virological suppression (third 90). We will perform process evaluation through qualitative interviews in phase 3, economic evaluation for cost-effectiveness analysis in phase 4 and a sustainability exit strategy using nominal group technique in phase 5. We will apply descriptive and inferential statistics for quantitative studies, and thematic framework analysis for qualitative studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was obtained from the Southern Adelaide Clinical Health Research Ethics Committee (SAC HREC), South Australia, and findings will be disseminated through publications, conference presentations, media release and policy briefs.

18308,Cost of community-led larval source management and house improvement for malaria control: a cost analysis within a cluster-randomized trial in a rural district in Malawi,2021-06-13,"BACKGROUND: There remains no effective intervention capable of reversing most cases of dementia. Current research is focused on prevention by addressing risk factors that are shared between cardiovascular disease and dementia (e.g., hypertension) before the cognitive, functional, and behavioural symptoms of dementia manifest. A promising preventive treatment is exercise. This study describes the methods of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that assesses the effects of aerobic exercise and behavioural support interventions in older adults at increased risk of dementia due to genetic and/or cardiovascular risk factors. The specific aims are to determine the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance, explore the biological mechanisms that influence cognitive performance after exercise training, and determine if changes in cerebrovascular physiology and function persist 1 year after a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention followed by a 1-year behavioural support programme (at 18 months). METHODS: We will recruit 264 participants (aged 50–80 years) at elevated risk of dementia. Participants will be randomly allocated into one of four treatment arms: (1) aerobic exercise and health behaviour support, (2) aerobic exercise and no health behaviour support, (3) stretching-toning and health behaviour support, and (4) stretching-toning and no health behaviour support. The aerobic exercise intervention will consist of three supervised walking/jogging sessions per week for 6 months, whereas the stretching-toning control intervention will consist of three supervised stretching-toning sessions per week also for 6 months. Following the exercise interventions, participants will receive either 1 year of ongoing telephone behavioural support or no telephone support. The primary aim is to determine the independent effect of aerobic exercise on a cognitive composite score in participants allocated to this intervention compared to participants allocated to the stretching-toning group. The secondary aims are to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on a number of secondary outcomes and determine whether aerobic exercise-related changes persist after a 1-year behavioural support programme (at 18 months). DISCUSSION: This study will address knowledge gaps regarding the underlying mechanisms of the pro-cognitive effects of exercise by examining the potential mediating factors, including cerebrovascular/physiological, neuroimaging, sleep, and genetic factors that will provide novel biologic evidence on how aerobic exercise can prevent declines in cognition with ageing.

Envelope proteins are the outermost proteins in the structure of flaviviruses and mediate viral infection. Studies indicate that flaviviruses mainly use envelope proteins to bind to cell attachment receptors and endocytic receptors for the entry step. Here, we present current findings regarding key envelope protein amino acids that participate in the flavivirus early infection process. Among these sites, most are located in special positions of the protein structure, such as the α-helix in the stem region and the hinge region between domains I and II, motifs that potentially affect the interaction between different domains. Some of these sites are located in positions involved in conformational changes in envelope proteins. In summary, we summarize and discuss the key envelope protein residues that affect the entry process of flaviviruses, including the process of their discovery and the mechanisms that affect early infection.","Hu, Tao; Wu, Zhen; Wu, Shaoxiong; Chen, Shun; Cheng, Anchun",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8254458/,215

20087,Data extraction methods for systematic review (semi)automation: A living systematic review,2021-05-19,"BACKGROUND: CRF55_01B is a newly identified HIV-1 circulating recombinant form originated from MSM in China. However, its impact on the disease progression and transmission risk has not been investigated. This study aimed to determine the impact of CRF55_01B infection on viral dynamics and immunological status so as to provide scientific evidence for further control and prevention effort on CRF55_01B. Linear mixed effect models were applied to evaluate CD4 cell count decline and viral load increase by subtype. RESULTS: Of the 3418 blood samples, 1446 (42.3%) were CRF07_BC, 1169 (34.2%) CRF01_AE, 467 (13.7%) CRF55_01B, 249 (7.3%) type B, and 87 (2.5%) other subtypes (CRF_08BC, CRF_01B, C). CRF55_01B had become the third predominant strain since 2012 in Shenzhen, China. CRF55_01B-infected MSM showed lower median of CD4 count than CRF07_BC-infected MSM (349.5 [IQR, 250.2–474.8] vs. 370.0 [IQR, 278.0–501.0], P < 0.05). CRF55_01B infection was associated with slower loss of CD4 count than CRF01_AE (13.6 vs. 23.3 [cells/µl]¹/²/year, P < 0.05)among MSM with initial CD4 count of 200–350 cells/µl. On the other hand, those infected with CRF55_01B showed higher median plasma HIV RNA load (5.4 [IQR, 5.0–5.9]) than both CRF01_AE (5.3 [IQR, 4.8–5.7], P < 0.05) and CRF07_BC (5.0 log10 [IQR, 4.5–5.5], P < 0.001) at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, the annual increasing rate of viral load for CRF55_01B infection was significantly higher than that of CRF07_BC (2.0 vs. 0.7 log10 copies/ml/year, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively lower CD4 count and faster increase of plasma HIV RNA load of CRF55_01B-infected MSM without antiretroviral therapy suggest that CRF55_01B may lead to longer asymptomatic phase and higher risk of HIV transmission. Strengthened surveillance, tailored prevention strategies and interventions, and in-depth research focusing on CRF55_01B are urgently needed to forestall potential epidemic.

20221,A step-by-step guide to creating an academic surgery interest group: Review article,2021-08-05,"BACKGROUND: Personal health record (PHR) technology can be used to support workplace health promotion, and prevent social and economic losses related to workers’ health management. PHR services can not only ensure interoperability, security, privacy, and data quality, but also consider the user’s perspective in their design. OBJECTIVE: Using Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) and national health care data sets, this study aimed to design and develop an app for providing worker-centered, interconnected PHR services. METHODS: This study considered the user’s perspective, using the human-centered design (HCD) methodology, to develop a PHR app suitable for occupational health. We developed a prototype after analyzing quantitative and qualitative data collected from workers and a health care professional group, after which we performed a usability evaluation. We structured workers’ PHR items based on the analyzed data, and ensured structural and semantic interoperability using FHIR, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine–Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT), and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). This study integrated workers’ health information scattered across different Korean institutions through an interface method, and workers’ PHRs were managed through a cloud server, using Azure API for FHIR. RESULTS: In total, 562 workers from industrial parks participated in the quantitative study. The preferred data items for PHR were medication, number of steps walked, diet, blood pressure, weight, and blood glucose. The preferred features were ability to access medical checkup results, health information content provision, consultation record inquiry, and teleconsultation. The worker-centered PHR app collected data on, among others, life logs, vital signs, and medical checkup results; offered health care services such as reservation and teleconsultation; and provided occupational safety and health information through material safety data sheet search and health questionnaires. The app reflected improvements in user convenience and app usability proposed by 19 participants (7 health care professionals and 12 end users) in the usability evaluation. The After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ) was evaluated with a mean score of 5.90 (SD 0.34) out of 7, and the System Usability Scale (SUS) was evaluated a mean score of 88.7 (SD 4.83) out of 100. CONCLUSIONS: The worker-centered PHR app integrates workers’ health information from different institutions and provides a variety of health care services from linked institutions through workers’ shared PHR. This app is expected to increase workers’ autonomy over their health information and support medical personnel’s decision making regarding workers’ health in the workplace. Particularly, the app will provide solutions for current major PHR challenges, and its design, which considers the user’s perspective, satisfies the prerequisites for its utilization in occupational health.","Park, Hyun Sang; Kim, Kwang Il; Chung, Ho-Young; Jeong, Sungmoon; Soh, Jae Young; Hyun, Young Ho; Kim, Hwa Sun",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8374662/,215
21514,Plasma lipids and growth faltering: A longitudinal cohort study in rural Gambian children,2021-09-17,"MicroRNAs (miRs) and inflammatory cytokines can induce acute lung injury (ALI), which can develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe cases. Previous research has revealed that miR-122-5p participates in the development of ALI, and that its expression is positively associated with ALI. However, the mechanism by which miR-122-5p contributes to ALI remains to be determined. In the current study, TargetScan and dual luciferase reporter gene assays were used to confirm that IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN) was a target of miR-122-5p. Subsequently, by referring to previous literature, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI cell model was established. A549 cells were transfected with mimic control or miR-122-5p mimics for 24 h, and 10 µg LPS was used to treat the transfected cells for 12 h. The results revealed that miR-122-5p mimics decreased cell viability and promoted apoptosis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays indicated that miR-122-5p mimics increased LDH release. ELISA demonstrated that miR-122-5p mimics promoted TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 expression levels. A549 cells were transfected with inhibitor control, miR-122-5p inhibitor, miR-122-5p inhibitor + control-small interfering (si)RNA or miR-122-5p inhibitor + IL1RN-siRNA for 24 h, after which the cells were treated with 10 µg LPS for 12 h. The results revealed that the effects of the miR-122-5p inhibitor were the opposite of those of the miR-122-5p mimic. All the effects of miR-122-5p inhibitor on LPS-treated A549 cells were significantly reversed by IL1RN-siRNA. Overall, the results highlighted miR-122-5p as a potential novel target for the treatment of ALI.","Li, Jie; Zeng, Xiaoxia; Wang, Weiqing",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8456493/,215

Broad-scale investigations of soil yeasts pose a methodological challenge as metagenomics are of limited use for identifying this group of fungi. Here we characterize global soil yeast diversity using fungal DNA barcoding on 1473 yeasts cultured from 3826 soil samples obtained from nine countries in six continents. We identify mean annual precipitation and international air travel as two significant correlates with soil yeast community structure and composition worldwide. Evidence for anthropogenic influences on soil yeast communities, directly via travel and indirectly via altered rainfall patterns resulting from climate change, is concerning as we found common infectious yeasts frequently distributed in soil in several countries. Our discovery of 41 putative novel species highlights the continued need for culture-based studies to advance our knowledge of environmental yeast diversity.","Samarasinghe, Himeshi; Lu, Yi; Aljohani, Renad; Al-Amad, Ahmad; Yoell, Heather; Xu, Jianping",iScience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8479693/,215

A high index of suspicion with early diagnosis and institution of appropriate therapy significantly impacts on the morbidity and mortality of invasive fungal infections (IFIs). METHODS: we conducted a cross-sectional multicentre survey across 7 tertiary hospitals in 5 geopolitical zones of Nigeria between June 2013 and March 2015. Knowledge, awareness and practice of Nigerian resident doctors about the diagnosis and management of invasive fungal infections were evaluated using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire. Assessment was categorized as poor, fair and good. RESULTS: 834(79.7%) of the 1046 participants had some knowledge of IFIs, 338(32.3%) from undergraduate medical training and 191(18.3%) during post-graduate (specialty) residency training. Number of years spent in clinical practice was positively related to knowledge of management of IFIs, which was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Only 2 (0.002%) out of the 1046 respondents had a good level of awareness of IFIs. Only 4(0.4%) of respondents had seen > 10 cases of IFIs; while 10(1%) had seen between 5-10 cases, 180(17.2%) less than 5 cases and the rest had never seen or managed any cases of IFIs. There were statistically significant differences in knowledge about IFIs among the various cadres of doctors (p < 0.001) as level of knowledge increased with rank/seniority. CONCLUSION: knowledge gaps exist that could militate against optimal management of IFIs in Nigeria.

Introduction: Ecocriticism, Climate Change, and COVID-19; 2. Anthropocene Ecocriticism; 3. Affective Ecocriticism; 4. Postcolonial Ecocriticism; 5. Zoocriticism and Phytocriticism; 6. Ecocriticism and Ecomedia Studies; 7. Conclusion. The review focuses on six monographs, one edited book, and two journal issues. Ecocriticism publications in 2019 reflect an imperative to devise new means of signification in response to planetary concerns. The biospheric urgencies of the Anthropocene and its catastrophic imprint of climate change continue to draw ecocritical attention to issues of time, scale, embodiment, and affect. Attuned to the Anthropocene context, 2019 publications demonstrate sustained attention to posthumanist thinking, including more-than-human ontologies. More specifically, the year brought valuable additions to postcolonial ecocriticism, affective ecocriticism, and zoocriticism as well as strides in the theorization of ecophobia. New directions in phytocriticism, hydrocriticism, and sumbiocriticism (an ecocritical mode attentive to the manner in which a text engages ideas of symbiosis) evince the field’s ongoing diversification within the environmental humanities ambit. 2019 saw significant developments in ecopoetic studies as well as highly generative confluences between ecocriticism and ecomedia studies, two complementary fields regarded historically as separate domains. The extension of ecocritical methods to the literatures of Turkey, Pakistan, Cuba, and other non-anglophone contexts signifies the continuous evolution of the field beyond its provenance in British and American studies of nature writing.","Ryan, John Charles",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7665768/,215

When healthcare resources were being diverted to only the most critical of needs, emergent surgical and burn care remained essential. Currently, no data exist on the impact of a global pandemic on a burn center. Our aim for this study was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected admissions, hospital course, and discharges at a major metropolitan burn center. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of admissions to our burn center. Our institution’s medical record was reviewed from 1/1–8/31 for years 2020, 2019, & 2018. We included all thermal, chemical, and electrical burn inpatient admissions over these time periods. Non-burn wound admissions and vulnerable patient populations were excluded. Our population included 1,358 patients. These patients were grouped by year 2020 (n=425), 2019 (n=470), and 2018 (n=463). The medical record was queried for admission, hospital course, and discharge variables. SAS 9.4 statistical software was used to compare the pre-pandemic 2018/2019 groups against the 2020 group. Group means were compared using two-sample two-tailed t-tests, and categorical variables were compared using Chi-Square analysis. RESULTS: In 2020 the burn center had 425 admissions compared to 470 and 463 in 2019 and 2018 respectively. On admission, there were no differences in age, gender, pediatric admissions, burn etiology, total body surface area (TBSA), TBSA >20%, work-related injuries, or suspected abuse related injuries. Of note, the mean days from injury to admission for the groups were (2020 2.5±4.9 vs 2019 1.4±4.3, p=0.001, vs 2018 1.5±4.3, p=0.0017). Groups were similar in respect to burns requiring surgery and mean OR visits. 2019 and 2018 had increased ICU admissions compared to the 2020 cohort (ICU: 2020 60-(14%) vs 2019 91-(19.4%), p=0.041, vs 2018 108-(23.3%), p=0.033). Inpatient mortality was lower in the 2020 cohort compared to the pre-pandemic cohorts (2020 2 (0.6%) vs 2019 9 (2.5%), p=0.04, vs 2018 14 (4.2%) p=0.0017). CONCLUSIONS: Volume at our burn center remains high during the pandemic. There is an increased lag time from burn injury to hospital admission in the 2020 cohort. We hypothesize this is due to patients’ avoiding the hospital due to fear of contracting COVID-19. TBSA is similar across groups, but ICU admissions are down in the 2020 cohort. Further work is needed to understand whether the increased lag time has affected outcomes and whether the decreased ICU admissions are due to yearly variation or the pandemic.","Codner, Jesse A; Mittal, Rohit; De Ayala, Rafael",J Burn Care Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083618/,215

While there is emerging evidence of adaptability mitigating burnout amongst pharmacists in other countries (1), what has yet to be established is the extent to which the well-being and resilience of pharmacists in the UK may be supported through changes in intra and inter-professional working practices. AIM: As part of a wider project aiming to explore the impact of COVID-19 on pharmacists’ wellbeing and resilience, in this abstract we present findings exploring the impact on working relationships within pharmacy and multidisciplinary teams. METHODS: An online questionnaire containing validated measures of wellbeing and resilience and free-text open questions exploring the impact of COVID-19 on working practices was piloted on five practising pharmacists. This questionnaire was subsequently distributed via social media and professional networks in June 2020. Convenience sampling was used whereby any UK-registered pharmacist in a patient-facing role was eligible to take part. Inductive thematic analysis of the free text responses was conducted. This abstract presents one key theme; intra and inter-professional relationships. RESULTS: A total of 202 questionnaires were completed (Table 1), with 192 participants entering free-text responses. Participants reported pharmacy teams becoming closer, supporting one another and working more cohesively. Work redesign and staff upskilling were given as positive examples of practice change in response to the pandemic. Reported challenges included managing conflict within a team due to heightened stress, sustaining staff morale, exhaustion, and prioritising others to the detriment of their own wellbeing: “I have no time for myself as I'm too busy keeping the day to day working and supporting my team emotionally. I'm emotionally exhausted and at home I withdraw and ignore the outside world as I'm at breaking point but don’t want my colleagues to see this.” Inter-professional relationships sometimes improved as a result of more effective communication, extended networking and pharmacists feeling valued and recognised as integral to multidisciplinary working. Supportive inter-professional working was described as a “Great sense of comradery - we're in this together”. Yet for others, inter-professional working proved challenging, with non-engagement of clinicians, frequently changing guidance from senior management, and restricted staff interaction due to remote or shift working. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst for some the pandemic facilitated improved inter- and intra- professional interactions, for others this was viewed as challenges of daily practice. Due to recruiting via social media, this study is limited by the response numbers and is therefore not representative of all UK registered pharmacists. However, a key strength is that pharmacists from all sectors of practice responded, in comparison to other studies which have focused solely on community pharmacists. Results from this study can be used to support sustainable change in fostering collaborative working within pharmacy and multi-professional healthcare teams. REFERENCES: 1. Austin, Z., & Gregory, P.

The dental team has a high risk of infection as a result of the specificity of their procedures. The aim of this questionnaire was to estimate the preventive measures and the awareness methods that may be adopted by the dentists to prevent or reduce the transmission of COIVD-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The questionnaire was an electronic survey contained 23 questions, which were designed based on the instruction given for dental setting by CDC during COVID-19 pandemic; the respondents in this study were dental practitioners in Syria. RESULTS: A total of 1013 dentists have responded to this survey 61% of the participants treated only the emergent treatment, 84% of them wear facial masks, while the prevalence for other protective equipment was low. The majority of the participants schedule the appointments as there is only one patient in the waiting room. More than half of the dentists sterilize the patients’ hands before and after the dental treatment, and 59% of them choose 70% ethyl alcohol as a disinfectant. Most of the respondents use dental mouthwashes before the initiation of the treatment. Almost three-quarters of the dentists use high vacuum. Only 15% of dentists sterilize the dental handpieces in the autoclaves after each patient. Most of dentists educate their patients about preventive methods. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the Syrian dentists should take more strict measures during dental practice.","Shihabi, Safaa; Nesser, Salma Al; Hamadah, Omar",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219013/,215

The microelectronics and communication mediums also enhance their reachability of coverage and connectivity. 5G enhances the capacity of the network in terms of lowest communication latency, highest speed, enhanced throughput, minimum E2E delay, and minimizing the packet loss. In this paper, we discuss the working principle and key features of 5G communication technology along with the limitations of existing technologies. Further, we provide the taxonomy of the 5G network. Moreover, we provide a comparison of 5G and 4G LTE in terms of data privacy and security aspects. Further, we propose a four-layer architecture for ehealthcare system, which uses 5G NR (New Radio) architecture incorporating the control plane and user plane. We perform the simulation over the frequency range1 and frequency range2 and calculated the throughput and latency for distinct values of OFDM numerologies. Further, we provide a comparative analysis for 4G and 5G and deduce that 5G facilitates 10 times lower latency than 4G, and 5G can accommodate a much higher number of devices than 4G. In this work, we discuss providing better healthcare facilities electronically using 5G NR. Moreover, the data sharing and diagnosing the disease become faster and easier by using 5G NR.","Mishra, Lalita; Vikash; Varma, Shirshu",Wirel Pers Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8264963/,215

Oxygen is a critical regulator of cellular metabolism. However, during immune responses T cells must function in oxygen-deficient, or hypoxic, environments. Here, we used high resolution mass spectrometry to investigate how the proteome of primary murine CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is reconfigured in response to hypoxia in vitro. We identified and quantified over 7,600 proteins and discovered that hypoxia increased the abundance of a selected number of proteins in CTLs. This included glucose transporters, metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, cytolytic effector molecules, checkpoint receptors and adhesion molecules. While some of these proteins may augment the effector functions of CTLs, others may limit their cytotoxicity. Moreover, we determined that hypoxia could inhibit IL-2-induced proliferation cues and antigen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in CTLs. These data provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the magnitude of the CTL response to hypoxia and emphasise the importance of oxygen-sensing pathways for controlling CD8(+) T cells. Additionally, this study provides new understanding about how hypoxia may promote the effector function of CTLs, while contributing to their dysfunction in some contexts.","Ross, Sarah H.; Rollings, Christina M.; Cantrell, Doreen A.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8484760/,215

This paper studies a dynamic game model that describes the social distancing behaviors during an epidemic, assuming a continuum of players and individual infection dynamics. The evolution of the players’ infection states follows a variant of the well-known SIR dynamics. We assume that the players are not sure about their infection state, and thus, they choose their actions based on their individually perceived probabilities of being susceptible, infected, or removed. The cost of each player depends both on her infection state and on the contact with others. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium and characterize Nash equilibria using nonlinear complementarity problems. We then exploit some monotonicity properties of the optimal policies to obtain a reduced-order characterization for Nash equilibrium and reduce its computation to the solution of a low-dimensional optimization problem. It turns out that, even in the symmetric case, where all the players have the same parameters, players may have very different behaviors. We finally present some numerical studies that illustrate this interesting phenomenon and investigate the effects of several parameters, including the players’ vulnerability, the time horizon, and the maximum allowed actions, on the optimal policies and the players’ costs.","Kordonis, Ioannis; Lagos, Athanasios-Rafail; Papavassilopoulos, George P.",Dyn Games Appl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503885/,215

This review assessed published evidence on the effects of food environment interventions on anthropometric (BMI and weight status) outcomes in school-aged children (5-9 y) and adolescents (10-19 y) (SACA) in LMICs. We summarized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies (QES) published since 2000 to August 2019 in the peer-reviewed and gray literature that assessed the effects of food-related behavioral and environmental interventions on diet-related health outcomes in SACA in LMICs. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library) were searched using appropriate keywords, Medical Subject Headings, and free text terms. Eleven RCTs and 6 QES met the inclusion criteria, testing multicomponent behavioral and environmental interventions in schools. Analysis of 6 RCTs (n = 17,054) suggested an overall effect on change in BMI [mean difference (MD): -0.11, 95% CI: -0.19 , -0.03], whereas there was no observed effect in 5 studies using endline BMI (n = 17,371) (MD: 0.05, 95% CI: -0.32, 0.21). There was no significant pooled effect among the 3 QES (n = 5,023) that reported differences in change in BMI or endline (MD: -0.37, 95% CI: -0.95, 0.22). There is limited evidence to support the modification of diet-related health outcomes through school-based food environment interventions in SACA in LMICs. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of school and community-based food environment interventions on nutritional status in this population.","Carducci, Bianca; Oh, Christina; Keats, Emily C; Roth, Daniel E; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Current developments in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzaa098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32666031/,215

While spatial heterogeneity plays an important role in environmental regulation in China, it is necessary to analyze the spatial heterogeneity influences of air pollution control policies and informal environmental regulation on air pollutant emissions in China. Based on the quantification of air pollution control policies, this paper incorporates the central government's policy formulation and local government's policy implementation into the intensity of air pollution control policy. This paper uses the panel data of China's 30 provinces to examine the spatial impact of air pollution control policy and informal environmental regulation on air pollutant emissions. The results show that (a) air pollutant emissions represented by soot and dust emission intensity has a significant positive spatial spillover effect; (b) air pollution control policy and informal environmental regulation play significant inhibitory roles in air pollutant emissions; (c) informal environmental regulation has a negative moderating effect on the negative relationship between air pollution control policy and air pollutant emissions.

We provide new analyses to estimate the likelihood of reaching or remaining in a phenotype under dynamic, physiologically likely perturbations of stimuli (""phenotype stability""). We show that higher stability values of the motile phenotype (Go) are associated with reduced patient survival. Moreover, induced motile states are capable of driving GBM recurrence. We found that the Dormancy and Go phenotypes are equally represented in advanced GBM samples, with natural transitioning between the two. Furthermore, Go and Grow phenotype transitions are mostly driven by tumor-brain stimuli. These are difficult to regulate directly, but could be modulated by reprogramming tumor-associated cell types. Our framework provides a foundation for designing targeted perturbations of the tumor-brain environment, by assessing their impact on GBM phenotypic plasticity, and is corroborated by analyses of patient data.","Rajapakse, Vinodh N; Herrada, Sylvia; Lavi, Orit",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz4125; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832595/,215

To date, there are no effective treatments for progressive deficits or disease-modifying therapy for those patients. We report encouraging results for spastic paraparesis after spinal cord stimulation. METHODS A 51-year-old woman suffering from progressive weakness and spasticity in lower limbs related to hereditary spastic paraplegia type 4 underwent spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and experienced also significant improvement in motor function. Maximum ballistic voluntary isometric contraction test, continuous passive motion test and gait analysis using a motion-capture system were performed in ON and OFF SCS conditions. Neurophysiologic assessment consisted of obtaining motor evoked potentials in both conditions. RESULTS Presurgical Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale (SPRS) score was 26. One month after effective SCS was initiated, SPRS went down to 15. At 12 months follow up, she experienced substantial improvement in motor function and in gait performance, with SPRS scores 23 (OFF) and down to 20 (ON). There was an increased isometric muscle strength (knee extension, OFF: 41 N m; ON: 71 N m), lower knee extension and flexion torque values in continuous passive motion test (decrease in spastic tone) and improvement in gait (for example, step length increase).

Decreased mortality and improved quality of life have been reported in patients undergoing treatment with these agents. Increased risk of bacterial, viral, granulomatous, and opportunistic infections also has been associated with the use of these medications. Enhanced patient education, watchful monitoring to promote early detection of infections, discontinuation of the medication when clinical symptoms are identified, and immediate availability of supportive care are advised to balance the benefit of treatment with biologic agents against the potential risk of infection. Herein, we discuss the risk of infection and the monitoring and vaccination guidelines in patients having psoriasis treated with biologic agents. OBSERVATIONS A woman with obesity and psoriasis that had previously been successfully treated with efalizumab (Raptiva) for 3 years was started on a regimen of infliximab (Remicade) to treat a flare. She died 1 week after her first infusion of infliximab and was found to have had influenza A(H1N1).

METHODS The relationship between CrSO2/PrSO2 and cardiac index (CI), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in patients experiencing cardiogenic shock and those undergoing venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was retrospectively analyzed; in patients on ECMO, total circulatory index (TCI) was calculated from the sum of CI and extracorporeal blood flow index. RESULTS In patients experiencing cardiogenic shock (n=10), significant correlations between PrSO2 values and CI (Spearman r=0.81; P<.0001), SVRI (r=-0.45; P<.0001), and MAP (r=0.58; P<.0001) were found. Significant correlations between CrSO2 and CI (r=0.55; P<.0001) and SVRI (r=-0.47; P<.0001), but not MAP, were observed. Linear regression analysis revealed that CI could be calculated using the following equation: CI=PrSO2/24.0. In patients on VA ECMO (n=12), significant correlations were found between PrSO2 and TCI (r=0.68; P<.0001), SVRI (r=-0.47; P<.0001), and MAP (r=0.27; P=.025). Significant correlations were also found between CrSO2 and TCI (r=0.68; P<.0001) and SVRI (r=-0.51; P<.0001), but not MAP.

68164,A sequential compression mechanical pump to prevent hypotension during elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia.,2012,"BACKGROUND Adolescent nonmedical prescription opioid use is associated with overdose and other adverse outcomes, but its risk factors are poorly understood. METHODS Data were drawn from a prospective cohort study of Los Angeles, California, high school students. At baseline (mean age = 14.6 years), students completed self-report screening measures of problem alcohol, cannabis, and drug use and 6 mental health problems (major depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and hypomania or mania). Past 6-month nonmedical prescription opioid use (yes or no) was assessed across 7 semiannual follow-ups. RESULTS Among baseline never users of nonmedical prescription opioids (N = 3204), average past 6-month prevalence of new nonmedical prescription opioid use across the 42-month follow-up was 4.4% (range 3.5%-6.1%). In a multivariable model co-adjusting for 9 baseline behavioral problems and other factors, major depression, hypomania or mania, cannabis, alcohol, and other drug use problems were associated with increased odds of nonmedical prescription opioid use over follow-ups. Cumulative indices of behavioral health comorbidity showed successively greater odds of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use for students with 1 (odds ratio [OR]: 3.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.79-5.01), 2 (OR: 8.79; 95% CI: 5.95-12.99), or 3 (OR: 9.69; 95% CI: 5.63-16.68) vs 0 baseline substance use problems, and similar increases were associated with increasing number of mental health problems (1 [OR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03-2.88] to all 6 [OR: 3.98; 95% CI: 1.09-14.82] vs 0). CONCLUSIONS Behavioral health problems may be associated with increased risk of subsequent nonmedical prescription opioid use during mid to late adolescence, with successively greater risk for those with greater behavioral health comorbidity. In pediatric clinical practice or school-based prevention, behavioral health screeners may be useful for identifying youth at high risk for nonmedical prescription opioid use.","Cho, Junhan; Kelley-Quon, Lorraine I; Barrington-Trimis, Jessica L; Kechter, Afton; Axeen, Sarah; Leventhal, Adam M",Pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-051451; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34400572/,215

68713,Is the rehabilitation ready for COVID-19 patients' care?,2020-05-14,"Obesity is considered a serious chronic disease, associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1-induced protein-1 (MCPIP1) is an RNase decreasing stability of transcripts coding for inflammation-related proteins. In addition, MCPIP1 plays an important role in the regulation of adipogenesis in vitro by reducing the expression of key transcription factors, including C/EBPβ. To elucidate the role of MCPIP1 in adipocyte biology, we performed RNA-Seq and proteome analysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes overexpressing wild-type (WTMCPIP1) and the mutant form of MCPIP1 protein (D141NMCPIP1). Our RNA-Seq analysis followed by confirmatory Q-RT-PCR revealed that elevated MCPIP1 levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes upregulated transcripts encoding proteins involved in signal transmission and cellular remodeling and downregulated transcripts of factors involved in metabolism. These data are consistent with our proteomic analysis, which showed that MCPIP1 expressing adipocytes exhibit upregulation of proteins involved in cellular organization and movement and decreased levels of proteins involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Moreover, MCPIP1 adipocytes are characterized by decreased level of insulin receptor, reduced insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation, as well as depleted Glut4 level and impaired glucose uptake. Overexpression of Glut4 in 3T3-L1 cells expressed WTMCPIP1 rescued adipogenesis. Interestingly, we found decreased level of MCPIP1 along with an increase in body mass index in subcutaneous adipose tissue.

70110,"Invest in Rural North Carolina to Ensure a Thriving State, Pandemic or Not.",2021,"INTRODUCTION Urethral injury is an uncommon surgical complication of penile prosthesis (PP) surgery. Conventional dogma requires abortion of the procedure if the adjacent corporal body is involved or delayed implantation to avert device infection associated with urinary extravasation. Besides the setback of the aborted surgery, this management approach also presents the possible difficulty of encountering corporal fibrosis at the time of reoperation. AIM We report an approach using primary urethral repair and temporary suprapubic cystostomy for the management of incidental urethral injuries in a cohort of patients allowing for successful completion of unaborted PP implantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients receiving PPs from 1990 to 2014 in which incidental urethral injuries were repaired and PP implantation was completed with suprapubic cystostomy (suprapubic tube [SPT] insertion). After allowing for urethral healing and urinary diversion via SPT for 4-8 weeks, the PP was activated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Successful management was determined by the absence of perioperative complications within 6 months of implantation. RESULTS We identified four cases, all receiving inflatable PPs, managed with temporary suprapubic cystostomy. These patients sustained urethral injuries during corporal dissection (one patient), corporal dilation (one patient), and penile straightening (two patients). All patients were managed safely and successfully. CONCLUSION Primary urethral repair followed by temporary suprapubic cystostomy offers a surgical approach to complete PP implantation successfully in patients who sustain urethral injury complications, particularly for complex PP surgeries.

70406,Mapping the prevalence and nature of drug related problems among hospitalised children in the United Kingdom: a systematic review.,2019-12-11,"BACKGROUND The prognostic value of positive surgical margins after transoral laser microsurgery (TOLM) is still under debate. In case of positive superficial margins, some experts recommend a second-look surgery (SL) and some recommend wait and watch approach with close observation. Narrow band imaging (NBI) is an advanced imaging system used to enhance visualization of mucosal vascular pattern. In laryngology, NBI is used to improve the detection of premalignant, dysplastic and malignant lesions. AIM To assess the usefulness of NBI imaging in guiding clinical decision making regarding follow-up plan and SL after TOLM. MATERIALS AND METHODS A prospective cohort of 127 patients was divided into three groups based on the histology results and NBI vascular pattern of the mucosa. Group A (24/127, 18.90%) consisted of patients with suspicious vascular pattern in NBI or/and with positive deep margin. Group B (52/127, 40.94%) consisted of patients with positive or uncertain superficial margins and non-suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. Group C (51/127, 40.15%) had non-suspicious vascular NBI pattern and all negative margins. RESULTS After the first TOLM procedure, 9/24 (37.5%) patients had positive deep margins, 1/24 (4.2%) had uncertain deep margin and 1/24 patient (4.2%) had both positive deep margin and suspicious vascular pattern in NBI. The remaining 13 cases in Group A had a suspicious NBI finding only during the first follow-up. All of the 24 patients (Group A) underwent a second look surgery. The final histology after SL showed squamous cell carcinoma in 10/24 (41.7%) patients. All 10 patients had suspicious vascular pattern in NBI and one patient had both a positive deep margins after the first TOLM and positive NBI finding. None of Group B and C subjects developed an early recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Our study provides evidence that NBI imaging will be a useful adjunct to margin status after TOLM and will facilitate clinical decision-making regarding performing the SL in patients with positive or uncertain superficial surgical margins in the first TOLM procedure. However, additional investigation with more subjects is required at this time to further validate this technique and change the standard of care.","Witkiewicz, Joanna; Klimza, Hanna; Piersiala, Krzysztof; Jackowska, Joanna; Wierzbicka, Małgorzata",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764755/,215
70960,Potential relevance of pre-operative quality of life questionnaires to identify candidates for surgical treatment of genital prolapse: a pilot study.,2012,"BACKGROUND The Nissen and Toupet fundoplications are the most commonly used techniques for surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. To date, no population-based trend analysis has been reported examining the choice of procedure and short-term outcomes. This study was designed to analyze trends in the use of Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications, and corresponding short-term outcomes during a 10-year period between 1995 and 2004. METHODS A trend analysis was performed of 873 patients (Toupet: 254 patients, Nissen: 619 patients) prospectively enrolled in the database of the Swiss Association for Laparoscopic and Thoracoscopic Surgery. RESULTS The frequency of the performed techniques remained stable during the observation period (p value for trend 0.206). The average postoperative and total length of hospital stay both significantly decreased during the 10-year period from 5.6 to 4.0 days and 6.8 to 4.8 days, respectively (both p values for trend <0.001). The average duration of surgery decreased significantly from 141 minutes to 121 minutes (p value for trend <0.001). There was a trend towards less complications in later years (2000-2004) compared to early years (1995-1999, p = 0.058). Conversion rates were significantly lower in later years compared with early years (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS This is the first trend analysis in the literature reporting clinical outcomes of 873 prospectively enrolled patients undergoing Nissen and Toupet fundoplications during a 10-year period. The proportion of laparoscopic Nissen versus Toupet fundoplications remained stable over time, indicating that literature reports of the advantages of one procedure over the other had minimal influence on surgeons' choice of technique. Length of hospital stay, duration of surgery, morbidity, and conversion rate decreased over time, reflecting the learning curve. Clearly, patient outcomes have much improved during the 10-year observation period.","Zingg, U; Rosella, L; Guller, U",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1093-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464418/,215

We considered that the first 3 months are crucial to understand how knowledge has been generated by performing a bibliometric analysis, including the citations to these articles to guide researchers in exploring this field, and to evaluate the relationship between confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths with the number of papers per country. METHODS Scientific publications were obtained from PubMed (January-March 2020) and their citations during the first 6 months retrieved from the Scopus database. An analysis of the number of papers by country, approach (type and category of publication), and impact was made. A multiple linear regression model was implemented to analyze the correlation between the number of publications and confirmed cases and deaths. RESULTS A total of 2,530 publications were analyzed with 59,104 citations (23.4 citations/article), written by authors from 67 countries. China was the country with more publications (988, 39%) and more citations (36,416, 63%) followed by the United States with 423 articles (16.7%) and 7,458 citations (12.6%). The coauthorship network identified 10,756 authors.

We tested the hypothesis that patients with coronavirus disease 2019-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome are at higher risk of in-hospital mortality due to prolonged coma compared with other patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome matched for disease severity. DESIGN Propensity-matched cohort study. SETTING Seven ICUs in an academic hospital network, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). PATIENTS All mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 patients between March and May 2020 were identified and matched with patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome of other etiology. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Using clinical data obtained from a hospital registry, we matched 114 coronavirus disease 2019 patients to 228 noncoronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome patients based on baseline disease severity. Coma was identified using the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale less than or equal to -3. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the percentage of comatose days, sedative medications used, and the association between coronavirus disease 2019 and in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality (48.3% vs 31.6%, adjusted odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.34-3.44; p = 0.002), the percentage of comatose days (66.0% ± 31.3% vs 36.0% ± 36.9%, adjusted difference, 29.35; 95% CI, 21.45-37.24; p < 0.001), and the hypnotic agent dose (51.3% vs 17.1% of maximum hypnotic agent dose given in the cohort; p < 0.001) were higher among patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Brain imaging did not show a higher frequency of structural brain lesions in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (6.1% vs 7.0%; p = 0.76). Hypnotic agent dose was associated with coma (adjusted coefficient, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45-0.78; p < 0.001) and mediated (p = 0.001) coma. Coma was associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 5.84; 95% CI, 3.58-9.58; p < 0.001) and mediated 59% of in-hospital mortality (p < 0.001).

We analyze the impact of time on clinical outcome and the effect of patient, hospital, and health system characteristics on workflow within the trial. METHODS AND RESULTS Relationship between outcome (modified Rankin Scale) and interval times was modeled by using logistic regression. Association between time intervals (stroke onset to arrival in endovascular-capable hospital, to qualifying computed tomography, to groin puncture, and to reperfusion) and patient, hospital, and health system characteristics were modeled by using negative binomial regression. Every 30-minute increase in computed tomography-to-reperfusion time reduced the probability of achieving a functionally independent outcome (90-day modified Rankin Scale 0-2) by 8.3% (P=0.006). Symptom onset-to-imaging time was not associated with outcome (P>0.05). Onset-to-endovascular hospital arrival time was 42% (34 minutes) longer among patients receiving intravenous alteplase at the referring hospital (drip and ship) versus direct transfer (mothership). Computed tomography-to-groin puncture time was 15% (8 minutes) shorter among patients presenting during work hours versus off hours, 41% (24 minutes) shorter in drip-ship patients versus mothership, and 43% (22 minutes) longer when general anesthesia was administered. The use of a balloon guide catheter during endovascular procedures shortened puncture-to-reperfusion time by 21% (8 minutes). CONCLUSIONS Imaging-to-reperfusion time is a significant predictor of outcome in the ESCAPE trial. Inefficiencies in triaging, off-hour presentation, intravenous alteplase administration, use of general anesthesia, and endovascular techniques offer major opportunities for improvement in workflow.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients underwent percutaneous MW ablation of 26 intraparenchymal pulmonary masses. All patients were judged to be inoperable on the basis of tumour stage, comorbidities, advanced age and/or refusal to undergo surgery. Ablation was performed using a microwave generator (Evident Microwave Ablation System, Covidien Ltd., Dublin). Lesions with a diameter ≤ 3 cm were treated with a single antenna, lesions with a diameter >3 cm were treated by positioning two or more antennae, simultaneously. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) follow-up with and without contrast administration at 1, 3 and 6 months and then yearly in combination with complete blood and metabolic tests. RESULTS Technical success was 100 %. No major complications were recorded. Asymptomatic grade-1 pneumothorax was recorded in 9 patients (37.5 %). One case of asymptomatic pleural effusion and one of haemoptysis, not requiring transfusion, were observed. No patients were diagnosed with a post-ablation syndrome.

Sequence alignment failed to identify the disease-causing variant(s) in both genes. Therefore, whole exome sequencing in one affected individual was performed. Data analysis detected a novel homozygous missense variant (c.956C>T; p.Pro319Leu) in the exon 9 of the RASGRP2 gene. Five additional individuals of a family including both parents, an affected individual and two asymptomatic individuals were Sanger sequenced for the variant (c.956C>T). The variant segregates in the family in an autosomal recessive manner. Several in silico tools predicted the variant as pathogenic. Protein modeling studies suggest that the mutation (p.Pro319Leu) cause a conformational change in the loop structure of the RasGEF domain of the CalDAG-GEFI protein. Reported variants in the RasGEF domain impair expression and/or nucleotide exchange activity of CalDAG-GEFI protein and thus inhibit the activation of Rap1 protein required for platelet adhesion and hemostatic plug formation.","Alharby, Essa; Bakhsh, Mohammad A; Albalawi, Alia M; Almutairi, Sultan O; Hashmi, Jamil A; Basit, Sulman",Platelets,https://doi.org/10.1080/09537104.2019.1663803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609603/,215

79827,Cognitive complaints in age-related chronic conditions: A systematic review.,2021,"BACKGROUND Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) caused by respiratory viruses are common and persistent infectious diseases worldwide and in China, which have pronounced seasonal patterns. Meteorological factors have important roles in the seasonality of some major viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Our aim was to identify the dominant meteorological factors and to model their effects on common respiratory viruses in different regions of China. METHODS We analysed monthly virus data on patients hospitalised with ALRI from 81 sentinel hospitals in 22 provinces in mainland China from Jan 1, 2009, to Sept 30, 2013. We considered seven common respiratory viruses: RSV, influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human coronavirus. Meteorological data of the same period were used to analyse relationships between virus seasonality and seven meteorological factors according to region (southern vs northern China). The geographical detector method was used to quantify the explanatory power of each meteorological factor, individually and interacting in pairs, on the respiratory viruses. FINDINGS 28 369 hospitalised patients with ALRI were tested, 10 387 (36·6%) of whom were positive for at least one virus, including RSV (4091 [32·0%] patients), influenza virus (2665 [20·8%]), human parainfluenza virus (2185 [17·1%]), adenovirus (1478 [11·6%]), human bocavirus (1120 [8·8%]), human coronavirus (637 [5·0%]), and human metapneumovirus (615 [4·8%]). RSV and influenza virus had annual peaks in the north and biannual peaks in the south. Human parainfluenza virus and human bocavirus had higher positive rates in the spring-summer months. Human metapneumovirus had an annual peak in winter-spring, especially in the north. Adenovirus and human coronavirus exhibited no clear annual seasonality. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, vapour pressure, and rainfall had most explanatory power on most respiratory viruses in each region. Relative humidity was only dominant in the north, but had no significant explanatory power for most viruses in the south. Hours of sunlight had significant explanatory power for RSV and influenza virus in the north, and for most viruses in the south. Wind speed was the only factor with significant explanatory power for human coronavirus in the south. For all viruses, interactions between any two of the paired factors resulted in enhanced explanatory power, either bivariately or non-linearly. INTERPRETATION Spatiotemporal heterogeneity was detected for most viruses in this study, and interactions between pairs of meteorological factors were found to enhance their influence on virus variation. These findings might be helpful to guide government planning, such as public health interventions, infection control practice, and timing of passive immunoprophylaxis, and might facilitate the development of future vaccine strategies.

79871,Tocilizumab in Treatment for Patients With COVID-19.,2021-04-05,"BACKGROUND The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was to compare the incidence of chronic pain after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) using a 35-g/m2 titanized polypropylene mesh and a 16-g/m2 titanized polypropylene mesh. The reported incidence of chronic pain in patients who underwent laparoscopic hernia repair is a serious problem. The techniques of dissection, mesh fixation, and the mesh material used have all been identified as being part of the problem. Excellent biocompatibility through a unique combination of a lightweight open porous polypropylene mesh covered with a covalent-bonded titanium layer has been claimed. The aim of this study was to find out whether the titanium surface alone or the difference in material load between the two available meshes influences clinical outcomes. METHODS Three hundred eighty patients with 466 inguinal hernias were operated on between 2002 and 2006 with the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) technique. Mesh fixation with staples was carried out routinely. After the dissection was completed just prior to the implantation of the mesh, patients were randomized into two groups. In Group A, 250 (53.6%) inguinal hernias were repaired with a 35-g/m2 titanized polypropylene mesh, and in Group B, 216 (46.4%) inguinal hernias were repaired with a 16-g/m2 titanized polypropylene mesh. The primary outcome was chronic pain 3 years after surgery. The degree of pain was determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) with a range from 0 to 10. The secondary outcome was the rate of recurrence. RESULTS The postoperative period of observation was at least 3 years for every patient. In both groups, 90% of the patients could be questioned and examined clinically: in Group A (Light), 5.3% of the patients and in Group B (Extralight), 1.5% of the patients suffered from chronic pain. Chronic pain was significantly more common in Group A than in Group B (p=0.037). There was no difference with respect to the rate of recurrence: for Group A it was 3.1% and for Group B it was 2.6% (p=0.724). CONCLUSIONS Chronic pain is not very common in patients who have had their inguinal hernias repaired with titanium-covered polypropylene mesh. Reducing the material load from 35 to 16 g/m2 seems to further improve the biocompatibility of these meshes, thus improving the clinical outcome by reducing chronic pain to a rare event. The role of staples in causing chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair may be overestimated. There was no evidence supporting the notion that the use of the 16-g/m2 titanized meshes is associated with increased recurrence rates.","Schopf, Stefan; von Ahnen, Thomas; von Ahnen, Martin; Schardey, Hans",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0850-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21103989/,215

In the absence of specific antiviral treatments capable of neutralising the etiological agent, one therapeutic approach is to control the cytokine storm responsible for the most severe forms of the disease. The characteristic cytokine profile of severely affected patients is increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). AREAS COVERED This article discusses the pathogenesis of COVID-19 as a rationale for using the biological and targeted synthetic drugs used in rheumatology (anti-TNF, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents and baricitinib) to treat the disease, and provides key information concerning their potential benefits and adverse effects. EXPERT OPINION Interleukin inhibition seems to be a promising means of treating COVID-19 patients when respiratory function declines (or even earlier) if there are laboratory data indicating the presence of a cytokine storm because the interleukins are key drivers of inflammation. However, it is important to consider the risks and benefits of biological agents carefully, and critically analyse the evidence concerning their use in COVID-19 patients.","Atzeni, Fabiola; Gerratana, Elisabetta; Giallanza, Manuela; La Corte, Laura; Nucera, Valeria; Miceli, Gianfranco; Sangari, Donatella; Masala, Ignazio Francesco",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14712598.2020.1817372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32866053/,215

DESIGN AND METHODS Five hundred and eighteen people with cancer with data extracted from two waves (2017-19 and April 2020) of the Understanding Society UK dataset participated. FINDINGS An increased risk of depression was observed for cancer of the breast, prostate, blood, but not other cancers (e.g., lung, melanoma). After controlling for prior depression and other factors, it was loneliness during COVID-19, and not previous loneliness, that was predictive. Those currently lonely had a 4.5-fold increased risk of depression. These findings demonstrate that people living with cancer are at increased risk of developing depression during COVID-19, and that feelings of isolation help explain this risk. IMPLICATIONS These particular findings have implications for health promotion and intervention work and how best to support people who may feel lonely in this vulnerable group.","Gallagher, Stephen; Bennett, Kate Mary; Roper, Louise",Journal of psychosocial oncology,https://doi.org/10.1080/07347332.2020.1853653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33274697/,215

In the present study, Solea senegalensis juveniles were exposed under laboratory conditions to contaminated whole-sediments for 7 and 28 days. Sediments were obtained from a low to moderately polluted estuary, a highly polluted harbour and from the mixture of both field-collected sediments. Biometry data were recorded. Liver, brain, gills, and gonads were dissected out and processed to determine markers of oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Analyses of sediment granulometry and chemical profiles indicated different degrees of toxicity and suggested a distinct release of pollutants from each sediment in relation with their physicochemical properties. Interestingly, biological responses were in agreement with contaminant levels reported in source sediments. The most distinct toxicopathic effects were detected upon exposure to the harbour's sediment and particularly on day 28. Overall, enhanced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase activity and lysosomal enlargement were detected in all experimental groups, demonstrating a toxic effect from all sediments whilst catalase inhibition, lysosomal membrane destabilisation, changes in lysosomal content and liver histopathology were most pronounced in soles exposed to the harbour's sediment. The Integrative Biomarker Response index (IBR/n) evidenced that exposure to the three sediments caused an impact of diverse magnitude in sole health (IBR/nHarbour > IBR/nMixture > IBR/nEstuary). The magnitude of biological responses essentially depended on the presence of contaminants in source sediments, which seemed to be altered by the conditions imposed by whole-sediment toxicity assays.","Briaudeau, Tifanie; Zorita, Izaskun; Izagirre, Urtzi; Marigómez, Ionan",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408203/,215

Aim of the study was to validate the process used for labelling heat-damaged red blood cells ""totally in vitro"", after blood sample collection, before re-inject labeled RBCs to the patient. Moreover, we assessed efficacy of the staff training programme in order to guarantee repeatibility and method standardization in the clinical routine. METHODS The validation process of the labeling procedure was performed in three different patients during three consecutive days. After collection of a blood sample using a heparinized syringe, we isolated erythrocytes from other blood components by centrifugation and washing steps. Then, we added the stannous pyrophosphate (PYP) to the erythrocytes pellet, after pH control. The 'pretinning' of RBCs was necessary to reduce Tc-99m once pertechnetate was entered them. After the labeling reaction with 130 MBq of 99mTc-pertechnetate, the erythrocytes were denatured in a water bath at a temperature of 49°-50°C, for 10 min. Radioactivity of blood aliquotes was measured with a dose calibrator and labelling efficiency (LE%) was determined. The labelling purity was measured using a gamma counter and calculated using the formula: counts of pellet/counts of pellet+(counts of surnatant)*100.Training program was evaluated using a Learning Questionnaire (LQ). with a grading score from 6 ("""") to 1 (""nothing"") for each operator (n=3). RESULTS We didn't observed the presence of macroaggregates during the entire process, until the final sample. The labelling efficiency resulted at very high values in the three consecutive measured aliquotes (mean value 73.67%) as well as the labelling purity (>95.22%). In our instituion, we use splenic imaging with labelled heat-damaged RBCs to detect ectopic spleen, splenosis, extramedullary hematopoiesis. We performed 3 procedures with heat-damaged labeled RBCs with a mean labelling efficiency 73.67%.Training and learning programmes were scored by key objective areas with a mean value of 5. CONCLUSIONS Our in vitro labeling process of heat-damaged RBCs is simple and safe, providing a useful technique easy to implement in clinical routine for splenic imaging Learning outcome of the training programme was scored as effective by all the operators with evidence of high-efficiency-reproducible procedure mantained over time.","Sammartano, Antonino; Scarlattei, Maura; Migliari, Silvia; Baldari, Giorgio; Ruffini, Livia",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v90i3.7767; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580314/,215
85540,Bariatric surgery to treat severely obese patients with type 2 diabetes: A consensus statement.,2011,"All positive-strand RNA viruses reorganize host intracellular membranes to assemble their replication complexes. Similarly, brome mosaic virus (BMV) induces two alternate forms of membrane-bound RNA replication complexes: vesicular spherules and stacks of appressed double-membrane layers. The mechanisms by which these membrane rearrangements are induced, however, remain unclear. We report here that host ACB1-encoded acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) binding protein (ACBP) is required for the assembly and activity of both BMV RNA replication complexes. ACBP is highly conserved among eukaryotes, specifically binds to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, and promotes general lipid synthesis. Deleting ACB1 inhibited BMV RNA replication up to 30-fold and resulted in formation of spherules that were ∼50% smaller but ∼4-fold more abundant than those in wild-type (wt) cells, consistent with the idea that BMV 1a invaginates and maintains viral spherules by coating the inner spherule membrane. Furthermore, smaller and more frequent spherules were preferentially formed under conditions that induce layer formation in wt cells. Conversely, cellular karmella structures, which are arrays of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes formed upon overexpression of certain cellular ER membrane proteins, were formed normally, indicating a selective inhibition of 1a-induced membrane rearrangements. Restoring altered lipid composition largely complemented the BMV RNA replication defect, suggesting that ACBP was required for maintaining lipid homeostasis. Smaller and more frequent spherules are also induced by 1a mutants with specific substitutions in a membrane-anchoring amphipathic α-helix, implying that the 1a-lipid interactions play critical roles in viral replication complex assembly.","Zhang, Jiantao; Diaz, Arturo; Mao, Lan; Ahlquist, Paul; Wang, Xiaofeng",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06701-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22345450/,215

We report our experience using the Silk flow diverter (SFD; Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France) for the treatment of complex aneurysms in four Argentine centers. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 246 consecutive patients who were treated with the SFD at four Argentine centers between January 2009 and January 2017. The patient and aneurysm characteristics, as well as the details of the procedure, were analyzed. The angiographic and clinical findings were recorded during and immediately after the procedure and at 12-month follow-up. Results Angiography follow-up at 12 months was possible in 235 patients (95.5%) with 282 aneurysms. A total of 265 aneurysms (93.9%) presented with complete occlusion of the aneurysmal sac (class 1) and 17 aneurysms (6.1%) presented with partial occlusion (class 2). The 12-month clinical follow-up showed 11 patients with major events (seven, scale 2; five, scale 3; and two, scale 4). The morbidity and mortality rates were 4.2% (11/289) and 2.1% (5/289), respectively. Conclusions The treatment of aneurysms with the SFD was associated with a low rate of complications and a high percentage of aneurysmal occlusion. These findings suggest that SFD is an effective and safe alternative in the endovascular treatment of complex aneurysms.","Foa Torres, G; Roca, F; Noguera, A; Godes, J; Petrocelli, S; Aznar, I; Ales, S; Muszynski, P; Maehara, R; Vicente, M; Pumar, J M","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019918771340; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29720021/,215

Christianity's dedication to health care, and its belief that assisting the sick constituted an absolute obligation, distinguished early Christianity from its contemporary cultural milieu which regularly ignored and excluded the sick. The novelty of the Christian approach to healing can be traced to the early church's unique recognition of human need. This vision of human need, which ultimately replaced the secular Greco-Roman emphasis on reciprocal philanthropy and providing assistance only to the worthy, is clearly exemplified in the life of Christ, in responses to plague and in the writings of John Chrysostom and the Cappadocian Fathers Basil the Great, Gregory of Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus. An analysis of these sources demonstrates that the early Christian Church viewed the sick not only as persons to be assisted insofar as they shared a common human nature but also individuals necessary for the salvation of the broader community as a whole. The early church's emphasis on reciprocal interdependence between healthy and sick eliminated the boundaries traditionally established between these two groups and transformed long-standing notions of contagious disease. Ultimately, the development of these attitudes toward the sick originates in a deeper truth which underlies the Christian healthcare tradition both in the ancient world and in the modern era: humanity's profound and mutual need of God, before whom all are spiritually ill.","Becker, Sarah E",The Linacre quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1177/0024363920962958; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897048/,215

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of feeding PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb on performance, carcass characteristics, and ruminal fermentation variables of feedlot steers. In Exp. 1, during 2 consecutive years, 226 or 192 Angus and Angus crossbred steers were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. When measured on a BW basis, steers fed only PAP-Sb had a greater G:F (P < 0.05) than those fed no PAP. Nevertheless, when both PAP were fed, feed efficiency was similar (P > 0.10) to steers fed no PAP or only PAP-Sb. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased (P < 0.05) dressing percentage. Steers receiving PAP-Fn (alone or in combination with PAP-Sb) had a decreased severity of liver abscess (P < 0.05). No differences (P > 0.10) were observed in any other carcass characteristics. In Exp. 2, sixteen ruminally cannulated Angus crossbred steers (BW = 665 +/- 86 kg) were fed a high-grain diet containing either PAP-Sb or PAP-Fn, or both. Feeding only PAP-Fn or PAP-Sb for 19 d decreased (P < 0.05) ruminal counts of S. bovis when compared with steers fed both or no PAP. The ruminal counts of F. necrophorum in steers fed PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb were decreased by 98% (P < 0.05) after 19 d, when compared with the counts in control steers. Mean daily ruminal pH was greater (P < 0.05) in steers fed both PAP when compared with feeding either or no PAP. Ruminal pH in the first 4 h after feeding was greater (P < 0.05) for steers receiving PAP-Fn alone or in combination with PAP-Sb. Steers receiving either PAP alone or in combination had less (P < 0.05) ruminal NH(3)-N concentrations in the first 4 h after feeding when compared with those of control steers. Polyclonal antibody preparations against S. bovis were effective in enhancing G:F of steers fed high-grain diets, but dressing percentage was decreased. Mechanisms of enhancement of G:F remain unknown but may be related to changes in ruminal counts of target bacteria and associated effects on ruminal fermentation products.","DiLorenzo, N; Dahlen, C R; Diez-Gonzalez, F; Lamb, G C; Larson, J E; DiCostanzo, A",Journal of animal science,https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-0859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18955541/,215

Anastomotic surgery of the upper digestive tract was performed on dogs using the conventional and modified methods for LapCAC. The animals were sacrificed postoperatively at different time points to obtain sections from the anastomotic site for pathologic study. Anastomotic outcomes of the two methods were also verified in two clinical cases. The animal experiments and the two clinical cases showed that no anastomotic leakage occurred with the modified method, and that the new method was simple, convenient and reliable as compared with the conventional method. The mean time of placing the anastomosis clip was shorter, and the mean numbers of operation attempts, secondary actions and sutures in the operating holes were reduced. The serosa at the anastomosis healed completely, the muscular layer and submucosal fibers proliferated well, and the anastomosis was covered with mucosa within two weeks after the operation. LapCAC offered a better surgical outcome when it was used according to the modified method, where anastomoses formed smoothly and completely within two weeks after the operation.","Zhang, Dingyu; Zheng, Chengzhu; Song, Chengli",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy,https://doi.org/10.3109/13645706.2010.527777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21091069/,215

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Data from Health Facility Assessment (HFA) survey is used for efficiency measurement. The data on patient's perceptions and other control variables are taken from Client Exit Interviews part of the HFA survey. Two-stage residual inclusion, Ordered Logistic Regression and Least square dummy variable techniques are used to investigate the relationship between technical efficiency and patients' satisfaction level. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) AND RESULTS The average efficiency score for Pakistan's DHQHs is 0.52, and not a single hospital is fully efficient. Moreover, the relationship between technical efficiency and patients' satisfaction is found to be negative and statistically significant indicating that an increase in hospital efficiency tends to decrease patients' satisfaction. The disaggregated analysis reveals that patients' satisfaction associated with the healthcare provider attitude and communication is more affected by technical efficiency. CONCLUSION Patients' satisfaction level is more sensitive to physician's attitude and communication.

87151,Preoperative Sleep Quality And Adverse Pain Outcomes After Total Hip Arthroplasty.,2021-03-08,"INTRODUCTION Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among stem cell transplant recipients. While there is a substantial amount of information on prognostic factors and response ribavirin therapy is available for RSV infections this information is largely lacking for hMPV. PATIENTS AND METHODS In total 71 patients were included in this study: 47 patients with RSV and 24 with hMPV. Forty one patients presented as an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and 30 as a primary lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Patients were stratified as per ISI criteria into low, moderate and high-risk groups. Twenty two patients in the URTI cohort received treatment with ribavirin (mainly oral), 19 patients received no antiviral therapy. The decision for antiviral treatment was at the discretion of the attending physician. All 30 patients with primary LRTI and 10 patients with secondary LRTI were treated with ribavirin, 95% with the intravenous formulation. 45% of these patients received additional treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins. The viral load was assessed indirectly by using the CT-value of the RT - PCR. RESULTS In the cohort as whole 11,5 % suffered a virus - associated death, 5% in the URTI group and 20% in the LRTI group. Sixty - day mortality was significantly higher in the ISI high - risk group (log-rank p=0,05). Mortality was independent of the type of virus (p=0,817). Respiratory failure with an indication for mechanical ventilation developed in 11,5%, this risk was independent of the type of virus. Progression from URTI to LRTI was observed in 24% of cases with a significantly higher risk (75%) in the ISI high group (log-rank p=0,001). In the ISI high-risk group treatment with ribavirin significantly reduced the risk of progression (log-rank p<0,001). Neither the type of virus nor the viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab impacted the risk of progression (p=0,529 and p=0,141 respectively). The detection of co - pathogens in the BAL fluid was borderline significant for mortality (p=0,07). CONCLUSIONS We could detect no differences between RSV and hMPV with respect to progression to LRTI, risk of respiratory failure or need for mechanical ventilation and virus - associated death. The ISI index is of predictive value in hMPV patients with a high ISI score and treatment with oral ribavirin has an equivalent protective effect in RSV and hMPV patients. Treatment of LRTI with intravenous ribavirin results in a similar outcome in RSV and hMPV infected patients. We could not detect any benefit of adjunctive treatment with immunoglobulins in both primary and secondary LRTI. No role of viral load as an independent prognostic marker could be detected either for progression to LRTI or death.","Akhmedov, Mobil; Wais, Verena; Sala, Elisa; Neagoie, Adela; Nguyen, Thanh Mai; Gantner, Andrea; von Harsdorf, Stephanie; Kuchenbauer, Florian; Schubert, Axel; Michel, Detlef; Döhner, Hartmut; Bunjes, Donald",Transplant infectious disease : an official journal of the Transplantation Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13276; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32162389/,215

87457,Pulse Transit Time as a Predictor of the Efficacy of a Celiac Plexus Block in Patients With Chronic Intractable Abdominal Pain.,2016,The medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth has been encouraged by the continuing growth of technology that can be applied to the reproductive journey. Technology now has the potential to fully separate reproduction from the human body with the prospect of ectogenesis-the gestation of a fetus outside of the human body. This paper considers the issues that have been caused by the general medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth and the impact that ectogenesis may have on these existing issues. The medicalisation of pregnancy and childbirth is criticised for its impact on the relationship between doctors and pregnant women and the way in which doctors treat fetuses. It is argued that ectogenesis may cause more imbalance in the doctor and intended parent relationship and may result in an increased lack of clarity regarding a doctor's duty to the fetus. This paper finds that extensive guidance and revised legislation will be necessary to minimise the impact of ectogenesis on the existing issues caused by the medicalisation of reproduction.,"Adkins, Victoria",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-106004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647041/,215

This study reviewed clinical studies and presents an overview of known and newly analyzed data from children <6 years. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for interventional and non-interventional studies which investigated the effects of EPs 7630 in aRTIs and included children <6 years of age. Sub-group analyses for this age range were performed for symptom scales, global efficacy or effectiveness assessments, and safety outcomes. RESULTS Seven studies with 1067 children <6 years exposed to EPs 7630 were identified. Efficacy of EPs 7630 was significantly superior to placebo in reducing symptom intensity and time until complete recovery in two randomized, double-blind trials in patients with acute bronchitis (AB). Similar symptom time courses were observed in two non-comparative observational studies in AB. One non-comparative, open-label study was identified in acute tonsillopharyngitis (ATP), and one in acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). In both indications, nearly all children showed complete recovery or major symptom improvements during the treatment period, with changes that were similar to those observed in controlled trials investigating older patient populations. The results were supported by an additional observational study including children with various diagnoses of aRTIs. EPs 7630 was safe and well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS EPs 7630 is efficacious in children <6 years suffering from AB. The analyses also support the effectiveness of the product in ATP and in ARS. No safety concerns were identified.","Kamin, Wolfgang; Funk, Petra; Seifert, Georg; Zimmermann, Andrea; Lehmacher, Walter",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1080/03007995.2017.1402754; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29119837/,215

91201,Developing a Framework for Designing and Deploying Technology-Assisted Rehabilitation Post Stroke: A Qualitative Study.,2020-11-02,"OBJECTIVE Recent work has attempted to uncover heterogeneity in experiences of victimization. However, few studies have included important trauma-related characteristics such as known perpetrator, fear of life or injury, and negative reactions to disclosure. Little focus on potentially important subgroup differences including sexual/gender identity, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status as well as protective factors have been assessed. METHOD Participants (N = 2,880) completed four annual surveys during late adolescence and the transition to young adulthood as part of an ongoing longitudinal study. Latent class analysis was used to extract classes of victimization and trauma-related characteristics. Latent class regression was used to understand how demographic covariates were related to class membership. Finally, discrete-time survival mixture analysis was used to assess latency to opioid use from ages 17 to 24 years, and how demographic and protective factors influenced opioid use across emergent classes. RESULTS The four-class solution fit the data best: sexual abuse and indirect violence + high trauma characteristics (n = 79, 3.6%); high all + high trauma characteristics (n = 177; 8.1%); chronic emotional abuse + trusted perpetrator (n = 263; 12.1%); and low all (n = 1,656; 76.1%). Latent class regression results indicated differential risk of class membership by sexual/gender minority status, sex assigned at birth, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Survival analysis noted shorter latency to opioid use across all classes compared to the low all class. Self-efficacy and neighborhood cohesion emerged as important protective factors. CONCLUSION Furthermore, results highlight key individual- and community-level protective factors that decrease the risk of opioid use.

METHODS Data were from a large longitudinal cohort study of Australian parents of a child aged 0-18 years collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) was used to measure resilience, the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) measured distress (i.e., composite of stress, anxiety and depression scales). Other factors assessed included: age, gender, being born overseas, number of children, self-assessed introversion, social, educational and economic variables, family resources, positive affect and emotional regulation, external social support, and partner social support. Hierarchical regression models and a moderation analysis were used to assess the aims. RESULTS Of 2110 parents, 1701 (80.6%) were female. The mean age was 38 years old (SD = 7, range = 19-69). High loneliness was a key contributor to distress. The level of social support received did add significantly to distress, with greater assistance associated with lower stress and anxiety (both p < .01). Partner support significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and depression; however, this relationship is of unlikely clinical significance due to its small statistical effect. CONCLUSION Interventions targeting resilience against distress and mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation and might include partners. Qualitative studies are needed to understand the various useful and not useful aspects of partner's support.","Mikocka-Walus, Antonina; Stokes, Mark; Evans, Subhadra; Olive, Lisa; Westrupp, Elizabeth",Journal of psychosomatic research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2021.110433; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33812660/,215

METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data from 78 patients who underwent minimally invasive partial nephrectomy, using soft coagulation, at the Shiga University of Medical Science, between September 2013 and April 2017. Tumor excision and hemostasis without renal arterial clamping was performed using soft coagulation. Collecting system repair and renorrhaphy with arterial clamping were carried out only if the collecting system had been opened. RESULTS Forty-three of the 78 patients underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy using soft coagulation and the other 35 patients underwent robotic partial nephrectomy using soft coagulation. The median estimated total blood loss was 73 (0-1140) mL and no patient needed a blood transfusion. No cases featured postoperative hemorrhagic events. Six patients with urinary fistula needed prolonged ureteral stenting. The median percentage change of the estimated glomerular filtration rate was -7.2 at one to 3 months after surgery. CONCLUSION The off-clamp soft coagulation technique in laparoscopic partial nephrectomy and robotic partial nephrectomy is a safe and feasible approach to excise kidney tumors. This procedure may reduce the incidence of perioperative hemorrhagic complications.","Yoshida, Tetsuya; Okinaka, Yuki; Tomita, Keiji; Tsuru, Teruhiko; Kageyama, Susumu; Narita, Mitsuhiro; Kawauchi, Akihiro",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31908133/,215

The purpose of this study was to simulate aerosolization events over a range of endoscopic procedures to gain an evidence-based aerosol risk assessment. METHODS Aerosolization was simulated in a cadaver using fluorescein solution (0.2mg/10ml) and quantified using a blue-light filter and digital image processing. Outpatient sneezing during endoscopy was simulated using an intranasal atomizer in the presence or absence of intact and modified surgical mask barriers. Surgical aerosolization was simulated during non-powered instrumentation, suction microdebrider, and high-speed drilling following nasal fluorescein application. RESULTS Among the outpatient conditions, a simulated sneeze event generated maximal aerosol distribution at 30cm extending to 66cm. Both an intact surgical mask and a modified VENT mask (which enables endoscopy) eliminated all detectable aerosol spread. Among the surgical conditions, cold instrumentation and microdebrider use did not generate detectable aerosols. Conversely, use of a high-speed drill produced significant aerosol contamination in all tested conditions. CONCLUSION We confirm that aerosolization presents a risk to the endonasal skull base surgeon. In the outpatient setting, use of a barrier significantly reduces aerosol spread. Cold surgical instrumentation and microdebrider use pose significantly less aerosolization risk than a high-speed drill. Procedures requiring drill use should carry a special designation as an ""Aerosol Generating Surgery"" to convey this unique risk, and support the need for protective PPE.

However, quantitate assessment of gastroesophageal reflux after this surgery has not been performed till date. The aims of the current study were to investigate the safety and feasibility of this operation and to elucidate the postoperative reflux status. Twenty consecutive patients (18 men) with (y)cStage I gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach who underwent LAPG at Kitasato University Hospital from May 2015 through September 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. We performed 24-h impedance-pH monitoring 3 months after surgery for the first eight patients and analyzed the postoperative reflux status. Median operation time was 333 min, while median anastomotic time was 81 min. None of the 20 patients experienced anastomotic leakage while two patients experienced anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic balloon dilatation. No patient experienced heartburn without antacid drugs. During the 24-h impedance-pH monitoring, all but one patient had normal gastroesophageal acid reflux with the acid percent time of <1.1% and reflux percent time of <1.4%. One patient with marginally abnormal postoperative gastroesophageal reflux had a normal DeMeester score of 3.0. Our results showed that esophagogastrostomy using the ""open-door"" technique is a safe and feasible procedure for LAPG. The degree of gastroesophageal reflux was acceptable using this technique. Randomized controlled trials with long-term follow-ups are required to confirm that this technique would be superior to the others.","Hosoda, Kei; Yamashita, Keishi; Moriya, Hiromitsu; Mieno, Hiroaki; Ema, Akira; Washio, Marie; Watanabe, Masahiko",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11605-016-3341-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025772/,215

However, it remains unclear whether those who frequently produce bullshit are inoculated from its influence. For example, both bullshit receptivity and bullshitting frequency are negatively related to cognitive ability and aspects of analytic thinking style, suggesting that those who frequently engage in bullshitting may be more likely to fall for bullshit. However, separate research suggests that individuals who frequently engage in deception are better at detecting it, thus leading to the possibility that frequent bullshitters may be less likely to fall for bullshit. Here, we present three studies (N = 826) attempting to distinguish between these competing hypotheses, finding that frequency of persuasive bullshitting (i.e., bullshitting intended to impress or persuade others) positively predicts susceptibility to various types of misleading information and that this association is robust to individual differences in cognitive ability and analytic cognitive style.","Littrell, Shane; Risko, Evan F; Fugelsang, Jonathan A",The British journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33538011/,215

96313,Presence of Decreased Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density Consistent with Small Fiber Neuropathy in Patients with Central Post-Stroke Pain.,2016,"Friedreich Ataxia (FA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the deficiency of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein. In primary cultures of dorsal root ganglia neurons, we showed that frataxin depletion resulted in decreased levels of the mitochondrial calcium exchanger NCLX, neurite degeneration and apoptotic cell death. Here we describe that frataxin-deficient dorsal root ganglia neurons display low levels of ferredoxin 1, a mitochondrial Fe/S cluster-containing protein that interacts with frataxin and, interestingly, is essential for the synthesis of calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D. We provide data that calcitriol supplementation, used at nanomolar concentrations, is able to reverse the molecular and cellular markers altered in DRG neurons. Calcitriol is able to recover both ferredoxin 1 and NCLX levels and restores mitochondrial membrane potential indicating an overall mitochondrial function improvement. Accordingly, reduction of apoptotic markers and neurite degeneration was observed and, as a result, cell survival was also recovered. All these beneficial effects would be explained by the finding that calcitriol is able to increase the mature frataxin levels in both, frataxin-deficient DRG neurons and cardiomyocytes; remarkably, this increase also occurs in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from FA patients. In conclusion, these results provide molecular bases to consider calcitriol for an easy and affordable therapeutic approach for FA patients.","Britti, Elena; Delaspre, Fabien; Sanz, Arabela; Medina-Carbonero, Marta; Llovera, Marta; Purroy, Rosa; Mincheva-Tasheva, Stefka; Tamarit, Jordi; Ros, Joaquim",The Biochemical journal,https://doi.org/10.1042/bcj20200331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305808/,215

The aims of this study were to analyse the outcomes of repeat hepatectomy for recurrent CLM and to identify factors predicting survival. METHODS Data for all liver resections for CLM carried out at one centre between 1998 and 2011 were analysed. RESULTS A total of 1027 liver resections were performed for CLM. Of these, 58 were repeat liver resections performed in 53 patients. Median time intervals were 10.5 months between the primary resection and first hepatectomy, and 15.4 months between the first and repeat hepatectomies. The median tumour size was 3.0 cm and the median number of tumours was one. Six patients had a positive margin (R1) resection following first hepatectomy. There were no perioperative deaths. Significant complications included transient liver dysfunction in one and bile leak in two patients. Rates of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival following repeat liver resection were 85%, 61% and 52%, respectively, at a median follow-up of 23 months. R1 resection at first hepatectomy (P = 0.002), a shorter time interval between the first and second hepatectomies (P = 0.02) and the presence of extrahepatic disease (P = 0.02) were associated with significantly worse overall survival. CONCLUSIONS Repeat resection of CLM is safe and can achieve longterm survival in carefully selected patients. A preoperative knowledge of poor prognostic factors helps to facilitate better patient selection.","Battula, Narendra; Tsapralis, Dimitrios; Mayer, David; Isaac, John; Muiesan, Paolo; Sutcliffe, Robert P; Bramhall, Simon; Mirza, Darius; Marudanayagam, Ravi",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/hpb.12096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23530978/,215

Building upon prior work, we conducted a systematic review of research published from 2010 to 2018 regarding: (1) the prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide among United States military personnel and veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; (2) whether posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide among United States military personnel and veterans. 2,106 titles and abstracts were screened, with 48 articles included. Overall risk of bias was generally high for studies on suicidal ideation or suicide attempt and low for studies on suicide. Across studies, rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide widely varied based on study methodology and assessment approaches. Findings regarding the association between posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis with suicidal ideation and suicide were generally mixed, and some studies reported that posttraumatic stress disorder was associated with lower risk for suicide. In contrast, most studies reported significant associations between posttraumatic stress disorder and suicide attempt. These findings suggest complex associations between posttraumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide, which are likely influenced by other factors (e.g., psychiatric comorbidity). In addition, most samples were comprised of veterans, rather than military personnel. Further research is warranted to elucidate associations between posttraumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and suicide, including identification of moderators and mediators of this relationship. Addressing this among United States military personnel, by gender, and in relation to different trauma types is also necessary.","Holliday, Ryan; Borges, Lauren M; Stearns-Yoder, Kelly A; Hoffberg, Adam S; Brenner, Lisa A; Monteith, Lindsey L",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982838/,215

However, patients with cancer who have stroke are often precluded from therapy because of coagulopathy or recent surgery. Endovascular therapy may be a more suitable recanalization strategy for some patients with cancer and stroke, but no prior detailed reports documenting its use in this population exist. We present a case series from a tertiary care referral center of 2 patients with active systemic cancer who were successfully treated with endovascular therapy for AIS. Both patients had active lung cancer with excellent premorbid functional status and presented with severe AIS from left middle cerebral artery occlusions. Intravenous thrombolysis was deferred because of absolute contraindications. Mechanical embolectomy was performed instead and revascularization was achieved within 5 hours in both patients, resulting in dramatic neurological recoveries-National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improved from 14 to 0 and from 23 to 3 from admission to discharge, respectively. In conclusion, endovascular therapy may be beneficial for select patients with cancer and AIS who are ineligible for intravenous thrombolysis. However, further studies are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of endovascular therapy in the population with cancer.","Merkler, Alexander E; Marcus, Justin R; Gupta, Ajay; Kishore, Sirish A; Leifer, Dana; Patsalides, Athos; DeAngelis, Lisa M; Navi, Babak B",The Neurohospitalist,https://doi.org/10.1177/1941874413520509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24982717/,215

Antiviral drugs and vaccinations may be insufficient to prevent catastrophe. OBJECTIVES To systematically review the effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. SEARCH STRATEGY We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2009, issue 2); MEDLINE (1966 to May 2009); OLDMEDLINE (1950 to 1965); EMBASE (1990 to May 2009); and CINAHL (1982 to May 2009). SELECTION CRITERIA We scanned 2958 titles, excluded 2790 and retrieved the full papers of 168 trials, to include 59 papers of 60 studies. We included any physical interventions (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection and hygiene) to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses. We included the following study designs: randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohorts, case controls, cross-over, before-after, and time series studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used a standardised form to assess trial eligibility. RCTs were assessed by: randomisation method; allocation generation; concealment; blinding; and follow up. Non-RCTs were assessed for the presence of potential confounders, and classified into low, medium, and high risks of bias. MAIN RESULTS The risk of bias for the four RCTs, and most cluster RCTs, was high. The observational studies were of mixed quality. Only case-control data were sufficiently homogeneous to allow meta-analysis.The highest quality cluster RCTs suggest respiratory virus spread can be prevented by hygienic measures, such as handwashing, especially around younger children. Additional benefit from reduced transmission from children to other household members is broadly supported in results of other study designs, where the potential for confounding is greater. Six case-control studies suggested that implementing barriers to transmission, isolation, and hygienic measures are effective at containing respiratory virus epidemics. We found limited evidence that N95 respirators were superior to simple surgical masks, but were more expensive, uncomfortable, and caused skin irritation. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to decrease respiratory disease remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, were not properly evaluated. There was limited evidence that social distancing was effective especially if related to the risk of exposure. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Many simple and probably low-cost interventions would be useful for reducing the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. Routine long-term implementation of some of the measures assessed might be difficult without the threat of a looming epidemic.","Jefferson, Tom; Del Mar, Chris; Dooley, Liz; Ferroni, Eliana; Al-Ansary, Lubna A; Bawazeer, Ghada A; van Driel, Mieke L; Nair, Sreekumaran; Foxlee, Ruth; Rivetti, Alessandro",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd006207.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091588/,215

In this study, we have traced pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of each component of siRNA polyplexes formed with polyethylenimine 25 kDa (PEI) or PEGylated PEIs by in vivo real-time gamma camera recording, SPECT imaging, and scintillation counting of blood samples and dissected organs. In vivo behavior of siRNA and polymers were compared and interpreted in the context of in vivo stability of the polyplexes which had been measured by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS). Both pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of polymer-complexed siRNA were dominated by the polymer. PEGylated polymers and their siRNA polyplexes showed significantly less uptake into liver (13.6-19.7% ID of PEGylated polymer and 9.5-10.2% ID of siRNA) and spleen compared to PEI 25 kDa (liver deposition: 36.2% ID of polymer and 14.6% ID of siRNA). With non-invasive imaging methods we were able to predict both kinetics and deposition in living animals allowing the investigation of organ distribution in real time and at different time points. FFS measurements proved stability of the applied polyplexes under in vivo conditions which explained the different behavior of complexed from free siRNA. Despite their stability in circulation, we observed that polyplexes dissociated upon liver passage. Therefore, siRNA/(PEG-)PEI delivery systems are not suitable for systemic administration, but instead may be useful when the first-pass effect is circumvented, which is the case in local application.","Merkel, Olivia M; Librizzi, Damiano; Pfestroff, Andreas; Schurrat, Tino; Buyens, Kevin; Sanders, Niek N; De Smedt, Stefaan C; Béhé, Martin; Kissel, Thomas",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2009.05.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19463870/,215

Elders, especially those with diabetes, are at the highest risk of COVID-19 related adverse outcomes and mortality. This is usually linked to the comorbidities that accumulate with age, diabetes-related chronic inflammation, and the pandemic's psychosocial effects.Areas covered: We present some approaches to manage these complicated elderly patients with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the inpatient setting, we suggest similar (pre-pandemic) glycemic targets and emphasize the importance of using IV insulin and possible use of continuous glucose monitoring to reduce exposure and PPE utilization. Outside the hospital, we recommend optimal glycemic control within the limits imposed by considerations of safety. We also describe the advantages and challenges of using various technological platforms in clinical care.Expert opinion: The COVID-19 pandemic has lifted the veil off serious deficiencies in the infrastructures for care at both the individual level and the population level and also highlighted some of the strengths, all of which affect individuals with diabetes and COVID-19.

On average, 6.41% of personal care and nursing aides and 6.23% of licensed practical nurses and registered nurses hold second jobs; second job holding rates are 35% and 32% higher than those of other workers, respectively. Both wages and hours in the primary job are negatively associated with the probability of holding a second job for personal care and nursing aides, while lower hours are more strongly correlated with a second job for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses. Many of these workers move across health settings from their first to second jobs, and 15% of second jobs for personal care and nursing aides are in other ""essential"" occupations.","Baughman, Reagan A; Stanley, Bryce; Smith, Kristin E",Medical care research and review : MCRR,https://doi.org/10.1177/1077558720974129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33213282/,215

100530,Differential drug effects on spontaneous and evoked pain behavior in a model of trigeminal neuropathic pain.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Mortality associated with sickle cell disease (SCD) is high in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Hydroxyurea, a medicine to effectively manage SCD, is not widely available in resource-constrained settings. We identified and synthesised the reported implementation outcomes for the therapeutic use of hydroxyurea for SCD in these settings. DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science Plus, Global Health, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched February through May 2019 without any restrictions on publication date. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA We included empirical studies of hydroxyurea for management of SCD that were carried out in LMICs and reported on implementation outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction using Proctor et al.'s implementation and health service outcomes, and assessed the risk of bias using ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions). RESULTS Two cross-sectional surveys (n=2) and one cohort study (n=1) reported implementation of hydroxyurea for SCD management, namely regarding outcomes of adoption (n=3), cost (n=3) and acceptability (n=1). These studies were conducted exclusively among paediatric and adults populations in clinical settings in Nigeria (n=2) or Jamaica (n=1). Adoption is low, as observed through reported provider practices and patient adherence, in part shaped by misinformation and fear of side effects among patients, provider beliefs regarding affordability and organisational challenges with procuring the medicine. There was no difference in the cost of hydroxyurea therapy compared with blood transfusion in the paediatric population in urban Jamaica. Risk of bias was low or moderate across the included studies. CONCLUSIONS This review rigorously and systematically assessed the evidence on implementation of hydroxyurea in resource-constrained settings such as LMICs. Findings suggest that knowledge regarding implementation is low. To address the know-do gap and guide clinical practice, implementation research is needed. Integrating effective interventions into existing health systems to improve hydroxyurea uptake is essential to reducing SCD-associated mortality.

101065,Clinical Outcomes in Young US Adults Hospitalized With COVID-19.,2020-09-09,"Body weight is determined via both metabolic and hedonic mechanisms. Metabolic regulation of body weight centres around the 'body weight set point', which is programmed by energy balance circuitry in the hypothalamus and other specific brain regions. The metabolic body weight set point has a genetic basis, but exposure to an obesogenic environment may elicit allostatic responses and upward drift of the set point, leading to a higher maintained body weight. However, an elevated steady-state body weight may also be achieved without an alteration of the metabolic set point, via sustained hedonic over-eating, which is governed by the reward system of the brain and can override homeostatic metabolic signals. While hedonic signals are potent influences in determining food intake, metabolic regulation involves the active control of both food intake and energy expenditure. When overweight is due to elevation of the metabolic set point ('metabolic obesity'), energy expenditure theoretically falls onto the standard energy-mass regression line. In contrast, when a steady-state weight is above the metabolic set point due to hedonic over-eating ('hedonic obesity'), a persistent compensatory increase in energy expenditure per unit metabolic mass may be demonstrable. Recognition of the two types of obesity may lead to more effective treatment and prevention of obesity.","Yu, Y-H; Vasselli, J R; Zhang, Y; Mechanick, J I; Korner, J; Peterli, R",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12246; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25588316/,215

Qingfei Paidu Decoction consists of 21 traditional Chinese medicines, such as Asari Radix et Rhizoma. However, the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma has been questioned by some people, because of one ancient proverb. To explore the rationality of the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, this study systematically examined the ancient and modern physicians' understanding of the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma, and collated the application and dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient prescriptions and modern clinics based on literature analysis. As a result, we found that ancient and modern physicians have different understanding on the toxicity of Asari Radix et Rhizoma and that the theory about the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma is flawed. We also found that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in ancient and modern clinical applications was not constrained by ancient experience. Physicians usually increase the dosage of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in clinical therapy according to the actual conditions, and there were no adverse reactions. Additionally, according to laws and regulations concerning medical affairs, physician could increase or decrease the dosage of the drug under special circumstances. Based on the analysis of safety and effectiveness of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction, we conclude that the dose of Asari Radix et Rhizoma in Qingfei Paidu Decoction is safe, effective and reasonable.","Qin, Zi-Nan; Wang, Meng-Xin; Shi, Nan-Nan; Wang, Yan-Ping; Zhai, Hua-Qiang",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200305.501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32489028/,215

In the absence of evidence based proven prophylactic or therapeutic options, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine (CQ/HCQ) patened as first line choice in COVID-19 treatment, which raised concerns about drug poisoning especially ocular toxicity. OBJECTIVE This study aim to investigate the possibility of ocular toxicity and the need for ophthalmic counseling to prescribe this therapeutic protocol. METHODS All the articles that were most relevant to the COVID-19 therapeutic or prophylactic options and CQ derivative ocular toxicity, were founded by a literature search and were thoroughly reviewed. RESULTS Anecdotal recent reports introduce CQ/HCQ as an effective therapeutic or prophylactic choice for COVID-19. Because of the short time prescribe and the insignificant cumulative dose of the drug on the one hand and higher risk of cross infection during ophthalmic examination on the other hand, ophthalmologic consult is not recommended except in high-risk patients for retinal toxicity. CONCLUSION This study recommended ophthalmic evaluation before CQ/HCQ prescription for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 only in preexisting maculopathy.","Bagheri, Masood; Rashe, Zahra; Ahur, Mohammad Hosein; Eidizadeh, Mojtaba",Recent patents on anti-infective drug discovery,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574891x15999200819102507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32814539/,215

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status.

This is particularly important for preterm infants who are highly susceptible to intestinal dysfunction and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We hypothesized that HMO supplementation of infant formula (IF) improves intestinal function, bacterial colonization and NEC resistance immediately after preterm birth, as tested in a preterm pig model. Mixtures of HMOs were investigated in intestinal epithelial cells and in preterm pigs (n=112) fed IF supplemented without (CON) or with a mixture of four HMOs (4-HMO) or >25 HMOs (25-HMO, 5-10 g/L given for 5 or 11 days). The 25-HMO blend decreased cell proliferation and both HMO blends decreased lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-8 secretion in IPEC-J2 cells, relative to control (P<.05). All HMOs were found in urine and feces of HMO-treated pigs, and short-chain fatty acids in the colon were higher in HMO vs. CON pigs (P<.05). After 5 days, NEC lesions were similar between HMO and CON pigs and 25-HMO increased colon weights (P<.01). After 11 days, the 4-HMO diet did not affect NEC (56 vs. 79%, P=.2) but increased dehydration and diarrhea (P<.05) and expression of immune-related genes (IL10, IL12, TGFβ, TLR4; P<.05). Bacterial adherence and diversity was unchanged after HMO supplementation. CONCLUSION Complex HMO-blends affect intestinal epithelial cells in vitro and gut gene expression and fermentation in preterm pigs. However, the HMOs had limited effects on NEC and diarrhea when supplemented to IF. Longer-term exposure to HMOs may be required to improve the immature intestinal function in formula-fed preterm neonates.","Rasmussen, Stine O; Martin, Lena; Østergaard, Mette V; Rudloff, Silvia; Roggenbuck, Michael; Nguyen, Duc Ninh; Sangild, Per T; Bering, Stine B",The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2016.10.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27889684/,215

Complete closure of these lesions is necessary to reduce these risks. The purpose of our study was to compare the outcome of DAVFs treated with Onyx versus those treated with n-Butyl Cyanoacrylate (nBCA) and coil embolization in a case-control study. Compared with nBCA and coil embolization, we hypothesized that Onyx embolization for DAVF is safer and has a higher chance of complete obliteration, with no need for post-embolization surgery for the DAVF. MATERIALS AND METHODS From 1998 to 2015, 29 patients who had DAVFs were treated with endovascular embolization. Of these, 24 patients had imaging available for analysis. Successful closure rates, complications, and procedure time were compared between the embolization techniques. RESULTS The chance of not requiring post-embolization surgery with Onyx (81.8%) was significantly higher (p = 0.005) than with nBCA (22.22%). The complication rate with Onyx (9.1%) tended to be lower compared with that of nBCA (22.22%; p = 0.37). Procedural time was not significantly different between Onyx (mean 267 minutes) and nBCA (mean 288 minutes) (p = 0.59). The odds ratio of a DAVF being treated with Onyx and then requiring no follow-up surgery was 17.5 (95% CI 1.97-155.4). CONCLUSION Our case-control study suggests that Onyx embolization is superior to nBCA and coil embolization in completely obliterating DAVFs, with higher odds of no post-embolization surgery.

107354,Vitamin C for COVID-19: A living systematic review.,2020-07-28,"Background Surgical proficiency is highly dependent on continuous and efficient training. However, efficacy of training hinges on questions such as accessibility and how intuitively the training can be translated into reality. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in particular relies on adequate training modalities in order to compensate for its additional psychomotor and visuospatial challenges. The increasing demand for MIS procedures longs for further enhancement of training and steep learning curves. We are investigating a nouveau training concept that continuously utilizes the first person view as addendum to laparoscopic view. We hypothesize this approach to be more intuitive thus faster and more naturally to apprehend than a laparoscopic view only and aim to establish a new standard to implement into training curricula. Methods and analysis The present study is conducted as a monocentric, two-arm randomized trial. Participants undergo a training curriculum in laparoscopic suturing and knot tying, using e-learning video material with either the first-person perspective of the surgeon or the laparoscopic view only. Primary endpoint is the total training time needed to reach a predefined proficiency level. Participants are evaluated by blinded raters using validated checklists. Number of attempts, procedure and knot quality subscore difference as well as metric parameter analysis from the first and last knots analyzed as secondary endpoints. Furthermore, trainees are assessed with regard to surgical background, basic skills level and spatial awareness. A total sample size of 80 participants for the analysis of the primary endpoint was determined, which will be performed as a two-sided t-test. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at Heidelberg University (Code S-334/2011). This trial was registered with the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS) in Freiburg, Germany, on May 6th (DRKS00009997). The results will be published and presented at appropriate conferences.","Schmidt, Mona Wanda; Friedrich, Mirco; Kowalewski, Karl-Friedrich; De La Garza, Javier; Bruckner, Thomas; Müller-Stich, Beat-Peter; Nickel, Felix",International journal of surgery protocols,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isjp.2017.01.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31851752/,215
107663,Transitioning to telehealth neuropsychology service: considerations across adult and pediatric care settings.,2020-08-26,"Alphaherpesvirus-associated ocular infections in humans caused by human alphaherpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) remain challenging to treat due to the frequency of drug application required and the potential for the selection of drug-resistant viruses. Repurposing on-the-market drugs is a viable strategy to accelerate the pace of drug development. It has been reported that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase inhibitor raltegravir inhibits HHV-1 replication by targeting the DNA polymerase accessory factor and limits terminase-mediated genome cleavage of human betaherpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). We have previously shown, both in vitro and in vivo, that raltegravir can also inhibit the replication of felid alphaherpesvirus 1 (FeHV-1), a common ocular pathogen of cats with a pathogenesis similar to that of HHV-1 ocular disease. In contrast to what was reported for HHV-1, we were unable to select for a raltegravir-resistant FeHV-1 strain in order to define any basis for drug action. A candidate-based approach to explore the mode of action of raltegravir against FeHV-1 showed that raltegravir did not impact FeHV-1 terminase function, as described for HHV-5. Instead, raltegravir inhibited DNA replication, similarly to HHV-1, but by targeting the initiation of viral DNA replication rather than elongation. In addition, we found that raltegravir specifically repressed late gene expression independently of DNA replication, and both activities are consistent with inhibition of ICP8. Taken together, these results suggest that raltegravir could be a valuable therapeutic agent against herpesviruses.IMPORTANCE The rise of drug-resistant herpesviruses is a longstanding concern, particularly among immunocompromised patients. Therefore, therapies targeting viral proteins other than the DNA polymerase that may be less likely to lead to drug-resistant viruses are urgently needed. Using FeHV-1, an alphaherpesvirus closely related to HHV-1 that similarly causes ocular herpes in its natural host, we found that the HIV integrase inhibitor raltegravir targets different stages of the virus life cycle beyond DNA replication and that it does so without developing drug resistance under the conditions tested. This shows that the drug could provide a viable strategy for the treatment of herpesvirus infections.","Pennington, Matthew R; Voorhees, Ian E H; Callaway, Heather M; Dehghanpir, Shannon D; Baines, Joel D; Parrish, Colin R; Van de Walle, Gerlinde R",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00994-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30045987/,215
107751,Modified rehabilitation exercises for mild cases of COVID-19.,2020-08-10,"INTRODUCTION National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) recruitment in the UK is competitive. The process must prioritise patient safety while being credible, impartial and fair. During the COVID-19 pandemic, all face-to-face interviews were cancelled. Selection was based on a controversial isolated self-assessment score with no evidence checking taking place. From 2021, selection will take place entirely online. Although this has cost and time advantages, new challenges emerge. METHODS We review surgical selection as it transitions to an online format and suggest validated methods that could be adapted from High Reliability Organisations (HRO). FINDINGS Virtual selection methods include video interviewing, online examinations and aptitude testing. These tools have been used in business for many years, but their predictive value in surgery is largely unknown. In healthcare, the established online Multi-Specialty Recruitment Assessment (MSRA) examines generic professional capabilities. Its scope, however, is too limited to be used in isolation. Candidates and interviewers alike may have concerns about the technical aspects of virtual recruitment. The significance of human factors must not be overlooked in the online environment. Surgery can learn from HROs, such as aviation. Pilot and air traffic control selection is integral to ensuring safety. These organisations have already established digital selection methods for psychological aptitude, professional capabilities and manual dexterity. CONCLUSION National selection for higher surgical training (ST3+) can learn from HROs, using validated methods to prioritise patient safety while being acceptable to candidates, trainers and health service recruiters.","Hardie, J A; Green, G; Bor, R; Brennan, P A",Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England,https://doi.org/10.1308/rcsann.2021.0034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955275/,215
107990,Monitoring for opioid-induced advancing sedation and respiratory depression: ASPMN membership survey of current practice.,2014,"BACKGROUND Elective stenting for intracranial stenosis is under study as an effective means of reducing stroke risk. At most institutions, these procedures are performed and monitored after the induction of general anesthesia. OBJECTIVE To report our success with elective intracranial stenting and angioplasty performed in conscious patients after the administration of mild sedatives and local anesthetic agents. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated data from 66 patients who underwent elective intracranial stenting for atherosclerosis. Sixty-one procedures were performed under local anesthesia with mild sedation; 3 were performed under general anesthesia, and 2 were converted from local to general anesthesia during the procedure. Intraprocedural neurological changes were monitored and led to reevaluation of technique, immediate reimaging, modifying the endovascular procedure itself, or possibly mandating conversion to general anesthesia. RESULTS Thirty-nine anterior and 27 posterior circulation stenotic segments were treated. Angiographic success was achieved in 95.5% of patients with an overall reduction in stenosis of 75.5 to 22.3%. Percutaneous angioplasty and stenting were used in 58 cases; 8 patients were treated with stenting alone. Three patients (4.9%) developed neurological deficits mandating alteration or adjustment of endovascular technique or immediate postoperative management to avoid permanent sequelae. A total of 8 periprocedural complications occurred, 2 of which resulted in permanent neurological deficit. The overall mortality rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS Stenting of intracranial atherosclerosis performed under conscious sedation is associated with complication rates and effectiveness similar to historical rates for general anesthesia. Conscious sedation confers the additional benefit of continuous neurological assessment during the procedure.","Chamczuk, Andrea J; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Snyder, Kenneth V; Ohta, Hajime; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0b013e3181efbcac; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20871450/,215

METHODS In this study, 121 pediatric patients who underwent LA between July 2009 and July 2011 were included. Age and gender of the patients, the number of clips, operative time and length of hospitalization, complications, and follow-up periods were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS Of appendicular stump of a total of 121 patients who were underwent LA, 71 were closed with double polymeric clips and 50 were closed with a single polymeric clip. Patients were between the ages of 3 and 15 years (mean 8.3 years). Out of the 121 patients, 54 were female and 67 were male. The duration of the operation was ranged from 13 to 55 minutes (mean 28 minutes). Of these, 83 patients were discharged in less than 24 hours. The cost of a single clip was 10 USD. The follow-up period of patients were ranged between 1 and 23 months (mean 13 months). No operative or postoperative complications occurred depending on the application of the polymeric clip.

108760,An Evaluation of the Online Quality of Content of United States Accredited Pain Medicine Fellowship Training Programs.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE To validate the ability of a specifically developed cognitive risk score to identify patients at risk of poststroke neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) who are eligible for a comprehensive cognitive assessment. METHODS After assessing 404 patients (infarct 91.3%) in the Groupe de Réflexion pour l'Evaluation Cognitive VASCulaire (GRECogVASC) cross-sectional study with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network battery 6 months after stroke, we used multivariable logistic regression and bootstrap analyses to determine factors associated with NCDs. Independent, internally validated factors were included in a cognitive risk score. RESULTS Cognitive impairment was present in 170 of the 320 patients with a Rankin Scale score ≥1. The backward logistic regression selected 4 factors (≥73% of the permutations): NIH Stroke Scale score on admission ≥7 (odds ratio [OR] 2.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.3, p = 0.005), multiple strokes (OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.6-8, p = 0.002), adjusted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSEadj) score ≤27 (OR 6.69, 95% CI 3.9-11.6, p = 0.0001), and Fazekas score ≥2 (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.3-4.2, p = 0.004). The cognitive risk score computed with these 4 factors provided good calibration, discrimination (overoptimism-corrected C = 0.793), and goodness of fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p = 0.99). A combination of Rankin Scale score ≥1, cognitive risk score ≥1, and MMSEadj score ≥21 selected 230 (56.9%) of the 404 patients for a comprehensive assessment. This procedure yielded good sensitivity (96.5%) and moderate specificity (43%; positive predictive value 0.66, negative predictive value 0.91) and was more accurate (p ≤ 0.03 for all) than the sole use of screening tests (MMSE or Montréal Cognitive Assessment). CONCLUSION The GRECogVASC cognitive risk score comprises 4 easily documented factors; this procedure helps to identify patients at risk of poststroke NCDs who must therefore undergo a comprehensive assessment.

Comorbidities such as diabetes and ischemic heart disease affect both results of invasive treatment and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) negatively. It is unknown how chronic widespread pain (CWP) influences the results of invasive treatment. We evaluated the influence of CWP on HRQoL in patients undergoing invasive (open surgery or endovascular treatment) and noninvasive BMT of IC. Methods A total of 242 patients with IC treated with invasive or noninvasive methods responded to the validated HRQoL questionnaires Short Form 36 Health Survey, EuroQoL 5-dimensions, and distribution of pain with the Epipain questionnaire at baseline and after 12 months. Results Invasively treated patients without CWP improved in all primary outcome measures. Patients with CWP reported significant improvements in most of the HRQoL-related outcome measures after invasive treatment, but patients with CWP in the noninvasive treatment group did not improve in any HRQoL-related outcome measure. Conclusions The presence of CWP not should be a cause to withhold invasive treatment in patients with IC.","Lindgren, Hans Iv; Pärsson, Håkan; Gottsäter, Anders; Bergman, Stefan",Clinical Medicine Insights.

Diverting FW into the sewer system is considered promising to tackle the FW issue. However, the transformation of FW in sewers and its impact on the sewer process have not received adequate attention due to the overlooked sewer networks. In this study, a laboratory-scale sewer reactor system was established to investigate the transformation of FW and the production of sulfide and methane under anaerobic conditions. The transformation of FW in the sewer reactor could result in an increase in the substrate level through hydrolyzing and converting biodegradable substances into preferred substrates. Moreover, the generated substrates from the addition of FW were preferable for the metabolism of key microbes in sewer biofilms. As a result, methane production from the sewer reactor could be enhanced from the addition of FW, whereas sulfide production was not affected at a low sulfate concentration. The findings of this study suggest that the diversion of FW may exert an adverse impact on sewers and the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emission. Hence, more research is necessary to clarify the detailed impacts on FW management and wastewater treatment.","Zan, Feixiang; Dai, Ji; Jiang, Feng; Chan, Richard C; Chen, Guanghao",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2020.175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32460287/,215

METHODS We performed a cross-sectional document review within two purposively selected clusters (one poorly-resourced and one well-resourced), from each arm of a cluster-randomized trial at two different time points: before and during the trial. The total trial consisted of 16 clusters randomized into 8 intervention and 8 control clusters to assess the impact of an mCDMSS on neonatal mortality in Ghana. We evaluated health workers' adherence (expressed as percentages) to birth asphyxia, neonatal jaundice and cord sepsis protocols by reviewing medical records of neonatal in-patients using a checklist. Differences in adherence to neonatal health protocols within and between the study arms were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and permutation tests for each morbidity type. In addition, we tracked concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the clusters during the 18-month intervention period. RESULTS In the intervention arm, mean adherence was 35.2% (SD = 5.8%) and 43.6% (SD = 27.5%) for asphyxia; 25.0% (SD = 14.8%) and 39.3% (SD = 27.7%) for jaundice; 52.0% (SD = 11.0%) and 75.0% (SD = 21.2%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. In the control arm, mean adherence was 52.9% (SD = 16.4%) and 74.5% (SD = 14.7%) for asphyxia; 45.1% (SD = 12.8%) and 64.6% (SD = 8.2%) for jaundice; 53.8% (SD = 16.0%) and 60.8% (SD = 11.7%) for cord sepsis protocols in the pre-intervention and intervention periods respectively. We observed nonsignificant improvement in protocol adherence in the intervention clusters but significant improvement in protocol adherence in the control clusters. There were 2 concurrent neonatal health improvement activities in the intervention clusters and over 12 in the control clusters during the intervention period. CONCLUSION Whether mHealth interventions can improve adherence to neonatal health protocols in low-resource settings cannot be ascertained by this study. Neonatal health improvement activities are however likely to improve protocol adherence. Future mHealth evaluations of protocol adherence must account for other concurrent interventions in study contexts.","Amoakoh, Hannah Brown; Klipstein-Grobusch, Kerstin; Agyepong, Irene Akua; Amoakoh-Coleman, Mary; Kayode, Gbenga A; Reitsma, J B; Grobbee, Diederick E; Ansah, Evelyn K",BMC pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-020-02378-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243172/,215

In our study, we systematically analyzed molecular correlates of pancreatic cancer by bioinformatic analysis. We characterized differentially expressed analysis based on the TCGA pancreatic cancer dataset. Then, univariate Cox regression was employed to screen out overall survival- (OS-) related DEGs. Based on these genes, we established a risk signature by the multivariate Cox regression model. The ICGC cohort and GSE62452 cohort were used to validate the reliability of the risk signature. The impact of T lymphocyte-related genes from risk signature was confirmed in PC. Here, we observed the correlation between the T lymphocyte-related genes and the expression level of targeted therapy. We established a five-mRNA (LY6D, ANLN, ZNF488, MYEOV, and SCN11A) prognostic risk signature. Next, we identified ANLN and MYEOV that were associated with T lymphocyte infiltrations (P < 0.05). High ANLN and MYEOV expression levels had a poorer prognosis in decreased T lymphocyte subgroup in PC. Correlation analysis between ANLN and MYEOV and immunomodulators showed that ANLN and MYEOV may have potential value in pancreatic cancer immunotherapy.","Li, Ziang; Hu, Chang; Yang, Zhiqiang; Yang, Minlan; Fang, Jiayu; Zhou, Xuhong",Computational and mathematical methods in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5549298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394706/,215

The purpose of this study is to directly compare the biocompatibility profiles of five different biologic meshes, AlloDerm(®) (non-crosslinked human dermal matrix), PeriGuard(®) (crosslinked bovine pericardium), Permacol(®) (crosslinked porcine dermal matrix), Strattice(®) (non-crosslinked porcine dermal matrix), and Veritas(®) (non-crosslinked bovine pericardium), using a porcine model of ventral hernia repair. METHODS Full-thickness fascial defects were created in 20 Yucatan minipigs and repaired with the retromuscular placement of biologic mesh 3 weeks later. Animals were euthanized at 1 month and the repair sites were subjected to tensile testing and histologic analysis. Samples of unimplanted (de novo) meshes and native porcine abdominal wall were also analyzed for their mechanical properties. RESULTS There were no significant differences in the biomechanical characteristics between any of the mesh-repaired sites at 1 month postimplantation or between the native porcine abdominal wall without implanted mesh and the mesh-repaired sites (P > 0.05 for all comparisons). Histologically, non-crosslinked materials exhibited greater cellular infiltration, extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and neovascularization compared to crosslinked meshes. CONCLUSIONS While crosslinking differentiates biologic meshes with regard to cellular infiltration, ECM deposition, scaffold degradation, and neovascularization, the integrity and strength of the repair site at 1 month is not significantly impacted by crosslinking or by the de novo strength/stiffness of the mesh.","Melman, L; Jenkins, E D; Hamilton, N A; Bender, L C; Brodt, M D; Deeken, C R; Greco, S C; Frisella, M M; Matthews, B D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-010-0770-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21222009/,215

T cells play a critical role in the cellular immune response against viral infections. We aimed to reveal the relationship between T cell subsets and disease severity. METHODS 40 COVID-19 patients were randomly recruited in this cross-sectional study. All cases were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Patients were divided into two equivalent groups, one severe and one nonsevere. Clinical, laboratory and flow cytometric data were obtained from both clinical groups and compared. RESULTS Lymphocyte subsets, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, memory CD4+ T cells, memory CD8+ T cells, naive CD4+ T cells, effector memory CD4+ T cells, central memory CD4+ T cells, and CD3+CD4+ CD25+ T cells were significantly lower in severe patients. The naive T cell/CD4 + EM T cell ratio, which is an indicator of the differentiation from naive T cells to memory cells, was relatively reduced in severe disease. Peripheral CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells were notably lower in severe presentations of the disease (median DP T cells 11.12 µL vs 1.95 µL; p< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS As disease severity increases in COVID-19 infection, the number of T cell subsets decreases significantly. Suppression of differentiation from naive T cells to effector memory T cells is the result of severe impairment in adaptive immune functions. Peripheral CD4+CD8+ double-positive T cells were significantly reduced in severe disease presentations and may be a useful marker to predict disease severity.","Kalpakci, Yasin; Hacibekiroglu, Tuba; Trak, Gulay; Karacaer, Cengiz; Demirci, Taner; Kocayigit, Havva; Sunu, Cenk; Varim, Ceyhun; Falay, Mesude",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,https://doi.org/10.1590/1806-9282.66.12.1666; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33331574/,215

116747,Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from cross-sectional viral load distributions.,2021-06-03,"OBJECTIVES Renal near-infrared spectroscopy is known to be predictive of acute kidney injury in children following cardiac surgery using a series of complex equations and area under the curve. This study was performed to determine if a greater than or equal to 20% reduction in renal near-infrared spectroscopy for 20 consecutive minutes intraoperatively or within the first 24 postoperative hours is associated with 1) acute kidney injury, 2) increased acute kidney injury biomarkers, or 3) other adverse clinical outcomes in children following cardiac surgery. DESIGN Prospective single center observational study. SETTING Pediatric cardiac ICU. PATIENTS Children less than or equal to age 4 years who underwent cardiac surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass during the study period (June 2011-July 2012). INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A reduction in near-infrared spectroscopy was not associated with acute kidney injury. Nine of 12 patients (75%) with a reduction in renal near-infrared spectroscopy did not develop acute kidney injury. The remaining three patients had mild acute kidney injury (pediatric Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End stage-Risk). A reduction in renal near-infrared spectroscopy was associated with the following adverse clinical outcomes: 1) a longer duration of mechanical ventilation (p = 0.05), 2) longer intensive care length of stay (p = 0.05), and 3) longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.01). A decline in renal near-infrared spectroscopy in combination with an increase in serum interleukin-6 and serum interleukin-8 was associated with a longer intensive care length of stay, and the addition of urine interleukin-18 to this was associated with a longer hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, the rate of acute kidney injury was much lower than anticipated thereby limiting the evaluation of a reduction in renal near-infrared spectroscopy as a predictor of acute kidney injury. A greater than or equal to 20% reduction in renal near-infrared spectroscopy was significantly associated with adverse outcomes in children following cardiac surgery. The addition of specific biomarkers to the model was predictive of worse outcomes in these patients. Thus, real-time evaluation of renal near-infrared spectroscopy using the specific levels of change of a 20% reduction for 20 minutes may be useful in predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation and other adverse outcomes in children undergoing cardiac surgery.","Gist, Katja M; Kaufman, Jonathan; da Cruz, Eduardo M; Friesen, Robert H; Crumback, Sheri L; Linders, Megan; Edelstein, Charles; Altmann, Christopher; Palmer, Claire; Jalal, Diana; Faubel, Sarah",Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,https://doi.org/10.1097/pcc.0000000000000674; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26914625/,215

However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO2 emissions, with consequent high-risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues; the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO2 captured in the growth of biomass equates to one ton of CO2 sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO2 is emitted by variable amounts during the life cycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political, and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?","Jones, Michael B; Albanito, Fabrizio",Global change biology,https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726492/,215
118849,Obesity Is a Risk Factor for Greater COVID-19 Severity.,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND TMPRSS2 is a host co-receptor for cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. One prior report suggested that use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which downregulates TMPRSS2, may protect men with prostate cancer from infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS Cohort study of a prospective registry of all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 12 and June 10, 2020, with complete follow-up until disease recovery or death. The main exposure examined was the use of ADT, and the outcome measures were the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positivity and disease severity as a function of ADT use. RESULTS The study cohort consisted of 1,779 men with prostate cancer from a total tested population of 74,787, of whom 4,885 (6.5%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of those with prostate cancer, 102 (5.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 304 (17.1%) were on ADT. Among those on ADT, 5.6% were positive as compared to 5.8% not on ADT. Men on ADT were slightly older (75.5 vs. 73.8 years, p=.009), more likely to have smoked (68.1% vs. 59.3%, p =.005), and more likely to report taking steroids (43.8% vs. 23.3%, p < .001). Other factors known to increase both risk of infection and disease severity were equally distributed (asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and immune suppressive disease). Multivariable analysis did not indicate a difference in infection risk for those with prostate cancer on ADT (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54-1.61, p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS ADT does not appear to be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Klein, Eric A; Li, Jianbo; Milinovich, Alex; Schold, Jesse D; Sharifi, Nima; Kattan, Michael W; Jehi, Lara",The Journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/ju.0000000000001338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32897764/,215

ANO1-AS2 (linc02584), as an lncRNA is located near the anoctamin1 (ANO1) gene. ANO1 is an important component of the transmembrane system exhibiting expression modifications in the idiopathic infertile men. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between ANO1-AS2 and ANO1 gene expression with sperm motility and morphology in the patients with asthenozoospermia (AZ) and terato- asthenozoospermia (TAZ). The study population included 32 patients with AZ, 35 patients with TAZ, and 34 people with normozoospermia (NZ, control). The expression levels of ANO1 gene and ANO1-AS2 in the spermatozoa were measured by the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Docking analysis was performed to investigate the interactions of the ANO1 gene promoter and intermediate elements with ANO1-AS2. ANO1 gene expression was significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in the patients however; ANO1-AS2 expression was significantly upregulated (P < 0.05). The subsequent analysis confirmed the inverse correlation between ANO1 and ANO1-AS2. ANO1 gene expression level was significantly positively correlated with sperm motility and morphology (P < 0.05). Moreover, ANO1-AS2 expression showed an inverse correlation with sperm motility and morphology (P < 0.05). Docking analysis confirmed that ANO1-AS2 could stably interact with ANO1 gene promoter. In conclusion, ANO1-AS2 is likely to downregulate the ANO1 gene by interacting with ANO1 gene promoter, which can influence the sperm motility and morphology.","Saberiyan, Mohammadreza; Mirfakhraie, Reza; Gholami, Delnya; Dehdehi, Leila; Teimori, Hossein",Experimental and molecular pathology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2020.104528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916161/,215

The E protein is made in excess during infection and has been shown to have ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers. However, a role in infection for the unincorporated E or its ion channel activity has not been described. To further investigate the function of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) E protein, we developed a recombinant version of IBV in which the E protein was replaced by a mutant containing a heterologous hydrophobic domain. The mutant virus, IBV-EG3, was defective in release of infectious virus particles. Further characterization of IBV-EG3 revealed that damaged particles appeared to accumulate intracellularly. The phenotype of IBV-EG3 suggested that the hydrophobic domain of IBV E may be important for the forward trafficking of cargo, so we determined whether IBV E facilitated the delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane. Surprisingly, we found that IBV E, but not EG3, dramatically reduced the delivery of cargo to the plasma membrane by impeding movement through the Golgi complex. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of IBV E, but not EG3, induced the disassembly of the Golgi complex. Finally, we determined that the delivery of IBV S to the plasma membrane was reduced in cells infected with wild-type-IBV compared to those infected with IBV-EG3. Our results indicated that the hydrophobic domain of IBV E alters the host secretory pathway to the apparent advantage of the virus.","Ruch, Travis R; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01570-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21047962/,215

After postoperative day 6, tissue samples were histologically examined. There were no significant differences in preoperative parameters between the groups. Fibrin production was higher in sealant groups compared with the HPC and CSC groups (both p < 0.001). Hepatocellular regeneration in sealant groups was higher than in both control groups. A significantly higher regeneration was seen in the FBS group. Use of sealants increased the degree of fibrin exudation at the resection plane.

Many methods for closure of the PF exist including sutures, tacks, and staples. We hypothesized that patients who had PF closure with suture would have better short-term QOL outcomes. METHODS AND PROCEDURES A prospective institutional hernia-specific database was queried for all adult, TAPP IHRs from July 2012 to August 2013. Unilateral and bilateral patients were included and each hernia was analyzed separately. The main outcome of interest was quality of life (QOL) at two- and four-week follow-up, as measured by the Carolinas Comfort Scale. RESULTS There were 227 patients who underwent TAPP, with 99 bilateral and 128 unilateral IHR, for a total of 326 IHR. PF closure was performed using tacks in 45.1%, suture in 19.0%, and staples in 35.9%. Patient characteristics were statistically similar between the tack, suture, and staple group. There were 32.9% direct, 46.5% indirect, and 20.6% pantaloon hernias, which were not significantly different when compared by PF closure method. Post-operative complications and length of stay were same for the three groups. There were no hernia recurrences. Post-operative activity limitation at two weeks was significantly better in the suture group when compared to the stapled group (p = 0.005). Additionally, sutured PF closure had less early post-operative pain when compared to the tack group (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS Following TAPP IHR, suture closure of the PF significantly improves 2-week post-operative movement limitation compared to stapled and tacked PF closure.

Problems in the global HRH supply and distribution are an obstacle to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals and other health outcomes. The Pacific Island region, covering 20,000 to 30,000 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, is suffering a serious HRH crisis. Yet updated evidence and data are not available for the 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories. The objective of this study was thus to explore the current HRH situation in the Pacific Island region, focusing particularly on the issue of health workforce migration. HRH trends and gaps differ by country, with some showing increases in HRH density over the past 20 years whereas others have made negligible progress. Currently, three Pacific Island countries are facing critical HRH shortages, a worsening of the situation from 2006, when HRH issues were first brought to widespread global attention. In this region, skilled personnel migration is a major issue contributing to the limited availability of HRH. Political commitment from source and destination countries to strengthen HRH would be a key factor toward increasing efforts to train new health personnel and to implement effective retention strategies.","Yamamoto, T S; Sunguya, B F; Shiao, L W; Amiya, R M; Saw, Y M; Jimba, M",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/1010539512453259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22815302/,215

Current approaches for acquiring information regarding microbiota/metabolites have limitations. We aimed to develop a precise magnetically controlled sampling capsule endoscope (MSCE) for the convenient, non-invasive and accurate acquisition of digestive bioinformation for disease diagnosis and evaluation. DESIGN The MSCE and surgery were both used for sampling both jejunal and ileal GI content in the control and antibiotic-induced diarrhoea groups. The GI content was then used for microbiome profiling and metabolomics profiling. RESULTS Compared with surgery, our data showed that the MSCE precisely acquired data regarding the intestinal flora and metabolites, which was effectively differentiated in different intestinal regions and disease models. Using MSCE, we detected a dramatic decrease in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria and Actinobacteria and hippuric acid levels, as well as an increase in the abundance of Escherichia-Shigella and the 2-pyrrolidinone levels were detected in the antibiotic-induced diarrhoea model by MSCE. MSCE-mediated sampling revealed specific gut microbiota/metabolites including Enterococcus, Lachnospiraceae, acetyl-L-carnitine and succinic acid, which are related to metabolic diseases, cancers and nervous system disorders. Additionally, the MSCE exhibited good sealing characteristics with no contamination after sampling.

We tried to define the clinical characteristics, risk factors, laboratory, and imagining results of neonates with community-acquired COVID-19. METHODS This prospective multicentered cohort study included 24 neonatal intensive care units around Turkey, wherein outpatient neonates with COVID-19 were registered in an online national database. Full-term and premature neonates diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in the study, whether hospitalized or followed up as ambulatory patients. Neonates without severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing or whose mothers had been diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy were excluded. RESULTS Thirty-seven symptomatic neonates were included. The most frequent findings were fever, hypoxemia, and cough (49%, 41%, 27%, respectively). Oxygen administration (41%) and noninvasive ventilation (16%) were frequently required; however, mechanical ventilation (3%) was rarely needed. Median hospitalization was 11 days (1-35 days). One patient with Down syndrome and congenital cardiovascular disorders died in the study period. C-reactive protein (CRP) and prothrombin time (PT) levels were found to be higher in patients who needed supplemental oxygen (0.9 [0.1-8.6] vs. 5.8 [0.3-69.2] p = 0.002, 11.9 [10.1-17.2] vs. 15.2 [11.7-18.0] p = 0.01, respectively) or who were severe/critical (1.0 [0.01-8.6] vs. 4.5 [0.1-69.2] p = 0.01, 11.7 [10.1-13.9] vs. 15.0 [11.7-18.0] p = 0.001, respectively).

OBJECTIVE Our aim was to evaluate the predictive values and the most powerful predictive combinations of single aEEG and NIRS parameters and the respective cut-off values with regard to short-term outcomes in HIE II. METHODS aEEG and NIRS were prospectively studied at the Medical University of Vienna in the first 102 h of life with regard to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-two neonates diagnosed with HIE II treated with hypothermia were investigated. The measurement period was divided into 6-h epochs. According to MRI, 2 outcome groups were defined and predictive values of aEEG parameters, regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), and the additional value of both methods combined were studied. Receiver operating curves (ROC) were obtained and area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated. ROC were then used to detect the optimal cut-off points, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values. RESULTS At all time epochs, combined parameter scores were more predictive than single parameter scores. The highest AUC were observed between 18 and 60 h of cooling for the aEEG summation score (0.72-0.84) and for (background pattern + seizures) × rScO2 (0.79-0.85). At 42-60 h sensitivity was similar between those 2 scores (87.5-90.0%), but the addition of NIRS to aEEG led to an increase in specificity (from 52.4-59.1% to 72.7-90.5%). CONCLUSIONS In HIE II, aEEG and NIRS are important predictors of short-term outcome. The combination of both methods improves prognostication.

123365,Polyester Mesh Dressings Reduce Delayed Wound Healing and Reoperations Compared with Silver-Impregnated Occlusive Dressings after Knee Arthroplasty.,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE To analyse if patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) subjected to cataract surgery differ in outcome compared to patients without DR with regard to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), deviation from target refraction, intraoperative difficulties and risk of complications. METHODS A register-based study from the Swedish National Cataract Register (NCR) during the years 2015-2017 including 358 040 cataract procedures. Patients with other ocular pathology than cataract and DR were omitted from outcome analyses. RESULTS Diabetic retinopathy was reported in 13 724 of all eyes (3.8%). Preoperative BCVA was significantly worse in DR patients than in patients without DR, 0.54 ± 0.33 compared to 0.40 ± 0.27 (logMAR, mean ± SD, p < 0.001). The same was evident for postoperative BCVA, 0.15 ± 0.25 for DR patients versus 0.06 ± 0.13 (p < 0.001). The improvement in BCVA was slightly better in DR than in non-DR, -0.40 ± 0.32 (logMAR; mean ± SD) versus -0.35 ± 0.27, p < 0.001. The absolute mean biometry prediction error was 0.42 ± 0.50 diopters (D) in DR and 0.43 ± 0.71 D in non-DR patients, p = 0.768. One or more intraoperative difficulties, including mechanical pupil dilation, capsular stain, hooks at capsulorhexis margin or capsular tension ring, had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-1.90, p < 0.001) in DR versus non-DR cases and the rate of posterior capsular tears (PCR) had an adjusted OR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.40-2.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Eyes with DR have inferior pre- and postoperative BCVA compared to non-DR eyes. There is little difference in improvement of BCVA and no difference in absolute mean biometry prediction error. Importantly, intraoperative difficulties and PCRs are almost twice as common in DR patients, strongly indicating that these patients should be managed by experienced surgeons.","Ridderskär, Lucas; Montan, Per; Kugelberg, Maria; Nilsson, Ingela; Lundström, Mats; Behndig, Anders; Zetterberg, Madeleine",Acta ophthalmologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34047075/,215

124121,Controversy over Smoking in COVID-19 - A Real World Experience in New York City.,2020-12-15,"CONTEXT Cold-water immersion is recommended for the immediate field treatment of exertional heat stroke. However, concerns exist over potential overcooling of hyperthermic individuals during cold-water immersion. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the recommendation that removing previously hyperthermic individuals from a cold-water bath at a rectal temperature (T(re)) of 38.6°C would attenuate overcooling. DESIGN Controlled laboratory study. SETTING University research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS Participants included 6 men and 4 women (age = 22 ± 3 years, height = 172 ± 10 cm, mass = 67.8 ± 10.7 kg, body fat percentage = 17.1% ± 4.5%, maximum oxygen consumption = 59.3 ± 8.7 mL·kg(-1)·min(-1)). INTERVENTION(S) After exercising at an ambient temperature of 40.0°C for 38.5 ± 9.4 minutes, until T(re) reached 39.5°C, participants were immersed in a 2.0°C circulated water bath until T(re) decreased to either 37.5°C or 38.6°C. Subsequently, participants were removed from the water bath and recovered for 20 minutes at an ambient temperature of 25°C. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Rectal and esophageal temperatures were measured continuously during the immersion and recovery periods. RESULTS Because of the experimental design, the overall time of immersion was greater during the 37.5°C trial (16.6 ± 5.7 minutes) than the 38.6°C trial (8.8 ± 2.6 minutes) (t(9) = -4.740, P = .001). During the recovery period after cold-water immersion, both rectal (F(1,9) = 50.540, P < .001) and esophageal (F(1,6) = 20.365, P = .007) temperatures remained greater in the 38.6°C trial than in the 37.5°C trial. This was evidenced by low points of 36.47°C ± 0.70°C and 37.19°C ± 0.71°C for rectal temperature (t(9) = 2.975, P = .016) and of 35.67°C ± 1.27°C and 36.72°C ± 0.95°C for esophageal temperature (t(6) = 3.963, P = .007) during the recovery period of the 37.5°C and 38.6°C trials, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Immersion for approximately 9 minutes to a rectal temperature cooling limit of 38.6°C negated any risk associated with overcooling hyperthermic individuals when they were immersed in 2°C water.","Gagnon, Daniel; Lemire, Bruno B; Casa, Douglas J; Kenny, Glen P",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-45.5.439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20831387/,215

With the number of emerging viral diseases increasing the last decades, there is a growing need for appropriate animal models for virus studies. The relevance of animal models can be limited in terms of mimicking human pathophysiology. In this review, we discuss the utility of animal models for studies of influenza A viruses, HIV and SARS-CoV in light of viral emergence, assessment of infection and transmission risks, and regulatory decision making. We address their relevance and limitations. The susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics may differ between the various animal models. These complexities may thwart translating results from animal experiments to the humans. Within these constraints, animal models are very informative for studying virus immunopathology and transmission modes and for translation of virus research into clinical benefit.

With minimal time to adapt, all programs transitioned to virtual interviews. Here we describe the experience of both program directors (PDs) and candidates with virtual interviews, and provide guidelines for implementation based on the results. METHODS Surveys regarding interview day specifics and perceptions were created for CGSO fellowship PDs and candidates. They were distributed at the conclusion of the season, prior to match. RESULTS Thirty (94%) PDs and 64 (79%) candidates responded. Eighty-three% of PDs and 79% of candidates agreed or strongly agreed that they felt comfortable creating a rank list. If given the choice, 60% of PDs and 45% of candidates would choose virtual interviews over in-person interviews. The majority of candidates found PD overviews, fellows only sessions and pre-interview materials helpful. CONCLUSION Overall, the majority of PDs and candidates felt comfortable creating a rank list; however, more PDs preferred virtual interviews for the future.

Seeing the vast impact of the pandemic and knowing its roots as a zoonotic disease, he realized this approach was critical to his medical education and for preparation against future novel infectious diseases. Zoonotic diseases have been emerging into human populations with increasing frequency, leading to public health emergencies such as Ebola, Avian Influenza, and SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 narrative, starting in bats then mutating through an intermediate host into humans, is another striking example of the interconnectedness between human, animal, and ecosystem health that underlies these infections. Preventing future pandemics will require a transdisciplinary One Health approach, and physicians should be prepared to participate in these discussions while advocating for One Health initiatives for the benefit of their current and future patients. Integration of One Health education into medical school curricula will also prepare future physicians for other complex and urgently important health issues such as climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and the impact of biodiversity loss. As the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, education in One Health must become a priority; it is essential to break down the conventional disciplinary silos of human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, public health, and the social sciences, so that future health crises can be prevented and mitigated collaboratively.","Dykstra, Michael P; Baitchman, Eric J",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33769340/,215

Methods In this study, as noted between 2010 and 2018, there were 77 PPPDs which were performed at our hospital by one surgeon. We began the circular stapled method from 2014, and continue with this procedure for the aforementioned surgeries including and up to today. The clinical data for the study were collected retrospectively to compare clinical outcomes of the two methods, the circular stapled anastomosis and the hand - sewn anastomosis. Results There were 34 patients in a circular stapled group, and 43 in a hand-sewn group as identified for this study. The delayed gastric emptying (DGE) occurred in 6 (17.64%) patients in the circular stapled group, and 10 (23.3%) in the hand-sewn group (p=0.547). It is noted that there was a serum albumin level measured on the 14th day after the operation, which was significantly high in the circular stapled group (3.41±0.47 (g/dl) vs 2.92±0.39 (g/dl), p<0.001). There were no significant differences in terms of the incidence of postoperative complications (58.8% vs 58.1%, p=0.952) and mortality rates (5.9% vs 0, p=0.192) among the patient participants in this study. Conclusions We conclude that using a circular stapler for the DJ procedure in PPPDs do not increase the development of a DGE, and is also helpful for the benefit of the patient's nutritional status going forward during recovery from the operation.","Kim, Dong-Hwan; Hong, Soon-Chan; Jang, Jae-Yool; Cho, Jin-Kyu; Ju, Young-Tae; Lee, Young-Joon; Jung, Eun-Jung; Jeong, Sang-Ho; Park, Tae-Jin; Kim, Ju-Yeon; Kwag, Seung-Jin; Park, Ji-Ho; Jeong, Chi-Young",Annals of hepato-biliary-pancreatic surgery,https://doi.org/10.14701/ahbps.2019.23.3.245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501813/,215

129152,Clinical and Therapeutic Approach to Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Pediatric Cohort in Portugal.,2021-03-12,"PURPOSE To evaluate the frequency, risk factors, and clinical significance of aggressive intrasegmental recurrence (AIR) found after radiofrequency (RF) ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study. Between March 2005 and December 2010, 539 patients (414 men, 125 women; mean age, 57.91 years; age range, 30-82 years) underwent ultrasonography-guided percutaneous RF ablation as a first-line treatment for a single HCC classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A. AIR of HCC was defined as (a) initial tumor recurrence with disease-free status at least 6 months after initial RF ablation and (b) the simultaneous development of multiple nodular (at least three) or infiltrative tumor recurrence in the treated segment. Patients were stratified into two groups: those with AIR (n = 20) and those without AIR (n = 519) during follow-up. Risk factors for AIR were assessed with logistic regression analysis, and risk factors for long-term overall survival were assessed with time-dependent Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS In a median follow-up period of 49 months (range, 6-95 months), AIR was observed in 3.7% of the patients (20 of 539 patients), with the frequency increasing to 15% in the subgroup with periportal HCC (11 of 72 patients). AIRs manifested as either multiple nodular type (n = 14, BCLC stage A or B) or diffusely infiltrative type with tumor thrombus formation (n = 6, BCLC stage C). At multivariate analysis, periportal tumor location and younger patient age were significant risk factors for AIR. The presence of AIR during the follow-up period has a significant effect on the overall survival rate (hazard ratio = 5.72, P = .002). CONCLUSION The overall frequency of AIR after RF ablation for HCC was low, with periportal location and patient age showing a significant relationship to the development of AIR. The occurrence of AIR had an adverse effect on overall survival rate.","Kang, Tae Wook; Lim, Hyo Keun; Lee, Min Woo; Kim, Young-Sun; Rhim, Hyunchul; Lee, Won Jae; Gwak, Geum-Youn; Paik, Yong Han; Lim, Ho Yeong; Kim, Min Ji",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.15141215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25734550/,215

DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS 16 dogs, from 3 Chicago area shelters, naturally infected with canine influenza A H3N2 virus. PROCEDURES Medical records of 16 affected dogs were reviewed. Nasal swab specimens from each dog had been tested periodically for a minimum of 15 days following an initial positive real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) assay result for influenza A virus shedding. Amplicons were purified, quantified, and sequenced by the Sanger DNA sequencing technique. Virus isolation and sequence results of canine influenza A H3N2 virus from nasal swab specimens were obtained in conjunction with signalment, description of clinical signs, type of treatment, and outcome. RESULTS Viruses from each dog were identified as canine influenza A H3N2 virus on the basis of DNA sequencing. The interval between first and last positive rRT-PCR assay results ranged from 13 to 24 days, whereas the time interval from first reported clinical signs to last positive assay results ranged from 15 to 26 days. Isolation of canine influenza A H3N2 virus was successful in the late shedding period from nasal swab specimens of 4 dogs at 15 and 20 days after the first positive rRT-PCR assay result and 18 to 20 days after the first clinical signs. Clinical signs resolved for all dogs that remained in the shelters during the testing period. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Dogs infected with H3N2 virus should be isolated for a period of ≥ 21 days following onset of illness. Even when resolution of clinical signs occurs sooner than 21 days, shedding of H3N2 virus may persist.","Newbury, Sandra; Godhardt-Cooper, Jennifer; Poulsen, Keith P; Cigel, Francine; Balanoff, Laura; Toohey-Kurth, Kathy",Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,https://doi.org/10.2460/javma.248.9.1022; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27074610/,215

We aimed to study the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in SLE women and detect its association with depression, functional disability and quality of life. METHODS This study included 94 SLE females. Ninety-eight control females agreed to participate. Patients and controls answered a written form of the Arabic version of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and Short Form 36 (SF-36). Disease activity and damage were assessed using the SLE Disease Activity Index and the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/American College of Rheumatology Damage Index. RESULTS The frequency of sexual dysfunction was similar in the patients and control groups (77.7% versus 82.7%) while the BDI, HAQ-DI and SF-36 scores were significantly worse in SLE patients. SLE patients with and without sexual dysfunction differed in neither disease characteristics nor disease activity and damage indices. The FSFI showed a strong positive correlation with SF-36, and strong inverse correlations with BDI and HAQ-DI in the patients group while it had a weaker positive correlation with SF-36 and no correlations with the other two indices in the control group. CONCLUSION No significant difference was found in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction between SLE patients and controls. Sexual dysfunction in SLE patients is mostly related to depression, poor functional status, increased pain, poor health perception and bad quality of life. Neither disease activity nor damage contributes significantly to sexual dysfunction in lupus females.","Dorgham, Dalia; Haggag, Hisham M; Attia, Doaa Hs",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/0961203320935518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32605530/,215

Method: between 2016 and 2018 seven patients were submitted to minimally invasive partial adrenalectomy in Ponderas Academic Hospital. Results: the median age at the time of surgery was 56 years (range 42-67 years) while the indications for partial adrenalectomy (PA) were represented by Conn's syndrome in four cases, bilateral pheochromocytoma in one cases and nonfunctional adrenal tumors in two cases. Preoperatively successful adrenal vein sampling was performed in one case. The indocyanine green test (ICG) as well as intraoperative ultrasound were used each in three cases. The transperitoneal approach was used for PA in all patients, laparoscopic in five and robotic assisted in two patients. No conversion to open surgery or to total suprarenalectomy was encountered. Conclusions: minimally invasive surgery seems to be a safe and effective method to perform partial adrenalectomy.

However, seagrass belowground production and decomposition have rarely been quantified in the field. To assess the significance of seagrass belowground production to carbon sequestration, belowground carbon budgets were constructed in intertidal seagrass beds of the late-successional species Thalassia hemprichii and the early-successional species Haloduleuninervis in southern Taiwan. For both species, the turnover rates of the belowground portions were much longer than that of the aboveground portion, so the belowground biomass was much higher than the aboveground biomass. The leaf productivity of both species was significantly higher than the belowground productivity, but most of the leaf production decomposed within a year. The lower turnover and slower decomposition rates of the belowground portions allowed the late-successional seagrass T. hemprichii to store more carbon in the sediments than the early-successional seagrass H. uninervis. Long-term changes for the past 20 years in the sediment depth showed that the sediments of seagrass beds were increasing in the habitats at low elevation but were decreasing or had no clear trends in the habitats at high elevation or on the windward side. The carbon storage rates according to the belowground production of T. hemprichii and H. uninervis were 0.3-4.7 and 1.5-2.3 g C m-2 yr-1, respectively, which can potentially contribute 53% of the long-term organic carbon storage in the low-elevation sediments.","Zou, Yi-Fang; Chen, Kuan-Yu; Lin, Hsing-Juh",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149579; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399336/,215

We characterized direct interactions of a whole nonenveloped virus (simian virus 40), as well as those of the hepatitis delta enveloped virus large form antigen, with candidate host receptors expressed on the MPA. Selected newly discovered membrane protein-pathogen interactions were validated by conventional methods, demonstrating that the MPA is an important tool for cellular receptor discovery and for understanding pathogen tropism.","Glick, Yair; Ben-Ari, Ya'ara; Drayman, Nir; Pellach, Michal; Neveu, Gregory; Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Avrahami, Dorit; Einav, Shirit; Oppenheim, Ariella; Gerber, Doron",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1518698113; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27044079/,215

Our study aimed to examine and compare the safety, feasibility and potential beneficial effects of individual moderate endurance and moderate muscle training in patients with Crohn's disease. METHODS Quiescent or mildly active (Crohn's disease activity index <220) patients with Crohn's disease were randomly allocated to either a control, endurance, or muscle training group. Participants exercised individually for 3 months three times per week. Endpoints included dropout rate, disease activity, inflammatory parameters including faecal calprotectin, anthropometric data, quality of life, physical activity and strength. RESULTS A total of 45 patients with Crohn's disease were randomly allocated. In the endurance group (n = 17), the dropout rate was significantly higher (47% vs. 13%) compared with the muscle group (n = 15). In both groups the maximal and average strength in the upper and lower extremities increased significantly (all P < 0.04). In the endurance group emotional function was significantly improved (P = 0.03). Statistically significant changes of disease activity and other outcome parameters were not observed in this pilot cohort. CONCLUSION Both individual moderate endurance and muscle training can be safely performed in patients with mild or quiescent Crohn's disease. Muscle training appears more feasible and may be favoured. Both forms of exercise have beneficial effects on strength. Quality of life increased in both intervention groups, although statistical significance was only reached in one subgroup.","Seeger, Wolfgang Alexander; Thieringer, Juliane; Esters, Philip; Allmendinger, Benjamin; Stein, Jürgen; Schulze, Hermann; Dignass, Axel",United European gastroenterology journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2050640620936383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580666/,215

STUDY DESIGN Secondary data analysis using dual-eligible enrollment data and health care workforce data. METHODS We determined the density of dual-eligible beneficiaries per 1000 population in 2017 for each of 3142 US counties. County-level supply of primary care physicians (PCPs), primary care nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was determined. RESULTS One-third of the 791 counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries had PCP shortages. Counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries and the fewest primary care clinicians of any type were concentrated in Southeastern states. These areas also had some of the highest coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks within their states. CONCLUSIONS States in the Southeastern region of the United States with some of the most restrictive scope-of-practice laws have an inadequate supply of primary care providers to serve a high concentration of dual-eligible beneficiaries. The fragmented care of the dually eligible population leads to extremely high costs, prompting policy makers to consider integrated delivery models that emphasize primary care. However, primary care workforce shortages will be an enduring challenge without scope-of-practice reforms.","Xu, Wendy Y; Retchin, Sheldon M; Buerhaus, Peter",The American journal of managed care,https://doi.org/10.37765/ajmc.2021.88581; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002963/,215

Traditional microbiologic data has provided insight into the role of infections in BOS. Now, new non-culture-based techniques have been developed to characterize the entire population of microbes resident on the surfaces of the body, also known as the human microbiome. Early studies have identified that lung transplant patients have a different lung microbiome and have demonstrated the important finding that the transplant lung microbiome changes over time. Furthermore, both unique bacterial populations and longitudinal changes in the lung microbiome have now been suggested to play a role in the development of BOS. In the future, this technology will need to be combined with functional assays and assessment of the immune responses in the lung to help further explain the microbiome's role in the failing lung allograft.","Becker, Julia; Poroyko, Valeriy; Bhorade, Sangeeta",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1586/17476348.2014.890518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24601662/,215

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) promises better cosmetic results and probably less pain compared with conventional laparoscopy. METHODS In a period of 5 months, data were collected and analyzed from patients, who underwent SILC using the Glove port. Another group of patients who underwent standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the same period has been taken as control group. Demographic data, operative time, successfulness of operation, length of hospital stay, and postoperative findings were collected. RESULTS Twenty-five patients underwent SILC and 30 patients underwent the standard procedure. There were no conversions to open procedure in either group. No major complications occurred. Operative time in SILC cases was significantly more than the standard technique, whereas postoperative pain in the SILC group was considerably less. CONCLUSIONS It seems that in selected patients (with a low risk of adhesions or technical difficulty), SILC can be an acceptable alternative to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy with acceptable results.","Barband, Alireza; Fakhree, Mohammad Bassir A; Kakaei, Farzad; Daryani, Amir","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e318242e12a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318053/,215

For example, a single allosteric modulator, Rp-cAMPS, of the prototypical protein kinase A (PKA) switches from antagonist to agonist depending on MgATP levels. However, the mechanism underlying such pluripotent allostery has remained elusive for decades. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ensemble models, kinase assays, and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that allosteric pluripotency arises from surprisingly divergent responses of highly homologous tandem domains. The differential responses perturb domain-domain interactions and remodel the free-energy landscape of inhibitory excited states sampled by the regulatory subunit of PKA. The resulting activation threshold values are comparable to the effective free energy of regulatory and catalytic subunit binding, which depends on metabolites, substrates, and mutations, explaining pluripotent allostery and warranting a general redefinition of allosteric targets to include specific subcellular environments.","Byun, J A; Akimoto, M; VanSchouwen, B; Lazarou, T S; Taylor, S S; Melacini, G",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abb1250; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596469/,215

Because renin-angiotensin system blockers increase levels of ACE2, a protein that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, there is concern that these drugs could increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal form of COVID-19. The impact of discontinuing ACEI and ARBs in patients with COVID-19 remains uncertain. DESIGN: BRACE CORONA is a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, phase IV, clinical trial that aims to enroll around 500 participants at 34 sites in Brazil. Participants will be identified from an ongoing national registry of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Eligible patients using renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACEI/ARBs) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 will be randomized to a strategy of continued ACEI/ARB treatment versus temporary discontinuation for 30 days. The primary outcome is the median days alive and out of the hospital at 30 days. Secondary outcomes include progression of COVID-19 disease, all-cause mortality, death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, new or worsening heart failure, myocarditis, pericarditis, arrhythmias, thromboembolic events, hypertensive crisis, respiratory failure, hemodynamic decompensation, sepsis, renal failure, and troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal-proBNP, and D-dimer levels.

In response, US officials augmented existing radiological screening at its ports of entry (POEs) to detect and decontaminate travelers contaminated with radioactive materials. During March 12 to 16, radiation screening protocols detected 3 travelers from Japan with external radioactive material contamination at 2 air POEs. Beginning March 23, federal officials collaborated with state and local public health and radiation control authorities to enhance screening and decontamination protocols at POEs. Approximately 543 000 (99%) travelers arriving directly from Japan at 25 US airports were screened for radiation contamination from March 17 to April 30, and no traveler was detected with contamination sufficient to require a large-scale public health response. The response highlighted synergistic collaboration across government levels and leveraged screening methods already in place at POEs, leading to rapid protocol implementation. Policy development, planning, training, and exercising response protocols and the establishment of federal authority to compel decontamination of travelers are needed for future radiological responses. Comparison of resource-intensive screening costs with the public health yield should guide policy decisions, given the historically low frequency of contaminated travelers arriving during radiological disasters.","Wilson, Todd; Chang, Arthur; Berro, Andre; Still, Aaron; Brown, Clive; Demma, Andrew; Nemhauser, Jeffrey; Martin, Colleen; Salame-Alfie, Adela; Fisher-Tyler, Frieda; Smith, Lee; Grady-Erickson, Onalee; Alvarado-Ramy, Francisco; Brunette, Gary; Ansari, Armin; McAdam, David; Marano, Nina",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://doi.org/10.1001/dmp.2012.46; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23077272/,215

AIM To investigate the prognostic value of pretreatment contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) characteristics in patients with esophageal NEC. METHODS Seventy-seven esophageal NEC patients who received contrast-enhanced CT at two hospitals were enrolled in this study from June 2014 to December 2019. The clinical features and image characteristics were recorded accordingly. Univariate survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test, and multivariate analysis was carried out with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS The multivariate analysis performed using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Meanwhile, adjuvant chemotherapy was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS). The hazard ratios (HRs) of N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, and degree of enhancement (mild vs moderate/marked) for OS were 0.426 (P = 0.024), 3.862 (P = 0.006), and 2.169/0.809 (P = 0.037), respectively. The HR of adjuvant chemotherapy for PFS was 6.432 (P < 0.001). Adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with degree of enhancement (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION Adjuvant chemotherapy is an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Additionally, N stage and degree of enhancement are prognostic factors for OS in patients with esophageal NEC.","Zhou, Yue; Hou, Ping; Zha, Kai-Ji; Wang, Feng; Zhou, Kun; He, Wei; Gao, Jian-Bo",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i31.4680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32884225/,215
146160,Predictors of functional dependence after COVID-19: A retrospective examination among veterans.,2020-10-12,"IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for many hematological malignancies and genetic disorders. The majority of patients do not have a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical sibling donor, and alternative stem cell sources include HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donors and haploidentical related donors. However, alternative donor HSCT are associated with three major complications i) graft rejection; ii) graft-versus-host disease (GvHD); and iii) delayed immune reconstitution leading to viral infections and relapse. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW Graft rejection and the risk of GvHD can be significantly reduced by using intensive conditioning regimens, including in vivo T cell depletion as well as ex vivo T cell depletion of the graft. However, the benefits of removing alloreactive T cells from the graft are offset by the concomitant removal of T cells with anti-viral or anti-tumor activity as well as the profound delay in endogenous T cell recovery post-transplant. Thus, opportunistic infections, many of which are not amenable to conventional small-molecule therapeutics, are frequent in these patients and are associated with significant morbidity and high mortality rates. This review discusses current cell therapies to prevent or treat viral infections/reactivations post-transplant. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN The reader will gain an understanding of the current state of cell therapy to prevent and treat viral infections post-HSCT, and will be introduced to preclinical studies designed to develop and validate new manufacturing procedures intended to improve therapeutic efficacy and reduce associated toxicities. TAKE HOME MESSAGE Reconstitution of HSCT recipients with antigen-specific T cells, produced either by allodepletion or in vitro reactivation, can offer an effective strategy to provide both immediate and long-term protection without harmful alloreactivity.","Leen, Ann M; Tripic, Tamara; Rooney, Cliona M",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14712590903456003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20132056/,215

METHODS Fourteen TCA cases treated between 1990 and 2010 were reviewed. Open D/S (O-D/S) through a vertical midline abdominal incision was routine from 1990 to 2005, whereupon Lap-D became routine. Lap-D involves laparoscopic colon resection, ileostomy take-down, and ileum pull-through through an additional Pfannenstiel incision. We compared pre-operative nutrition, operating time, intraoperative blood loss, duration until oral challenge, postoperative analgesic usage, incidence of enterocolitis, early complications that arose within 30 days of surgery, and late complications, and wound cosmesis 1 year postoperatively (Grade-1: unacceptable, Grade-2: passable, Grade-3: excellent). RESULTS Six had O-D/S (2D, 4S) and eight had Lap-D. Differences in patient demographics, mean ages/weights at surgery, average length of the aganglionic segment from the terminal ileum, operating time, and time taken for oral challenge were all not significant, full feeding took longer in O-D/S (6.7 vs. 5.9 days). Preoperative central vein intravenous hyperalimentation was required for one case in O-D/S and two cases in Lap-D. These three required hospitalization for at least 30 days postoperatively and parenteral nutrition after discharge. Although there were no intraoperative complications in either group, there was one case of transient ileus in O-D/S that resolved conservatively. Cosmesis was significantly better in Lap-D (O-D/S = 1.2; Lap-D = 2.1; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Cosmesis was the only factor that was significantly different between Lap-D and O-D/S; all other factors were similar.","Miyano, Go; Ochi, Takanori; Lane, Geoffrey J; Okazaki, Tadaharu; Yamataka, Atsuyuki",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-012-3247-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292536/,215

However, the amorphous limit of κl affects the celling of the attainable zT. Herein, we fabricate hierarchical structures by using an in-situ microwave synthesis to break the amorphous limit of κl for achieving a high zT in (Sn0.985In0.015Te)1-x(AgCl)x alloys. Our results from detailed electron microscopy characterizations suggest that the as-sintered (Sn0.985In0.015Te)1-x(AgCl)x alloys contain a range of lattice imperfections, including microsized grains with dense grain boundaries, nanopores with size from several to hundreds of nm, and nanoscale precipitates, which result in strong phonon scatterings and in turn lead to a minimized κl of 0.245 Wm-1K-1. Moreover, the calculated band structures reveal the introduction of resonance level by In doping, which dramatically enhances the electrical transport properties to ensure a high power factor of 26.4 µWcm-1K-2 at 823 K and a maximum zT of 0.86 (823 K) in hierarchically structured (Sn0.985In0.015Te)0.90(AgCl)0.10.

Here we explored the possibility of inhibiting GAV replication and disease using double-stranded (ds)RNAs expressed in bacteria and delivered either orally or by muscle injection. To enhance potential RNA interference (RNAi) responses, 5 long dsRNAs were used that targeted open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/b) gene regions and thus only the genomic length RNA. To examine oral delivery, P. monodon were fed pellets incorporating a pool of formalin-fixed bacteria containing the 5 GAV-specific dsRNAs before being injected with a minimal lethal GAV dose. Feeding with the pellets continued post-challenge but did not reduce mortality accumulation and elevation in GAV loads. In contrast, muscle injection of the dsRNAs purified from bacteria was highly effective at slowing GAV replication and protecting shrimp against acute disease and mortalities. In synergy with these data, dsRNA targeted to P. monodon beta-actin mRNA caused 100% mortality following injection, whilst its oral delivery caused no mortality. Findings confirm that injected dsRNA can mount effective RNAi responses in P. monodon to endogenous shrimp mRNA and exogenous viral RNAs, but when delivered orally in bacteria as a feed component, the same dsRNAs are ineffective. The efficacy of the RNAi response against GAV provided by injection of dsRNAs targeted to multiple genome sites suggests that this strategy might have general applicability in enhancing protection against other shrimp single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses, particularly in hatcheries or breeding programs where injection-based delivery systems are practical.","Sellars, Melony J; Rao, Min; Arnold, Stuart J; Wade, Nicholas M; Cowley, Jeff A",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://doi.org/10.3354/dao02343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21797032/,215

We report our experience with the microcatheter in a variety of neurointerventional procedures. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all Onyx embolizations performed in the head, neck, and spine using the Apollo Onyx Delivery Microcatheter from its introduction at our institution in July 2014 to August 2016. Information regarding patient diagnoses, procedural details, as well as clinical outcomes were obtained from the electronic medical record, procedure reports, and relevant angiographic imaging. Results A total of 58 arterial pedicle Onyx embolizations were performed in 37 patients. There were no cases of microcatheter entrapment, early/inadvertent tip detachment, or vessel injury upon removal of the device. There were two instances (3.5%) of leakage of Onyx from the microcatheter detachment site during embolization, which did not result in adverse sequelae. Clinical outcomes were excellent, with nearly all embolizations achieving the intended goal. In multivariate analysis, length of Onyx reflux along the microcatheter tip and utilization of a higher viscosity agent, Onyx 34, were significantly associated with tip detachment. Conclusion The use of the Apollo Microcatheter is both safe and effective during neurointerventional embolizations using Onyx. Leakage of liquid embolic agent from the detachment site is an infrequent technical complication that may be encountered with the device.","Miller, Timothy R; Giacon, Luciano; Kole, Matthew J; Chen, Rong; Jindal, Gaurav; Gandhi, Dheeraj","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019918758494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29482458/,215

Evidence to guide appropriate immunosuppressive therapy is scarce. We present a case of ICI-induced myocarditis and a review of ICI-induced myocarditis cases to determine the most effective immunosuppressive therapeutic strategy for ICI-induced myocarditis. METHODS A systematic search of PubMed was carried out for treatment of ICI-induced myocarditis. Reference lists from identified articles were manually reviewed for additional cases. RESULTS A total of 87 cases with ICI-induced myocarditis were identified. The majority were melanoma (n = 39), lung cancer (n = 19), renal cell cancer (n = 10), and thymoma cancer patients (n = 4). In 38 (44%) cases, patients received high-dose steroid treatment only. A total of 49 (56%) cases were treated with immunosuppressive agents other than steroid; a total of 13 different immunosuppressive agents were used, including alemtuzumab or abatacept.

A total of 48% of cases were fatal. In cases treated with high-dose steroids only vs. cases treated with other immunosuppressive agents, fatality was 55% and 43% respectively. In 64 out of the 87 cases, tumor control was not described. In patients treated with high-dose steroids only, two patients had stable disease as best tumor response; in patients treated with other immunosuppressive agents, one complete response, one partial response and seven stable disease were noted as best tumor response. Overall, 11 studies were at low risk of bias (12.6%), 38 at moderate risk of bias (43.7%) and 38 at high risk of bias (43.7%). CONCLUSION Immune checkpoint inhibitor induced myocarditis is a serious and often fatal adverse event. High-dose prednisolone, alemtuzumab or abatacept are all possible treatments options for ICI-induced myocarditis, whereas infliximab increases the risk of death from cardiovascular causes, and should be avoided. Further research is needed.","Matzen, Emma; Bartels, Lars Erik; Løgstrup, Brian; Horskær, Stine; Stilling, Christina; Donskov, Frede",Cardio-oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40959-021-00114-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34365980/,215

154833,Does pain vary across the menstrual cycle? A review.,2015,"Heparin is the earliest and most widely used anticoagulant and antithrombotic drug that is still used in a variety of clinical indications. Since it was discovered in 1916, after more than a century of repeated exploration, heparin has not been replaced by other drugs, but a great progress has been made in its basic research and clinical application. Besides anticoagulant and antithrombotic effects, heparin also has antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and other pharmacological activities. It is widely used clinically in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, cancer, etc., as the first anticoagulant medicine in COVID-19 exerts anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects. At the same time, however, it also leads to a lot of adverse reactions, such as bleeding, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase, allergic reactions, and others. This article comprehensively reviews the modern research progress of heparin compounds; discusses the structure, preparation, and adverse reactions of heparin; emphasizes the pharmacological activity and clinical application of heparin; reveals the possible mechanism of the therapeutic effect of heparin in related clinical applications; provides evidence support for the clinical application of heparin; and hints on the significance of exploring the wider application fields of heparin.","Qiu, Min; Huang, Shengjie; Luo, Chuanhong; Wu, Zhenfeng; Liang, Binzhu; Huang, Haozhou; Ci, Zhimin; Zhang, Dingkun; Han, Li; Lin, Junzhi",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2021.111561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848775/,215
155207,Time to Reassess Tocilizumab's Role in COVID-19 Pneumonia.,2020-10-20,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) utilizes host cellular proteases to enter cells. A previous report shows that furin, which is distributed mainly in the Golgi apparatus and cycled to the cell surface and endosomes, proteolytically activates the MERS-CoV spike (S) protein following receptor binding to mediate fusion between the viral and cellular membranes. In this study, we reexamined furin usage by MERS-CoV using a real-time PCR-based virus cell entry assay after inhibition of cellular proteases. We found that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK blocked entry of MERS-CoV harboring an S protein lacking furin cleavage sites; it even blocked entry into furin-deficient LoVo cells. In addition, dec-RVKR-CMK inhibited not only the enzymatic activity of furin but also those of cathepsin L, cathepsin B, trypsin, papain, and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, a virus cell entry assay and a cell-cell fusion assay provided no evidence that the S protein was activated by exogenous furin. Therefore, we conclude that furin does not play a role in entry of MERS-CoV into cells and that the inhibitory effect of dec-RVKR-CMK is specific for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L rather than furin.IMPORTANCE Previous studies using the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK suggest that MERS-CoV utilizes a cellular protease, furin, to activate viral glycoproteins during cell entry. However, we found that dec-RVKR-CMK inhibits not only furin but also other proteases. Furthermore, we found no evidence that MERS-CoV uses furin. These findings suggest that previous studies in the virology field based on dec-RVKR-CMK should be reexamined carefully. Here we describe appropriate experiments that can be used to assess the effect of protease inhibitors on virus cell entry.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Shirato, Kazuya; Kawase, Miyuki; Terada, Yutaka; Kawachi, Kengo; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Kamitani, Wataru",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00683-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30021905/,215
155535,Use patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) in treatment of long covid.,2021-05-18,"Objectives The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly across the world. The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual's risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were collected. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score. Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 (scale 0-14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95%, respectively. Conclusions The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters. This algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms.","Kurstjens, Steef; van der Horst, Armando; Herpers, Robert; Geerits, Mick W L; Kluiters-de Hingh, Yvette C M; Göttgens, Eva-Leonne; Blaauw, Martinus J T; Thelen, Marc H M; Elisen, Marc G L M; Kusters, Ron",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/cclm-2020-0593; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32598302/,215

No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. METHODS The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score ≥ 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.","Thombs, Brett D; Kwakkenbos, Linda; Carrier, Marie-Eve; Bourgeault, Angelica; Tao, Lydia; Harb, Sami; Gagarine, Maria; Rice, Danielle; Bustamante, Laura; Ellis, Kelsey; Duchek, Delaney; Wu, Yin; Bhandari, Parash Mani; Neupane, Dipika; Carboni-Jiménez, Andrea; Henry, Richard S; Krishnan, Ankur; Sun, Ying; Levis, Brooke; He, Chen; Turner, Kimberly A; Benedetti, Andrea; Culos-Reed, Nicole; El-Baalbaki, Ghassan; Hebblethwaite, Shannon; Bartlett, Susan J; Dyas, Laura; Patten, Scott; Varga, John",Journal of psychosomatic research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32521358/,215

This study was designed to evaluate clinical validity of the CAR™ 27 anastomosis in laparoscopic surgery for patients with left-sided colonic neoplasm. METHODS Intracorporeal anastomosis using the CAR™ 27 (CAR group) was performed in 66 patients (male 35; median age, 64.5 years), and short-term results were compared with consecutive 116 patients (male 70; median age, 64 years) where the anastomosis was constructed by double stapling technique using a circular stapler for the same indications (stapled group). RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, age, and distribution of pathologic lesion. The laparoscopic procedures, pathologic diagnosis/stage, and length of operation time and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. Conversion rate in the CAR and stapled group was 3% and 6%, respectively. There was no surgical mortality in either group. No intraoperative complications associated with the CAR™ 27 anastomosis were encountered. One patient in the CAR group was complicated by anastomotic leakage and none in the stapled group (p = 0.36). There was intestinal obstruction in two patients, in whom one required re-operation for entrapped small bowel adhesions within pelvis. No patient in either group showed symptomatic anastomotic stricture. CONCLUSIONS The anastomosis using the CAR™ 27 is an innovative technique. The CAR™ 27 anastomosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy for left-sided colonic tumor proved to be a safe and efficacious alternative to the standard double stapling technique.","Koo, Eun-Jung; Choi, Hong-Jo; Woo, Jin-Hee; Park, Ki-Jae; Roh, Young-Hoon; Kim, Ki-Han; Lee, Hak-Yoon",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-011-1310-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21909697/,215

Methods: This is a multi-center study and 68 COVID-19 patients were recruited in Jilin Province, China, from January 21, 2020 to February 21, 2020. Laboratory tests were conducted at admission. Outcomes were followed up until February 21, 2020. Results: Of the 68 patients, 63 were diagnosed as mild and 5 as moderate or severe. After follow-up, there are 28 and 40 patients in recovered and non-recovered group, respectively. Lymphocytes, including immature leukocyte subpopulation, were significantly increased after day 10 in recovered patients. Platelets and thrombocytocrit were significantly increased, while mean platelet volume was reduced markedly from day 6 in recovered patients. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated at onset and continued to decline at day 7 in recovered patients. Cardiac troponin I is always higher from onset to recovery in recovered patients, yet it is sharply declined below the upper limit of reference interval after day 10. Cholinesterase and alanine aminotransferase were higher during the recovery process in recovered patients than in non-recovered patients. Both eosinophil and age were identified as independent predictors for recovery. Conclusions: Some markers had different change patterns between the recovered and non-recovered patients. Eosinophil may serve as an independent predictor for recovery in addition to age. The monitoring of the dynamic level of markers can give more effective clues for the judgment of the progress in COVID-19 patients. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

Teachers who were educated and trained for teaching in a face-to-face classroom had to learn to teach online or in hybrid environments with little preparation or training. This paper explores the experiences of K-12 teachers who were teaching in online and hybrid classrooms due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The participants in this case study consisted of two groups of teachers. The first group of teachers consisted of 12 teachers in Hawai’i who were taking the professional development course that introduced them to the Authentic Social Learning Model (ASLM). The second group of teachers consisted of 5 teachers in Arizona who have been using the ASLM for a minimum of 3 years. The ASLM is based on social learning which is an application of the theory of connectivism. The purpose of this paper is to explore how teachers used the G Suite for Education (GSE) to implement the ASLM in online and hybrid classrooms during the COVID-19 pandemic and to recommend new education platforms that support inclusive social learning. Teachers in the case study indicated that implementing the ASLM resulted in students who were more engaged and motivated. The results indicated that social learning, which is the basis of the ASLM, was the most difficult aspect to implement in online and hybrid classes. Based on the results of this case study, this paper presents recommendations for new technology platforms that would allow teachers to easily implement social learning in K-12 online and hybrid classrooms. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Rice, R.","8th International Conference on HCI in Business, Government and Organizations, HCIBGO 2021, Held as Part of the 23rd HCI International Conference, HCII 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77750-0_33,215
167825,A Comparison of Hyperglycemic Crises in Patients with and without COVID-19,2021,"Pakistan is among the countries that have already crossed the water scarcity line, and the situation is worsened due to the recent pandemic. This is because the major budget of the country is shifted to primary healthcare activities from other development projects that included water treatment and transportation infrastructure. Consequently, water-borne diseases have increased drastically in the past few months. Therefore, there is a dire need to address this issue on a priority basis to ameliorate the worsening situation. One possible solution is to shift the focus/load from mega-projects that require a plethora of resources, money, and time to small domestic-scale systems for water treatment. For this purpose, domestic-scale solar stills are designed, fabricated, and tested in one of the harshest climatic condition areas of Pakistan, Rahim Yar Khan. A comprehensive overview of the regional climatology, including wind speed, solar potential, and ambient temperature is presented for the whole year. The analysis shows that the proposed system can adequately resolve the drinking water problems of deprived areas of Pakistan. The average water productivity of 1.5 L/d/m2 is achieved with a total investment of PKR 3000 (&lt;$20). This real site testing data will serve as a guideline for similar system design in other arid areas globally.","Muhammad Ahmad, Jamil Haseeb Yaqoob Farooq Muhammad Umar Yew Heng Teoh Ben Bin Xu Mahkamov Khamid Sultan Muhammad Kim Choon Ng Muhammad Wakil Shahzad",Water,https://doi.org/10.3390/w13081070,215

The data were collected using a questionnaire addressed to employees of companies that provide financial consultancy in Romania and were analyzed using the statistical software Smart-Pls 3.3.2. Starting with the literature of profile, the paper identifies the drivers of the organizational performance model in carrying out professional activities in the remote working system. These indicators are independent variables that model the impact of telework activities on business performance. The results of the study confirm the hypotheses presented in the article, emphasizing that the performance indicator of employees working in the remote system is the direct and intrinsic result of the collaboration of several factors, such as personal psychological, economic, and professional needs, system variables and regulation, while the ability to adapt to telework has a moderator effect between independent variables and the organizational performance. Identifying the determinants that contribute to increasing organizational performance through professional activities in telework is relevant for the human resource management, to value the positive aspects, such as the ability to actively involve employees, rewarded for their work and to prevent their resilience to change. © 2021, Amfiteatru Economic.

170523,Introduction of the ARDS—Anti-Ransomware Defense System Model—Based on the Systematic Review of Worldwide Ransomware Attacks,2021,"Background: Adult obesity prevention policies, which are largely untargeted, have met with limited success globally. Population groups with the highest risk of weight gain, if they could be reliably identified using readily available information, might benefit from targeted policy. The relative importance of age, sex, ethnicity, geographical region and social deprivation for weight gain is unknown. Methods: We calculated longitudinal changes in BMI over one, five and ten years and investigated transition between BMI categories using 11,187,383 clinically recorded, repeated measures of BMI from population-based electronic health records of 2,328,477 adults in England (1998- 2016). The influence of risk factors was tested using logistic regression. Findings: The youngest adult age group (18-24 years) was more strongly associated with risk of weight gain than older age, male sex, socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity or geographic region. Among the youngest adults, the top quartile gained 15.9kg in men and 12kg in women at 10 years. The odds of transitioning to a higher BMI category over 10 years were 4-6 times higher in the youngest (18-24 years) compared to oldest (65-74 years) individuals; odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 4.22 (3.85-4.62)) from normal weight to overweight or obesity, 4.60 (4.06-5.22) for overweight to obesity, and 5.87 (5.23-6.59) from obesity to severe obesity in multiple adjusted analyses. Among the youngest adults, socially deprived men were at greater risk of transitioning from normal weight to overweight (72%) and from overweight to obesity (68%) over 10 years. We provide an open access online risk calculator (https://pasea.shinyapps.io/bmi_shiny_app/) and present high resolution obesity risk charts over a 1-, 5- and 10-year follow-up. Interpretation: A radical shift in policy is required to focus on those at highest risk of weight gain - young adults - for individual and population level prevention of obesity and its long-term consequences for health and health care.","Katsoulis, M.; Lai, A.; Diaz-Ordaz, K.; Gomes, M.; Pasea, L.; Banerjee, A.; Denaxas, S.; Tsilidis, K.; Lagiou, P.; Misirli, G.; Bhaskaran, K.; Wannamethee, G.; Dobson, R.; Batterham, R.; Kipourou, D.-K.; Lumbers, R.

170937,The Impact of Non-Price In-premise Marketing on Food and Beverage Purchasing and Consumer Behaviour: A Systematic Review,2021-09-16,"Women’s reproductive cessation is the earliest sign of human aging and is caused by decreasing oocyte quality. Similarly, C. elegans’ reproduction declines with age and is caused by oocyte quality decline. Aberrant mitochondrial dynamics are a hallmark of age-related dysfunction, but the role of mitochondrial morphology in reproductive aging is largely unknown. We examined the requirements for mitochondrial fusion and fission in oocytes of both wild-type worms and the long-lived, long-reproducing insulin-like receptor mutant daf-2. We find that normal reproduction requires both fusion and fission. By contrast, daf-2 mutants require fission, but not fusion, for reproductive span extension. daf-2 mutant oocytes’ mitochondria are punctate (fissioned) and may be primed for mitophagy, as loss of the mitophagy regulator PINK-1 shortens daf-2’s reproductive span. Our data suggest that daf-2 maintain oocyte mitochondria quality with age via a shift toward punctate mitochondrial morphology and mitophagy to extend reproductive longevity.","Cota, Vanessa; Murphy, Coleen T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.16.456566,215

Classes have been moved online as a result of school closures. Despite the flexibility offered by online learning, there are several challenges faced. Creating a good classroom climate for online classes is a challenging task. It is difficult for the teachers to obtain emotional feedback from the students, especially in asynchronous classes or classes with large number of students. It is hard for the teachers to evaluate the engagement of the students in class without knowing the students' emotional response. The existing facial expression recognition databases focus on basic human emotions like happy, angry, sad, surprise and neutral. These basic emotions are not appropriate for learning as psychological and pedagogical studies have shown that there are differences between basic human emotions and academic emotions. In view of these problems, this paper presents a study on academic emotions. A dataset comprising four pertinent academic emotions have been established. Empirical analysis on the dataset is conducted using both hand crafted and deep learning approaches. The baseline evaluation demonstrates the suitability of the established academic dataset for online learning. © 2021 IEEE.","Min Han Pang, J.; Connie, T.; Kah Ong Michael, G.","9th International Conference on Information and Communication Technology, ICoICT 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icoict52021.2021.9527452,215
174422,EWMA control chart based on its first hitting time and coronavirus alert levels for monitoring symmetric COVID-19 cases,2021,"A thermodynamic framework has been developed for a class of amorphous polymers used in fused deposition modeling (FDM), in order to predict the residual stresses and the accompanying distortion of the geometry of the printed part (warping). When a polymeric melt is cooled, the inhomogeneous distribution of temperature causes spatially varying volumetric shrinkage resulting in the generation of residual stresses. Shrinkage is incorporated into the framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric expansion/contraction in the kinematics of the body. We show that the parameter for shrinkage also appears in the systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for the stress. The solidification of the melt around the glass transition temperature is emulated by drastically increasing the viscosity of the melt. In order to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the derived constitutive relation, we consider four ribbons of polymeric melt stacked on each other such as those extruded using a flat nozzle: each layer laid instantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before another layer is laid on it. Each layer cools, shrinks and warps until a new layer is laid, at which time the heat from the newly laid layer flows and heats up the bottom layers. The residual stresses of the existing and newly laid layers readjust to satisfy equilibrium. Such mechanical and thermal interactions amongst layers result in a complex distribution of residual stresses. The plane strain approximation predicts nearly equibiaxial tensile stress conditions in the core region of the solidified part, implying that a pre-existing crack in that region is likely to propagate and cause failure of the part during service. The free-end of the interface between the first and the second layer is subjected to the largest magnitude of combined shear and tension in the plane with a propensity for delamination.","Sreejith, P.; Kannan, K.; Rajagopal, K.

Established risk factors include smoking, alcohol and presence of human papillomavirus (HPV). The incidence rate of new disease continues to rise, despite falls in alcohol consumption and a reduction in smoking, the rising rates are unlikely to be solely attributed to HPV status alone. Obesity and its associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) are implicated in the risk and progression of a variety of cancers but there is paucity of evidence regarding its role in HNSCC. Methods and analysis A systematic review of cohort studies, reporting a risk of incident head and neck squamous cell carcinoma will be included. A systematic search strategy has been developed, multiple databases will be searched from January 1966, including Cochrane Library, OVID SP versions of Medline and EMBASE. The primary outcome will be incident HNSCC based on exposures of type 2 diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension as defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO). A combined risk effect across studies will be calculated using meta-analysis, although depending on the heterogeneity in study design, exposure and outcome reporting this may not be possible. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval is required for this systematic review. The review will be published in a revelant peer-review journal and findings will be presented at scientific meetings in both poster and oral presentation form.

Case Presentation: Here, we report three Iranian pediatric kidney transplantation cases who acquired COVID-19 infection and were admitted to Hazrat Ali Asghar Hospital in Tehran, Iran, in March-April 2020 (first wave). They were treated with prednisolone, cy-closporine, and cellcept. All of them had gastrointestinal symptoms, and one patient also had respiratory symptoms. In two patients who had only gastrointestinal symptoms, chest radiographies were considered normal. They did not need the intensive care unit (ICU), ventilator respiratory support, and dialysis due to a temporary increase in serum creatinine and no change in urine volume. Cellcept was stopped and other medications continued. The patient, who had pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms, expressed more severe manifestations that led to ICU admission and dialysis. Prednisolone was increased to a stress dose and the other drugs were discontinued.

Mitochondria play central roles in mediating innate immunity, hence some viruses have developed mechanisms to alter mitochondrial functions. Herein we show that arenavirus nucleoprotein (NP) enters the mitochondria of infected cells and affects their morphological integrity. We initially demonstrate electron-dense inclusions within mitochondria of reptarenavirus infected cells and hypothesized that these represent viral NP. Software predictions then serve to identify a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal (MTS) in arenavirus NPs; however, comparisons of wild-type and N-terminus mutated NPs suggest MTS-independent mitochondrial entry. NP does not enter isolated mitochondria, indicating that translocation requires additional cellular factors or conditions. Immune electron microscopy finally confirms the presence of NP within the mitochondria both in vitro and in infected animals. We hypothesize that mitochondria targeting might complement the known interferon antagonist functions of NP or alter the cell’s metabolic state.","Baggio, Francesca; Hetzel, Udo; Nufer, Lisbeth; Kipar, Anja; Hepojoki, Jussi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.370825,215

These architectures favor algorithms that expose ultra fine-grain parallelism and maximize the ratio of floating point operations to energy intensive data movement. One of the few viable approaches to achieve high efficiency in the area of PDE discretizations on unstructured grids is to use matrix-free/partially-assembled high-order finite element methods, since these methods can increase the accuracy and/or lower the computational time due to reduced data motion. In this paper we provide an overview of the research and development activities in the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED), a co-design center in the Exascale Computing Project that is focused on the development of next-generation discretization software and algorithms to enable a wide range of finite element applications to run efficiently on future hardware.

Traditional deep-learning methods perform poorly or even fail when trying to analyse these datasets. The results of a systematic literature review reveal the dominance of frameworks based on recurrent neural networks. The performance of deep-learning frameworks was found to be evaluated mainly using mean absolute error and root mean square error accuracy metrics. Underlying challenges that were identified are: lack of performance robustness, non-transparency of the methodology, internal and external architectural design and configuration issues.

Wastewater based epidemiology, in this context, emerged as an important tool in developed countries where proper sewage system is available. Due to the recent shift in the spread of the infection from urban to rural areas, it is now equally important to develop a similar mechanism for rural areas as well. Considering the urgency of the issue a study was conducted in 14 districts of Bangladesh and a total of 238 sewage samples were collected in two different periods from December 2020 to January 2021. We are the first to propose a surveillance system for both urban and rural areas where a proper sewage system is absent. Based on RT-PCR analysis of the water samples, in more than 92% of cases, we found the presence of the SARS-COV-2 gene (ORF1ab, N, and Internal Control-IC). The trend of Ct value varies for different study locations. The spread of genetic material for on-site (m = - 0.0386) sanitation system was found more prominent than that of off-site sewage system (m = 0.0105); which indicated the shift of genetic material from urban to rural areas. Wastewater samples were also measured for physicochemical parameters, including pH (6.30 - 12.50) and temperature (22.10 - 32.60)C. The highest viral titer of 1975 copy/mL in sewage sample was observed in a sample collected from the isolation ward of the SARS-COV-2 hospital. Additionally, a correlation was found between bacterial load and SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials. The results indicated the association of increased Ct values with decreasing number of patients and vice versa. The findings reported in this paper contributed to the field of wastewater-based epidemiology dealing with SARS-COV-2 surveillance for developing countries where proper sewage system is absent and highlighting some of the challenges associated with this approach in such settings.

184815,Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Routine Obstetrical Management.,2020-08-01,"Three COVID-19 vaccines are licensed for emergency use in the USA: the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna/NIH mRNA-based vaccines, and the Johnson & Johnson (J&J)/Janssen human adenovirus (Ad26) vaccine. These vaccines have immunized ~160 million people nationwide, comprising ~53% Pfizer, 39% Moderna, and 8% J&J recipients [1]. Although at varying stages of clinical investigation for use in children, no COVID-19 vaccines are yet available for this population, posing a significant public health concern. One method to protect infants and young children may be passive immunization via antibodies (Abs) provided in the milk of a lactating vaccinated person. Our early work [2] and other recent reports [3-5] examining the milk Ab response to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination have demonstrated that unlike the post-SARS-CoV-2 infection milk Ab profile, which is rich in specific secretory (s)IgA, the vaccine response is highly IgG-dominant. In this report, we present a comparative assessment of the milk Ab response elicited by not only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but importantly, the J&J vaccine as well. This analysis revealed that compared to mRNA vaccine recipients, 49% - 63% fewer J&J vaccine recipient milk samples were positive for Spike-specific IgG, with positive samples exhibiting significantly lower mean IgG titers. J&J recipient milk samples contained significantly less specific IgA than Moderna recipient milk samples, which exhibited significantly greater relative IgA increases compared to both Pfizer and J&J recipients. Absolute and relative vaccine-induced secretory Ab titers were similarly low for all groups, though ~25% more Moderna recipients exhibited a relative increase compared to Pfizer and J&J recipients. These data indicate that J&J vaccine poorly elicits Spike-specific Ab in milk compared to mRNA-based vaccines and that this vaccine should be considered a last choice for immunizing those intending to elicit a strong Ab response in their milk. These data also suggest that Moderna vaccine elicits a superior, albeit moderate, milk (s)IgA response, and highlight the need to design vaccines with optimal protection of the breastfeeding infant in mind.","Fox, A.; DeCarlo, C.; Yang, X.; Norris, C.; Powell, R.

These food industries have been badly hit not only because of the lock down, imposed for COVID-19 containment, but also because of the consumer's concern for food safety. To revive the processed food industry, it is necessary to win back the consumer's confidence, which in turn requires a number of steps to be taken by both the policy makers and the food business operators. In this context, the present article describes how the maintenance of hygiene at places of food production would be important for the food industry in the COVID-19 regime.

According to modern taxonomy, the species SARS Cov-2 belongs to the order – Nidovirales, family – Coronaviridae, subfamily – Coronavirinae, Genus – Betacoronavirus, lineage – Sarbecovirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the disease caused by the SARS CoV-2 COVID-19 virus (Coronavirus disease) on 11 February, 2020. On 11 March, 2020, after the epidemic had spread to all continents, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS CoV-2 virus is transmitted by airborne droplets, as well as through contaminated surfaces and objects. The presence of the virus has been shown in the body fluids of infected people, such as nasal and throat secretions, tears, sputum, stool and blood. The incubation period is 5 to 14 days. Non-specific prophylaxis is important in reducing the number of infections caused by SARS CoV-2 virus. Objective: The article describes preventive measures undertaken at the Institute of Rural Medicine in Lublin to prevent COVID-19 infections among patients and staff. Summary: Scientists emphasize that among the preventive measures, hand washing and disinfection, social distancing, the use of personal protective equipment, and surface decontamination are particularly important, which was confirmed in practice during the SARS epidemic.","Danielak, Marzena Dziemidok Piotr",Journal of Pre-Clinical and Clinical Research,https://doi.org/10.26444/monz/132556,215

In all cases, laboratory medicine was either a key contributor or leader in predictive risk management, preventative health, and integration of clinical care through active synthesis of relevant data: data that are too often under-used, under-recognized, or even missing in traditional models of care. Outcomes connect multi-disciplinary teams with favorable key performance indicators across patients, payors, clinicians and health systems, as well as top disease burdens and unmet gaps of care. Results affirm the possibilities ahead with proactive engagement across healthcare professionals including the vital and active role of laboratory medicine.

186980,[Neuropsychiatric recovery after COVID-19 - an observational cohort-study].,2021,"BACKGROUND Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID -19), is an infectious disease that has become a major public health emergency of international concern. It is necessary that Nigerian dental students have adequate knowledge about prevention/control of COVID-19 pandemic in dental practice. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception about COVID-19 among Nigerian dental students and its impact on their academic life. MATERIAL AND METHODS A web-based questionnaire assessing knowledge and perception with a total of 46 scoreable responses was created using Survey Monkey, an online survey tool. We surveyed 178 out of 507 clinical dental students attending the 10 dental schools. Bivariate analysis was conducted to test the association between students' age, gender and knowledge and perception of COVID 19 infection. Logistic regression was also conducted to determine the predictors of having good knowledge of COVID 19. The effect of all significant factors was inferred at P< 0.05. RESULTS The mean knowledge score of the dental students about infection control and COVID-19 was 32.19 (SD: 7.30, Range: 2-46). Knowledge scores significantly differed across genders, age-groups, class levels, university of study, previous lectures on infection prevention and control and risk-perception. The linear regression analysis showed that male gender (vs. female, β: 0.242, P<0.001), age-group of 18-24 years (vs. 45-54years, β: -0.305, P<0.001), class level 600 (vs. 500 level, β: -0.154, P<0.001), previous lectures on infection prevention and control (vs. no lecture, β: -0.186 , P=0.007), and a high-risk perception of COVID-19 ( vs. low-risk perception, β: 0.220, P=0.001) were significantly associated with higher knowledge scores. CONCLUSION The students were knowledgeable about mode of transmission, complications and diagnosis of COVID-19 but had limited understanding of the extra precautionary measures against COVID-19. These results imply that there is a need for an update of the infection prevention and control curriculum for dental students and improved quality assurance.","Olatosi, O; Nzomiwu, C L; Oyapero, A; Onyejaka, N K; Ejiegbu, T A",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34505463/,215

Tabletop exercises can provide an opportunity for individuals and groups to practice coordination of emergency response and evaluate performance. The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable self-assessment performance measurement tool for tabletop exercise participants. METHODS The study population comprised 179 public officials who attended three tabletop exercises in Massachusetts and Maine between September 2005 and November 2006. A 42-item questionnaire was developed to assess five public health functional capabilities: (1) leadership and management, (2) mass casualty care, (3) communication, (4) disease control and prevention, and (5) surveillance and epidemiology. Analyses were undertaken to examine internal consistency, associations among scales, the empirical structure of the items, and inter-rater agreement. RESULTS Thirty-seven questions were retained in the final questionnaire and grouped according to the original five domains. Alpha coefficients were 0.81 or higher for all scales. The five-factor solution from the principal components analysis accounted for 60% of the total variance, and the factor structure was consistent with the five domains of the original conceptual model. Inter-rater agreement ranged from good to excellent. CONCLUSIONS The resulting 37-item performance measurement tool was found to reliably measure public health functional capabilities in a tabletop exercise setting, with preliminary evidence of a factor structure consistent with the original conceptualization and of criterion-related validity.","Savoia, Elena; Testa, Marcia A; Biddinger, Paul D; Cadigan, Rebecca O; Koh, Howard; Campbell, Paul; Stoto, Michael A",Public health reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19413036/,215

Interestingly, a novel homologue of angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE), termed angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a receptor for SARS-CoV. ACE and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain and provide different key functions in the renin-angiotensin system. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II that is a key effector peptide of the system and exerts multiple biological functions, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels and thus is a negative regulator of the system. Importantly, our recent studies using ACE2 knockout mice have demonstrated that ACE2 protects murine lungs from ARDS. Furthermore, SARS-CoV infections and the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression. Notably, injection of SARS-CoV Spike into mice worsens acute lung failure in vivo that can be attenuated by blocking the renin-angiotensin pathway, suggesting the activation of pulmonary RAS influences the pathogenesis of ARDS and SARS.","Imai, Yumiko; Kuba, Keiji; Penninger, Josef M",Masui.

According to NSS involved status, COVID-19 patients were further divided into NSS patients and non-NSS patients. Elderly cases, males, common comorbidities, NSS, respiratory/cardiovascular/gastrointestinal symptoms, bilateral lesion, multifocal lesion, bacterial infection, bacterial&fungal infection were more common in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Meanwhile, severe COVID-19 patients showed increased baseline APTT, TT, D-dimer, CRP, ESR, CK-MB, creatine kinase, AST, ALT, creatinine, but decreased baseline platelet level, lymphocyte, albumin, GFR compared to non-severe patients. Notably, the continuous differences of lymphocyte, D-dimer, CRP, AST, ALT, albumin, GFR between severe patients and non-severe patients during treatment were observed. Age, NSS, bacterial & fungal infection, CRP and creatinine were further identified as independent risk factors for severe COVID-19, which could predict severe COVID-19 with area under curve of 0.861. Furthermore, severe patients presented with worse prognosis. Regrading NSS patients, they were related to older age, surgery history, diabetes comorbidities, respiratory/cardiovascular/gastrointestinal symptoms, bilateral lesion, multifocal lesion, bacterial infection, bacterial&fungal infection and more dysregulated laboratory indexes compared to non-NSS patients. Besides, NSS patients were correlated with poor prognosis to some extent. More intensive attention should be paid to COVID-19 patients with severe-disease risk factors and those with NSS involvement, in case of rapid deterioration.","Zhao, Yu; Wang, Fuxiang; Dong, Gaolei; Sheng, Qi; Feng, Shiyan",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437392/,215

METHODS A cross-sectional survey including 619 IBD patients was conducted. Patients answered questionnaires regarding IBD, IBD medicine, sociodemographic information, mental health, and COVID-19-specific worries (response rate = 64.6%). RESULTS In total, 14.3% of patients using IBD medication had paused or stopped their IBD treatment during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, the majority (61.4%) either due to remission or because of side-effects. Only five patients stated that COVID-19 contributed to their decision. The majority of patients (70.5%) expressed worries about an increased risk of infection with coronavirus-2 and worries that their IBD and/or IBD treatment might result in severe COVID-19. Women, patients taking immunomodulators and patients who considered their IBD to be severe were significantly more worried than the remaining population. Age, type of IBD, co-morbidity, level of education, work capacity and mental health were not associated with an increased level of COVID-19-specific worries. CONCLUSIONS In this selected IBD population, medical IBD treatment was rarely stopped or paused during the initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic even though 70% of the respondents expressed COVID-19-specific worries. These worries should, nevertheless, be addressed and the characteristics of the population who expressed concerns may be used in future targeted information to secure compliance. FUNDING none.

To produce structural and accessory proteins, members of the order Nidovirales (corona-, toro-, arteri- and roniviruses) generate a 3' co-terminal nested set of at least three and often seven to nine mRNAs. Coronavirus and arterivirus subgenomic transcripts are not only 3' co-terminal but also contain a common 5' leader sequence, which is derived from the genomic 5' end. Their synthesis involves a process of discontinuous RNA synthesis that resembles similarity-assisted RNA recombination. Most models proposed over the past 25 years assume co-transcriptional fusion of subgenomic RNA leader and body sequences, but there has been controversy over the question of whether this occurs during plus- or minus-strand synthesis. In the latter model, which has now gained considerable support, subgenomic mRNA synthesis takes place from a complementary set of subgenome-size minus-strand RNAs, produced by discontinuous minus-strand synthesis. Sense-antisense base-pairing interactions between short conserved sequences play a key regulatory role in this process. In view of the presumed common ancestry of nidoviruses, the recent finding that ronivirus and torovirus mRNAs do not contain a common 5' leader sequence is surprising. Apparently, major mechanistic differences must exist between nidoviruses, which raises questions about the functions of the common leader sequence and nidovirus transcriptase proteins and the evolution of nidovirus transcription. In this review, nidovirus transcription mechanisms are compared, the experimental systems used are critically assessed and, in particular, the impact of recently developed reverse genetic systems is discussed.","Pasternak, Alexander O; Spaan, Willy J M; Snijder, Eric J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16690906/,215

The inability to propagate the virus in vitro has made it difficult to quantitate JDV and determine the kinetics of virus replication during the acute phase of the disease process. We report for the first time two techniques that enable quantification of the virus and the use of these techniques to quantify the virus load during the acute phase of the disease process. A one-step JDV gag [corrected] TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection and quantification of JDV RNA in plasma. The limit of detection was 9.8 x 10(2) JDV viral RNA copies over 35 cycles, equivalent to 4.2 x 10(4) JDV genome copies/ml, and a peak virus load of 1.6 x 10(12) during the acute febrile period. An antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was also developed to quantify the levels of JDV capsid (JDVp26) over a linear range of 10 to 200 ng/ml. Viral RNA and JDVp26 levels were correlated in 48 plasma samples obtained from experimentally infected cattle. A significant positive correlation (R = 0.860 and r(2) = 0.740) was observed between the two techniques within the range of their detection limits. The relatively insensitive capture ELISA provides an economical and feasible method for monitoring of virus in the absence of more sensitive techniques.","Stewart, Meredith; Desport, Moira; Hartaningsih, Nining; Wilcox, Graham",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16272489/,215

The mechanisms of MHV-JHM-induced demyelination remain unclear and several studies have implicated the role of the immune response in this process. We have shown previously that protective immunity against MHV-JHM-induced encephalomyelitis was induced by immunization with a vaccinia virus (VV) recombinant expressing MHV-JHM S-protein (VV-S). Here, we present evidence that the time of MHV-JHM challenge after immunization with VV-S plays a critical role in protective immunity. The induction of virus-neutralizing S-protein-specific antibodies prior to the MHV-JHM challenge modulates the disease process and a subacute encephalomyelitis based on a persistent virus infection developed. Typical pathological alterations were lesions of inflammatory demyelination. In addition, the results indicate that after seroconversion, CD8+ T cells were no longer essential for virus elimination in contrast to their role in protection during acute encephalomyelitis.","Flory, E; Stühler, A; Barac-Latas, V; Lassmann, H; Wege, H",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9049333/,215

The structures of the ligand-free form and the enzyme-bestatin complex were determined at 1.5- and 1.6-A resolution, respectively. The enzyme is composed of four domains: an N-terminal beta-domain (Met(1)-Asp(193)), a catalytic domain (Phe(194)-Gly(444)), a middle beta-domain (Thr(445)-Trp(546)), and a C-terminal alpha-domain (Ser(547)-Ala(870)). The structure of the catalytic domain exhibits similarity to thermolysin, and a metal-binding motif (HEXXHX(18)E) is found in the domain. The zinc ion is coordinated by His(297), His(301), Glu(320), and a water molecule. The groove on the catalytic domain that contains the active site is covered by the C-terminal alpha-domain, and a large cavity is formed inside the protein. However, there exists a small hole at the center of the C-terminal alpha-domain. The N terminus of bestatin is recognized by Glu(121) and Glu(264), which are located in the N-terminal and catalytic domains, respectively. Glu(298) and Tyr(381), located near the zinc ion, are considered to be involved in peptide cleavage.

PROCEDURES Descriptive statistics were collated for all animal disease reports appearing on the ProMED-mail system from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 2004. RESULTS Approximately 30% of reports concerned events in the United States; reports were next most common in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Russia, and China. Rabies, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and anthrax were reported consistently over the study period, whereas avian influenza, Ebola virus, and Hantavirus infection were reported frequently in approximately half of the study years. Reports concerning viral agents composed more than half of the postings. Humans affected by zoonotic disease accounted for a third of the subjects. Cattle were affected in 1,080 reports, and wildlife species were affected in 825 reports. For the 10,490 postings studied, there was a retraction rate of 0.01 and a correction rate of 0.02.

194291,Distance Learning in the Field of Medicine: Hope or Hype?,2021-07-01,"Subgenomic mRNAs of nidoviruses (arteriviruses and coronaviruses) are composed of a common leader sequence and a ""body"" part of variable size, which are derived from the 5'- and 3'-proximal part of the genome, respectively. Leader-to-body joining has been proposed to occur during minus-strand RNA synthesis and to involve transfer of the nascent RNA strand from one site in the template to another. This discontinuous step in subgenomic RNA synthesis is guided by short transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) that are present at both these template sites (leader TRS and body TRS). Sense-antisense base pairing between the leader TRS in the plus strand and the body TRS complement in the minus strand is crucial for strand transfer. Here we show that extending the leader TRS-body TRS duplex beyond its wild-type length dramatically enhanced the subgenomic mRNA synthesis of the arterivirus Equine arteritis virus (EAV). Generally, the relative amount of a subgenomic mRNA correlated with the calculated stability of the corresponding leader TRS-body TRS duplex. In addition, various leader TRS mutations induced the generation of minor subgenomic RNA species that were not detected upon infection with wild-type EAV. The synthesis of these RNA species involved leader-body junction events at sites that bear only limited resemblance to the canonical TRS. However, with the mutant leader TRS, but not with the wild-type leader TRS, these sequences could form a duplex that was stable enough to direct subgenomic RNA synthesis, again demonstrating that the stability of the leader TRS-body TRS duplex is a crucial factor in arterivirus subgenomic mRNA synthesis.","Pasternak, Alexander O; van den Born, Erwin; Spaan, Willy J M; Snijder, Eric J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12502834/,215

194813,"Attitude, beliefs, and intentions to care for SARS patients among Korean clinical nurses: an application of theory of planned behavior.",2006,"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest shock in decades to the well developed healthcare system and resources worldwide. Although there was a wide variation in the level of preparedness, the transition was tough even for the most renowned healthcare systems. Increasing the capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure. However, while the system is preoccupied with a pandemic infection, patients suffering from other illnesses are in high risk to get infected, also being compromised by the imperative shift in medical resources and significant restrictions on routine medical care. For example patients with cardiovascular disease and others referred for nuclear cardiology procedures are frequently greater than 60 years of age and have other comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and chronic renal disease) that place them at a high-risk for adverse outcomes with COVID-19, providing unique challenges for their management in healthcare facilities, as well as for the care of health care personnel. Numerous medical specialty societies and governmental agencies issued guidelines aiming at the specification of preventive measures and amendments in everyday clinical practice during the escalation and peak of the pandemic. In accordance, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI), issued a common statement in late March 2020, which was provided as an initial response to this pandemic, offering specific recommendations for adapting nuclear cardiology practices at each step in a patient's journey through the lab-for inpatients, outpatients and emergency department patients. One of the main recommendations was cancelling or delaying of all non-urgent nuclear cardiology studies. As COVID-19 follows a different time course in different geographic regions and lockdowns begin to lift in many countries, the issue of re-establishment of non-emergent care, in nuclear cardiology laboratories amongst others, has to be addressed in a watchful and balanced way, keeping in mind that the COVID-19 crisis is far from over. Furthermore measuring what is happening in the current crisis is essential to ensuring preparedness for a possible next wave of the pandemic. Recently the ASNC, SNMMI, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), issued an information statement which describes a careful approach to reestablishment of non-emergent care in nuclear cardiology laboratories reflecting diverse settings from the United States and worldwide. In the same spirit it is also the reintroduction guidance issued by North American Cardiovascular Societies. In this paper we provide a synopsis of the basic steps of adapting nuclear cardiology practice in the era of COVID-19 in order to balance between the risk of viral transmission while also providing crucial cardiovascular assessments for our patients.","Paschali, Anna; Anagnostopoulos, Constantinos",Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32860393/,215

The method is based on the principle of binding of specific IgG to the test IBV antigen and the assay of unbound IgG on an antigen-coated ELISA plate. The immunoglobulins are chicken N-terminal S2 peplomeric protein-specific IgG isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography on synthetic peptide coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B or rabbit polyclonal IgG purified from the serum using Protein A Sepharose 4B. The assay detected all tested IBV strains and field isolates propagated in chicken embryos. Signal to noise ratios were calculated from LPB ELISA absorbance units and a diagnostic threshold was established from the signal to noise ratio frequency distribution of samples positive or negative for IBV by virus titration or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The relative sensitivity of the test ranged between 10(5) and 10(6) median egg infectious doses (EID(50)) for chicken IgG and between 10(3) and 10(4) EID(50) for rabbit IgG, depending on the test strain. The assay is simple and takes less than 3 h to perform. It does not require expensive reagents and can be readily adapted to monitor the IBV antigen concentration in allantoic fluids during propagation of vaccine strains or in samples of freeze-dried, live-attenuated IBV vaccines.","Lougovskaia, Natalia N; Lougovskoi, Andrei A; Bochkov, Yuri A; Batchenko, Galina V; Mudrak, Natalia S; Drygin, Vladimir V; Borisov, Alexander V; Borisov, Vladimir V; Gusev, Anatoly A",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12593737/,215
197851,Evaluating the Respiratory Support Pattern and Relationship with Initial Oxygen Saturation of the COVID Isolation Unit Patients in Sylhet.,2021-10-01,"Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a noninvasive form of respiratory assistance that has been used to support spontaneously breathing infants with lung disease for nearly 40 years. Following reports that mechanical ventilation contributes to pulmonary growth arrest and the development of chronic lung disease, there is a renewed interest in using CPAP as the prevailing method for supporting newborn infants. Animal and human research has shown that CPAP is less injurious to the lungs than is mechanical ventilation. The major concepts that embrace lung protection during CPAP are the application of spontaneous breathing at a constant distending pressure and avoidance of intubation and positive-pressure inflations. A major topic for current research focuses on whether premature infants should be supported initially with CPAP following delivery, or after the infant has been extubated following prophylactic surfactant administration. Clinical trials have shown that CPAP reduces the need for intubation/mechanical ventilation and surfactant administration, but it is still unclear whether CPAP reduces chronic lung disease and mortality, compared to modern lung-protective ventilation techniques. Despite the successes, little is known about how best to manage patients using CPAP. It is also unclear whether different strategies or devices used to maintain CPAP play a role in improving outcomes in infants. Nasal CPAP technology has evolved over the last 10 years, and bench and clinical research has evaluated differences in physiologic effects related to these new devices. Ultimately, clinicians' abilities to perceive changes in the pathophysiologic conditions of infants receiving CPAP and the quality of airway care provided are likely to be the most influential factors in determining patient outcomes.","Diblasi, Robert M",Respiratory care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19712498/,215
198976,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute myocardial infarction care times,2020,"In the presence of an RNA- temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant helper virus, two coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) defective interfering (DI) RNAs complemented each other, resulting in the assembly of MHV particles; we used this ability to complement as a means to study coronavirus assembly. One of the two DI RNAs was DIssA, a naturally occurring self-replicating DI RNA encoding N protein and the gene 1 proteins that encode RNA polymerase function; DIssA supports the replication and transcription of other non-self-replicating DI RNAs. The other DI was a genetically engineered DI RNA that encoded sM and M proteins. Coinfection of these two DIs at the nonpermissive temperature for the ts helper virus resulted in replication and transcription of both DI RNAs but not in synthesis of the helper virus RNAs. MHV particles containing DI RNAs, N protein, and M protein, all of which were exclusively derived from the two DI RNAs, were released from the coinfected cells; the amount of sM protein was below the limits of detection. Analyses of DI RNAs with mutations in the two envelope protein genes demonstrated that M and sM proteins appeared to be required for assembly and release of MHV particles that contained DI RNAs and N protein, while S protein was not required for assembly and release of MHV particles.","Kim, K H; Narayanan, K; Makino, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9094669/,215

200829,Robustly estimating the COVID19 epidemic curve in northern Italy using all-cause mortality,2020-07-28,"The coronavirus Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) employs polyprotein processing as a strategy to express its gene products. Previously we identified the first cleavage event as proteolysis at the Gly(673)-Gly(674) dipeptide bond mediated by the first papain-like proteinase domain (PLPD-1) to release an 87-kDa mature protein. In this report, we demonstrate a novel cleavage activity of PLPD-1. Expression, deletion, and mutagenesis studies showed that the product encoded between nucleotides 2548 and 8865 was further cleaved by PLPD-1 at the Gly(2265)-Gly(2266) dipeptide bond to release an N-terminal 195-kDa and a C-terminal 41-kDa cleavage product. Characterization of the cleavage activity revealed that the proteinase is active on this scissile bond when expressed in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and can act on the same substrate in trans when expressed in intact cells. Both the N- and C-terminal cleavage products were detected in virus-infected cells and were found to be physically associated. Glycosidase digestion and site-directed mutagenesis studies of the 41-kDa protein demonstrated that it is modified by N-linked glycosylation at the Asn(2313) residue encoded by nucleotides 7465 to 7467. By using a region-specific antiserum raised against the IBV sequence encoded by nucleotides 8865 to 9786, we also demonstrated that a 33-kDa protein, representing the 3C-like proteinase (3CLP), was specifically immunoprecipitated from the virus-infected cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and expression studies showed that a previously predicted cleavage site (Q(2583)-G(2584)) located within the 41-kDa protein-encoding region was not utilized by 3CLP, supporting the conclusion that the 41-kDa protein is a mature viral product.","Lim, K P; Ng, L F; Liu, D X",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10644337/,215

205096,Stress and long-term memory retrieval: a systematic review,2020,"The development of the organization of the motor representation areas in children and adolescents is not well-known. This cross-sectional study aimed to provide an understanding for the development of the functional motor areas of the upper extremity muscles by studying healthy right-handed children (6-9 years, n=10), preadolescents (10-12 years, n=13), adolescents (15-17 years, n=12), and adults (22-34 years, n=12). The optimal representation site and resting motor threshold (rMT) for the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) were assessed in both hemispheres using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Motor mapping was performed at 110% of the rMT while recording the EMG of six upper limb muscles in the hand and forearm. The association between the motor map and manual dexterity (box and block test, BBT) was examined. The mapping was well-tolerated and feasible in all but the youngest participant whose rMT exceeded the maximum stimulator output. The centers-of-gravity (CoG) for individual muscles were scattered to the greatest extent in the group of preadolescents and centered and became more focused with age. In preadolescents, the CoGs in the left hemisphere were located more laterally, and they shifted medially with age. The proportion of hand compared to arm representation increased with age (=0.001); in the right hemisphere, this was associated with greater fine motor ability. Similarly, there was less overlap between hand and forearm muscles representations in children compared to adults (p<0.001). There was a posterior-anterior shift in the APB hotspot coordinate with age, and the APB coordinate in the left hemisphere exhibited a lateral to medial shift with age from adolescence to adulthood (p=0.006). Our results contribute to the elucidation of the developmental course in the organization of the motor cortex and its associations with fine motor skills. It was shown that nTMS motor mapping in relaxed muscles is feasible in developmental studies in children older than seven years of age.","Säisänen, Laura; Könönen, Mervi; Niskanen, Eini; Lakka, Timo; Lintu, Niina; Vanninen, Ritva; Julkunen, Petro; Määttä, Sara",Neuroimage,,215
205170,Efficacy of simplified-cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia(S-CBTI) among female COVID-19 patients with insomnia symptom in Wuhan mobile cabin hospital,2021,"The prediction of severe weather events such as hurricanes is always a challenging task in the history of climate research, and many deep learning models have been developed for predicting the severity of weather events. When a disastrous hurricane strikes a coastal region, it causes serious hazards to human life and habitats and also reflects a prodigious amount of economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to build models to improve the prediction accuracy and to avoid such significant losses in all aspects. However, it is impractical to predict or monitor every storm formation in real time. Though various techniques exist for diagnosing the tropical cyclone intensity such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), convolutional auto-encoders, recurrent neural network (RNN), etc., there are some challenges involved in estimating the tropical cyclone intensity. This study emphasizes estimating the tropical cyclone intensity to identify the different categories of hurricanes and to perform post-disaster management. An improved deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for predicting the weakest to strongest hurricanes with the intensity values using infrared satellite imagery data and wind speed data from HURDAT2 database. The model achieves a lower Root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 7.6 knots and a Mean squared error (MSE) value of 6.68 knots by adding the batch normalization and dropout layers in the CNN model. Further, it is crucial to predict and evaluate the post-disaster damage for implementing advance measures and planning for the resources. The fine-tuning of the pre-trained visual geometry group (VGG 19) model is accomplished to predict the extent of damage and to perform automatic annotation for the image using the satellite imagery data of Greater Houston. VGG 19 is also trained using video datasets for classifying various types of severe weather events and to annotate the weather event automatically. An accuracy of 98% is achieved for hurricane damage prediction and 97% accuracy for classifying severe weather events. The results proved that the proposed models for hurricane intensity estimation and its damage prediction enhances the learning ability, which can ultimately help scientists and meteorologists to comprehend the formation of storm events. Finally, the mitigation steps in reducing the hurricane risks are addressed.","Devaraj, Jayanthi Ganesan Sumathi Rajvikram Madurai Elavarasan Subramaniam Umashankar",Applied Sciences,,215

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is primarily spread person to person through respiratory droplets. Nationwide, the meat and poultry processing industry, an essential component of the U.S. food infrastructure, employs approximately 500,000 persons, many of whom work in proximity to other workers (1). Because of reports of initial cases of COVID-19, in some meat processing facilities, states were asked to provide aggregated data concerning the number of meat and poultry processing facilities affected by COVID-19 and the number of workers with COVID-19 in these facilities, including COVID-19-related deaths. Qualitative data gathered by CDC during on-site and remote assessments were analyzed and summarized. During April 9-27, aggregate data on COVID-19 cases among 115 meat or poultry processing facilities in 19 states were reported to CDC. Among these facilities, COVID-19 was diagnosed in 4,913 (approximately 3%) workers, and 20 COVID-19-related deaths were reported. Facility barriers to effective prevention and control of COVID-19 included difficulty distancing workers at least 6 feet (2 meters) from one another (2) and in implementing COVID-19-specific disinfection guidelines.* Among workers, socioeconomic challenges might contribute to working while feeling ill, particularly if there are management practices such as bonuses that incentivize attendance. Methods to decrease transmission within the facility include worker symptom screening programs, policies to discourage working while experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19, and social distancing by workers. Source control measures (e.g., the use of cloth face covers) as well as increased disinfection of high-touch surfaces are also important means of preventing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Mitigation efforts to reduce transmission in the community should also be considered. Many of these measures might also reduce asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission (3). Implementation of these public health strategies will help protect workers from COVID-19 in this industry and assist in preserving the critical meat and poultry production infrastructure (4).","Dyal, Jonathan W; Grant, Michael P; Broadwater, Kendra; Bjork, Adam; Waltenburg, Michelle A; Gibbins, John D; Hale, Christa; Silver, Maggie; Fischer, Marc; Steinberg, Jonathan; Basler, Colin A; Jacobs, Jesica R; Kennedy, Erin D; Tomasi, Suzanne; Trout, Douglas; Hornsby-Myers, Jennifer; Oussayef, Nadia L; Delaney, Lisa J; Patel, Ketki; Shetty, Varun; Kline, Kelly E; Schroeder, Betsy; Herlihy, Rachel K; House, Jennifer; Jervis, Rachel; Clayton, Joshua L; Ortbahn, Dustin; Austin, Connie; Berl, Erica; Moore, Zack; Buss, Bryan F; Stover, Derry; Westergaard, Ryan; Pray, Ian; DeBolt, Meghan; Person, Amy; Gabel, Julie; Kittle, Theresa S; Hendren, Pamela; Rhea, Charles; Holsinger, Caroline; Dunn, John; Turabelidze, George; Ahmed, Farah S; deFijter, Siestke; Pedati, Caitlin S; Rattay, Karyl; Smith, Erica E; Luna-Pinto, Carolina; Cooley, Laura A",MMWR morb. mortal. wkly. rep,,215

Results showed that all four types of media (official media, commercial media, social media, and overseas media) cause vicarious traumatization to their audiences to different degrees. It was also found that the impact of media exposure on anxiety was mediated by media vicarious traumatization: there were full mediation effects for commercial media exposure and overseas media exposure, while there were indirect-only mediation effects for official media exposure and social media exposure.

This study aimed to examine the usability and test performance of a point of care polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for detection of SARS-COV2 (POCKITTM Central) in care homes. METHODS: POCKITTM Central was evaluated in a purposeful sample of four UK care homes. Test agreement with laboratory real-time PCR and usability and use errors were assessed. RESULTS: No significant usability-related hazards emerged, and the sources of error identified were found to be amendable with minor changes in training or test workflow. POCKITTM Central has acceptable sensitivity and specificity based on RT-PCR as the reference standard, especially for symptomatic cases.Asymptomatic specimens showed 83.3% (95% CI: 35.9%-99.6%) positive agreement and 98.7% negative agreement (95% CI: 96.2%-99.7%), with overall prevalence and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) of 0.965 (95% CI: 0.932- 0.999). Symptomatic specimens showed 100% (95% CI: 2.5%-100%) positive agreement and 100% negative agreement (95% CI: 85.8%-100%), with overall PABAK of 1.Recommendations are provided to mitigate the frequency of occurrence of the residual use errors observed. Integration pathways were discussed to identify opportunities and limitations of adopting POCKIT&#8482; Central for screening and diagnostic testing purposes. CONCLUSION: Point-of-care PCR testing in care homes can be considered with appropriate preparatory steps and safeguards.

While much research has been dedicated to understanding the genetic causes of the disease, our understanding of the mechanistic impacts of GRN deficiency has only recently begun to take shape. With no known cure or treatment available for GRN-related FTD, there is a growing need to rapidly advance genetic and/or small-molecule therapeutics for this disease. This issue is complicated by the fact that, while lysosomal dysfunction seems to be a key driver of pathology, the mechanisms linking a loss of GRN to a pathogenic state remain unclear. In our attempt to address these key issues, we have turned to the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, to model, study, and find potential therapies for GRN-deficient FTD. First, we show that the loss of the nematode GRN ortholog, pgrn-1, results in several behavioral and molecular defects, including lysosomal dysfunction and defects in autophagic flux. Our investigations implicate the sphingolipid metabolic pathway in the regulation of many of the in vivo defects associated with pgrn-1 loss. Finally, we utilized these nematodes as an in vivo tool for high-throughput drug screening and identified two small molecules with potential therapeutic applications against GRN/pgrn-1 deficiency. These compounds reverse the biochemical, cellular, and functional phenotypes of GRN deficiency. Together, our results open avenues for mechanistic and therapeutic research into the outcomes of GRN-related neurodegeneration, both genetic and molecular.","Doyle, James J; Maios, Claudia; Vrancx, Céline; Duhaime, Sarah; Chitramuthu, Babykumari; Bennett, Hugh P J; Bateman, Andrew; Parker, J Alex",Proc.

Rickettsial infections may be first evident as an exanthem with eschars as a key finding. In contrast, eschars and necrotic lesions can be seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Both illnesses share a similar mechanism of infecting endothelial cells resulting in vasculopathy. Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia 364D are both characterized by eschars unlike Rickettsia rickettsii. Other eschar causing rickettsioses such as Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia africae, and Orientia tsutsugamushi are commonly diagnosed in people from or having traveled through endemic areas. While there is no consensus on treatment for COVID-19, rickettsioses are treatable. Due to possibly serious consequences of delayed treatment, doxycycline should be administered given an eschar-presenting patient's travel history and sufficient suspicion of vector exposure. The proliferation of COVID-19 cases has rendered it critical to differentiate between the two, both of which may have overlapping vasculopathic cutaneous findings.

Our contributions include a novel and open source geo-fenced dataset on student and educator opinion within South Korea that we are making available to other researchers as well. We also identify trends in sentiment and polarity over the pandemic timeline, as well as key drivers behind the sentiments. Moreover, we provide a comparative analysis of two widely used pre-trained sentiment analysis approaches with TextBlob and VADER using statistical significance tests. Ultimately, we analyze how public opinion shifted on the pandemic in terms of positive sentiments about accessing course materials, online support communities, access to classes, and creativity, to negative sentiments about mental fatigue, job loss, student concerns, and overwhelmed institutions. We also initiate initial discussions about the concept of actionable sentiment analysis by overlapping polarity with the concept of trigger management to assist users in coping with negative emotions.

Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) causes sleep-related injury, has important clinical implications as a harbinger of PD and predicts a progressive clinical phenotype. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and its related symptoms can impair sleep initiation. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a refractory problem affecting patients' daytime activities. In particular, during the COVID-19 era, special attention should be paid to monitoring sleep problems, as infection-prevention procedures for COVID-19 can affect patients' motor symptoms, psychiatric symptoms and sleep. Therefore, screening for and managing sleep problems is important in clinical practice, and the maintenance of good sleep conditions may improve the quality of life of PD patients.

The soil was mixed with green waste compost and spiked with naphthalene which concentration varied from 0 to 500 ppm. Obtained results indicate that naphthalene additive at the concentration rate from 100 to 500 ppm reduced spring barley germination. The significant lower weight of green mass per pot, one plant weight and mass of 1000 grains were observed in the amendment with the highest naphthalene concentration (500 ppm). It was determined the daily intake (ED) of 16PAHs via spring barley grain and incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR). Estimated ED and ILCR of 16PAHs via spring barley ranged from 1.00 to 3.78 ng day-1 and 3.79 to 14.3 × 10-5 respectively. It should be noted that obtained results are higher around 10 times compared to previous studies performed using wheat grain. This study presents the mechanisms of naphthalene bioaccumulation and effect on the mineral composition of the most common agricultural plant spring barley grain and straw.

Biased media can influence people in undesirable directions and hence should be unmasked as such. We observe that featurebased and neural text classification approaches which rely only on the distribution of low-level lexical information fail to detect media bias. This weakness becomes most noticeable for articles on new events, where words appear in new contexts and hence their""bias predictiveness""is unclear. In this paper, we therefore study how second-order information about biased statements in an article helps to improve detection effectiveness. In particular, we utilize the probability distributions of the frequency, positions, and sequential order of lexical and informational sentence-level bias in a Gaussian Mixture Model. On an existing media bias dataset, we find that the frequency and positions of biased statements strongly impact article-level bias, whereas their exact sequential order is secondary. Using a standard model for sentence-level bias detection, we provide empirical evidence that article-level bias detectors that use second-order information clearly outperform those without.","Chen, Wei-Fan; Al-Khatib, Khalid; Stein, Benno; Wachsmuth, Henning",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10649v1.pdf,215

CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among employees was not significantly different among those who provided direct patient care and those who did not, suggesting that facility-wide infection control measures were effective. Employees who reported direct personal contact with COVID-19-positive persons outside work were more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Employee exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outside work may introduce infection into hospitals.","Dimcheff, Derek E; Schildhouse, Richard J; Hausman, Mark S; Vincent, Brenda M; Markovitz, Erica; Chensue, Stephen W; Deng, Jane; McLeod, Melissa; Hagan, Danielle; Russell, Jon; Bradley, Suzanne F",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,215
229750,863 COVID-19-related perinatal stress associated with increased depression risk,2021,"The COVID-19 outbreak was neither unpredictable nor unforeseen, yet it blind-sided policymakers when it emerged, leading to unprecedented global restrictions on human activity and almost certainly triggering the first global economic contraction since WWII. This paper considers the key factors in the eruption of the crisis, as well as the lessons that should be learned from it. The paper begins with an outline of COVID-19’s spread, highlighting six key drivers that have determined its severity: the exponential pace of transmission, global interconnectedness, health-sector capacity, wider state capacity, the economic impact of suppression measures, and fragilities caused by the 2008 financial crisis. The paper then proceeds by considering the steps that have been taken in response to five key challenges, corresponding to elements of the IRGC risk governance framework: technical assessment, risk perception, evaluation, management and communication. While acknowledging that only tentative conclusions can be drawn at this early stage, the paper ends with a series of ten recommendations designed to increase preparedness for future crises.","Collins, Aengus; Florin, Marie-Valentine; Renn, Ortwin",J.

In this research, we further extend the stochastic model suggested in \cite{us} and incorporate in it all available to us knowledge about parameters characterising the behaviour of the virus and the illness induced by it. The models we use are flexible, comprehensive, fast to run and allow us to incorporate the following: -time-dependent strategies of handling the epidemic; -spatial heterogeneity of the population and heterogeneity of development of epidemic in different areas; -special characteristics of particular groups of people, especially people with specific medical pre-histories and elderly. Standard epidemiological models such as SIR and many of its modifications are not flexible enough and hence are not precise enough in the studies that requires the use of the features above. Decision-makers get serious benefits from using better and more flexible models as they can avoid of nuanced lock-downs, better plan the exit strategy based on local population data, different stages of the epidemic in different areas, making specific recommendations to specific groups of people; all this resulting in a lesser impact on economy, improved forecasts of regional demand upon NHS allowing for intelligent resource allocation.","Zhigljavsky, Anatoly; Whitaker, Roger; Fesenko, Ivan; Kremnizer, Kobi; Noonan, Jack",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04583v1.pdf,215
230780,Persistent symptoms 1.5-6 months after COVID-19 in non-hospitalised subjects: a population-based cohort study,2020,"Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has afflicted millions of people worldwide since its first case was reported in December 2019. Personal protective equipment (PPE) has been tailored accordingly, but as of April 2020, close to 10 000 health care workers in the United States have contracted COVID-19 despite wearing recommended PPE. As such, standard guidelines for PPE may be inadequate for the health care worker performing high-risk aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation. In this brief technical report, we describe the integration of an orthopedic hood cover as an item for full barrier protection against COVID-19 transmission. Technical Description: The Coronavirus Airway Task Force at Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center approved this initiative and went live with the full barrier suit during the last week of March 2020. The PPE described in this report includes a Stryker T4 Hood, normally used in conjunction with the Stryker Steri-Shield T4 Helmet. Instead of the helmet, the hood is secured to the head via a baseball cap and binder clip. This head covering apparatus is to be used as an accessory to other PPE items that include an N95 mask, waterproof gown, and disposable gloves. The motor ventilation system is not used in order to prevent airborne viral entry into the hood. Discussion: An advantage of the full barrier suit is an additional layer of droplet protection during intubation. The most notable disadvantage is the absence of a ventilation system within the hood covering. Conclusion: Modification of existing PPE may provide protection for health care workers during high-risk aerosolizing procedures such as endotracheal intubation. Although the integration of this medical equipment meets the immediate needs of an escalating crisis, further innovation is on the horizon. More research is needed to confirm the safety of modified PPE.","Wills, Timothy T.; Zuelzer, Wilhelm A.; Tran, Bryant W.",Geriatr. Orthop. Surg. Rehabit.,,215

In this context, it is important to address the four dimensions of care: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. Medical students, however, feel inadequately equipped to discuss these dimensions with the patient. To bridge this gap, a new assignment was developed and implemented, in which students talked to a chronic or palliative patient about the four dimensions of care during an internship. This study, reports the evaluation of this assignment by students and teachers using a design-based approach. METHODS: Mixed methods were used, including a) student questionnaires, b) student focus groups, c) teacher interviews, and d) student's written reflections. Two researchers performed analyses of the qualitative data from the focus groups, interviews, and written reflections using qualitative research software (ALTLAS.TI). Descriptive statistics were computed for the quantitative data using SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: Students and teachers valued talking to an actual patient about the four dimensions of care. Reading and providing peer feedback on each other's reports was considered valuable, especially when it came to the diversity of illnesses, the way that patients cope and communication techniques. The students considered reflection useful, especially in the group and provided it was not too frequent. All the dimensions were addressed in the interviews, however the spiritual dimension was found to be the most difficult to discuss. The analysis of the written reflections revealed an overlap between the social and spiritual dimensions. Students pay a lot of attention to the relationship between the illness and the patient's daily life, but the reflections do often not show insight in the potential relationship between the four dimensions and decisions in patient care. CONCLUSIONS: During internships, medical students can practice talking about four dimensions of care with a chronically ill or palliative patient. Due to the format, it can be implemented across existing internships with relatively little extra time and effort. Reflection, peer feedback, and group discussion under the guidance of a teacher are important additions.","Pieters, Jolien; Verstegen, Daniëlle M L; Dolmans, Diana H J M; Warmenhoven, Franca C; van den Beuken-van Everdingen, Marieke H J",BMC Med Educ,,215
232429,Laboratory evidence of COVID-19 infection in gravidas in the first 6 months of the pandemic,2021,"Although research on pricing and lot-sizing decisions concerning payment types has been extensive, almost all of it has been done from the buyer's perspective. In this study, we incorporate the following relevant and essential facts. If a seller allows a buyer to pay on credit, it increases sales volume. But if a seller asks a buyer for an advance payment, it decreases sales volume. Sometimes, a seller offers a buyer a price discount for an advance payment to increase sales and profitability. Asking a buyer for an advance payment bears interest earned and has no default risk. If a seller offers a buyer the opportunity to pay on credit, then a longer credit period may mean a higher the sales volume, but the default risk is higher, too. The seller wants to set an optimal selling price, replenishment time, and payment method simultaneously so that the profit per unit time is maximized. To achieve this, we develop and compare the seller's profit per unit time under each of three payment methods-advance, cash and credit. Through numerical analyses, the following managerial insights are highlighted: (1) Under certain conditions, a specific payment type obtains the seller's highest profit among all three payment types. (2) If advance payment is required, then it is critically important for a seller to offer a price discount. (3) An advance payment generates more profit than a credit payment provided that sales volume from a credit payment to an advance payment declines insignificantly and vice versa.","Feng, Lin; Skouri, Konstantina; Wang, Wan-Chih; Teng, Jinn-Tsair",Ann Oper Res,,215

At the same time, the pandemic has created challenges for data collection, one of which is interviewer training in the context of social distancing. In sub-Saharan Africa, in-person interviewer training and face-to-face data collection remain the norm, requiring researchers to think creatively about transitioning to remote settings to allow for safer data collection that respects government guidelines. Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA, formerly PMA2020) has collected both cross-sectional and longitudinal data on key reproductive health measures in Africa and Asia since 2013. Relying on partnerships with in-country research institutes and cadres of female interviewers recruited from sampled communities, the project was well-positioned to transition to collecting data on COVID-19 from the onset of the pandemic. This article presents PMA's development of a remote training system for COVID-19 surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, including challenges faced and lessons learned. We demonstrate that remote interviewer training can be a viable approach when data are critically needed and in-person learning is not possible. We also argue against systematic replacement of in-person trainings with remote learning, instead recommending consideration of local context and a project's individual circumstances when contemplating a transition to remote interviewer training.","Turke, Shani; Nehrling, Sarah; Adebayo, Samuel Olanipekun; Akilimali, Pierre; Idiodi, Ivan; Mwangi, Anthony; Larson, Elizabeth; Moreau, Caroline; Anglewicz, Philip",Glob Health Sci Pract,,215
233627,Differential COVID-19 case positivity in New York City neighborhoods: socioeconomic factors and mobility,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected all types of global communities. Differences in urban and rural environments have led to varying levels of transmission within these subsets of the population. To fully understand the prevalence and impact of SARS-CoV-2 it is critical to survey both types of community. This study establishes the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a rural community: Montgomery, West Virginia. Approximately 10% of participants exhibited serological or PCR-based results indicating exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within 6 months of the sampling date. Quantitative analysis of IgG levels against SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) was used to stratify individuals based on antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. A significant negative correlation between date of exposure and degree of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG (R2 = 0.9006) was discovered in addition to a correlation between neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (R2 = 0.8880) and days post exposure. Participants were confirmed to have normal immunogenic profiles by determining serum reactivity B. pertussis antigens commonly used in standardized vaccines. No significant associations were determined between anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG and age or biological sex. Reporting of viral-like illness symptoms was similar in SARS-CoV-2 exposed participants greater than 30 years old (100% reporting symptoms 30-60 years old, 75% reporting symptoms >60 years old) in contrast to participants under 30 years old (25% reporting symptoms). Overall, this axnalysis of a rural population provides important information about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in small rural communities. The study also underscores the fact that prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in antibody responses that wane over time which highlights the need for vaccine mediated protection in the absence of lasting protection.","Horspool, Alexander M.; Russ, Brynnan P.; Wolf, M.

METHODS: An open-label parallel randomized controlled trial was performed among healthy migrant workers quarantined in a large multi-storey dormitory in Singapore. Forty clusters (each defined as individual floors of the dormitory) were randomly assigned to receive a 42-day prophylaxis regimen of either oral hydroxychloroquine (400 mg once, followed by 200 mg/day), oral ivermectin (12 mg once), povidone-iodine throat spray (3 times/day, 270 µg/day), oral zinc (80 mg/day)/vitamin C (500 mg/day) combination, or oral vitamin C, 500 mg/day. The primary outcome was laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown by either: (1) a positive serologic test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody on day 42, or (2) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at any time between baseline and day 42. RESULTS: A total of 3037 asymptomatic participants (mean age, 33.0 years; all men) who were seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline were included in the primary analysis. Follow-up was nearly complete (99.6%). Compared with vitamin C, significant absolute risk reductions (%, 98.75% confidence interval) were observed for oral hydroxychloroquine (21%, 2-42%) and povidone-iodine throat spray (24%, 7-39%). No statistically significant differences were observed with oral zinc/vitamin C combination (23%, -5 to +41%) and ivermectin (5%, -10 to +22%). Interruptions due to side effects were highest among participants who received zinc/vitamin C combination (6.9%), followed by vitamin C (4.7%), povidone-iodine (2.0%), and hydroxychloroquine (0.7%).

Over one third of national COVID-19 cases are among Latinos, likely due to an increased prevalence of comorbid risk factors and social determinants of health that make following precautions difficult. DESIGN: Respondents were recruited using snowball sampling as part of a previous effort to establish an academic-community partnership with Latinos in the area. In April 2020, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews in Spanish with participants over the phone. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into Spanish, and translated to English. We employed the framework approach in a thematic analysis using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Common themes were a wariness of news appearing on social media, generalized worry, and the use of natural medicines to maintain health. Respondents followed recommended guidelines to protect their own health, though expressed concern that members of their community were not.

The purpose of this article is to provide useful safety strategies for ophthalmologists in daily practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infection control strategies in the hospital and Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, are discussed. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection, as they have close contact with patients during ocular examinations, and are also facing high patient volume in outpatient clinics as well as emergency consultations. Furthermore, ocular symptoms, such as conjunctivitis, may be the presenting signs of COVID-19 infection. We provide our strategies, which include hospital's gate control with triage station, patient volume control, proper personal protective equipment, and consultation with telemedicine technology, to decrease the risk of cross-infection between medical staffs and patients. CONCLUSION: To achieve the goal of preventing viral spread and maximizing patient and medical staffs' safety, besides providing proper protective equipment, it is also crucial for staffs and patients to strictly follow antiepidemic measures. We hope that our experience can help ophthalmologists and health-care workers to have a safer working environment when facing COVID-19 pandemic.","Lin, Jui-Yen; Kang, Eugene; Yeh, Po-Han; Ling, Xiao; Chen, Hung-Chi; Chen, Kuan-Jen; Hwang, Yih-Shiou; Lai, Chi-Chun; Wu, Wei-Chi",Taiwan J.

It is thus imperative to study post-COVID (i.e., short-term) and long-COVID (i.e., long-term) effects, specifically as local and systemic pathophysiological outcomes of other coronavirus-related diseases (such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)) were well-cataloged. We conducted a comprehensive review of adverse post-COVID health outcomes and potential long-COVID effects. We observed that such adverse outcomes were not localized. Rather, they affected different human systems, including: (i) immune system (e.g., Guillain-Barré syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndromes such as Kawasaki disease), (ii) hematological system (vascular hemostasis, blood coagulation), (iii) pulmonary system (respiratory failure, pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pulmonary vascular damage, pulmonary fibrosis), (iv) cardiovascular system (myocardial hypertrophy, coronary artery atherosclerosis, focal myocardial fibrosis, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac hypertrophy), (v) gastrointestinal, hepatic, and renal systems (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia, acid reflux, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, lack of appetite/constipation), (vi) skeletomuscular system (immune-mediated skin diseases, psoriasis, lupus), (vii) nervous system (loss of taste/smell/hearing, headaches, spasms, convulsions, confusion, visual impairment, nerve pain, dizziness, impaired consciousness, nausea/vomiting, hemiplegia, ataxia, stroke, cerebral hemorrhage), (viii) mental health (stress, depression and anxiety). We additionally hypothesized mechanisms of action by investigating possible molecular mechanisms associated with these disease outcomes/symptoms.

METHODS: Four sample treatments were evaluated in a 3-step procedure to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva: 1) heating at 95 °C for 5 min for sample inactivation; 2) sample treatment; 3) analysis by reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Saliva samples used were from infected individuals or were spiked with known quantities of viral particles. RESULTS: Three treatments had a limit of detection (LOD) of 500.000 viral particles per ml of saliva and could be used to detect individuals with potential to transmit the disease. The treatment of phosphate buffer, dithiothreitol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and proteinase K, with an additional 95 °C heating step, yielded a lower LOD of 95; its sensitivity ranged from 100% in patients with nasopharyngeal swab reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction cycle threshold values <20 to 47.8% for values >30. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance of an adequate sample treatment for saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 and describes a flexible procedure that can be adapted to point-of-care. Although its sensitivity when LAMP is used is lower than reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, this procedure can contribute to COVID-19 control by detecting individuals able to transmit the disease.","Rubio, Camila P; Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Resalt, Cristina Sánchez; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Morata-Martínez, Irene; Bernal, Enrique; Alcaraz, María J; Vicente-Romero, María R; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Cerón, José J",Int J Infect Dis,,215

Practical implications: Team member selection is likely to be one of the first tasks necessary when such a temporary task force is created. Additionally, competent individuals might be successful even when not embedded in clear structures and even when not working in their own specialist roles. Originality/value: The sudden pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 disrupted governments, corporations and individual people alike. As handling a pandemic is new for most involved people, and many such task forces are shown to be manned by personnel not formally trained in crisis management, this study's results represent important contributions to team performance, decision-making and crisis management literature in general. Furthermore, avenues for further research into the comparative analysis of predictors are revealed.","Wegmann, Reto M.; Schärrer, Laura",J. Organ. Eff. People Perform.,,215

COVID-19 induces a massive release of proinflammatory cytokines, which drives COVID-19 progression, severity, and mortality. In addition, bronchial epithelial cells are the first pulmonary cells activated by coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2) leading to massive cytokine release, which can hyperactivate lung fibroblasts, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis, a phenomenon observed even in moderate COVID-19 survivors. This in vitro study tested the hypothesis that Virlaza, a herbal medicine, could inhibit the hyperactivation of human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and pulmonary fibroblasts (MRC-5) induced by SARS-Cov-2. BEAS-2B (5x104/mL/well) and MRC-5 (5x104/mL/well) cells were co-cultivated with 1ml of blood of a Sars-Cov-2 infected patient for 4 hours and Virlaza (1ug/mL) was added in the first minute of the co-culture. After 4 hours, the cells were recovered and used for analysis of cytotoxicity by MTT and for mRNA expression of P2X7 receptor E iNOS. The supernatant was used to measure ATP and cytokines. Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased release of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha by BEAS-2B and MRC-5 cells (p<0.001). Treatment with Virlaza resulted in reduction of ATP, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha release (p<0.001). In addition, Sars-Cov-2 incubation resulted in increased expression of P2X7 receptor and iNOS (p<0.001), which has been reversed by Virlaza (p<0.001). In conclusion, Virlaza presents important anti-inflammatory effects in the context of Sars-Cov-2 infection.","Brandao-Rangel, Maysa A R; Melamed, Dobroslav; Silva-Reis, Anamei; Brill, Boris; Zamarioli, Lucas dos Santos; Oliveira, Carlos R; Vieira, Rodolfo P",,,215

METHODS: The survey was conducted online from April 27 to May 1, 2020. Questionnaires were sent to core facilities and affiliated hospitals of the obstetrics and gynecology training program and to hospitals of the national perinatal medical liaison council. RESULTS: A total of 296 institutions participated in our survey; however, 2 institutions were excluded. Full PPE was used by doctors in 7.1% of facilities and by midwives in 6.8%. Our study also determined that around 65.0% of facilities for doctors and 73.5% of facilities for midwives used PPE beyond the ""standard gown or apron, surgical mask, goggles or face shield"" during labor of asymptomatic women. N95 masks were running out of stock at 6.5% of the facilities and goggles and face shields at 2.7%. Disposable N95 masks and goggles or face shields were re-used after re-sterilization in 12% and 14% of facilities, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of asymptomatic patients was performed for 9% of vaginal deliveries, 14% of planned cesarean sections and 17% of emergency cesarean sections. The number of PCR tests for obstetrics and gynecology per a week ranged from zero to five in 92% of facilities. CONCLUSION: The shortage of PPE in Japan is alarming. Sufficient stockpiling of PPE is necessary to prevent unnecessary disruptions in medical care. Appropriate guidelines for PPE usage and COVID-19 testing of pregnant women at delivery are needed in Japan.","Umazume, Takeshi; Miyagi, Etsuko; Haruyama, Yasuo; Kobashi, Gen; Saito, Shigeru; Hayakawa, Satoshi; Kawana, Kei; Ikenoue, Satoru; Morioka, Ichiro; Yamada, Hideto",J Obstet Gynaecol Res,,215

We aimed to evaluate whether aerobic exercise (i.e., walking combined with jogging) improves objective sleep parameters among female nurses who met eligibility criterion as poor sleepers at the end of an 8-week exercise program and 4 weeks after study completion. This single-blinded, parallel-design, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a classroom of a hospital in northern Taiwan. Sixty eligible female nurses were randomly assigned to either the aerobic exercise (n = 30) or usual activity status (n = 30) group. A moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program was administered over 5 days (60 min per day) a week for 8 weeks after the nurses' day shifts. Objective sleep outcomes including total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE) were retrieved using an actigraph device. A generalized estimating equation model was used for data analysis. The aerobic exercise group exhibited improvements in TST and SE at 4 and 8 weeks compared with the baseline evaluation (TST: B = 70.49 and 55.96; SE: B = 5.21 and 3.98). Between-group differences were observed in SOL and WASO at 4 weeks but not 8 weeks compared with the baseline evaluation (SOL: B = -7.18; WASO: B = -11.38). Positive lasting effects for TST were observed only until the 4-week follow-up. To improve sleep quality and quantity, we encourage female nurses who sleep poorly to regularly perform moderate-intensity aerobic exercise.","Niu, Shu-Fen; Lin, Chia-Jou; Chen, Pin-Yuan; Fan, Yen-Chun; Huang, Hui-Chuan; Chiu, Hsiao-Yean",Res. nurs. health,,215

Although young adults with multiple sclerosis (yawMS) might be at greater risk of developing psychological distress linked to the pandemic, they might also be able to adapt to stress and find meaning in adverse life events. The aim of the present study was to explore benefit finding in response to the pandemic in a sample of yawMS. As part of a larger project, data were collected using a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Benefit finding was analysed using a qualitative thematic approach; descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to describe the sample and compare sub-groups. Out of 247 respondents with mostly relapsing-remitting MS, 199 (31.9 ± 6.97 years) reported at least one benefit. Qualitative analysis showed that during the pandemic yawMS found benefits related to three themes: personal growth, relational growth, and existential growth. No differences in benefit finding were found between age sub-groups (18-30 vs. 31-45). Participants reported a wide range of benefits, some of which seem to be specific to MS or the pandemic. Results have been transformed into tips to be introduced in clinical practice to promote resilience in yawMS through meaning making.","Poli, Silvia; Rimondini, Michela; Gajofatto, Alberto; Mazzi, Maria Angela; Busch, Isolde Martina; Gobbin, Francesca; Schena, Federico; Del Piccolo, Lidia; Donisi, Valeria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,215

COVID-19 containment measures, including isolation and triage, led to restrictions in the health care of chronically ill patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of IBD patients. METHODS: In this multicentre cross-sectional study to evaluate the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health and quality of care of patients with inherited bleeding disorder, an ad hoc questionnaire was sent to 586 patients/parents of children with haemophilia A, B or von Willebrand syndrome type 3. In addition to demographic and clinical data, patients/parents of patients with inherited bleeding disorders were asked about their thoughts, concerns and experiences regarding their medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Differences between clinical subgroups were calculated. RESULTS: Significant differences were found between subgroups (severity, type of therapy, product class, comorbidities) with regard to the transmission of COVID-19 through plasma products, the effects of COVID-19 positive test results, fear of getting COVID-19, delayed drug supply and physiotherapy treatment. DISCUSSION: The medical care of patients with inherited bleeding disorders, who need a continuous supply of essential drugs, is a particular challenge in times of pandemics. Therefore, worries and fears of IBD patients should be taken seriously and innovative communication channels established to maintain therapy standards and quality of care.","Olivieri, Martin; Halimeh, Susan; Wermes, Cornelia; Hassenpflug, Wolf; Holstein, Katharina; von Mackensen, Sylvia",Gesundheitswesen,,215

We presented an age-structured Susceptible-Latent-Mild-Critical-Removed (SLMCR) compartmental model of COVID-19 disease transmission with nonlinear incidence during the pandemic period. We provided the model calibration to estimate parameters with day-wise COVID-19 data, i.e., reported cases by worldometer from 15th February to 30th March 2020 in six high-burden countries, including Australia, Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK, and Canada. We estimate transmission rates for each country and found that the country with the highest transmission rate is Spain, which may increase the new cases and deaths than the other countries. We found that saturation infection negatively impacted the dynamics of COVID-19 cases in all the six high-burden countries. The study used a sensitivity analysis to identify the most critical parameters through the partial rank correlation coefficient method. We found that the transmission rate of COVID-19 had the most significant influence on prevalence. The prediction of new cases in COVID-19 until 30th April 2020 using the developed model was also provided with recommendations to control strategies of COVID-19. We also found that adults are more susceptible to infection than both children and older people in all six countries. However, in Italy, Spain, the UK, and Canada, older people show more susceptibility to infection than children, opposite to the case in Australia and the USA.

This paper aims to evaluate sound level exposure in a densely populated environmental justice city in close proximity to major roadways, a nearby airport and high levels of industrial activity. In this study we collected various sound level metrics to evaluate the loudness and frequency composition of the acoustical environment in Chelsea, Massachusetts, USA. A total of 29 week-long sites were collected from October 2019 to June 2020, a time period that also included the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which drastically altered activity patterns and corresponding sound level exposures. We found that Chelsea is exposed to high levels of sound, both day and night (65 dB (A), and 80 dB and 90 dB for low frequency, and infrasound sound levels). A spectral analysis shows that 63 Hz was the dominant frequency. Distance to major roads and flight activity (both arrivals and departures) were most strongly correlated with all metrics, most notably with metrics describing contributing from lower frequencies. Overall, we found similar patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic but at levels up to 10 dB lower. Our results demonstrate the importance of noise exposure assessments in environmental justice communities and the importance of using additional metrics to describe communities inundated with significant air, road, and industrial sound levels. It also provides a snapshot of how much quieter communities can be with careful and intentional urban and environmental policy and planning.","Walker, Erica D; Lee, Nina F; Scammell, Madeleine K; Feuer, Arielle P; Power, Maria B; Lane, Kevin J; Adamkiewicz, Gary; Levy, Jonathan I",Environ Res,,215

To do so, academic medical centers must address 2 key research issues: (1) how to effectively and efficiently determine which trials have the best chance of benefiting current and future patients and (2) how to establish a transparent and ethical process for subject recruitment while maintaining research integrity and without overburdening patients or staff. We share here the current methods used by Michigan Medicine to address these issues.","Spector-Bagdady, Kayte; Higgins, Peter D R; Aaronson, Keith D; Birk, Judy; Flaherty, Kevin R; Gregg, Kevin S; Hyzy, Robert C; Kaul, Daniel R; Lauring, Adam S; Magee, John C; Meurer, William J; Park, Pauline K; Scott, Phillip; Lok, Anna S",Clin Infect Dis,,215

256727,Strategy to identify priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination: A population based cohort study,2021,"The 2016 global commitments towards ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 require the Asia-Pacific region to reach the Fast-Track targets by 2020. Despite early successes, the region is well short of meeting these targets. The overall stalled progress in the HIV response has been further undermined by rising new infections among young key populations and the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the HIV situation, assesses the gaps, and analyses what it would take the region to end AIDS by 2030. Political will and commitments for ending AIDS must be reaffirmed and reinforced. Focused regional strategic direction that answers the specific regional context and guides countries to respond to their specific needs must be put in place. The region must harness the power of innovative tools and technology in both prevention and treatment. Community activism and meaningful community engagement across the spectrum of HIV response must be ensured. Punitive laws, stigma, and discrimination that deter key populations and people living with HIV from accessing health services must be effectively tackled. The people-centred public health approach must be fully integrated into national universal health coverage while ensuring domestic resources are available for community-led service delivery. The region must utilise its full potential and draw upon lessons that have been learnt to address common challenges of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics and achieve the goal of ending AIDS by 2030, in fulfillment of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.","Murphy, Eamonn; Shwe, Ye Yu; Bhatia, Reeta; Bakkali, Taoufik; Vannakit, Ravipa",Sex Health,,215
256909,When Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus and Severe COVID-19 Converge: The Perfect Storm for Mucormycosis,2021,"INTRODUCTION: While telemedicine usage has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains little consensus about how spine surgeons perceive virtual care. The purpose of this study was to explore international perspectives of spine providers on the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. METHODS: Responses from 485 members of AO Spine were analyzed, covering provider perceptions of the challenges and benefits of telemedicine. All questions were optional, and blank responses were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: The leading challenges reported by surgeons were decreased ability to perform physical examinations (38.6%), possible increased medicolegal exposure (19.3%), and lack of reimbursement parity compared to traditional visits (15.5%). Fewer than 9.0% of respondents experienced technological issues. On average, respondents agreed that telemedicine increases access to care for rural/long-distance patients, provides societal cost savings, and increases patient convenience. Responses were mixed about whether telemedicine leads to greater patient satisfaction. North Americans experienced the most challenges, but also thought telemedicine carried the most benefits, whereas Africans reported the fewest challenges and benefits. Age did not affect responses. CONCLUSION: Spine surgeons are supportive of the benefits of telemedicine, and only a small minority experienced technical issues. The decreased ability to perform the physical examination was the top challenge and remains a major obstacle to virtual care for spine surgeons around the world, although interestingly, 61.4% of providers did not acknowledge this to be a major challenge. Significant groundwork in optimizing remote physical examination maneuvers and achieving legal and reimbursement clarity is necessary for widespread implementation.","Riew, Grant J; Lovecchio, Francis; Samartzis, Dino; Bernstein, David N; Underwood, Ellen Y; Louie, Philip K; Germscheid, Niccole; An, Howard S; Cheung, Jason Pui Yin; Chutkan, Norman; Mallow, Gary Michael; Neva, Marko H; Phillips, Frank M; Sciubba, Daniel M; El-Sharkawi, Mohammad; Valacco, Marcelo; McCarthy, Michael H; Iyer, Sravisht; Makhni, Melvin C",Eur. spine j,,215

257320,Discontinuation of botulinum neurotoxin type-A treatment during COVID-19 pandemic: an Italian survey in post stroke and traumatic brain injury patients living with spasticity,2020,"BACKGROUND: Balancing the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the resumption of travel is a global priority. Current recommendations include mitigation measures before, during, and after travel. Pre- and post-travel strategies including symptom monitoring, antigen or nucleic acid amplification testing, and quarantine can be combined in multiple ways considering different trade-offs in feasibility, adherence, effectiveness, cost, and adverse consequences. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to analyze the expected effectiveness of symptom monitoring, testing, and quarantine under different estimates of the infectious period, test-positivity relative to time of infection, and test sensitivity to reduce the risk of transmission from infected travelers during and after travel. RESULTS: If infection occurs 0-7 days prior to travel, immediate isolation following symptom onset prior to or during travel reduces risk of transmission while traveling by 30-35%. Pre-departure testing can further reduce risk, with testing closer to the time of travel being optimal even if test sensitivity is lower than an earlier test. For example, testing on the day of departure can reduce risk while traveling by 44-72%. For transmission risk after travel with infection time up to 7 days prior to arrival at the destination, isolation based on symptom monitoring reduced introduction risk at the destination by 42-56%. A 14-day quarantine after arrival, without symptom monitoring or testing, can reduce post-travel risk by 96-100% on its own. However, a shorter quarantine of 7 days combined with symptom monitoring and a test on day 5-6 after arrival is also effective (97--100%) at reducing introduction risk and is less burdensome, which may improve adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine is an effective measure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from travelers and can be enhanced by the addition of symptom monitoring and testing. Optimal test timing depends on the effectiveness of quarantine: with low adherence or no quarantine, optimal test timing is close to the time of arrival; with effective quarantine, testing a few days later optimizes sensitivity to detect those infected immediately before or while traveling. These measures can complement recommendations such as social distancing, using masks, and hand hygiene, to further reduce risk during and after travel.","Johansson, Michael A; Wolford, Hannah; Paul, Prabasaj; Diaz, Pamela S; Chen, Tai-Ho; Brown, Clive M; Cetron, Martin S; Alvarado-Ramy, Francisco",BMC Med,,215

257879,Risk of COVID-19 in dermatologic patients receiving long-term immunomodulatory therapy,2020,"Elections occurring during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been affected by notable changes in the methods of voting, the number and type of polling locations, and in-person voting procedures (1). To mitigate transmission of COVID-19 at polling locations, jurisdictions have adopted changes to protocols and procedures, informed by CDC's interim guidance, developed in collaboration with the Election Assistance Commission (2). The driving principle for this guidance is that voting practices with lower infection risk will be those which reduce the number of voters who congregate indoors in polling locations by offering a variety of methods for voting and longer voting periods. The guidance for in-person voting includes considerations for election officials, poll workers, and voters to maintain healthy environments and operations. To assess knowledge and adoption of mitigation strategies, CDC collaborated with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services and the Delaware State Election Commission on a survey of poll workers who served during the statewide primary election on September 15, 2020. Among 522 eligible poll workers, 93% correctly answered all three survey questions about COVID-19 transmission. Respondents noted that most voters and poll workers wore masks. However, masks were not always worn correctly (i.e., covering both the nose and mouth). Responses suggest that mitigation measures recommended for both poll workers and voters were widely adopted and feasible, but also highlighted gaps in infection prevention control efforts. Strengthening of measures intended to minimize the risk of poll workers acquiring COVID-19 from ill voters, such as additional training and necessary personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as support for alternative voting options for ill voters, are needed. Adherence to mitigation measures is important not only to protect voters but also to protect poll workers, many of whom are older adults, and thus at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. Enhanced attention to reducing congregation in polling locations, correct mask use, and providing safe voting options for ill voters are critical considerations to minimize risk to voters and poll workers. Evidence from the Delaware election supports the feasibility and acceptability of implementing current CDC guidance for election officials, poll workers, and voters for mitigating COVID-19 transmission at polling locations (2).","Leidman, Eva; Hall, Noemi B; Kirby, Amy E; Garcia-Williams, Amanda G; Aponte, Jose; Yoder, Jonathan S; Hong, Rick; Albence, Anthony; Coronado, Fátima; Massetti, Greta M",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,215

Aim: The present study has analyzed the trend in alcohol-related intoxications requiring the hospitalization of children, adolescents and young adults aged less than 21 years in Slovenia in the 1999–2018 period. Methods: We performed a retrospective study on patients discharged after hospitalizations due to mental and behavioral disorders due to acute alcohol intoxication (MBDAAI) or hospitalizations due to the toxic effects of alcohol (TEA We considered three groups: children (aged 10–14), adolescents (aged 15–19) and young adults (20–21 years old). Hospitalization rates and time trends were analyzed using joinpoint regression to obtain the annually calculated age-and sex-specific rates and the annual percentage of change (APC). Results: Considering a total of 2912 MBDAAI-hospitalizations, 15–19-year-old subjects showed a significantly higher hospitalization rate compared to the immediately younger and older age groups and a significant increase in hospitalization rates in the period 1999–2011, followed by a significant decrease. Considering 1143 TEA-hospitalizations, we observed a continuous decrease in the hospitalization rates for children and young adults and, conversely, a continuous even if less than significant increase for adolescents aged 15–19. Conclusions: Alcohol consumption in Slovenian children and adolescents is a highly important health concern. Special attention to public health problem of severe alcohol abuse requiring hospitalization in children and adolescents is needed, especially with possible crisis of SARS-CoV-2/Covid-19 situation.","Lovrecic, Mercedes; Lovrecic, Barbara; Simon, Mateja Rok; Korosec, Ales; Rocca, Filippo Della; Maremmani, Angelo G.

The extent to which clinical and demographic factors moderate this relationship is unclear, though signals are emerging that link higher BMI and higher HbA1c to worse outcomes in PWD with COVID-19. As well as posing direct immediate risks to PWD, COVID-19 also risks contributing to worse diabetes outcomes due to disruptions caused by the pandemic, including stress and changes to routine care, diet, and physical activity. Countries have used various strategies to support PWD during this pandemic.

Little was known about the impact of these changes on childbearing women. AIM: To describe childbearing women's experiences of becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory design using semi-structured interviews was used. Women were recruited through social media and self-nominated to participate in an interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. A total of 27 interviews were conducted with women across Australia. Data were analysed thematically. FINDINGS: The thematic analysis resulted in four primary themes and ten sub-themes. The themes were 'going it alone - having a baby was an isolating experience' ('receiving maternity care alone', 'dealing with government restrictions', and 'desiring social support'), 'advocating for self or others' ('seeking reliable information', 'valuing peersupport', and 'having to be resourceful'), 'finding a way through' ('a changed experience for all', 'managing stress and anxiety', 'requiring constant adjustments', and 'managing fear mongering'), and 'keeping safe'. CONCLUSION: Becoming a mother during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was a profound experience for the women. Following the public health initiatives which resulted in physical distancing restrictions, isolation, and the need to provide and receive social and peer support were common experiences. Whilst public health initiatives are implemented to keep people safe, the social and emotional toll on childbearing women should be considered by healthcare professionals. Childbearing women need to be safe but also require support and reassurance.","Sweet, Linda; Bradfield, Zoe; Vasilevski, Vidanka; Wynter, Karen; Hauck, Yvonne; Kuliukas, Lesley; Homer, Caroline S E; Szabo, Rebecca A; Wilson, Alyce N",Midwifery,,215

Younger age, previous infection, and compromised health status (chronic illnesses and regular medicines uptake) can be associated with an increased risk of CoronaVac SEs;Conclusions: The independent research shows a higher prevalence of CoronaVac SEs than what is reported by phase I–III clinical trials. In general, the results of this study confirm the overall safety of CoronaVac and suggest potential risk factors for its SEs. Gender-based differences and SEs distribution among age groups are worth further investigation.","Riad, A.; Sağıroğlu, D.; amp,; Uuml,; stün, B.; Pokorná, A.; Klugarová, J.; Attia, S.; Klugar, M.",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,215

There are at present no effective treatments for COVID-19. The safety and effectiveness of western anti-coronavirus drugs are under investigation. In many places in China, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used to treat COVID-19 with a high clinical cure rate. The treatment economics of TCM is good. The immune-regulating and antiviral TCM can enhance human immunity and exert an antiviral effect. They have been widely used in the anti-COVID-19 treatment. We consulted the database of CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and PubMed for screening the immune-regulating and antiviral TCMs (Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Pogostemonis Herba, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Scutellariae Radix, Forsythiae Fructus, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Bupleuri Radix, Isatidis Radix, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Astragali Radix, and Houttuyniae Herba). This article summarizes the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics, and the clinical application of the effective components of immune-regulating and antiviral TCM in the prescriptions and Chinese patent medicines, in order to provide a better reference for the clinical application of TCM.","Chen, Ran; Wang, Ting-Ting; Li, Kai-Ling; Shang, Rui-Feng; Song, Jie; Zhang, Jing-Qing",Chin.

266021,African American Patient Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes: A Call to Action for Physiatrists to Provide Rehabilitation Care to Black Survivors,2020,"Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have been confronted with an online semester. Because of the special requirements, online teaching can trigger negative emotions, which can have an unfavourable impact on the learning process and which therefore need to be regulated. This study investigates academic-associated emotions and the regulation of those emotions both before (December 2019) and during (June 2020) the online semester for first-year medical students. Methods: Questionnaire data (t1=Dec 2019; t2=Jun 2020) regarding academic-associated emotions and emotion regulation, taken from a longitudinal research project (Experienced Learning Medicine Augsburg; ELMA) at the University of Augsburg, was used. At t2, the students were also asked, as future physicians, to name their three most significant emotions regarding their studies, taking into account the COVID-19 situation. Results: Longitudinal analyses (Wilcoxon tests) showed few changes in academic-associated emotions. The emotions happy (r=.32) and proud (r=.33) increased significantly with moderate effects at the online semester. There also was an increased, but still low suppression of emotions (r=.22) at t2. The future physicians were most often curious, grateful and afraid about their medical studies with regard to the COVID-19 situation. Overall, medical studies were more often associated with positive than negative emotions during the online semester. Conclusions: The results show that the online semester did not have any worrying impacts on academic-associated emotions and emotion regulation. There was even some indication that students might benefit from online teaching formats.","Polujanski, Sabine; Schindler, Ann-Kathrin; Rotthoff, Thomas",GMS J Med Educ,,215
266420,"Sevoflurane, a sigh of relief in COVID-19?",2020,"During disasters and pandemics, vulnerable populations such as patients with mental conditions are known to be overly influenced. Yet, not much is known about how the individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one of the most common neurodevelopmental conditions globally with a prevalence of 1%, are affected from health-related disasters, especially the current Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conducted an investigation of how individuals with ASD responded to Covid-19 in terms of comprehension and adherence to implemented measures; changes in their behavioral problems; and how their caregivers' anxiety levels relate with these behavioral changes. Our sample consisted of 87 individuals with ASD (15 girls; ages ranged from 3-29, with an average of 13.96 ± 6.1). The majority of our sample had problems understanding what Covid-19 is and the measures it requires. They also had challenges in implementing social distance and hygiene-related regulations of the pandemic. The majority stopped receiving special education during this period. We observed a Covid-19-related clinical presentation that resembled PTSD in individuals with ASD in terms of increased stereotypies, aggression, hypersensitivity, behavioral problems, and sleep and appetite alterations. All subscales of Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) differed significantly between before and after the pandemic conditions. The number of hours the children slept significantly decreased from before to during Covid-19. The anxiety levels of caregivers were high and correlated with the current behavioral problem levels of their children, but not with the level of their behavioral problems before the pandemic. The difference in ABC total score and specifically the lethargy/social withdrawal subscale score predicted parents' anxiety score. Our results suggest that the Covid-19 period inflicts specific challenges to individuals with ASD and their caregivers, underlining the need for targeted, distance special education interventions and other support services for this population.","Mutluer, Tuba; Doenyas, Ceymi; Aslan Genc, Herdem",Front Psychiatry,,215

Since then, the virus has quickly spread worldwide, leading the World Health Organization to declare it as a pandemic; by the end of April 2020, the number of cases exceeded 3 million. Due to the high infectivity rate, SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain, making disinfectant protocols vital, especially for essential, highly trafficked areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, and delivery centers. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, best practices to slow the spread rely on good hand hygiene, including proper handwashing practices as well as the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers. However, they provide warning against sanitizing products containing benzalkonium chloride (BAC), which has sparked concern in both the scientific community as well as the general public as BAC, a common quaternary ammonium compound (QAC), is ubiquitous in soaps and cleaning wipes as well as hospital sanitation kits. This viewpoint aims to highlight the outdated and incongruous data in the evaluation of BAC against the family of known coronaviruses and points to the need for further evaluation of the efficacy of QACs against coronaviruses.","Schrank, Cassandra L; Minbiole, Kevin P C; Wuest, William M",ACS Infect Dis,,215

267460,A Clinical Study on Initial Experience of COVID-19 ARDS in Obstetric Patients at a Tertiary Care Centre in India,2021,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities house thousands of undocumented immigrants in environments discordant with the public health recommendations to reduce the transmission of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.","Irvine, Michael; Coombs, Daniel; Skarha, Julianne; Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah; Taxman, Faye; Green, Traci C",J. urban health,,215

Particularly on the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, biological sequence data play an important role in detecting diseases, analyzing the mechanism and discovering specific drugs. In recent years, pretraining models that have emerged in natural language processing have attracted widespread attention in many research fields not only to decrease training cost but also to improve performance on downstream tasks. Pretraining models are used for embedding biological sequence and extracting feature from large biological sequence corpus to comprehensively understand the biological sequence data. In this survey, we provide a broad review on pretraining models for biological sequence data. Moreover, we first introduce biological sequences and corresponding datasets, including brief description and accessible link. Subsequently, we systematically summarize popular pretraining models for biological sequences based on four categories: CNN, word2vec, LSTM and Transformer. Then, we present some applications with proposed pretraining models on downstream tasks to explain the role of pretraining models. Next, we provide a novel pretraining scheme for protein sequences and a multitask benchmark for protein pretraining models. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in pretraining models for biological sequences.","Song, Bosheng; Li, Zimeng; Lin, Xuan; Wang, Jianmin; Wang, Tian; Fu, Xiangzheng",Briefings in functional genomics (Online),,215
271866,Improved Safety of Endoscopic Vessel Harvesting During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the rise of remote work with consequences for the global division of work. Remote work could connect labour markets, but it could also increase spatial polarisation. However, our understanding of the geographies of remote work is limited. Specifically, does remote work bring jobs to rural areas or is it concentrating in large cities, and how do skill requirements affect competition for jobs and wages? We use data from a fully remote labour market - an online labour platform - to show that remote work is polarised along three dimensions. First, countries are globally divided: North American, European, and South Asian remote workers attract most jobs, while many Global South countries participate only marginally. Secondly, remote jobs are pulled to urban regions; rural areas fall behind. Thirdly, remote work is polarised along the skill axis: workers with in-demand skills attract profitable jobs, while others face intense competition and obtain low wages. The findings suggest that remote work is shaped by agglomerative forces, which are deepening the gap between urban and rural areas. To make remote work an effective tool for rural development, it needs to be embedded in local skill-building and labour market programmes.","Braesemann, Fabian; Stephany, Fabian; Teutloff, Ole; Kassi, Otto; Graham, Mark; Lehdonvirta, Vili",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13356v1.pdf,215

The immunopathogenesis of the infection is currently unknown. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at highest risk of infection and disease. Aim of the study was to assess the sero-prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in an Italian cohort of HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay (BioMedomics IgM-IgG Combined Antibody Rapid Test) was adopted to assess the prevalence of IgG and IgM against SARS-CoV-2. It was ethically approved (""Milano Area 1"" Ethical Committee prot. n. 2020/ST/057). RESULTS: A total of 202 individuals (median age 45 years; 34.7% males) were retrospectively recruited in an Italian hospital (Milan, Italy). The percentage (95% CI) of recruited individuals with IgM and IgG were 14.4% (9.6-19.2%) and 7.4% (3.8-11.0%), respectively. IgM were more frequently found in males (24.3%), and in individuals aged 20-29 (25.9%) and 60-69 (30.4%) years. No relationship was found between exposure to COVID-19 patients and IgM and IgG positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The present study did show a low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgM in Italian HCWs.

279723,Hemoptysis as an Initial Presentation of COVID-19 - An Observation,2020,"The WHO has announced the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak to be a global pandemic. The distribution of community outbreaks shows seasonal patterns along certain latitude, temperature and humidity, that is, similar to the behaviour of seasonal viral respiratory tract infections. COVID-19 displays significant spread in northern mid-latitude countries with an average temperature of 5­11°C and low humidity. Vitamin D deficiency has also been described as pandemic, especially in Europe. Regardless of age, ethnicity and latitude, recent data showed that 40 % of Europeans are vitamin D deficient (25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50 nmol/l), and 13 % are severely deficient (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l). A quadratic relationship was found between the prevalences of vitamin D deficiency in most commonly affected countries by COVID-19 and the latitudes. Vitamin D deficiency is more common in the subtropical and mid-latitude countries than the tropical and high-latitude countries. The most commonly affected countries with severe vitamin D deficiency are from the subtropical (Saudi Arabia 46 %; Qatar 46 %; Iran 33·4 %; Chile 26·4 %) and mid-latitude (France 27·3 %; Portugal 21·2 %; Austria 19·3 %) regions. Severe vitamin D deficiency was found to be nearly 0 % in some high-latitude countries (e.g. Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Netherlands). Accordingly, we would like to call attention to the possible association between severe vitamin D deficiency and mortality pertaining to COVID-19. Given its rare side effects and relatively wide safety, prophylactic vitamin D supplementation and/or food fortification might reasonably serve as a very convenient adjuvant therapy for these two worldwide public health problems alike.","Kara, Murat; Ekiz, Timur; Ricci, Vincenzo; Kara, Özgür; Chang, Ke-Vin; Özçakar, Levent",Br J Nutr,,215
280637,Adapting Vascular Surgery Practice to the Current COVID-19 Era at a Tertiary Academic Center in Madrid,2020,"The ability of ant colonies to transport, store, and distribute food resources through trophallaxis is a key advantage of social life. Nonetheless, how the structure of the digestive system has adapted across the ant phylogeny to facilitate these abilities is still not well understood. The crop and proventriculus, structures in the ant foregut (stomodeum), have received most attention for their roles in trophallaxis. However, potential roles of the esophagus have not been as well studied. Here, we report for the first time the presence of an auxiliary thoracic crop in Pheidole aberrans and Pheidole deima using X-ray micro-computed tomography and 3D segmentation. Additionally, we describe morphological modifications involving the endo- and exoskeleton that are associated with the presence of the thoracic crop. Our results indicate that the presence of a thoracic crop in major workers suggests their potential role as repletes or live food reservoirs, expanding the possibilities of tasks assumed by these individuals in the colony. Our contribution emphasizes the utility of combining data from external and internal morphology to better understand functional and behavioral mechanisms.","Casadei-Ferreira, A; Fischer, G; Economo, E P",Arthropod Struct Dev,,215

A call for action,2020,"Currently, Brazil has one of the fastest increasing COVID-19 epidemics in the world, that has caused at least 94 thousand confirmed deaths until now. The city of Sao Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populous in the country. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is important to help the urgent need to integrate better actions to face the pandemic. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the COVID-19 mortality, from March to July 2020, considering the spatio-time architectures, the socio-economic context of the population, and using a fine granular level, in the most populous city in Brazil. For this, we conducted an ecological study, using secondary public data from the mortality information system. We describe mortality rates for each epidemiological week and the entire period by sex and age. We modelled the deaths using spatiotemporal and spatial architectures and Poisson probability distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We obtained the relative risks for temporal and spatiotemporal trends and socio-economic conditions. To reduce possible sub notification, we considered the confirmed and suspected deaths. Our findings showed an apparent stabilization of the temporal trend, at the end of the period, but that may change in the future. Mortality rate increased with increasing age and was higher in men. The risk of death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions throughout the study period. However, this was not a uniform pattern over time, since we identified a shift from the high risk in the areas with best socio-economic conditions to the worst ones. Our study contributed by emphasizing the importance of geographic screening in areas with a higher risk of death, and, currently, worse socio-economic contexts, as a crucial aspect to reducing disease mortality and health inequities, through integrated public health actions.","Bermudi, Patricia Marques Moralejo; Lorenz, Camila; Aguiar, Breno Souza de; Failla, Marcelo Antunes; Barrozo, Ligia Vizeu; Chiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02322v1.pdf,215

282055,Measuring the shadows: A systematic review of chronic emptiness in borderline personality disorder,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with COVID-19 frequently exhibit a hypercoagulable state with high thrombotic risk, particularly those admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Thromboprophylaxis is mandatory in these patients; nevertheless, thrombosis still occurs in many cases. Thus, the problem of assessing an adequate level of anticoagulation in ICU patients becomes evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the heparin resistance and the efficacy of heparin monitoring using an anti-Xa activity assay. METHODS: Thirty-seven heparin-treated patients admitted to ICU for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were retrospectively studied for antifactor Xa activity (anti-Xa), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), Antithrombin, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Factor VIII, von Willebrand Factor, and the total daily amount of heparin administered. The correlation between APTT and anti-Xa was evaluated for unfractionated heparins (UFH). The correlations between the daily dose of UFH or the dosage expressed as IU/kg b.w. for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and anti-Xa were also evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients received calcium heparin, 8 sodium heparin, and 8 LMWH. A moderate correlation was found between APTT and anti-Xa for UFH. APTT did not correlate with coagulation parameters. 62% of UFH and 75% of LMWH treated patients were under the therapeutic range. About 75% of patients could be considered resistant to heparin. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-COV2 pneumonia patients in ICU have frequently heparin resistance. Anti-Xa seems a more reliable method to monitor heparin treatment than APTT in acute patients, also because the assay is insensitive to the increased levels of fibrinogen, FVIII, and LAC that are common during the COVID-19 inflammatory state.","Novelli, Chiara; Borotto, Erika; Beverina, Ivo; Punzi, Veronica; Radrizzani, Danilo; Brando, Bruno",Int. j. lab. hematol,,215

AIMS: This study explored adolescent psychopathological profiles at age 17, and their role in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at age 19. METHODS: The analyses used a sample of 904 participants (mean age = 19.17 years) from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) sweep 7 who completed the mental health questions from January 2018 to March 2019 (mean age = 17.18 years) and the COVID-19 Survey in May 2020. Adolescent psychopathological profiles were identified by means of latent class analysis. RESULTS: Four psychopathological profiles were identified: ""low-symptom class"" (60.17% of participants), ""high-symptom class"" (23.01% of participants), ""substance/behavioural addictions class"" (12.03% of participants), and ""emotion-dysregulation class"" (4.79% of participants). Adolescents in the high-symptom and emotional-dysregulation classes had the worst outcome during the lockdown. Specifically, they experienced more stress, conflict and loneliness, and lower levels of perceived social support than adolescents in the other psychopathological classes. Adolescents in the emotional-dysregulation class also consumed more alcohol and had worse financial situation during the lockdown compared to pre- lockdown period.

The chronic inflammatory process found in these cardiometabolic comorbidities is marked by the overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumoral necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), which are products of the Toll-Like receptors 4 (TLR4) pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 initially infects cells in the upper respiratory tract and, in some patients, spread very quickly, needing respiratory support and systemically, causing collateral damage in tissues. We hypothesize that this happens because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts strongly with TLR4, causing an intensely exacerbated immune response in the host's lungs, culminating with the cytokine storm, accumulating secretions and hindering blood oxygenation, along with the immune system attacks the body, leading to multiple organ failure.","Brandão, Simone Cristina Soares; Ramos, Júlia de Oliveira Xavier; Dompieri, Luca Terracini; Godoi, Emmanuelle Tenório Albuquerque Madruga; Figueiredo, José Luiz; Sarinho, Emanuel Sávio Cavalcanti; Chelvanambi, Sarvesh; Aikawa, Masanori",Cytokine growth factor rev,,215

To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the virus causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in clinical samples before testing. However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown. Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal swab samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed by three different methods: (i) incubation with the TRIzol LS reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (ii) heating in a water bath at 56°C for 30 min, and (iii) high-temperature treatment, including autoclaving at 121°C for 20 min, boiling at 100°C for 20 min, and heating at 80°C for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and 39.85% of open reading frame (ORF) 1ab. For samples treated at 56°C for 30 min, the copy number of the N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively. The viral RNA copy number dropped by 50 to 66% after heating at 80°C for 20 min. Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min. These results indicate that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false-negative results, especially in weakly positive cases. Thus, use of the TRIzol reagent rather than heat inactivation is recommended for sample inactivation, as the TRIzol reagent had the least effect on the RNA copy number among the tested methods.","Chen, Hailong; Wu, Rui; Xing, Yuan; Du, Quanli; Xue, Zerun; Xi, Yanli; Yang, Yujie; Deng, Yangni; Han, Yuewen; Li, Kaixin; Luan, Yang; Zhang, Yalan; Wei, Xiaoguang; Yu, Tongtong; Li, Hao; Zhu, Lingxiang; Su, Shisheng; Lian, Hao; Lu, Linping; Tan, Chianru; Zheng, Haichao; Chen, Baozhong; Yu, Pengbo; Guo, Yong; Ma, Chaofeng",J. clin. microbiol,,215

We aim to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hospital admission or death in adult outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43,103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD=14.3);93.0% (n=40,081) of patients were &lt; 65 years old and 61.9% (n=26,688) were women. Of these 43,103 patients, 67.5% (n=29,104) completed a medical questionnaire on comorbidities and symptoms. The main reported comorbidities were asthma (12.8%;n=3,685), hypertension (12.3%;n=3,546) and diabetes (4.8%;n=1,385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1% [95% CI: 3.9-4.2];1,751/43,103) experienced clinical worsening. The rate of hospitalisation was 4.0% (95% CI: 3.8-4.2;n=1,728) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1-0.2;n=64) died. Factors associated with clinical worsening were male sex, older age, obesity and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease or cancer under treatment. Probability of worsening was reduced with anosmia/ageusia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical worsening was rare among outpatients. Male sex, older age and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease, active cancers or obesity were independently associated with clinical worsening. However, our cohort may include patients younger and healthier than the general population.","Yordanov, Y.; Dinh, A.; Bleibtreu, A.; Mensch, A.; Lescure, F.

We also discussed the retirement and decommissioning of old biofouling-encrusted oil and gas platforms (~62 platforms) from decreased production and the current oil crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This presents an ecological concern due invasive coral range expansion and potential impacts to poorly studied ecosystems such as marginal shallow-water coral reefs and mesophotic ecosystems. It is imperative that mindful risk analysis and rigorous environmental studies must precede the installation of new oil and gas platforms. In addition, decommissioning of retired structures should take into consideration marine restoration and non-indigenous species dispersal, and more specifically, Tubastraea bioinvasion.","Braga, Marcus Davis Andrade; Paiva, Sandra Vieira; Gurjão, Lívio Moreira de; Teixeira, Carlos Eduardo Peres; Gurgel, Anne Larisse Alves Rebouças; Pereira, Pedro Henrique Cipresso; Soares, Marcelo de Oliveira",Mar Pollut Bull,,215

The present study is focused on bryophyte development occurring in the show cave that was responsible of limestone biodeterioration. In order to understand the colonization process of limestone, we have maintained limestone blocks under optimal Lampenflora growth conditions. Moreover, some limestone blocks were painted with several pigments that were used in the prehistory (e.g., red ocher, bone char). Microorganisms and bryophyte growth were monitored during 1 year, and then, the block samples were treated using UV-C light (254 nm). Thus, obtained results were compared with in situ treatment in La Glacière cave. Results have showed dense bryophyte propagation on the several blocks. However, the growth rate was correlated with the chemical composition of the pigment. In fact, the presence of some chemical elements such as As, Cr, Ti, and Co contributed to reduce bryophyte growth. Finally, moss treatment using UV-C light has demonstrated high efficiency under in situ condition, while a fast recolonization has been observed for samples maintained in laboratory. This difference was explained by the high bryophyte density under laboratory conditions that make UV-C light penetration difficult.","Pfendler, Stéphane; Einhorn, Olympe; Alaoui-Sossé, Laurence; Bousta, Faisl; Alaoui-Sossé, Badr; Aleya, Lotfi",,,215

291770,Coping with Dementia in the Middle of the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The surface water resources in the Meriç-Ergene River Basin, especially Ergene River and Çorlu Stream are among the most polluted rivers in Turkey. Despite the action plans for prevention and control of surface water pollution in the basin, the desired results have not been achieved. However, the implementation of a nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 might probably lead to an improvement in the surface water quality. We evaluated the impact of the lockdown on water quality by measuring the levels of physico-chemical variables and metal(loid)s in water samples taken from 25 sampling stations in the basin. BOD, COD, EC, turbidity, TSS and Mn levels did not show significant differences between the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods due to the ongoing domestic wastewater discharges and agricultural activities in the basin during the lockdown period. However, Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, As, Pb and Cd concentrations decreased considerably during the lockdown. Similarly, heavy metal pollution index and heavy metal evaluation index values showed a significant improvement in water quality of almost all stations during the lockdown period. Also, total hazard index values for children and adults reduced by 67% and 69%, respectively during the lockdown period, while total carcinogenic risk values for As and Cr reduced by 60% and 94%, respectively. The limited operational status of most industrial facilities in the basin during the lockdown reduced the amount of industrial effluents, leading to significant improvement in surface water quality for metal(loid)s. The lockdown has shown that the solution for preservation and sustainability of natural water resources lies in our hands, and the efficient management of pollution sources can prevent surface water pollution at a very rapid pace. Finally, we suggest that water management policy needs to be improved and implemented.","Tokatli, Cem; Varol, Memet",Environ Res,,215

This study aimed to gather information about ecological richness, abundance, and activity patterns of bat species over a year, within two points less changed habitats (forest fragments) and two points in the most altered areas (public squares). Captures were made between May 2009 and April 2010 with two consecutive nights at each point. Active searches were also made in urban constructions. A total of 48 nights and 50.400 m².h. of sampling effort. We captured 478 individuals from 17 different species with a predominance of families Phyllostomidade (55.02%) and Molossidae (44.35%). Two more species were recorded by active searches, totaling 19 bat species in the urban area of Nova Xavantina. We registered for the first time the species Pteronotus Parnelli, Phyllostomus elongates and Uroderma magnirostrum in the studied area. This study revealed that species of bats in urban areas reconditioned to live in these environments, and that urbanization affects the richness of bat communities in the environment. Studies detailed on the ecological aspects of these species are important because fragmentation tends to endanger the ecological role of these animals in nature.","Gomes da Silva, Sérgio; Cristina da Silveira Anacleto, Teresa",Chiropt. neotrop.,,215

Knowing precisely the number of ICU beds in real-time is very important to estimate the health system collapse and to create strategies for the government to provide new ICU beds for patients. Thus, at Rio Grande do Norte, a state in Brazil, the State Health Department requested us to rapidly develop a technology to integrate ICU beds and patient data related explicitly to Covid-19 from the 58 health units (hospitals and clinics) in the state. Thus, this article presents the methodology and strategies used for the development and implementation of a web information system, called Leitos, for the management of ICU and semi-ICU beds assigned to Covid-19 patients. Nowadays, more than 200 government agents and clinical unit staff are using this system that presents the real-time situation of the ICU beds in this state.","Barroca, I. D.; Sampaio, S. C.; Cruz, A.

296456,"Good times, bad times: A diary of a physician in the COVID-19 era",2020,"This paper presents the geography of the historic central district of Kraków, Poland before, during and after the first wave of the 2020 pandemic. It describes how the disneyfied main part of the UNESCO heritage site of universal values turned into a ghost town as functional changes were turning into physical ones amid restrictions. From the results of pre-pandemic processes (that, as we argue, turned the city into its disneyfied version), to the lockdown (that later revealed itself to be but the first one in a row), to the post-lockdown recovery, these changes are presented in modified figure-ground diagrams with accessibility being defined by both tangible and intangible properties. The results are set against the background of the city’s current policies regarding economic recovery, mobility and accessibility to urban green areas. As an attempt to address the present vulnerability of the once resilient historic city centres—of which Kraków Old Town is a luminous example—this paper tends to be a voice in the debate on the post-2020 planning and the strategies we will need to face the subsequent waves of this, or other, pandemics as well as consequences of climate change.","Porębska, Anna Barnaś Krzysztof Dendura Bartosz Kania Olga Łukasik Marta Rogulska Aleksandra Szpakowska-Loranc Ernestyna Zieliński Miłosz",URBAN DESIGN International,,215

Studies have suggested that these comorbidities also are related to erythrocyte factors linked to increased blood viscosity in microcirculation such as erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability. Increased blood viscosity in microcirculation can lead to a decrease in oxygenation and nutrition of tissues. Therefore erythrocyte aggregation and erythrocyte deformability may be involved in covid-19 severity, leading to tissue hypoxia and a decrease of drug concentration in affected organs. If this relationship is demonstrated, erythrocytes factors can be used to monitor treatments for improve microcirculatory fluidity that may decrease covid-19 severity. Lifestyle improvement and treatments such as vitamin D and estrogens supplementation are some possible approaches to improve microcirculation and covid-19 prevention and treatment.","Farber, Paulo Luiz",,,215

298513,Assessment of Deaths From COVID-19 and From Seasonal Influenza,2020,"RATIONALE: In life-threatening Covid-19, corticosteroids reduce mortality, suggesting that immune responses have a causal role in death. Whether this deleterious inflammation is primarily a direct reaction to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 or an independent immunopathologic process is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2 organotropism and organ-specific inflammatory responses, and the relationships between viral presence, inflammation, and organ injury. METHODS: Tissue was acquired from eleven detailed post-mortem examinations. SARS-CoV-2 organotropism was mapped by multiplex PCR and sequencing, with cellular resolution achieved by in situ viral spike protein detection. Histological evidence of inflammation was quantified from 37 anatomical sites, and the pulmonary immune response characterized by multiplex immunofluorescence. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multiple aberrant immune responses in fatal Covid-19 were found, principally involving the lung and reticuloendothelial system, and these were not clearly topologically associated with the virus. Inflammation and organ dysfunction did not map to the tissue and cellular distribution of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and protein, both between and within tissues. An arteritis was identified in the lung, which was further characterised as a monocyte/myeloid-rich vasculitis, and occurred along with an influx of macrophage/monocyte-lineage cells into the pulmonary parenchyma. In addition, stereotyped abnormal reticulo-endothelial responses, including excessive reactive plasmacytosis and iron-laden macrophages, were present and dissociated from viral presence in lymphoid tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue-specific immunopathology occurs in Covid-19, implicating a significant component of immune-mediated, virus-independent immunopathology as a primary mechanism in severe disease. Our data highlight novel immunopathological mechanisms, and validate ongoing and future efforts to therapeutically target aberrant macrophage and plasma cell responses as well as promoting pathogen tolerance in Covid-19.

Here, directed assembly of rod-like, biologically derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) within the template of a processed cotton fiber cell wall, that is, the native origin of CNCs, is reported. It is a system where the assembly takes place in solid state simultaneously with the top-down formation of the CNCs via hydrolysis with HCl vapor. Upon hydrolysis, cellulose microfibrils in the fiber break down to CNCs that then pack together, resulting in reduced pore size distribution of the original fiber. The denser packing is demonstrated by N2 adsorption, water uptake, thermoporometry, and small-angle X-ray scattering, and hypothetically assigned to attractive van der Waals interactions between the CNCs.","Solala, Iina; Driemeier, Carlos; Mautner, Andreas; Penttilä, Paavo A; Seitsonen, Jani; Leppänen, Miika; Mihhels, Karl; Kontturi, Eero",Macromol Rapid Commun,,215
298873,Managing the Rehabilitation Wave: Rehabilitation Services for COVID-19 Survivors,2020,"This study aimed to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic alters day-to-day relational experiences and how daily relational experiences shape outlook on the pandemic. Data were collected from university students in the U.S. using smartphone-based experience sampling and nightly diary surveys over a 10-day period beginning in April 2020. To address the first objective, we examined how pandemic-related anxiety and depressive symptoms manifested in three aspects of daily relational life: (a) perceptions of loneliness, (b) relational difficulty, and (c) communication quality. To address the second objective, we investigated how daily relational experiences were linked to their end-of-day outlook of the pandemic in terms of pessimism versus optimism regarding COVID-19 and general sense of hope. Over the 10-day study period, COVID-19-related anxiety was found to be uniquely associated with greater loneliness, desire for interaction when alone, interpersonal conflict, and distraction during communication episodes. In addition, results showed that relational experiences throughout the day, including loneliness, challenges maintaining relationships, and communication quality, were linked to end-of-day COVID-19 optimism and state hope. Overall, this study identifies potential ways in which young adults? relational lives were altered during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Results also suggest how relational experiences factor into daily social constructions of the pandemic.","Merolla, Andy J.; Otmar, Christopher Hernandez Carlos Ruvalcaba",Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,,215
299241,Consequences of COVID-19: A Survey of Individuals with Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury,2020,"BACKGROUND: Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing measures, lockdowns, and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline curve-fitting model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model, two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model (ICM). METHODS: Using COVID-19 case-recovery-death count data reported in India from March 15 to October 15 to train the models, we generate predictions from each of the five models from October 16 to December 31. To compare prediction accuracy with respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and reported cumulative death counts, we compute the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For reported cumulative cases and deaths, we compute Pearson's and Lin's correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported counts agree. We also present underreporting factors when available, and comment on uncertainty of projections from each model. RESULTS: For active case counts, SMAPE values are 35.14% (SEIR-fansy) and 37.96% (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are 6.89% (baseline), 6.59% (eSIR), 2.25% (SAPHIRE) and 2.29% (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the SMAPE values are 4.74% (SEIR-fansy), 8.94% (eSIR) and 0.77% (ICM). Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative case counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of October 31 and note that for cumulative cases, the SEIR-fansy model yields an underreporting factor of 7.25 and ICM model yields 4.54 for the same quantity. For total (sum of reported and unreported) cumulative deaths the SEIR-fansy model reports an underreporting factor of 2.97. On October 31, we observe 8.18 million cumulative reported cases, while the projections (in millions) from the baseline model are 8.71 (95% credible interval: 8.63-8.80), while eSIR yields 8.35 (7.19-9.60), SAPHIRE returns 8.17 (7.90-8.52) and SEIR-fansy projects 8.51 (8.18-8.85) million cases. Cumulative case projections from the eSIR model have the highest uncertainty in terms of width of 95% credible intervals, followed by those from SAPHIRE, the baseline model and finally SEIR-fansy. CONCLUSIONS: In this comparative paper, we describe five different models used to study the transmission dynamics of the SARS-Cov-2 virus in India. While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the ""total"" number of infections including reported and unreported cases (on which we have no validation data). The degree of under-reporting has been a major concern in India and is characterized in this report. Overall, the SEIR-fansy model appeared to be a good choice with publicly available R-package and desired flexibility plus accuracy.","Purkayastha, Soumik; Bhattacharyya, Rupam; Bhaduri, Ritwik; Kundu, Ritoban; Gu, Xuelin; Salvatore, Maxwell; Ray, Debashree; Mishra, Swapnil; Mukherjee, Bhramar",BMC Infect Dis,,215

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS: Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","Kwee, R M; Krdzalic, J; Fasen, B A C M; de Jaegere, T M H",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,215
300403,"Chinese, European and Persian medicine recommendations for the prevention of pandemics (COVID-19) related to the respiratory system: A systematic review",2021,"BACKGROUND: In 2004, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) called for all nursing schools to phase out master's-level preparation for advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) and transition to doctor of nursing practice (DNP) preparation only by 2015. Today, five years after the AACN's deadline, nursing has not yet adopted a universal DNP standard for APRN practice entry. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing the ability of nursing schools to implement a universal DNP standard for APRNs. METHODS: Deans from top-ranked nursing schools explore the current state of the DNP degree in the US. The authors draw upon their collective experience as national leaders in academic nursing, long-time influencers on this debate, and heads of DNP programs themselves. This insight is combined with a synthesis of the literature and analysis of previously unpublished data from the AACN on trends in nursing doctoral education. FINDINGS: This paper highlights issues such as the long history of inconsistency (in messaging, curricula, etc.) surrounding the DNP, certification and accreditation challenges, cost barriers, and more. The authors apply COVID-19 as a case study to help place DNP graduates within a real-world context for health system stakeholders whose buy-in is essential for the success of this professional transition. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the DNP's standing in today's professional environment and advances the conversation on key barriers to its adoption. Insights are shared regarding critical next steps to ensure national acceptance of the DNP as nursing's terminal practice degree.","McCauley, Linda A; Broome, Marion E; Frazier, Lorraine; Hayes, Rose; Kurth, Ann; Musil, Carol M; Norman, Linda D; Rideout, Kathy H; Villarruel, Antonia M",Nurs. outlook,,215

An experience in New York City,2020,"BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities are high-risk settings for severe outcomes from outbreaks of Covid-19, owing to both the advanced age and frequent chronic underlying health conditions of the residents and the movement of health care personnel among facilities in a region. METHODS: After identification on February 28, 2020, of a confirmed case of Covid-19 in a skilled nursing facility in King County, Washington, Public Health-Seattle and King County, aided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a case investigation, contact tracing, quarantine of exposed persons, isolation of confirmed and suspected cases, and on-site enhancement of infection prevention and control. RESULTS: As of March 18, a total of 167 confirmed cases of Covid-19 affecting 101 residents, 50 health care personnel, and 16 visitors were found to be epidemiologically linked to the facility. Most cases among residents included respiratory illness consistent with Covid-19; however, in 7 residents no symptoms were documented. Hospitalization rates for facility residents, visitors, and staff were 54.5%, 50.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. The case fatality rate for residents was 33.7% (34 of 101). As of March 18, a total of 30 long-term care facilities with at least one confirmed case of Covid-19 had been identified in King County. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of rapidly escalating Covid-19 outbreaks, proactive steps by long-term care facilities to identify and exclude potentially infected staff and visitors, actively monitor for potentially infected patients, and implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures are needed to prevent the introduction of Covid-19.","McMichael, Temet M; Currie, Dustin W; Clark, Shauna; Pogosjans, Sargis; Kay, Meagan; Schwartz, Noah G; Lewis, James; Baer, Atar; Kawakami, Vance; Lukoff, Margaret D; Ferro, Jessica; Brostrom-Smith, Claire; Rea, Thomas D; Sayre, Michael R; Riedo, Francis X; Russell, Denny; Hiatt, Brian; Montgomery, Patricia; Rao, Agam K; Chow, Eric J; Tobolowsky, Farrell; Hughes, Michael J; Bardossy, Ana C; Oakley, Lisa P; Jacobs, Jesica R; Stone, Nimalie D; Reddy, Sujan C; Jernigan, John A; Honein, Margaret A; Clark, Thomas A; Duchin, Jeffrey S",N Engl J Med,,215

The coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) controls virus replication and is therefore considered a major target and promising opportunity for rational-based antiviral discovery with direct acting agents. Here we review first-generation SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors PF-07304814, GC-376, and CDI-45205 that are being delivered either by injection or inhalation due to their low intrinsic oral bioavailability. In addition, PF-07321332 is now emerging as a promising second-generation clinical candidate for oral delivery. A key challenge to the development of novel 3CLpro inhibitors is the poor understanding of the predictive value of in vitro potency toward clinical efficacy, an issue complicated by the involvement of host proteases in virus entry. Further preclinical and clinical validation will be key to establishing 3CLpro inhibitors as a bona fide class for future SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics for both hospitalized and outpatient populations.","Vandyck, Koen; Deval, Jerome",Curr Opin Virol,,215

Although a large number of computational models of the olfactory system have been proposed, they do not account for the diversity in physiology, connectivity of local neurons, and several recent discoveries in the insect antennal lobe, a major olfactory organ in insects. Recent studies revealed that the response of some projection neurons were reduced by application of a GABA antagonist, and that insects are sensitive to odor pulse frequency. To account for these observations, we propose a spiking neural circuit model of the insect antennal lobe. Based on recent anatomical and physiological studies, we included three sub-types of local neurons as well as synaptic short-term depression (STD) in the model and showed that the interaction between STD and local neurons resulted in frequency-sensitive responses. We further discovered that the unexpected response of the projection neurons to the GABA antagonist is the result of complex interactions between STD and presynaptic inhibition, which is required for enhancing sensitivity to odor stimuli. Finally, we found that odor discrimination is improved if the innervation of the local neurons in the glomeruli follows a specific pattern. Our findings suggest that STD, presynaptic inhibition and diverse physiology and connectivity of local neurons are not independent properties, but they interact to play key roles in the function of antennal lobes.","Kao, Kuo-Wei; Lo, Chung-Chuan",J. comput. neurosci,,215

Sucrose transport, mediating distribution of photosynthates in plant, is a key physiological process impacted by drought and salinity stresses, as sucrose is a prime energy and signaling molecule as well as an osmolyte. Therefore, understanding the effects of abiotic stresses on sucrose transport and transporters, and underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms, is imperative to maintain sugar homeostasis in plants under stress. Here, we investigated the effects of drought and salinity stresses on sucrose transport and distribution, and on expression levels of genes encoding Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs), along with a potential transcription factor regulating SWEET expression in rice. We observed that drought and salinity stresses increased the sucrose content in leaf and root tissues and in phloem sap of rice indica varieties. Expression analyses of SWEET genes and histochemical analysis of ß-glucuronidase-reporter transgenic plants suggested that OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 are major SWEET transporters regulating the sucrose transport and levels in response to the abiotic stresses. Transactivation analyses showed that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 directly binds to the promoters of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 and activates their expression. Taken together, the results showed that the higher expressions of OsSWEET13 and OsSWEET15 genes, induced by binding of an ABA-responsive transcription factor OsbZIP72 to the promoters, potentially modulate sucrose transport and distribution in response to the abiotic stresses. The mechanism could possibly be targeted for maintaining sugar homeostasis in rice under drought and salinity stresses.","Mathan, Jyotirmaya; Singh, Anuradha; Ranjan, Aashish",Physiol. plant,,215

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched till August 3, 2020 to identify studies reporting COVID-19 patients with DKA and combined DKA/HHS. A total of 19 articles reporting 110 patients met the eligibility criteria. RESULTS: Of the 110 patients, 91 (83%) patients had isolated DKA while 19 (17%) had DKA/HHS. The majority of the patients were male (63%) and belonged to black ethnicity (36%). The median age at presentation ranged from 45.5 to 59.0 years. Most of the patients (77%) had pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only 10% of the patients had newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. The median blood glucose at presentation ranged from 486.0 to 568.5 mg/dl, being higher in patients with DKA/HHS compared to isolated DKA. The volume of fluid replaced in the first 24 h was higher in patients with DKA/HHS in contrast to patients with DKA alone. The in-hospital mortality rate was 45%, with higher mortality in the DKA/HHS group than in the isolated DKA group (67% vs. 29%). pH was lower in patients who had died compared to those who were discharged. CONCLUSION: DKA in COVID-19 patients portends a poor prognosis with a mortality rate approaching 50%. Differentiating isolated DKA from combined DKA/HHS is essential as the latter represents nearly one-fifth of the DKA cases and tends to have higher mortality than DKA alone.","Pal, Rimesh; Banerjee, Mainak; Yadav, Urmila; Bhattacharjee, Sukrita",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,215

304783,"HIV and risk of COVID-19 death: a population cohort study from the Western Cape Province, South Africa",2020,"Hypoxia is defined by low oxygen concentration in organs, tissues and cells. Maintaining oxygen homeostasis represents the essential cellular metabolic process for the structural integrity of tissues in different pathological conditions, including SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) as regulator of cellular response to hypoxia and its involvement in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glucose metabolism, inflammation, we propose hypoxic preconditiong (HPC) as a novel prevention therapeutic approach on healthy contacts of COVID-19 patients. To date, several studies revealed the benefic effects of hypoxic preconditioning in ischemia, kidney failure and in pulmonary function recovery of lung surgery patients. HPC increases the expression of factors that promote cell survival and angiogenesis, induces an anti-inflammatory outcome, triggers coordinated hypoxia responses that promote erythropoiesis, and mobilizes the circulating progenitor cells. Futhermore, the mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) exposed to HPC show improvement of their regenerative capacities, and increases the effectiveness of stem cell therapy in different pathologies, including COVID-19. In conclusion, HPC should be considered an approach with beneficial outcomes and without significant side effects when the organism is severely exposed to the same stressor. HPC appears as a trigger to mechanisms that improve and maintain tissue oxygenation and repair, a main goal in different pathologies, including COVID-19 or other respiratory conditions.","Hertzog, Radu Gabriel; Bicheru, Nicoleta Simona; Popescu, Diana Mihaela; Calborean, Octavian; Catrina, Ana-Maria",Int. j. infect. dis,,215

This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (ß = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (ß = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (ß = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (ß = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (ß = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (ß = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (ß = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (ß = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.","Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A",JAMA pediatr.

Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak could alter their psychological state. The objective was to analyze the psychological impact of the pandemic and confinement on stress levels and psychopathological symptoms in patients with SLE. Patients and method: In this cross-sectional study, stress levels were compared with the Perceived Stress Scale, the Stress Vulnerability Inventory and psychopathological symptoms of the SCL-90-R Symptom Inventory in patients with SLE during the period of confinement (group 1; n = 276) in comparison to patients with SLE evaluated in a period before the pandemic (group 2; n = 152). Results: The comparison between both groups showed there were statistically significant differences in vulnerability to stress (p < 0.0001), depression (p &#8804; 0.05), anxiety (p &#8804; 0.05), phobic anxiety (p < 0.0001), interpersonal sensitivity (p &#8804; 0.043), and psychoticism (p &#8804; 0.023). In these variables, the group of patients with lupus in confinement obtained higher scores. Conclusions: The confinement and threat of the COVID-19 outbreak had important repercussions on the psychological state of patients with SLE with high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. These findings show their vulnerability to a public health alert and indicate the need to carry out a psychological approach to these patients while the state of health emergency lasts as well as to possible outbreaks of the virus.","Santos-Ruiz, Ana; Montero-López, Eva; Ortego-Centeno, Norberto; Peralta-Ramírez, María Isabel",,,215

Indeed, during his pilgrimage to Rome, Saint Roch helped people suffering from the plague and was, subsequently, himself infected. He was then forced to retire in solitary confinement to avoid the plague's spread and followed scrupulously the necessary restrictive measures.

We conduct a quasi-difference-in-differences (DID) analysis of the impacts of lockdown measures on air pollution during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Our study covers 367 cities from the beginning of the lockdown on 23 January 2020 until April 22, two weeks after the lockdown in the epicenter was lifted. Static and dynamic analysis of the average treatment effects on the treated is conducted for the air quality index (AQI) and six criteria pollutants. The results indicate that, first, on average, the AQI decreased by about 7%. However, it was still over the threshold set by the World Health Organization. Second, we detect heterogeneous changes in the level of different pollutants, which suggests heterogeneous impacts of the lockdown on human activities: carbon monoxide (CO) had the biggest drop, about 30%, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) had the second-biggest drop, 20%. In contrast, ozone (O3) increased by 3.74% due to the changes in the NOx/VOCs caused by the decrease in NOx, the decrease of O3 titration, and particulate matter concentration. Third, air pollution levels rebounded immediately after the number of infections dropped, which indicates a swift recovery of human activities.

312508,Reply to Jakovac: About COVID-19 and vitamin D,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the public health responses to previous pandemics of respiratory diseases, and in the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on population engagement in non-pharmaceutical interventions. Engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety level and knowledge, as well as historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses and cultures. OBJECTIVE: To compare psycho-behavioral responses in Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK) during the early phase of the pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered among adults in HK and the UK during the early phase of each respective epidemic. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between explanatory variables and the adoption of social-distancing measures. RESULTS: Data of 3431 complete responses (HK:1663; UK:1768) were analysed. Perceived severity differed by setting (HK: 96.8%; UK: 19.9%). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally/borderline anxious (HK:60.0%; UK:46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (HK:94.0-98.5%; UK:69.2-93.5%), with HK identifying additional routes. HK reported high levels of adoption of social-distancing (HK:32.6-93.7%; UK:17.6-59.0%) and mask-wearing (HK:98.8%; UK:3.1%). The impact of perceived severity and perceived ease of transmission on the adoption of social-distancing varied by setting. In HK, they had no impact, whereas in the UK, those who perceived severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social-distancing (aOR:1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to both general social-distancing (aOR:2.00, 95% CI:1.57, 2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR:1.80, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social-distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in the populations, as well as prior sensitisation to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk communication should be done through suitable media channels - and trust should be maintained - while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.

Researchers and pharmaceutical companies have developed in record time vaccines against COVID-19 that are intended to be safe and effective;however, the short validation time has been a challenge for doctors and epidemiologists, especially in light of the increase in reports emerging from various parts of the world about the adverse effects of the new vaccines. Portugal's national regulatory authority, the National Authority of Medicines and Health Products (INFARMED), has recently granted approval for Pfizer-BioNTech (Pfizer Inc., New York, NY;BioNTech SE, Mainz, Germany) and Modema (Modema, Inc, Cambridge, MA) COVID-19 vaccines, and they are being rolled out to be administered among the general population.

313781,Clinical and Demographic Risk Factors for COVID-19 during Delivery Hospitalizations in New York City,2021,"Introduction Le recours à des traitements antibiotiques à l’admission des patients hospitalisés pour des pneumopathies à SARS-CoV-2 est fréquent, malgré une faible prévalence des co-infections bactériennes. Au cours de l’épidémie, les connaissances scientifiques ont évolué et ont permis d’adapter les recommandations de prise en charge. L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’évolution du recours aux antibiotiques (ATB) au cours de l’épidémie, en lien avec la diffusion de recommandations locales de pratique clinique. Matériels et méthodes L’étude était rétrospective et monocentrique. Tous les patients hospitalisés pour une pneumopathie à SARS-CoV-2 ont été inclus, et classés en trois périodes sur l’année 2020 (P1 du 02/03 au 14/04, P2 du 15/04 au 27/06 et P3 du 07/09 au 06/12). Des recommandations locales d’aide à la prescription d’ATB chez les patients COVID ont été diffusées entre P1 et P2, puis entre P2 et P3. Etaient exclus les patients admis directement en réanimation. Les données cliniques, microbiologiques et les prescriptions d’ATB étaient recueillies. Le critère de jugement principal était le taux d’exposition aux ATB lors des 48 premières heures d’hospitalisation. Les critères de jugement secondaires étaient parmi ces antibiothérapies celles prescrites pour plus de 48h et la durée médiane de l’antibiothérapie. Résultats Ont été inclus 932 patients lors des 3 périodes (507, 123 et 302, respectivement). L’âge médian était de 69 ans [58–81] et 367 étaient des femmes (39 %). Une obésité (IMC&gt;30kg/m2) était présente chez 224 patients (32 %) ;467 étaient hypertendus (50 %), 279 étaient diabétiques (29 %), 124 insuffisant rénaux chroniques (13 %) et 120 immunodéprimés (13 %). Les répartitions étaient semblables au sein de chaque période, de même que les médianes des variables biologiques: PNN 6,4 G/L [3,6–7,5], CRP 72mg/L [30–128] et PCT 0,1μg/L [0,1–0,3]. À l’admission, une oxygénothérapie≥3L/min était nécessaire pour 42 %, 29 % et 45 % des patients, respectivement (p=0,01). Le taux d’exposition aux ATB au cours de chacune des trois périodes était de 78%, 50% puis 38% (p&lt;0,001). Les ATB initiaux étaient principalement l’amoxicilline/clavulanate et le céfotaxime (54 % et 30 %). Le taux d’antibiothérapies de plus de 48h était de 64%, 45% puis 27 %. La durée médiane des antibiothérapies était de 6jours sur P1 et P2, puis diminuait à 4jours pendant P3 (p&lt;0,001). Au total, 940jours d’ATB ont été économisés lors de P3 par rapport à P1. Enfin, aucune différence sur l’aggravation n’a été constaté entre P1 et P3 (décès, réanimation ou recours à l’oxygénothérapie haut débit). Conclusion Entre mars et décembre 2020, une baisse significative de l’initiation d’antibiothérapies chez les patients COVID-19 a été objectivée passant de 78 à 38%, sans conséquence apparente sur le pronostic. Cette baisse pourrait en partie être expliquée par la rédaction et la diffusion de recommandation locale de prescription et de prise en charge dans le cadre des actions de bon usage des anti-infectieux, ainsi que par la reprise d’une activité transversale de conseil en antibiothérapie.","Thery, A.; Galy, A.; Lepeule, R.; Ourghanlian, C.",Infectious Diseases Now,,215

However, its impact on fresh fruit and vegetable vendors remains unclear; these are often smaller, more community centered, and may lack the financial infrastructure to withstand supply and demand changes induced by such crises. OBJECTIVE: This study documents the methodology used to assess fresh fruit and vegetable vendor closures in New York City (NYC) following the start of the COVID-19 pandemic by using Google Street View, the new Apple Look Around database, and in-person checks. METHODS: In total, 6 NYC neighborhoods (in Manhattan and Brooklyn) were selected for analysis; these included two socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods (Upper East Side, Park Slope), two socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (East Harlem, Brownsville), and two Chinese ethnic neighborhoods (Chinatown, Sunset Park). For each neighborhood, Google Street View was used to virtually walk down each street and identify vendors (stores, storefronts, street vendors, or wholesalers) that were open and active in 2019 (ie, both produce and vendor personnel were present at a location). Past vendor surveillance (when available) was used to guide these virtual walks. Each identified vendor was geotagged as a Google Maps pinpoint that research assistants then physically visited. Using the ""notes"" feature of Google Maps as a data collection tool, notes were made on which of three categories best described each vendor: (1) open, (2) open with a more limited setup (eg, certain sections of the vendor unit that were open and active in 2019 were missing or closed during in-person checks), or (3) closed/absent. RESULTS: Of the 135 open vendors identified in 2019 imagery data, 35% (n=47) were absent/closed and 10% (n=13) were open with more limited setups following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. When comparing boroughs, 35% (28/80) of vendors in Manhattan were absent/closed, as were 35% (19/55) of vendors in Brooklyn. Although Google Street View was able to provide 2019 street view imagery data for most neighborhoods, Apple Look Around was required for 2019 imagery data for some areas of Park Slope. Past surveillance data helped to identify 3 additional established vendors in Chinatown that had been missed in street view imagery. The Google Maps ""notes"" feature was used by multiple research assistants simultaneously to rapidly collect observational data on mobile devices. CONCLUSIONS: The methodology employed enabled the identification of closures in the fresh fruit and vegetable retail environment and can be used to assess closures in other contexts. The use of past baseline surveillance data to aid vendor identification was valuable for identifying vendors that may have been absent or visually obstructed in the street view imagery data. Data collection using Google Maps likewise has the potential to enhance the efficiency of fieldwork in future studies.","Ali, Shahmir H; Imbruce, Valerie M; Russo, Rienna G; Kaplan, Samuel; Stevenson, Kaye; Mezzacca, Tamar Adjoian; Foster, Victoria; Radee, Ashley; Chong, Stella; Tsui, Felice; Kranick, Julie; Yi, Stella S",JMIR Form Res,,215

It is highly contagious with a death rate up to twelve times that of the flu, even higher where the healthcare systems have been strained. To reduce the spread, states have implemented stay-at-home declarations, limiting social gatherings, and closing churches. However, some have argued that churches are an “essential service” and should be reopened in order that the faithful to be able to receive the sacraments, in particular the Eucharist. I will argue that this goes against the Catholic doctrine of the common good and care for the poor and vulnerable. Summary: COVID-19 has caused a pandemic strained health care resources.

However, data are limited in these patients. We aimed to report the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic impact of severe AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure. METHODS: A retrospective monocenter study including adult patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure. The primary outcome was to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with severe AKI (KDIGO stages 2 or 3). RESULTS: Overall, 110 COVID-19 patients were admitted. Among them, 77 (70%) required invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), 66 (60%) received vasopressor support, and 9 (8.2%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Severe AKI occurred in 50 patients (45.4%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, severe AKI was independently associated with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.08 (95% CI (confidence interval): 1.03-1.14), p = 0.003), IMV (OR = 33.44 (95% CI: 2.20-507.77), p = 0.011), creatinine level on admission (OR = 1.04 (95% CI: 1.008-1.065), p = 0.012), and ECMO (OR = 11.42 (95% CI: 1.95-66.70), p = 0.007). Inflammatory (interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and ferritin) or thrombotic (D-dimer and fibrinogen) markers were not associated with severe AKI after adjustment for potential confounders. Severe AKI was independently associated with hospital mortality (OR = 29.73 (95% CI: 4.10-215.77), p = 0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (subhazard ratio = 0.26 (95% CI: 0.14-0.51), p < 0.001). At the time of hospital discharge, 74.1% of patients with severe AKI who were discharged alive from the hospital recovered normal or baseline renal function. CONCLUSION: Severe AKI was common in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and was not associated with inflammatory or thrombotic markers. Severe AKI was an independent risk factor of hospital mortality and hospital length of stay, and it should be rapidly recognized during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Ghosn, Muriel; Attallah, Nizar; Badr, Mohamed; Abdallah, Khaled; De Oliveira, Bruno; Nadeem, Ashraf; Varghese, Yeldho; Munde, Dnyaseshwar; Salam, Shameen; Abduljawad, Baraa; Saleh, Khaled; Elkambergy, Hussam; Wahla, Ali; Taha, Ahmed; Dibu, Jamil; Bayrlee, Ahmed; Hamed, Fadi; Rahman, Nadeem; Mallat, Jihad",,,215

However, the safety of cryopreservation has been controversial in unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), especially for bone marrow (BM) grafts. In addition, in unrelated HSCT, the effect of the time from harvest to cryopreservation of donor grafts required for the transportation of donor graft has not been fully clarified. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the first 112 patients with available data who underwent cryopreserved unrelated blood and marrow transplantation through the Japan Marrow Donor Program during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 112 patients, including 83 who received BM grafts and 29 who received peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. The median time from stem cell harvest to cryopreservation was 9.9 hours (range, 2.6 to 44.0 hours), and the median time from cryopreservation to infusion was 231.2 hours. The incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day 28 after HSCT was 91.1%, and among 109 patients (excluding 3 patients with early death), all but 1 patient achieved neutrophil engraftment within 60 days after HSCT. The time to neutrophil engraftment and time to platelet engraftment were shorter in PBSC transplantation compared with BM transplantation (BMT), but the differences were not statistically significant (P = .064 and .18). Multivariate analysis among BM recipients revealed that a higher number of frozen nucleated cells and the absence of HLA mismatch were associated with faster neutrophil engraftment. The time to neutrophil engraftment after unrelated cryopreserved BMT was not different from that after unrelated BMT without cryopreservation. Our findings suggest that unrelated donor BM and PBSC grafts can be safely cryopreserved even after transit from the harvest center to the transplantation center. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, cryopreservation can be considered as an option while balancing the risks and benefits of the procedure.","Kanda, Yoshinobu; Inoue, Masami; Uchida, Naoyuki; Onishi, Yasushi; Kamata, Reiko; Kotaki, Mika; Kobayashi, Ryoji; Tanaka, Junji; Fukuda, Takahiro; Fujii, Nobuharu; Miyamura, Koichi; Mori, Shin-Ichiro; Mori, Yasuo; Morishima, Yasuo; Yabe, Hiromasa; Kodera, Yoshihisa",Transplant Cell Ther,,215

Background: During the most difficult phases of the Covid-19 he-alth emergency, when access to the usual work location was not allowed due to the constraints related to the pandemic, Smart Working enabled business continuity in the face of the ongoing health emergency. Mo-dern technology serves a new way of working, allowing workers to effectively manage their professional and personal spheres in a world that increasingly requires them to optimize their time. The main objective of this research is to validate a Smart Working questionnaire administered to healthcare workers. Methods: The questionnaire, reported in Annex I, consisting of 30 questions and submitted electronically through Google Forms, was administered in Italian to healthcare personnel of the Teaching hospi-tal Umberto I and Sapienza University of Rome between September and October 2020. The questionnaire analyzed the characteristics of the sample and investigated the perception and attitude of healthcare personnel towards seven different aspects of Smart Working. A descriptive analysis of the sample examined and an internal consistency analysis was performed through the use of the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) program version 25.0. Cronbach's alpha statistical indicator, which measures reprodu-cibility over time, reliability, and homogeneity of questions, was used for the analysis. Results: A total number of 53 health care providers answered the online questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were female (60.4%); 73.6% of respondents reported having a college degree or a higher educational level.

321653,The Hidden Cost of COVID-19!,2021,"BACKGROUND: Widespread social distancing and lockdowns of everyday activity have been the primary policy prescription across many countries throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Despite their uniformity, these measures may be differentially valuable for different countries. METHODS: We use a compartmental epidemiological model to project the spread of COVID-19 across policy scenarios in high- and low-income countries. We embed estimates of the welfare value of disease avoidance into the epidemiological projections to estimate the return to more stringent lockdown policies. RESULTS: Social distancing measures that 'flatten the curve' of the disease provide immense welfare value in upper-income countries. However, social distancing policies deliver significantly less value in lower-income countries that have younger populations, which are less vulnerable to COVID-19. Equally important, social distancing mandates a trade-off between disease risk and economic activity. Poorer people are less able to make those economic sacrifices. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiological and welfare value of social distancing is smaller in lower-income countries and such policies may exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the informal sector often lack the resources and social protections that enable them to isolate themselves until the virus passes. By limiting these households' ability to earn a living, social distancing can lead to an increase in hunger, deprivation, and related mortality and morbidity.","Barnett-Howell, Zachary; Watson, Oliver John; Mobarak, Ahmed Mushfiq",Trans.

322085,Neurological symptoms in COVID-19: a cross-sectional monocentric study of hospitalized patients,2021,"To the Editors, The current coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has led mental health systems to uncertainty regarding safe continuation of clozapine monitoring protocols. Clozapine is without doubt the only antipsychotic available with repeatedly proven efficacy in treatment resistant schizophrenia.1 Replacing clozapine with an alternative antipsychotic in patients stabilized with clozapine can potentially lead to higher risk of relapse or exacerbation of severity of illness.1 Clozapine, as already known, has a number of side effects, some of which can be serious, thus patients receiving clozapine require ongoing scheduled monitoring. Side effects of clozapine include neutropenia or agranulocytosis, myocarditis, fever, hypersalivation, weight gain and constipation. These side effects can be detected and treated when recognized on time decreasing the possibility of serious consequences making the implementation of an ongoing treatment monitoring protocol for patients on clozapine mandatory.2 Since it was advised for all mental health providers in most countries worldwide to limit non-urgent hospital visits and procedures to reduce the risk of contamination a challenge arose for patients' ability to access health care facilities for their routine clozapine monitoring. Nevertheless, the majority of Mental Health Care Authorities decided to ensure access for all patients on clozapine to their routine monitoring protocol.3,4 To date, no data exist on any potential relationship between antipsychotic use and the risk of contamination with SARS-CoV-2 or the development of severe symptoms of the infection. The literature suggests that patients receiving antipsychotics, especially clozapine, have an increased risk of developing pneumonia, leading to the assumption that patients receiving clozapine are at higher risk to develop COVID-19. 1 Balancing the importance of monitoring continuation against the increased risk for COVID-19, an International Consensus Statement was recently published addressing a monitoring protocol with reduced visits. The Consensus suggested reduced hematologic monitoring frequency of every 3 months with a prescription of 90 days clozapine supply (if safe). The above applies to patients receiving clozapine for at least one year without neutropenia. &#932;he risk of neutropenia after 12 months of clozapine treatment falls significantly.4 Based on the above it is suggested to all clozapine clinics to implement a guidance monitoring protocol for all patients on clozapine to ensure safety during the pandemic. Besides hematological monitoring that requires physical contact with healthcare workers it is significant to implement a telemedicine appointment in frequent intervals to monitor symptoms of infection, symptoms of cardiovascular diseases and constipation. Patient should also be advised to regularly monitor one's blood pressure and pulses and ideally be educated on how by a member of the staff. If a patient is detected with any symptoms related to the above an emergency appointment for evaluation should be planned. Overall, since both the consequences and the duration of the pandemic are unknown, mental health services must work jointly to implement a clozapine monitoring plan to ensure safe continuation in such a vulnerable population.","Nystazaki, Maria; Alevizopoulos, Giorgos",,,215
323571,Challenges in the management of older patients with acute coronary syndromes in the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,": The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need to expand access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment through telehealth. A more permanent adoption of tele-SUD treatment options could positively alter the future of SUD treatment. We identify four steps that will help to ensure a broader transition to telehealth will be successful in improving the health outcomes of patients with SUDs. These steps are: (1) investing in telehealth infrastructure to enable health care providers and patients to use telehealth; (2) training and equipping providers to provide SUD treatment through telehealth; (3) providing patients with the financial and social support, hardware, and training necessary to use telehealth; (4) making temporary changes to telehealth law and regulation permanent. We believe these 4 steps will be critical to initiating SUD treatment for many persons that have yet to receive it, and for preserving SUD treatment continuity for millions of other patients both during and after the pandemic.","Drake, Coleman; Yu, Jiani; Lurie, Nicole; Kraemer, Kevin; Polsky, Daniel; Chaiyachati, Krisda H",J Addict Med,,215

This study aimed to explore the emotional impact (depression and anxiety symptoms and perceived stress) of the COVID-19 pandemic in Portuguese women pursuing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Results showed 67.4% of participants were in confinement but were dealing with it in a reasonably positive way. Women who continued to work at their workplace presented significantly higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than those who stayed at home. No significant differences were found regarding depression and anxiety symptoms scores when comparing the current sample with an infertility reference sample and a community sample. Depressive and anxiety symptoms remained stable, but there was a significant decrease in perceived stress over the eight-week period. Although these findings do not suggest a worsening of psychological difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals should be attentive to patients' long-term psychological consequences. It may be helpful to provide additional psychological support to women when restarting their ART treatments.","Galhardo, Ana; Carolino, Naír; Monteiro, Bárbara; Cunha, Marina",Psychol Health Med,,215

The article focuses on the management of patient flows, access to the hospital, maintaining and reallocating staffing levels, and managing urgent referrals, information, and communications from the point of view of the hospital managers over a seven-week period. The objective of the article is to provide beneficial insights and solutions to other hospital managers and medical directors who should find themselves in the same or a similar situation. In such an epidemic emergency, in the authors' opinion, the most important factors influencing the capability of the hospital to maintain operations are (1) sustaining the strict triage of patients, (2) the differentiation of flows and pathways to create what could be regarded as ""a hospital inside a hospital"", (3) tracing and sharing all available information to face the rapidly changing environment, (4) being able to maintain staffing levels in critical areas by flexibly allocating the workforce, and (5) from a regional perspective, being organized along a hub-and-spoke system for critical and time-sensitive networks was key for focusing the hospital's resources on the most needed services.","Magro, Francesco; Perazzo, Paolo; Bottinelli, Elena; Possenti, Francesco; Banfi, Giuseppe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,215

Stringent control measures, such as school closures and stay-at-home orders, while having significant effects, also bring huge economic losses. A crucial question for policymakers around the world is how to make the trade-off and implement the appropriate interventions. In this work, we propose a Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning framework to facilitate the data-driven decision making and minimize the long-term overall cost. Specifically, at each decision point, a Bayesian epidemiological model is first learned as the environment model, and then we use the proposed model-based multi-objective planning algorithm to find a set of Pareto-optimal policies. This framework, combined with the prediction bands for each policy, provides a real-time decision support tool for policymakers. The application is demonstrated with the spread of COVID-19 in China.","Wan, Runzhe; Zhang, Xinyu; Song, Rui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04607v2.pdf,215

Other complications including post-malaria neurological syndrome (PMNS) can rarely occur following complete recovery from the disease. We report a case of post-malaria neurological syndrome in a Tunisian patient. Case presentation: A 26-year-old Tunisian man with no past medical history was admitted in 2016 for a muscle weakness of the 4 limbs, seizures, tetraparesis and myoclonus which appeared after he returned from Côte d'Ivoire where he had been treated three weeks ago for Plasmodium falciparum malaria with favorable outcome. Blood smears for malaria were negative. Brain MRI showed multiple hypersignal cerebral lesions. Investigations didn't show any infectious, metabolic, toxic, vascular or tumoral etiology. Thus, the diagnosis of PMNS was considered. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone with favorable outcome. Two years later, he was completely asymptomatic. Conclusion: PMNS should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms occurring within two months of cured acute disease in which blood smears for malaria are negative and other etiologies have been ruled out. In most cases, the disease is self-limited while in severe cases corticosteroid therapy should be prescribed with favorable outcome.","Bellazreg, Foued; Slama, Dorsaf; Lasfar, Nadia Ben; Abid, Maha; Zaghouani, Houneida; Rouis, Sana; Hachfi, Wissem; Letaief, Amel",Afr Health Sci,,215

METHODS: A multi-center retrospective study was conducted at 11 hospitals in 4 provinces of China, and COVID-19 patients with stroke were enrolled from February 24 to May 4, 2020. We analyzed epidemiological, demographic, and clinical characteristics of cases as well as the laboratory test results, treatment regimens and outcomes, and the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes were compared between severe and nonsevere patients, and by age group, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 27 patients [mean age: 66.41 (SD 12.1) years] were enrolled. Among them, 9 (33.3%) were severe patients and 18 (66.7%) were nonsevere patients; 17 (63.0%) were female; 19 (70.4%) were aged 60 years and above. The most common symptoms were fever [19 (70.4%)], fatigue [12 (44.4%)] and cough [11 (40.7%)], respectively. Abnormal laboratory findings of COVID-19 patients with stroke included high levels of C-reactive protein [19 (73.1%)], D-dimer [14 (58.3%)], blood glucose [14 (53.8%)], fibrinogen [13 (50.0%)], and decreased lymphocytes [12 (44.4%)]. Comparing to nonsevere cases with stroke, severe patients with stroke were likely to be older, susceptible to receiving oxygen inhalation, and had more complications (p < 0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in lymphocytes, neutrophils, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, creatine kinase between the severe cases and nonsevere cases (p < 0.05). The older patients had a decreased platelet count and elevated fibrinogen, compared with the younger (p < 0.05). All patients (100%) received antiviral treatment, 12 (44.4%) received antibiotics treatment, 26 (96.3%) received Traditional Chinese Medicine (Lung cleansing & detoxifying decoction), and oxygen inhalation was in 18 (66.7%). The median duration of hospitalization was 16 days. By May 4, 2020, a total of 26 (96.3%) patients were cured and discharged, and 1 (3.7%) patients died. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with stroke had poor indicators of coagulation system, and severe and older patients might have a higher risk of complications and unfavorable coagulation system. However, the overall treatment outcome is favorable.","Ji, Xin-Yu; Ma, Yan; Shi, Nan-Nan; Liang, Ning; Chen, Ren-Bo; Liu, Si-Hong; Shi, Shuai; Wu, Gui-Hui; Li, Ji-Ke; Chen, Hong; Wang, Jing-Wei; Na, Hui; Zhou, Ying-Chun; Li, Min-Qing; Wang, Yu-Dong; Hu, Xiao-Mei; Hu, Yun-Hong; Liu, Zhang; Xie, Hai-Jun; Zhang, Lin-Song; Zhang, Hua-Min; Wang, Yan-Ping; Wang, Yong-Yan",Phytomedicine,,215

One solution involves splitting one ventilator to treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are obvious risks and little is known on how the technique would work on patients with ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs of equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but that large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different compliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility of the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments expanding on the previous studies with different ventilator setting and lung characteristics. Using two test lungs connected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were measured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances, modes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found large discrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs with compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway resistances, and that higher PEEP settings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test lungs. The most balanced, although far from ideal, delivery of tidal volumes for the test lungs with different compliance was measured using pressure-controlled ventilation with a maximum inspiratory pressure of 30 mbar and a PEEP at 6 or 10 mbar. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to identify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the hazards of the technique.","Tronstad, C.; Martinsen, T.; Olsen, M.; Rosseland, L.

Commercial RNA extraction kits are often expensive, in limited supply, and do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls for the development of safer methods for SARS-CoV-2 extraction that utilize readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories. We optimized and simplified a RNA extraction method combining a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution, phenol and chloroform. First, we determined the GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with an efficient two-step RT-qPCR for B2M mRNA in nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab samples. Second, we optimized a one-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2 using NP and OP samples. We furthermore tested a SARS-CoV-2 dilution series to determine the detection threshold. The method enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). The protocol is simple, safe, and expands analysis capacity as the inactivated samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral work. The method takes about 30 min from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA and circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits.","Kalnina, Lelde; Mateu-Regué, Àngels; Oerum, Stephanie; Hald, Annemette; Gerstoft, Jan; Oerum, Henrik; Nielsen, Finn Cilius; Iversen, Astrid K N",APMIS,,215

Patient awareness of the pandemic and executive limitations imposed on public life have changed the perception of when to seek care for acute conditions in some cases. We sought to study whether there is a delay in presentation for acute ischemic stroke patients in the first month of the pandemic in the US. METHODS: The interval between last-known-well (LKW) time and presentation of 710 consecutive patients presenting with acute ischemic strokes to 12 stroke centers across the US were extracted from a prospectively maintained quality database. We analyzed the timing and severity of the presentation in the baseline period from February to March 2019 and compared results with the timeframe of February and March 2020. RESULTS: There were 320 patients in the 2-month baseline period in 2019, there was a marked decrease in patients from February to March of 2020 (227 patients in February, and 163 patients in March). There was no difference in the severity of the presentation between groups and no difference in age between the baseline and the COVID period. The mean interval from LKW to the presentation was significantly longer in the COVID period (603±1035 min) compared with the baseline period (442±435 min, P<0.02).

338928,Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Surgical Breast Cancer Care in the Netherlands: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study,2020,"Lasting immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection is questioned because serum antibodies decline in convalescence. However, functional immunity is mediated by long-lived memory T and B (Bmem) cells. Therefore, we generated fluorescently-labeled tetramers of the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid protein (NCP) to determine the longevity and immunophenotype of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells in COVID-19 patients. A total of 36 blood samples were obtained from 25 COVID-19 patients between 4 and 242 days post-symptom onset including 11 paired samples. While serum IgG to RBD and NCP was identified in all patients, antibody levels began declining at 20 days post-symptom onset. RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells predominantly expressed IgM+ or IgG1+ and continued to rise until 150 days. RBD-specific IgG+ Bmem were predominantly CD27+, and numbers significantly correlated with circulating follicular helper T cell numbers. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response contracts in convalescence with persistence of RBD- and NCP-specific Bmem cells. Flow cytometric detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific Bmem cells enables detection of long-term immune memory following infection or vaccination for COVID-19.","Hartley, Gemma E; Edwards, Emily S J; Aui, Pei M; Varese, Nirupama; Stojanovic, Stephanie; McMahon, James; Peleg, Anton Y; Boo, Irene; Drummer, Heidi E; Hogarth, P Mark; O039,; Hehir, Robyn E; van Zelm, Menno C",Sci. immunol,,215
339030,A fatal case of COVID-19 infection presenting with an erythema multiforme-like eruption and fever,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The first case of infection by SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) has been officially recorded by the Italian National Health Service on February 21st, 2020. Lombardy was the first Italian region to be affected by the pandemic. Subsequently, the entire Northern part of Italy recorded a high number of cases, while the South was hit following the migratory waves. On March 8th, the Italian Government has issued a decree that imposed a total lockdown defined as a state of isolation and restricted access in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS: We analyzed the virus trend in the period between February 24th and September 8th, 2020, focusing on Calabria, with regards to the following items: new positives, change of total positives and total cases. Furthermore, we included other information, such as the incubation period, symptom resolution period, quarantine period. RESULTS: On March 27th, the epidemic curve spiked with 101 new positive cases validating the hypothesis that this abnormal event was related to the displacement of non-residents people, living in the Northern part of Italy, to the home regions in the South. The epidemic curve showed a decreasing trend in the period after lockdown proving the effectiveness of this measure. From the end of the lockdown (May 04th) to September 8th, the registered trend was -94.51%. A negative growth rate indicates that the number of new positive cases is lower than the number of healed patients. CONCLUSION: This study describes the effectiveness of the Italian Government policy, particularly the role of lockdown, for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in Calabria, a region with a low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate within the registered period.","Abenavoli, Ludovico; Cinaglia, Pietro; Procopio, Anna Caterina; Serra, Raffaele; Aquila, Isabella; Zanza, Christian; Longhitano, Yaroslava; Artico, Marco; Larussa, Tiziana; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Luzza, Francesco",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),,215
339031,A fatal case of COVID-19 infection presenting with an erythema multiforme-like eruption and fever,2020,"We examined the effects of regional scale land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors on alpha, beta and zeta diversities of native fish communities in wadeable streams and non-wadeable rivers in the Danube basin, Hungary. Relationships among land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors were weak both in streams and rivers, suggesting that these stressors act relatively independently. Alpha diversity decreased strongly with increasing local scale environmental stressor intensity in rivers. On the contrary, its response to stressors was more obscure in streams, where the best-fit statistical model indicated the importance of the interaction between land use, local scale environmental and biotic stressors, while the secondly ranked model highlighted the negative impact of local scale environmental stressors. Analysis of variance using distance matrices provided evidence that stressors alone and in interactions explained compositional differences of pairs of study sites (beta diversity). Considering the degree of overall degradation, both local (alpha) and among-site (beta and zeta) diversity indices responded to increasing stressor intensity, generally negatively. Riverine fish communities showed higher degrees of similarity (lower beta and higher zeta) than stream fish communities. They also showed increasing similarity (i.e. homogenization) with increasing overall stressor intensity, unlike stream fish communities, which showed no relationship with overall stressor intensity. Our results suggest that the relationships between land use and local scale environmental and biotic stressors can be complex and so do their effects on biodiversity. While stressor specific indices can provide information on the role of specific stressors in some cases, the examination of overall stressor effects is needed to assess realistically the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on native fish diversity. Diversity indices that quantify among-site changes in species composition, such as measures of beta and zeta diversity, can be fruitful for better understanding the role of multiple stressors in structuring ecological communities.","Eros, Tibor; Czeglédi, István; Tóth, Rita; Schmera, Dénes",Sci Total Environ,,215
339803,Recommendations for Endotracheal Intubation of COVID-19 Patients,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Molecular testing such as nasopharyngeal viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (NVP) is available now in most hospitals and widely used to identify respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study at 8 hospitals from March 1, 2016, to April 30, 2019. We included all adult SOT recipients who were admitted to the hospitals and had their first NVP post transplantation. RESULTS: A total of 102 adult SOT recipients were enrolled. NVP test was positive in 33 (32.4%) SOT recipients and negative in 69 (67.6%). Median age was more than 60 years old with female predominance in both groups. The majority of patients who had positive NVP were hospitalized either in fall or winter seasons (91%). RVI symptoms were documented in about 73% of the positive NVP group. Rhinovirus was the most common identified virus (48.4%). On logistic regression analysis, clinical presentation in fall or winter seasons, presenting with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms and taking prednisone &#8805;10 mg/d were significantly associated with positive NVP. This model classified patients into 3 categories of risk for RVIs-low (none of the variables), 0%; intermediate (1 variable), 6.5%; and high (&#8805;2 variables), 55.4% with P < .001 for all predictors. CONCLUSION: SOT recipients who are taking prednisone (&#8805;10 mg) and have URI symptoms in fall or winter seasons are more likely to have RVIs.","Samannodi, Mohammed; Vaghefi-Hosseini, Reza; Nigo, Masayuki; Guevara, Eduardo Yepez; Hasbun, Rodrigo",Transplant. proc,,215

Fourteen vaccines with reliable safety and effectiveness are being successfully distributed to the public. However, there is no specific clinical trial data of the vaccines currently on the market on cancer patients at various stages, so the safety and effectiveness on cancer patients is unknown. This mini-review aims to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients, and the urgent need of COVID-19 vaccines for cancer patients. In this review, we described the current status of the COVID-19 vaccine usages in cancer patients, as well as discussed potential problems in the use of vaccine. In addition, we included an original survey of the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccines in 209 cancer patients and their family members. COVID-19 vaccine can provide cancer patients with social and medical benefits; therefore, clinical trials of vaccines on cancer patients are in great need.","He, Yang; Ding, Yi; Cao, Bo; Huang, Yi; Wang, Xiao",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,215

The great majority of fatal events have been recorded in adults older than 70 years; of them, a large proportion had comorbidities. Since data regarding the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics in neonates and children developing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are scarce and originate mainly from one country (China), we reviewed all the current literature from 1 December 2019 to 7 May 2020 to provide useful information about SARS-CoV2 viral biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment, prevention, and hospital organization for clinicians dealing with this selected population. IMPACT: Children usually develop a mild form of COVID-19, rarely requiring high-intensity medical treatment in pediatric intensive care unit.Vertical transmission is unlikely, but not completely excluded.Children with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 must be isolated and healthcare workers should wear appropriate protective equipment.Some clinical features (higher incidence of fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and a longer incubation period) are more common in children than in adults, as well as some radiologic aspects (more patchy shadow opacities on CT scan images than ground-glass opacities).Supportive and symptomatic treatments (oxygen therapy and antibiotics for preventing/treating bacterial coinfections) are recommended in these patients.","Di Nardo, Matteo; van Leeuwen, Grace; Loreti, Alessandra; Barbieri, Maria Antonietta; Guner, Yit; Locatelli, Franco; Ranieri, Vito Marco",Pediatr. res,,215

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between ethnicity and outcomes of coronavirus positivity and hospitalization. DESIGN: An observational cohort study using electronic health record (EHR) data from a large community healthcare system in Washington State across the first phase of the pandemic (March 5 - June 7, 2020). RESULTS: A total of 18,667 patients (65.9% of all tested) with EHR-documented ethnicity were included. Overall, 6.4% of patients tested positive for coronavirus. Among Latinx patients, 18.6% of those tested were positive, compared to only 4.0% of tested White patients. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significantly higher odds of positivity for Latinxs (aOR = 4.96, 95% CI 4.19-5.87), Asians (aOR = 2.33, 95% CI 1.74-3.08), Blacks (aOR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.43-2.31), and members of other ethnic minority groups (aOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.80-2.95), compared to Whites in models adjusting for relevant confounders. Latinxs had a higher percentage of self-pay insurance (22.2%) compared to other ethnic groups (7.9-15.8%) and, among those who tested positive, were the only ethnic subpopulation with significantly higher odds than Whites to be hospitalized for COVID-19 (aOR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.45-3.33). We observed a positive correlation between infection and the percentage of Latinxs (r = 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.74), Blacks (r = 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.66), or Asians (r = 0.64, 95% CI 0.49-0.76) in a given zip-code. This correlationwas negative for Whites (r = -0.63, 95% CI -0.75, -0.45). CONCLUSIONS: We present empirical evidence of higher rates of coronavirus positivity among People of Color compared to White people in Washington State. Social determinants of health, such as occupation, housing, healthcare access, and community structure, may contribute to health disparities in the coronavirus pandemic. Targeted capture of these variables in electronic health records is warranted to inform health equity analyses.","Pflugeisen, Bethann Mangel; Mou, Jin",Ethn Health,,215
345069,The Evolving Pandemic of COVID-19 and Interventional Cardiology,2020,"Rationale:India has a high prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which can be lowered by regular physical activity. To understand this association, recent population data is required which is representative of all the states and union territories of the country.Objective:We aimed to investigate the patterns of physical activity in India, stratified by zones, body mass index (BMI), urban, rural areas, and gender.Method:We present the analysis of physical activity status from the data collected during the phase 1 of a pan-India study. This (Niyantrita Madhumeha Bharata 2017) was a multicenter pan-India cluster sampled trial with dual objectives. A survey to identify all individuals at a high risk for diabetes, using a validated instrument called the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS), was followed by a two-armed randomized yoga-based lifestyle intervention for the primary prevention of diabetes. The physical activity was scored as per IDRS (vigorous exercise or strenuous at work = 0, moderate exercise at home/work = 10, mild exercise at home/work = 20, no exercise = 30). This was done in a selected cluster using a mobile application. A weighted prevalence was calculated based on the nonresponse rate and design weight.Results:We analyzed the data from 2,33,805 individuals;the mean age was 41.4 years (SD 13.4). Of these, 50.6% were females and 49.4% were males;45.8% were from rural areas and 54% from urban areas. The BMI was 24.7 ± 4.6 kg/m2. Briefly, 20% were physically inactive and 57% of the people were either inactive or mildly active. 21.2% of females were found physically inactive, whereas 19.2% of males were inactive. Individuals living in urban localities were proportionately more inactive (21.7% vs. 18.8%) or mildly active (38.9% vs. 34.8%) than the rural people. Individuals from the central (29.6%) and south zones (28.6%) of the country were also relatively inactive, in contrast to those from the northwest zone (14.2%). The known diabetics were found to be physically inactive (28.3% vs. 19.8%) when compared with those unaware of their diabetic status.Conclusion:20% and 37% of the population in India are not active or mildly active, respectively, and thus 57% of the surveyed population do not meet the physical activity regimen recommended by the World Health Organization. This puts a large Indian population at risk of developing various NCDs, which are being increasingly reported to be vulnerable to COVID-19 infections. India needs to adopt the four strategic objectives recommended by the World Health Organization for reducing the prevalence of physical inactivity.","Podder, Vivek Nagarathna Raghuram Anand Akshay Suchitra Patil S.; Singh, Amit Kumar Nagendra Hongasandra Ramarao",Annals of Neurosciences,,215

Purpose To report abdominal imaging findings in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional study, patients consecutively admitted to a single quaternary care center from 3/27/2020 to 4/10/2020 who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were included. Abdominal imaging studies performed in these patients were reviewed and salient findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Univariable analysis and logistic regression were performed. Results 412 patients (average age 57 years; range 18->90 years; 241 men, 171 women) were evaluated. 224 abdominal imaging studies were performed (radiographs, n=137; ultrasound, n=44; CT, n=42; MRI, n=1) in 134 patients (33%). Abdominal imaging was associated with age (odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per year increase, p=0.001) and ICU admission (OR 17.3, p<0.001). Bowel wall abnormalities were seen on 31% of CT scans (13 of 42) and were associated with ICU admission (OR 15.5, p=0.01). Bowel findings included pneumatosis or portal venous gas, seen on 20% of CT scans in ICU patients (4 of 20). Surgical correlation (n=4) revealed unusual yellow discoloration of bowel (n=3) and bowel infarction (n=2). Pathology demonstrated ischemic enteritis with patchy necrosis and fibrin thrombi in arterioles (n=2). Of right upper quadrant ultrasounds, 87% (32 of 37) were performed for liver laboratory findings, and 54% (20 of 37) demonstrated a dilated sludge-filled gallbladder suggestive of cholestasis. Patients with a cholecystostomy tube placed (n=4) had negative bacterial cultures. Conclusion Bowel abnormalities and cholestasis were common findings on abdominal imaging of inpatients with COVID-19.

347988,Estimating lengths-of-stay of hospitalised COVID-19 patients using a non-parametric model: a case study in Galicia (Spain),2021,"OBJECTIVES: Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, introductions between primary care physicians (PCPs) and specialists were conducted in person. These important meetings were integral to patient care, facilitated care coordination, and improved the managed care of the patient. During COVID-19 and beyond, these important relationships should be fostered via digital means. We aimed to identify opportunities of digital health integration for the optimization of physician integration. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Prior to COVID-19, we conducted a survey of PCPs at a large multidisciplinary group with more than 1500 physicians that staffs multiple hospitals within a health system. The survey was sent via email with only 1 reminder. RESULTS: Thirty-six PCPs responded to the survey; 25% (9/36) were very satisfied and 19.4% (7/36) were moderately satisfied with the current in-person introductions. The PCPs found introductions to specialists helpful; 83.7% (31/37) wanted to ""put a name to the face,"" and 64.9% (24/37) wanted to ""understand the range of service provided by the specialist."" Fifty-one percent (19/37) and 54% (20/37) said ""I can better manage patient care and know when to refer to a specialist"" and ""I learn more about a particular specialist,"" respectively, with specialist introductions. If made easy, 67.6% (25/37) of PCPs would be interested in TeleConnect to facilitate introductions to specialists. CONCLUSIONS: Referrals between PCPs and specialists have been an integral aspect of medical care within managed care organizations. With the advent of technology during COVID-19, and along with this brief survey, the need for digital means to introduce PCPs and specialists is underscored.","Mechanic, Oren J; Nguyen, Nicolas; Kimball, Alexa B; Awtrey, Christopher",Am J Manag Care,,215

DESIGN: Observational, multicenter, time series analysis, of electronic medical records from 15 PICU in Brazil. Data consisted of all March, April, and May PICU admissions from 2017 to 2020. SETTING: Fifteen private PICUs in Brazil. PATIENTS: Pediatric patients admitted to the PICU from March to May since 2017. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The period from March 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020, was considered the ""intervention point"" studied, corresponding to the suspension of school activities and the beginning of physical distancing in Brazil. During the pandemic period studied, there were 28 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (one death). The mean age was higher (p = 0.000), the length of stay was shorter (p = 0.000), but mortality rates were similar among the periods (p = 0.36). The model estimated a reduction of 1,483 PICU admissions from March 2020 to May 2020. At the end of May, there was an estimated drop of -146.6 bronchiolitis admissions (95% CI, -242.8 to -50.3; p = 0.016); -71 asthma admissions (95% CI, -93.6 to -48.63; p = 0.000); and -59 community-acquired pneumonia admissions (95% CI, -74.7 to -43.3; p = 0.000) per period. The model showed no effect of the ""intervention"" (physical distancing) on hospitalization rates for epilepsy, diarrhea, sepsis, bacterial meningitis, or surgery when analyzed individually. When assessed together, the model estimated a reduction of 73.6 admissions (95% IC, -132 to -15.2; p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic strongly affected Brazilian PICUs, reducing admissions, length of stay, and the epidemiological profile.

We assessed whether risk factors related to social relationships (loneliness, living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing) at W1 were associated with suicidal ideation at W1 and W2 using multiple regression models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, mental health, and lifestyle variables. RESULTS: A total of 1,674 (18-75 years old; 86.5% females) were included in our longitudinal sample. Living alone (OR: 1.16; 95%CI = 1.03 - 1.30; p=0.015), number of days practicing social distancing (OR: 1.002; 95%CI = 1.000 - 1.004; p=0.027), and loneliness (OR: 1.49; 95%CI = 1.32 - 1.68; p<0.001) were associated with suicidal ideation in the cross-sectional analysis of W1. Only loneliness (OR= 2.12; 95%CI = 1.06 - 4.24; p = 0.033) remained significant as a risk factor to suicidal ideation in the longitudinal analysis between both waves. LIMITATION: Snowball, convenience sample design limits outcome estimates. Assessments were not objectively performed. CONCLUSION: Loneliness was consistently associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation, while other variables, such as living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing, were not. Measures to overcome loneliness are therefore necessary to reduce suicidal ideation during pandemics.","Antonelli-Salgado, Thyago; Monteiro, Gabriela Massaro Carneiro; Marcon, Grasiela; Roza, Thiago Henrique; Zimerman, Aline; Hoffmann, Maurício Scopel; Cao, Bo; Hauck, Simone; Brunoni, André Russowsky; Passos, Ives Cavalcante",J Affect Disord,,215

In response to reduced demand and travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19, airlines experienced a 94% reduction in passenger capacity worldwide in April and an estimated 60% reduction in passengers transported for all of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to spread on airplanes by infected passengers, so minimizing the risk of secondary infections aboard aircraft may save lives. We present the airplane seating assignment problem (ASAP) to minimize transmission risks on airplanes, and we provide two models to solve ASAP. We show that both models can be effectively solved using a standard commercial solver and that seating assignments provided by these models have lower aggregate risk than the strategy of blocking the middle seats, given the same number of passengers. The available risk models for aircraft are based on influenza data, and hence risk models based on SARS-CoV-2 should be developed to maximize the benefits of our research. © 2021 INFORMS.","Pavlik, J.

This would harm businesses according to the sectors. Like other sectors real estate sector under the construction industry is also facing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It becomes very detrimental about labour market, company liquidity, the supply of materials, project delivery, and key cost components, and so on. In general, it happens that the real estate sector often experiences complexities in case of project completion, scheduling, and financing. The planned work cannot be carried out due to the non-availability of sufficient numbers of skilled labours and staff. Moreover due to effects of pandemic real estate sectors and the work-life of real estate professionals are being hampered. It is very much obvious that human resources act as the lifeline of any organization and they need to be handled and managed with the utmost care and dignity. Despite the physical, technological and financial resources in the business, human resource is such a critical asset that employers should take care of their quality of work-life all the time, not only during the crisis period. By satisfying them the business can achieve its objectives in terms of revenue and recognition. After a strict lockdown when things return to new normal and employees return to work, the company needs to take certain 'human resource' perspectives for maintaining a good quality of work life. All the employers should implement some strategies concerning to qualitative work life of the employees during this epidemic situation. The real estate sector is labour intensive and employees are a very critical resource that helps to increase productivity and enhancing competitiveness in the market.

RECENT FINDINGS: Corticosteroids have been prescribed with the objective to attenuate the marked and persistent activation of the immune system. However, some causes of community-acquired pneumonia, namely viral, are associated with unexpected low levels of cytokines and depressed cellular immunity. As a result, several recent randomized controlled trials and large prospective observational studies repeatedly showed that corticosteroids had no impact on survival, and in some types of pneumonia like influenza, its use was associated with potential harmful effects like invasive aspergillosis. Apart from this, adverse effects, namely hyperglycemia, superinfections and increased length-of-stay, were frequent findings in the corticosteroid-treated patients. SUMMARY: According to the current evidence, corticosteroids are recommended in Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-infected patients and recommendations are against its use in influenza. In all other forms of severe community-acquired pneumonia, with the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the strength of the evidence does not support the safe and widespread use of corticosteroids as adjunctive therapy. Further studies are needed to identify subgroups of severe community-acquired pneumonia that can benefit or not from corticosteroids.","Póvoa, Pedro; Coelho, Luís; Salluh, Jorge",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,215

We offer a brief review of governmental policy responses in four OECD countries and how they may impact the disconnect YYA within those countries. METHODS: Literature was reviewed utilizing Cochrane Library, ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science to outline existing inequities among disconnected YYA and COVID-19 economic and health impacts. Government responses to COVID-19 from four OECD countries were reviewed. Using the social protection model, we highlighted significant policy changes and developments that influence the protection of vulnerable populations and evaluated the potential effect of long-term economic dislocations prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Disconnected YYA suffered significant financial and health burdens with no social protection floor in place. Lessons learned prior to and during the pandemic indicate that initiatives aimed at improving health and well-being among vulnerable YYA and their communities must be adequately funded, flexible, and comprehensive. Attempts to connect or reconnect YYA who were disconnected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will require a re-envisioning of policy. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, governments must invest in social safety net programs that focus on supporting those most at-risk. A concentrated focus on job creation, education and training, and paid work experience, investments in early childhood care and education, housing, health and mental health care is necessary to not only offset the pandemic's effects but also support thriving in the future for YYA.","Palmer, Ashley N; Small, Eusebius",Scand J Public Health,,215
355275,An artificial intelligence system for predicting the deterioration of COVID-19 patients in the emergency department,2020,"Most of the existing prediction models for COVID-19 lack validation, are inadequately reported or are at high risk of bias, a reason which has led to discourage their use. Few existing models have the potential to be extensively used by healthcare providers in low-resource settings since many require laboratory and imaging predictors. Therefore, we sought to develop and validate a multivariable prediction model of death in Mexican patients with COVID-19, by using demographic and patient history predictors. We conducted a national retrospective cohort study in two different sets of patients from the Mexican COVID-19 Epidemiologic Surveillance Study. Patients with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and complete unduplicated data were eligible. In total, 83 779 patients were included to develop the scoring system through a multivariable Cox regression model; 100 000, to validate the model. Eight predictors (age, sex, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, hypertension, obesity and chronic kidney disease) were included in the scoring system called PH-Covid19 (range of values: -2 to 25 points). The predictive model has a discrimination of death of 0.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.796-0.804). The PH-Covid19 scoring system was developed and validated in Mexican patients to aid clinicians to stratify patients with COVID-19 at risk of fatal outcomes, allowing for better and efficient use of resources.","Mancilla-Galindo, J; Vera-Zertuche, J M; Navarro-Cruz, A R; Segura-Badilla, O; Reyes-Velázquez, G; Tepepa-López, F J; Aguilar-Alonso, P; Vidal-Mayo, J de J; Kammar-García, A",Epidemiol Infect,,215

Using Facebook public posts, this research assessed compliance to COVID-19 restrictions such as social gatherings (SG) and social distancing (SD) in non-COVID-19, indigenous Fijian (iTaukei) funerals in Fiji. Results showed 95% of the 20 funerals exceeding SG limits with greater, and highly variable crowd sizes in rural than urban communities. Additionally, 75% of the 20 funerals did not adhere to the 2-m SD requirement of which 80% were in rural areas. Higher SG and SD compliance in urban funerals could be partially explained by the presence of a recognized authority who enforced crowd size limits, and the heterogeneous urban community who were more likely to flag breaches than their collectivistic, homogeneous, close-knit, rural counterparts. Ultimately, health authorities need to utilize a social lens that incorporates etic and emic differences in culture to ensure maximum compliance.","Vave, Ron",Asia Pac J Public Health,,215

Recent studies have discussed the fact that the presence of T. gondii cysts in the brain and the resulting biochemical and immunological mechanisms could be linked to neurobehavioral disorders. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity in OSA obese patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control study on obese patients screened for OSA was performed. According to the sleep disorder and matched based on gender, age and body mass index (BMI), two groups of obese patients were selected from our sample collection database. All patients were tested for toxoplasmosis serological status measuring anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were performed to assess the impact of chronic toxoplasmosis on sleepiness and OSA severity. RESULTS: 107 obese patients suffering from OSA were included in the study (median age: 53.3 years Interquartile range (IQR): [41.9-59.9]; median BMI: 39.4 kg/m2 IQR: [35.5-44.1], apnea-hypopnea index = 27.5 events/h [10.7-49.9]). Chronic toxoplasmosis was present in 63.4% and 70.7% of patients with or without sleepiness (p = 0.48), respectively and was not associated either to sleepiness (OR: 0.76, 95% CI: [0.52; 2.33], p = 0.64) or OSA severity (OR = 1.75, 95% CI: [0.51; 5.98] p = 0.37). CONCLUSION: Although chronic Toxoplasma infection in immunocompetent humans has been associated to several behavioral disorders or pathologies in recent literature, we demonstrate here that chronic toxoplasmosis is not associated to sleepiness and to sleep apnea syndrome severity in obese patients suspected of sleep apnea syndrome.","Dard, Céline; Bailly, Sébastien; Pépin, Jean-Louis; Brenier-Pinchart, Marie-Pierre; Fricker-Hidalgo, Hélène; Peeters, Marie; Pelloux, Hervé; Tamisier, Renaud",PLoS One,,215

The development of potential drugs requires an understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and mechanism of action. Thus, it is essential to understand the full repertoire of viral proteins and their interplay with host factors. Here, we show how the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein undergoes 3 stages of processing to allow virion activation and host cell infection. Our comprehensive structural and computational studies reveal why COVID19 is hypervirulent and incites the possible reason for the failure of several antibody treatments. In addition, our resolved complex structures of spike protein with different host cell receptors shows the complexity of entry. We also demonstrate via experimental, biophysical and molecular dynamics studies that how the host proteins CD26 (DPP4), Furin and TMPRSS2 process the viral spike glycoprotein and assist in the viral entry in addition to ACE2. These results cognise the detailed mechanism of spike glycoprotein for its entry or cascade into host cell and also reveal new avenues for potential therapeutics to block different stages of viral entry and new pathways for vaccine development.","Vankadari, Naveen",The FASEB Journal,,215

The COVID-19 pandemic has renewed interest in telemedicine and may spur expansion or development of new TCC programs. This narrative addresses the Cleveland Clinic TCC service, (eHospital) to promote exchange of ideas to continually optimize the practice for current and future users. Methods: A descriptive narrative methodology is used in this report. Results: Cleveland Clinic's eHospital was established in 2014 to support nighttime critical care across system hospitals. It encompasses a tiered system of two-way audiovisual communication, telemetry, software platform that integrates the electronic health record, and a proprietary risk stratification algorithm for targeted electronic surveillance. The TCC team includes intensivists, advanced care providers, and registered nurses. Three coverage models evolved depending on onsite clinician availability. More than 133,000 patients have been served by eHospital to date, and span the typical spectrum of critical illness. Along with universal monitoring, â¼18% of patients received active interventions, the most common of which are categorized. Patterns of activity, typical workflows, and adaptations of bedside best practices are also described. Bookending the work shift are sign outs focused on pending critical issues, unstable patients, and those who can be triaged out of the intensive care unit. In between, TCC teams round periodically and interact with bedside teams. Conclusions: TCC adoption has proceeded slowly. Some acceleration is anticipated in a post-COVID-19 pandemic world.

367365,Geographic risk assessment of COVID-19 transmission using recent data: An observational study,2020,"Due to COVID-19, many countries implemented emergency plans, such as lockdown and school closures. This new situation has significantly affected families, namely, the involvement required to support children's learning at home. The current study aimed to analyze Portuguese parents' perceptions of their home-based parental involvement in their children's learning during the lockdown and school closures in 2020 due to COVID-19. An online survey, using a closed-ended questionnaire, was employed. Variables included parents' sociodemographic and COVID-19 related characteristics;students' sociodemographic characteristics;distance learning context;parental involvement;and students' autonomy. Data were collected from a sample of 21,333 parents with children from elementary school to secondary education, and statistical data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 26. Findings revealed that Portuguese parents supported their children during the pandemic mainly through the monitoring of attention in classes and task realization. However, several variables appear to significantly determine parental involvement time, which is higher when students attend public schools, when they are less autonomous and younger, when parents' level of education is lower, when the child is a boy (except in secondary education where gender is not relevant), and when the online school time is higher. Findings highlight the need for a significant investment of time from parents, particularly of primary school children, making it difficult to cohere work or telework with school activities. Implications for policies, schools, families are discussed in order to promote children's learning and success.","Ribeiro, Luísa Mota Cunha Rosário Serrão Silva Maria Conceição Andrade e Carvalho Marisa Vital Maria Luísa",Education Sciences,,215

368085,"Rehabilitation needs of the first cohort of post-acute COVID-19 patients in Hubei, China",2020,"Background: Various studies have examined the psychological 'typhoon eye' and 'ripple' effects in mental disorders following COVID-19. However, these studies only considered the disorders as entities and assessed severity, and overlooked the differences in specific symptoms of disorders. Objectives: This aim of the study is to assess the psychological typhoon eye and ripple effects at the symptom-level in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is considered as a common psychopathology following the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: In total, 1150 undergraduates, including 271 students from the Hubei province (e.g. epidemic centre) and 879 students from other provinces, completed the self-report questionnaire. The networks were estimated and compared using the R packages. Results: Although the PTSD networks of Hubei and non-Hubei undergraduates were similarly connected and shared some symptoms with high centrality (e.g. flashbacks, irritability and anger), there were differences across the networks. Distorted cognition and no positive emotion only exhibited high centrality in the Hubei network. Physiological responses and exaggerated startle only exhibited high centrality in the non-Hubei network. Conclusion: These findings suggested that the psychological typhoon eye and ripple effects may co-exist at the symptom level. Targeted and distinct psychological services for college students in Hubei and non-Hubei provinces should be emphasized following COVID-19.","Sun, R.; Qi, J. J.; Huang, J.

A prospective cohort study,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), are heterogeneous diseases characterized by different mechanistic pathways (endotypes) and variable clinical presentations (phenotypes). AREAS COVERED: This review provides the clinician with an overview of the prevalence and clinical impact of severe chronic upper and lower airways disease and suggests a novel therapeutic approach with biological agents with possible biomarkers. To select relevant literature for inclusion in this review, we conducted a literature search using the PubMed database, using terms 'severe airways disease' AND 'endotype' AND 'treatment.' The literature review was performed for publication years 2010-2020, restricting the articles to humans and English language publications. EXPERT OPINION: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has brought forth many challenges for patients with severe airway disease and healthcare practitioners involved in care. These patients could have an increased risk of developing severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, although treatment with biologics is not associated with a worse prognosis. Eosinopenia on hospital admission plays a key role as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.","De Filippo, Maria; Votto, Martina; Licari, Amelia; Pagella, Fabio; Benazzo, Marco; Ciprandi, Giorgio; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",Expert rev. respir. med,,215

The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 pose a series of challenges both in understanding and delimiting the disease secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the fact that the main axis of this disease is the endothelial compromise and the production of a ""cytokine storm,"" triggering multiple organ failure and death. Given that a complete understanding of its pathophysiology and clinical behavior has not yet been achieved, we wondered if coinfection with other respiratory viruses modifies its performance and outcomes described so far. A literature search was performed, obtaining 68 articles, of which 25 were analyzed. The analysis showed us that there is a high variety both in the types of associated infections and in the clinical behavior of patients and their outcomes. Therefore, we consider that the search for other infections should be performed exhaustively, especially in those cases that may be susceptible to treatment such as Influenza A, human immunodeficiency virus, or bacterial infections. As well as optimize the analysis of these cases and establish if there are characteristics that allow establishing the possibility of carrying an additional infection to that of SARS-CoV-2 and the implications for the management and prognosis of the patient.","Barrera-López, Pedro; Pérez-Riveros, Erika D; Moreno-Montoya, José; Ballesteros, Silvia Marcela; Valencia, Sergio A; De la Hoz-Valle, José A",J. med. virol,,215

371940,COVID-19 and influenza testing in New York City,2020,"BACKGROUND: Anxiety is an extremely prevalent condition, and yet, it has received notably less attention than depression and other mental health conditions from a research, clinical, and public health perspective. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated growing concerns about the burden of anxiety due to the confluence of physical health risks, economic stressors, social isolation, and general disruption of daily activities. OBJECTIVE: This study examines differences in anxiety outcomes by care modality (coaching, teletherapy and telepsychiatry, and combined care) within an on-demand mental health system. We also explore the association between levels of engagement within each care modality and odds of improvement in symptoms of anxiety. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of individuals who accessed Ginger, an on-demand mental health system. Data were collected from 1611 Ginger members between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. We used logistic regression to assess the association between care modality and improvement in anxiety symptoms. Within each modality, we assessed the association between level of engagement and improvement. RESULTS: Of 1611 Ginger members, 761 (47.0%) experienced a decrease in anxiety symptoms, as measured by a change from a positive to a negative 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) screen. Among members who still screened positive at follow-up (865/1611, 53%), a total of 192 members (11.9%) experienced a clinically significant score reduction in the full GAD-7 (ie, a score reduction of >5 points), even though their GAD-2 scores were still positive. All modalities showed increased odds of improvement compared to those who were not engaged with coaching or clinical services (""app-only""). Higher GAD-7 intake scores were also associated with decreased odds of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: This study found increased odds of anxiety improvement for all care modalities compared to those who did not engage in care, with larger effect sizes for higher utilization within all care modalities. Additionally, there is a promising observation that those engaged in combined care (teletherapy and text-based coaching) had the greatest odds of anxiety improvement. Future directions include more detailed classifications of utilization patterns and an exploration of explanations and solutions for lower-utilization members.","Kunkle, Sarah; Yip, Manny; Hunt, Justin; amp,; 926,; Watson,; Udall, Dana; Arean, Patricia; Nierenberg, Andrew; Naslund, John A",JMIR Form Res,,215
371973,COVID-19 in 17 Italian Pediatric Emergency Departments,2020,"This study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the detection of new cases of leprosy in the state of Bahia, Brazil. The periods January-September 2019 and January-September 2020 were compared. There was a 44.40% reduction in the diagnosis of leprosy when comparing the two periods (1,705 in 2019 and 948 in 2020). There was a reduction in the number of municipalities with reported cases: 251 municipalities in 2019 and 202 in 2020, expressing a reduction of 24.25%. Considering only the months following the arrival of the virus (April-September), the reduction was 51.10%. An inverse correlation was observed between the number of new cases of leprosy and the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.840; P < 0.001) and the number of new monthly cases of COVID-19 (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.817; P < 0.001). A slight increase was also observed in the proportion of multibacillary cases in the state (70.38% in 2019 and 72.69% in 2020) as well as in the proportion of individuals with the degree of physical disability not assessed at diagnosis, whose proportion rose from 16.39% in 2019 to 22.53% in 2020. The negative impact of COVID-19 in tackling leprosy should be seen as a warning sign for health and political authorities.","Matos, Thais Silva; do Nascimento, Vanessa Almeida; do Carmo, Rodrigo Feliciano; Moreno de Oliveira Fernandes, Tânia Rita; de Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire; da Silva, Tarcísio Fulgêncio Alves",Int J Dermatol,,215

372635,Severe maternal morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19: The risk should not be downplayed,2020,"AIMS: To evaluate the relationship between mental workload and job performance among nurses providing care to patients with COVID-19, and to explain the factors predicting their performance. BACKGROUND: The increased workload of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic affects their job performance, causes medical errors, contributes to patients' mortality and is a major concern for all health care organisations in the world. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 139 nurses selected from the ICUs, infectious disease wards and emergency units of two hospitals in Iran. The NASA-Task Load Index and Paterson's job performance questionnaire were used. RESULTS: Mean scores of mental workload and job performance of the nurses were 67.14 ± 30.53 and 37.37 ± 7.36, respectively. A total of 71.95% and 96.4% of the nurses had high mental workload and job performance levels, respectively. The results indicated a weak positive correlation between mental workload and the mean score of job performance(r = .057). Unlike the mental demand (r = .175, p = .04) and temporal demand (r = .307, p < .001) that had a significant positive correlation with job performance, frustration had a significant negative correlation with job performance (r = -.183, p = .032). The following variables explained 33% of the variance of nurses' job performance: age, gender, type of ward, working shift, experience of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and frustration. CONCLUSION: The nurses' mental workload increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative effect of mental workload on the nurses' behaviour and performance, the rise in their job performance and its weak positive correlation with their mental workload should be further addressed. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The present study results support the need for focusing on implementing strategies such as providing social and psychological support to moderate mental workload and improve job performance of nurses who provide care to patients with COVID-19.","Pourteimour, Sima; Yaghmaei, Safura; Babamohamadi, Hassan",J. nurs. manag,,215
372942,Anesthesia for Cardiac Surgery during COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to widespread cancelation of electively scheduled surgeries, including for colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. The American College of Surgeons and the Society of Surgical Oncology have released guidelines for triage of these procedures. We seek to synthesize available evidence on delayed resection and oncologic outcomes, while also providing a critical assessment of the released guidelines. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify literature between 2005 and 2020 investigating the impact of time to surgery on oncologic outcomes in colorectal, pancreatic, and gastric cancer. RESULTS: For colorectal cancer, 1066 abstracts were screened and 43 papers were included. In primarily resected colon cancer, delay over 30 to 40 days is associated with lower survival. In rectal cancer, time to surgery over 7 to 8 weeks following neoadjuvant therapy is associated with decreased survival. Three hundred ninety-four abstracts were screened for pancreatic cancer and nine studies were included. Two studies demonstrate increased unexpected progression with delayed surgery over 30 days. Out of 633 abstracts screened for gastric cancer, six studies were included. No identified study demonstrated worse survival with increased time to surgery. CONCLUSION: Moderate evidence suggests that delayed resection of colorectal cancer worsens survival; the impact of time to surgery on gastric and pancreatic cancer outcomes is uncertain. Early resection of gastrointestinal malignancies provides the best chance for curative therapy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritization of procedures should account for available evidence on time to surgery and oncologic outcomes.","Fligor, Scott C; Wang, Sophie; Allar, Benjamin G; Tsikis, Savas T; Ore, Ana Sofia; Whitlock, Ashlyn E; Calvillo-Ortiz, Rodrigo; Arndt, Kevin R; Gangadharan, Sidhu P; Callery, Mark P",J Gastrointest Surg,,215

Methods: Twenty-seven U-19 elite male soccer players participated in the study. The investigation was conducted over two consecutive and similar seasons (e.g., the same staff, players, weekly training schedule), the first being the control and the second the experimental season. The strength program was carried out 2 times per week, for 10 weeks, during part of the preseason and in-season. Injury incidence and absence days were compared between both seasons, according to the injury rate ratio (IRR), with 95% CI and the Z test. Results: A lower number of total and hamstring injuries were recorded during the experimental (9 and 2, respectively) compared to the control (15 and 7, respectively) period. During the 10 weeks intervention period, the injury rate ratio (IRR) was lower in the experimental season than in the control season (IRR = 8.12; 95% CI: 1.00-66.03; effect size (ES) = 3.30, large). In addition, there was a decline in absence days per injury and in the number of absence days/1000 h (IRR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.90-3.14; ES = 1.12) during the experimental season. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that this simple strength-training program could reduce the muscle injury incidence during its application period in young soccer players.","Raya-González, Javier; Suarez-Arrones, Luis; Sanchez-Sanchez, Javier; Ramirez-Campillo, Rodrigo; Nakamura, Fabio Y; Sáez De Villarreal, Eduardo",Res Q Exerc Sport,,215

To mitigate these concerns, we develop and apply a methodology for evaluating the functionality, privacy and security of Android apps using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification API. This is a three-pronged approach consisting of a manual analysis, general static analysis and a bespoke static analysis, using a tool we've developed, dubbed MonSTER.

More importantly, various reports indicate that the number of asymptomatic cases can be several-fold higher than the reported symptomatic cases. In this article, we take the reported cases in India and various states within the country till September 1, as the specimen to understand the progression of the COVID-19. Employing a modified SEIRD model, we predict the spread of COVID-19 by the symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infectious population. Considering reported infection primarily due to symptomatic, we compare the model predicted results with the available data to estimate the dynamics of the asymptomatically infected population. Our data indicate that in the absence of the asymptomatic infectious population, the number of symptomatic cases would have been much less. Therefore, the current progress of the symptomatic infection can be reduced by quarantining the asymptomatically infectious population via extensive or random testing. This study is motivated strictly toward academic pursuit; this theoretical investigation is not meant for influencing policy decisions or public health practices.","Chatterjee, Saptarshi; Sarkar, Apurba; Karmakar, Mintu; Chatterjee, Swarnajit; Paul, Raja",Indian J Phys Proc Indian Assoc Cultiv Sci (2004),,215

Above average temperatures and below average rainfall resulted in drought across many parts of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, which then contributed to catastrophic bushfires. However, by late summer, above average rainfall resulted in a dramatic increase in mosquito abundance. While the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic unfolded, NSW experienced increased activity of mosquito-borne Ross River virus. All these extreme events created many challenges for managing the pest and the public health risks associated with mosquitoes, from maintenance of mosquito monitoring and control programs through to unique challenges of communicating mosquito bite prevention advice to local communities. There are important lessons to be learned in situations where extreme weather events may influence the risk of mosquito-borne disease through driving changes in the abundance and diversity of mosquito populations, while also influencing the abundance and distribution of native wildlife that represents important local reservoirs of arboviruses. Similarly, supporting the maintenance of mosquito monitoring and management programs while local authorities face competing priorities due to extreme natural disasters and/or public health events is critical.","Webb, Cameron E",Public Health Res.

Previous research has demonstrated that anticipating positive events produces increases in positive emotion during discrete stressors. We hypothesized that state and trait positive anticipation during the COVID-19 pandemic would be associated with increased positive emotions. We assessed how often participants thought about a future positive/negative/neutral event, activity, or goal through a daily reconstruction method that represented a ""day in the life"" of people in the United States during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of multi-level modeling and mediational analyses demonstrated that higher optimism, one form of trait positive anticipation, was related to higher state positive anticipation, which was in turn related to higher positive emotions during the current episode, which persisted to the next episode. In addition, both optimism and state positive anticipation were related to adaptive responses to the pandemic.

378924,[Outpatient Care of COVID-19 Patients - V.4.0/12.01.2021;provided by medix],2021,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 is growing, and a shortage of masks and respirators has been reported globally. Policies of health organizations for healthcare workers are inconsistent, with a change in policy in the US for universal face mask use. The aim of this study was to review the evidence around the efficacy of masks and respirators for healthcare workers, sick patients and the general public. METHODS: A systematic review of randomized controlled clinical trials on use of respiratory protection by healthcare workers, sick patients and community members was conducted. Articles were searched on Medline and Embase using key search terms. RESULTS: A total of 19 randomised controlled trials were included in this study - 8 in community settings, 6 in healthcare settings and 5 as source control. Most of these randomised controlled trials used different interventions and outcome measures. In the community, masks appeared to be effective with and without hand hygiene, and both together are more protective. Randomised controlled trials in health care workers showed that respirators, if worn continually during a shift, were effective but not if worn intermittently. Medical masks were not effective, and cloth masks even less effective. When used by sick patients randomised controlled trials suggested protection of well contacts. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that community mask use by well people could be beneficial, particularly for COVID-19, where transmission may be pre-symptomatic. The studies of masks as source control also suggest a benefit, and may be important during the COVID-19 pandemic in universal community face mask use as well as in health care settings. Trials in healthcare workers support the use of respirators continuously during a shift. This may prevent health worker infections and deaths from COVID-19, as aerosolisation in the hospital setting has been documented.","MacIntyre, C Raina; Chughtai, Abrar Ahmad",Int J Nurs Stud,,215

Narozny: ENT manifestation in COVID-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: The first cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Brazil were diagnosed in February 2020. Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support. We were able to ascertain the outcome in majority (96%) of patients. While the overall mortality was 30.2%, mortality for intubated patients was 55.9%. Multivariate analysis agreed with data found in other studies although the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker as a protective factor could be promising but would need further studies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Brazilian registry of clinical trials: RBR-5d4dj5.","Brandão Neto, Rodrigo A; Marchini, Julio F; Marino, Lucas O; Alencar, Julio C G; Lazar Neto, Felippe; Ribeiro, Sabrina; Salvetti, Fernando V; Rahhal, Hassan; Gomez Gomez, Luz Marina; Bueno, Caue G; Faria, Carine C; da Cunha, Victor P; Padrão, Eduardo; Velasco, Irineu T; de Souza, Heraldo Possolo",PLoS One,,215

To address this health emergency, countries have organized the flow of production and innovation to reduce the impact on health. This article shows the response of the Brazilian scientific community to meet the urgent needs of the public unified health system [SUS], aiming to guarantee universal access to an estimated population of 211 million. By December 2020, Brazil had recorded more than six million cases and approximately 175,000 deaths. METHODS: We collected data on research, development and innovation projects carried out by 114 public universities (plus Oswaldo Cruz Foundation [Fiocruz] and Butantan Institute), as reported on their websites. Additionally, we examined the studies on COVID-19 approved by the National Comission for Research Ethics, as well as those reported on the Ministry of Education website as of May 15, 2020. RESULTS: The 789 identified projects were classified according to research categories as follows: development and innovation (n = 280), other types of projects (n = 226), epidemiologic research (n = 211), and basic research on disease mechanisms (n = 72). Most proposals focused on the development and innovation of personal protective equipment, medical devices, diagnostic tests, medicines and vaccines, which were rapidly identified as research priorities by the scientific community. Some promising results have been observed from phase III vaccine trials, one of which is conducted in partnership with Oxford University and another of which is performed with Sinovac Biotech. Both trials involve thousands of volunteers in their Brazilian arms and include technology transfer agreements with Fiocruz and the Butantan Institute, respectively. These vaccines proved to be safe and effective and were immediately licensed for emergency use. The provision of doses for the public health system, and vaccination, started on January 17, 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The mobilized Brazilian scientific community has generated comprehensive research, development and innovation proposals to meet the most urgent needs. It is important to emphasize that this response was only possible due to decades of investment in research, development and innovation in Brazil. We need to reinforce and protect the Brazilian science, technology and innovation system from austerity policies that disregard health and knowledge as crucial investments for Brazilian society, in line with the constitutional right of universal health access and universal health coverage.","Rosa, Mário Fabrício Fleury; da Silva, Everton Nunes; Pacheco, Christina; Diógenes, Marcos Vinícius Pereira; Millett, Christopher; Gadelha, Carlos Augusto Grabois; Santos, Leonor Maria Pacheco",Health Res Policy Syst,,215
384980,COvid MEdicaTion (COMET) study: protocol for a cohort study,2020,"This study describes a novel approach in the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during trans-oral robotic surgery (TORS). Eight patients underwent TORS between 01 February 2020 and 07 September 2020. A sterile plastic sheet draped over sterile supports with water-tight seal around each cannula was used to create a sterile working space within which the robotic arms could freely move during operation. This set-up acts as an additional physical barrier against droplet and aerosol transmission. Operative diagnosis; droplet count and distribution on plastic sheet and face shields of console and assistant surgeons, and scrub nurse were documented. TORS tumour excision was performed for patients with suspected tonsillar tumour (n = 3) and tongue base tumour (n = 2). TORS tonsillectomy and tongue base mucosectomy was performed for cervical nodal metastatic carcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). Droplet contamination was noted on all plastic drapes (n = 8). Droplet contamination was most severe over the central surface at 97.2% (91.7-100.0%), with the highest droplet count along the centre-most column where it overlies the site of operation in the oral cavity 33.3% (n = 31). Droplet count decreased towards the periphery. Contamination rate was 2.8% (0.0-8.3%) over the right lateral surface. There was no droplet contamination over the vertex and left lateral surface of plastic drapes. No droplet contamination was noted on face shields of all parties. The use of sterile plastic drapes with water-tight seal around each robotic cannula can help reduce viral transmission to healthcare providers during TORS.","Chow, Velda Ling-Yu; Chan, Jimmy Yu-Wai; Wong, Melody Man-Kuen; Wong, Stanley Thian-Sze; Tsang, Raymond King-Yin",J. robot. surg.

It was shown that vaccination can significantly reduce the likelihood of deaths. However, existing vaccines do not prevent new infections, and vaccinated individuals can spread the infection as intensely as unvaccinated ones. Therefore, it is too early to lift quarantine restrictions in Europe and most other countries. The constant appearance of new cases due to re-infection increases the likelihood of new coronavirus strains, including very dangerous. As existing vaccines are not able to prevent this, it remains to increase the number of tests per registered case.

OBJECTIVE: To compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition and factors associated with changes. METHODS: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data from April 2020. Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and &#8805; 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID) change for anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; MCID = 4.0) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; MCID = 3.0) symptoms, controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels. RESULTS: Mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France (N = 159), adjusted anxiety symptom change scores were significantly higher in the United Kingdom (N = 50; 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.6), United States (N = 128; 2.5 points, 95% CI 0.7 to 4.2), and Canada (N = 98; 1.9 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.8). Odds of &#8805;1 MCID increase were 2.6 for the United Kingdom (95% CI 1.2 to 5.7) but not significant for the United States (1.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.9) or Canada (1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5). Older age and adequate financial resources were associated with less continuous anxiety increase. Employment and shorter time since diagnosis were associated with lower odds of a &#8805; 1 MCID increase. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety symptoms, but not depression symptoms, increased dramatically during COVID-19 among people with a pre-existing medical condition.","Thombs, Brett D; Kwakkenbos, Linda; Henry, Richard S; Carrier, Marie-Eve; Patten, Scott; Harb, Sami; Bourgeault, Angelica; Tao, Lydia; Bartlett, Susan J; Mouthon, Luc; Varga, John; Benedetti, Andrea",J Psychosom Res,,215

The aim of this study was to describe attitudes and behaviours towards the Canadian COVID-19 public health response, and identify risk-modifying behaviours based on socio-demographic characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was administered in May 2020 to members of a paid panel representative of the Canadian population by age, gender, official language, and region of residence. A total of 4981 respondents provided responses for indicators of self-reported risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours towards COVID-19 public health measures. RESULTS: More than 90% of respondents reported confidence in the ability to comply with a variety of public health measures. However, only 51% reported preparedness for illness in terms of expectation to work if sick or access to paid sick days. Risk perceptions, attitudes, and behaviours varied by demographic variables. Men, younger age groups, and those in the paid workforce were less likely to consider public health measures to be effective, and had less confidence in their ability to comply. Approximately 80% of respondents reported that parents provided childcare and 52% reported that parents in the workforce provided childcare while schools were closed. CONCLUSION: Policies to help address issues of public adherence include targeted messaging for men and younger age groups, social supports for those who need to self-isolate, changes in workplace policies to discourage presenteeism, and provincially co-ordinated masking and safe school policies.","Brankston, Gabrielle; Merkley, Eric; Fisman, David N; Tuite, Ashleigh R; Poljak, Zvonimir; Loewen, Peter J; Greer, Amy L",Can J Public Health,,215

There is limited information regarding donor tolerability of convalescent plasma donation. In this study, we evaluated the short-term donor tolerability of convalescent plasma donation. METHODS: A prospective study of 309 convalescent plasma donation related adverse events were conducted at Wuhan Blood Center of China, from February 12 to April 1, 2020. Additionally, up to 28-day post-donation follow-ups were performed on the donors. RESULTS: Sixteen (5.2%) adverse events were reported in 309 donations. All of these were mild vasovagal without loss of consciousness. The frequency of adverse reactions was higher in donors with a per donation volume of >8 mL/kg body weight or &#8805; 600 mL, <100 mm Hg in pre-donation systolic blood pressure, or less than 28 days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

Airway management for such patients during the COVID-19 pandemic including tracheal intubation, lung isolation, one-lung ventilation and flexible bronchoscopy may pose a significant risk to healthcare professionals and patients. That said, there remains a need for timely thoracic surgery for patients with lung cancer or thoracic trauma. The thoracic anaesthetic community has been confronted with the need to modify existing techniques to maximise safety for patients and healthcare professionals. With appropriate modification, aerosol generation may be mitigated against in most circumstances. We developed a set of practice-based recommendations for airway management in thoracic surgical patients, which have been endorsed by the Association for Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Critical Care and the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain and Ireland.","Thornton, M; Reid, D; Shelley, B; Steven, M",Anaesthesia,,215

We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elmer, Timon; Mepham, Kieran; Stadtfeld, Christoph",PLoS One,,215

A randomized controlled trial follow-up study,2021,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), one of the oldest drugs used in rheumatology, came recently into attention as one of the potential therapies tested for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 disease treatment. Used initially as an antimalarial, then translated to rheumatic diseases, HCQ has been used in a wide range of pathologies, including infectious diseases, immune disorders, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or neoplasia. Regarding systemic diseases, HCQ is the mainstay treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where, according to last European guidelines, it is proposed to all SLE patients unless contraindicated or with side effects. HCQ proved positive impact in SLE on robust outcomes, such as accrual damage, disease activity and survival, but also pleiomorphic effects, including decrease in the need for glucocorticoids, reduction in the risk of neonatal lupus, lower fasting glucose and protection against diabetes, thrombotic risk, dyslipidemia, infections, etc. Moreover, HCQ can be used during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Besides SLE, the role for HCQ in the anti-phospholipid syndrome and Sjögren's disease is still under debate. On the contrary, recent advances showed only limited interest for rheumatoid arthritis, especially due the lack of structural damage prevention. There are still no strong data to sustain the HCQ use in other systemic diseases. In this review, we summarised the utility and efficacy of HCQ in different clinical conditions relevant for rheumatology practice.","Dima, Alina; Jurcut, Ciprian; Arnaud, Laurent",Joint Bone Spine,,215

405403,"A review of 92 obstetric patients with COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York and their peripartum anaesthetic management",2021,"Introduction: Emerging epidemiological studies suggested that Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors may increase infectivity and severity of COVID-19 by modulating the expression of ACE2. Methods: In silico analysis was conducted to compare the blood expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes between age and gender matched cohort of hypertensive patients versus control, and to determine the effect of common cardiovascular medications on the expression of COVID-19 receptors in vitro using primary human hepatocytes. Results: The transcriptomic analysis revealed a significant increase of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the blood of patients with hypertension. Treatment of primary human hepatocytes with captopril, but not enalapril, significantly increased ACE2 expression. A similar pattern of ACE2 expression was found following the in vitro treatments of rat primary cells with captopril and enalapril. Telmisartan, a second class RAAS inhibitors, did not affect ACE2 levels. We have also tested other cardiovascular medications that may be used alone, or in combination with RAAS inhibitors. Some of these medications increased TMPRSS2, while others, like furosemide, significantly reduced COVID-19 receptors. Conclusions: The increase in ACE2 expression levels could be due to chronic use of RAAS inhibitors or alternatively caused by other hypertension-related factors or presence of other comorbidities. Treatment of common co-morbidities often require chronic use of multiple medications, which may result in an additive increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Our data suggest that more research is needed to determine the effect of different medications, as well as medication combinations, on COVID-19 receptors.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Al Heialy, Saba; Hamoudi, Rifat; Kashour, Tarek; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Internat.

Cherry laurel (Laurocerasus officinalis Roem.) fruit is rich in vitamins and phenolic compounds with antioxidant effect. The aim of this study was to investigate how effective its extract would be against dimethoate-induced testis and sperm damage in rats. Sixty animals were divided in six groups of 10. Group 1 (control) received only 1 mL of saline (0.9 % NaCl). Group 2 received 7 mg/kg of dimethoate in 1 mL of saline. Group 3 received 4 mg/kg of extract in 1 mL of saline. Group 4 received the extract 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 5 received vitamin C (positive control, 100 mg/kg in 1 mL of saline) 30 min before dimethoate administration. Group 6 received only dimethoate for the first four weeks and then a combination of dimethoate and extract for another four weeks. All doses were administered daily by oral gavage. After eight weeks of treatment, the rats were euthanised and their reproductive organs removed. We took their body and reproductive organ weights and evaluated testicular oxidative stress, semen characteristics, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and histopathological changes. Dimethoate significantly decreased body and reproductive organ weights, sperm motility and concentration, testicular superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-peroxidase activities and significantly increased lipid peroxidation, abnormal sperm rate, sperm DNA damage, testicular apoptosis, and caused histopathological lesions. Cherry laurel extract significantly countered many dimethoate-induced adverse effects, both as pre- and post-treatment, including reproductive organ weight, semen parameters, oxidant-antioxidant balance, sperm DNA integrity, testicular apoptosis, and histological structure. Our findings clearly suggest that the beneficial effects of the extract are associated with countering oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation in particular.","Bakir, Elçin; Sariözkan, Serpil; Endirlik, Burcu Ünlü; Kiliç, Ayse Baldemir; Yay, Arzu Hanim; Tan, Fazile Cantürk; Eken, Ayse; Türk, Gaffari",Arh Hig Rada Toksikol,,215

METHODS: We linked population based surveillance of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations to national administrative data, to estimate seasonal RSV hospitalization rates among adults aged 18-80 years with certain pre-existing CMCs: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age and ethnicity adjusted rates stratified by age group were estimated. RESULTS: Among 883,999 adult residents aged 18-80 years, 281 RSV positive hospitalizations were detected during 2012-2015 winter seasons. Across all ages, RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with COPD, asthma, CHF, and CAD compared to those without each corresponding condition. RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with ESRD aged 50-64 years and adults with DM aged 65-80 years compared to adults in each age group without these conditions. No increased risk was seen for adults with CVA. The CMC with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization was CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.6-36.5 across age strata) and COPD (IRR range: 9.6-9.7). Among RSV positive adults, CHF and COPD were independently associated with increased length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with specific CMCs are at increased risk of RSV hospitalizations. Age affects this relationship for some CMCs. Such populations maybe relevant for future RSV prevention strategies.","Prasad, Namrata; Walker, Tiffany A; Waite, Ben; Wood, Tim; Trenholme, Adrian A; Baker, Michael G; McArthur, Colin; Wong, Conroy A; Grant, Cameron C; Huang, Q Sue; Newbern, E Claire",,,215

Participants reported their answers to items on a 5-point Likert-like scale. Results: The results revealed that psychological trauma was a negative predictor of mental health, and resilience and positive emotion regulation mediated the relationship between psychological trauma and mental health. Conclusions: Accordingly, we concluded that resilience and positive emotion regulation interrupted the direct impact of psychological trauma on mental health, thereby greatly protecting the mental health of Wuhan's high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Yang, Dong; Swekwi, Usaporn; Tu, Chia-Ching; Dai, Xiao",Child Youth Serv Rev,,215

To test this, we interrogated the interstitial migratory capacity of adult meniscal cells through dense fibrous networks and adult tissue before and after nuclear softening via the application of a histone deacetylase inhibitor, Trichostatin A (TSA) or knockdown of the filamentous nuclear protein Lamin A/C. Our results show that transient softening of the nucleus improves migration through microporous membranes, electrospun fibrous matrices, and tissue sections and that nuclear properties and cell function recover after treatment. We also showed that biomaterial delivery of TSA promoted in vivo cellularization of scaffolds by endogenous cells.

410648,Is There an Impact of COVID-19 on Admission of Patients to the Emergency Department for Vascular Surgery?,2020,"Viruses hijack host functions to invade their target cells and spread to new cells. Specifically, viruses learned to usurp liquidâliquid phase separation (LLPS), a newly exploited mechanism, used by the cell to concentrate enzymes to accelerate and confine a wide variety of cellular processes. LLPS gives rise to actual membraneless organelles (MLOs), which do not only increase reaction rates, but also act as a filter to select molecules to be retained or to be excluded from the liquid droplet. This is exactly what seems to happen with the condensation of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to favor the packaging of intact viral genomes, excluding viral subgenomic or host cellular RNAs. Another older pandemic virus, HIV-1, also takes advantage of LLPS in the host cell during the viral cycle. Recent discoveries highlighted that HIV-1 RNA genome condensates in nuclear MLOs accompanied by specific host and viral proteins, breaking the dogma of retroviruses that limited viral synthesis exclusively to the cytoplasmic compartment. Intriguing fundamental properties of viral/host LLPS remain still unclear. Future studies will contribute to deeply understanding the role of pathogen-induced MLOs in the epidemic invasion of pandemic viruses.","Scoca, Viviana; Di Nunzio, Francesca",J. mol. cell biol.

412169,Vaccination and COVID-19 dynamics in hemodialysis patients: a population-based study in France,2021,"At the current time of rising demand for hospital beds, it is important to triage COVID-19 patients according to the treatment needed during hospitalization. The need for oxygen therapy is an important factor determining hospital admission of these patients. Our retrospective study was designed to identify risk factors associated with the progression to oxygen requirement in COVID-19 patients. A total of 133 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital from February 22, 2020, to August 23. After excluding asymptomatic, non-Japanese, pediatric, pregnant patients and also those who needed oxygen immediately at admission, data of the remaining 84 patients were analyzed. The patients were separated into those who required oxygen after admission and those who did not, and their characteristics were compared. Age, body mass index (BMI), lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase, estimated glomerular filtration rate, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were significantly different between the two groups. Multivariate analysis identified four significant and independent risk factors of oxygen requirement, including advanced age, obesity, glucose intolerance and lymphocytopenia. Dividing the patients into subgroups according to the number of these risk factors found in each patient indicated that the need for oxygen increased with higher number of these risk factors in the same individual. Our results suggest that the presence of higher number of these risk factors in COVID-19 patients is associated with future oxygen requirement and that this index can be potentially useful in triaging COVID-19 patients staying home in the context of need for hospitalization.","Okauchi, Yukiyoshi; Matsuno, Kanae; Nishida, Tsutomu; Sawada, Koichi; Kawasaki, Akiko; Ito, Naohiko; Morimura, Osamu; Otani, Yasushi; Yokoe, Masaru; Abe, Kinya; Iwahashi, Hiromi",Endocr J,,215
413439,"Trajectories of eating behavior during COVID-19 lockdown: Longitudinal analyses of 22,374 adults",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), one of the causes of the common cold, exacerbates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchial asthma. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists and ß2-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids inhibit the exacerbation of COPD and bronchial asthma caused by infection with viruses, including HCoV-229E. However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication and infection-induced inflammation in the human airway are unknown. METHODS: Primary human nasal (HNE) and tracheal (HTE) epithelial cell cultures were infected with HCoV-229E. RESULTS: Pretreatment of HNE and HTE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E receptor CD13, the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm, and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, and IFN-ß. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2'2'-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production. Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol reduced the susceptibility to infection, and pretreatment with the three drugs inhibited activation of nuclear factor-kappa B p50 and p65 proteins. Pretreatment with formoterol increased cAMP levels and treatment with cAMP decreased viral titers, CD13 expression, and the fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly by inhibiting receptor expression and/or endosomal function and that these drugs modulate infection-induced inflammation in the airway.","Yamaya, Mutsuo; Nishimura, Hidekazu; Deng, Xue; Sugawara, Mitsuru; Watanabe, Oshi; Nomura, Kazuhiro; Shimotai, Yoshitaka; Momma, Haruki; Ichinose, Masakazu; Kawase, Tetsuaki",Respir Investig,,215

However, still there are no approved antiviral agents or vaccines available yet. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as a novel promising adjuvant therapy for the attenuation of COVID-19 based on its putative pathogenesis. MSCs may exert anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-apoptotic, as well as regenerative effects through a series of mechanisms. Remarkably, MSCs may be resistant to virus infection, which is fundamental for the treatment of COVID-19. The beneficial therapeutic effects of MSCs have been preliminarily proved to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of COVID-19 in current clinical trials. This work aims to review the beneficial effects of MSCs in treating ALI/ARDS, which provides novel insight into the potential therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.

The presently popular approach of a collection of samples using the nasopharyngeal swab method and subsequent detection of RNA using the real-time polymerase chain reaction suffers from false-positive results and a longer diagnostic time scale. Alternatively, various optical techniques namely optical sensing, spectroscopy, and imaging shows a great promise in virus detection. Herein, a comprehensive review of the various photonics technologies employed for virus detection, particularly the SARS-CoV family, is discussed. The state-of-art research activities in utilizing the photonics tools such as near-infrared spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence-based techniques, super-resolution microscopy, surface plasmon resonance-based detection, for virus detection accounted extensively with an emphasis on coronavirus detection. Further, an account of emerging photonics technologies of SARS-CoV-2 detection and future possibilities is also explained.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread globally, isolation and restriction orders taken by the governments have become the cores to control the pandemic. In this study, we, therefore, aimed to investigate the ureteral stone presentations in a high-volume university hospital during the COVID-19 restriction order period. Materials and Methods: The data of 149 patients who were hospitalized due to ureteral stone both during the COVID-19 pandemic restriction period and the corresponding period (non-COVID-19) of the previous year were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Unpaired Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables. The categorical data were assessed using Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests. Results: Of 149 patients, 35 were hospitalized in the COVID-19 restrictions period. While the mean age and the stone characteristics of the two groups did not differ significantly, serum creatinine levels (1.9 ± 1.85 vs 1.15 ± 0.64) and the white blood cell counts (12.45 ± 6.54 vs 8.21 ± 4.15) at hospital admission were significantly higher in the COVID-19 restrictions group (p = 0.034 and p = 0.005, respectively). According to the priority classification recommendations of the European Urology Guidelines Office Rapid Reaction Group for urolithiasis applicable during the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant difference was observed between the two periods (X2 = 9.907, p = 0.019). In particular, the rate of emergency cases was found more than threefold in the COVID-19 period. Although there was no significant difference in terms of the grade of hydronephrosis at hospital admission between the two groups, the rates of grade 3 and 4 hydronephrosis were higher in the COVID-period group (1.8- and 3.3-fold, respectively). Conclusion: The rate of complicated ureteral stone disease significantly increased during the COVID-19 restrictions period. Urologists should prioritize the patients most in need of urgent care during COVID-19-like biosocial crisis.","Gul, Murat; Kaynar, Mehmet; Yildiz, Mehmet; Batur, Ali Furkan; Akand, Murat; Kilic, Ozcan; Goktas, Serdar",J Endourol,,215
422923,Age but not sex may explain the negative effect of arterial hypertension and diabetes on COVID-19 prognosis,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess the extent and to identify the determinants of food insecurity and coping strategies in urban and rural households of Bangladesh during the month-long, COVID-19 lockdown period. SETTING: Selected urban and rural areas of Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: 106 urban and 106 rural households. OUTCOME VARIABLES AND METHOD: Household food insecurity status and the types of coping strategies were the outcome variables for the analyses. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were done to identify the determinants. RESULTS: We found that around 90% of the households were suffering from different grades of food insecurity. Severe food insecurity was higher in urban (42%) than rural (15%) households. The rural households with mild/moderate food insecurity adopted either financial (27%) or both financial and food compromised (32%) coping strategies, but 61% of urban mild/moderate food insecure households applied both forms of coping strategies. Similarly, nearly 90% of severely food insecure households implemented both types of coping strategies. Living in poorest households was significantly associated (p value <0.05) with mild/moderate (regression coefficient, ß: 15.13, 95% CI 14.43 to 15.82), and severe food insecurity (ß: 16.28, 95% CI 15.58 to 16.97). The statistically significant (p <0.05) determinants of both food compromised and financial coping strategies were living in urban areas (ß: 1.8, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.09), living in poorest (ß: 2.7, 95% CI 1 to 4.45), poorer (ß: 2.6, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.4) and even in the richer (ß: 1.6, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.9) households and age of the respondent (ß: 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21). CONCLUSION: Both urban and rural households suffered from moderate to severe food insecurity during the month-long lockdown period in Bangladesh. But, poorest, poorer and even the richer households adopted different coping strategies that might result in long-term economic and nutritional consequences.","Das, Subhasish; Rasul, Md Golam; Hossain, Md Shabab; Khan, Ar-Rafi; Alam, Md Ashraful; Ahmed, Tahmeed; Clemens, John D",BMJ Open,,215

427963,What is the relationship between validated frailty scores and mortality for adults with COVID-19 in acute hospital care? A systematic review,2021,"Background: Variations in COVID-19 prevalence, severity, and mortality rate remain ambiguous. Genetic or individual differences in immune response may be an explanation. Moreover, hyperinflammation and dysregulated immune response are involved in the etiology of severe forms of COVID-19. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) levels, as an acute-phase plasma protein with immunomodulatory effect and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation response in severe COVID-19 illness. Methods: In this retrospective observational cohort study, 64 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive COVID-19 hospitalized patients were studied for AAT, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), troponin, complete blood count (CBC), random blood sugar, serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), and arterial oxygen saturation (O2sat) at admission and during hospitalization. Results: The results showed that hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had low serum levels of AAT and high CRP levels at the first days of hospitalization. In particular, the percentages of individuals with low, normal, and high AAT levels were 7.80%, 82.80%, and 9.40%, respectively, while high and low values of CRP accounted for 86.70% and 13.30% of patients. Most of the patients had an upward neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) trend, with a higher mortality rate (p < 0.05) and troponin levels (p < 0.05). However, comorbidities, CRP alterations, ESR alterations, nonfasting blood sugar, SGOT, SGPT, O2sat, RBC, and PLT values were not significantly different between the NLR downward and upward trend groups. Conclusions: The current study revealed that severe COVID-19 patients had low serum AAT levels related to CRP values.

Conventional oxygen therapy and awake proning are options, but the use of high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure are controversial. There is an urgent need for effective rescue therapies. Our aim is to evaluate the role of inhaled nitric oxide 160 ppm as a possible rescue therapy in nonintubated coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Design: Retrospective evaluation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients in respiratory distress receiving nitric oxide gas as rescue therapy. Setting: Massachusetts General Hospital, between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, during the local coronavirus disease 2019 surge. Patients: Coronavirus disease 2019 patients at high risk for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with worsening symptoms despite use of supplemental oxygen and/or awake proning. Interventions: Patients received nitric oxide at concentrations of 160 ppm for 30 minutes twice per day via a face mask until resolution of symptoms, discharge, intubation, or the transition to comfort measures only. Measurements and Main Results: Between March 18, 2020, and May 20, 2020, five patients received nitric oxide inhalation as a rescue therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 at Massachusetts General Hospital. All received at least one dosage. The three patients that received multiple treatments (ranging from five to nine) survived and were discharged home. Maximum methemoglobin concentration after 30 minutes of breathing nitric oxide was 2.0% (1.7-2.3%). Nitrogen dioxide was below 2 ppm. No changes in mean arterial pressure or heart rate were observed during or after nitric oxide treatment. Oxygenation and the respiratory rate remained stable during and after nitric oxide treatments. For two patients, inflammatory marker data were available and demonstrate a reduction or a cessation of escalation after nitric oxide treatment. Conclusions: Nitric oxide at 160 ppm may be an effective adjuvant rescue therapy for patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Wiegand, Steffen B; Safaee Fakhr, Bijan; Carroll, Ryan W; Zapol, Warren M; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Crit Care Explor,,215
430626,"The Associated Factors of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms in COVID-19 Patients Hospitalized in Wuhan, China",2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), presents high rates of morbidity and mortality and has affected thousands of people around the world. The search to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing and urgent. This systematic review seeks to assess whether photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be effective in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. METHODS: The focus question was: Can photodynamic therapy be used as potential guidance for dealing with SARS-CoV-2?"". A literature search, according to PRISMA statements, was conducted in the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, LILACS, and Google Scholar. Studies published from January 2004 to June 2020 were analyzed. In vitro and in vivo studies were included that evaluated the effect of PDT mediated by several photosensitizers on RNA and DNA enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. RESULTS: From 27 selected manuscripts, 26 publications used in vitro studies, 24 were exclusively in vitro, and two had in vitro/in vivo parts. Only one analyzed publication was exclusively in vivo. Meta-analysis studies were unfeasible due to heterogeneity of the data. The risk of bias was analyzed in all studies. CONCLUSION: The in vitro and in vivo studies selected in this systematic review indicated that PDT is capable of photoinactivating enveloped and non-enveloped DNA and RNA viruses, suggesting that PDT can potentially photoinactivate SARS-CoV-2.","Conrado, Pollyanna C V; Sakita, Karina M; Arita, Glaucia S; Galinari, Camila B; Gonçalves, Renato S; Lopes, Luciana D G; Lonardoni, Maria V C; Teixeira, Jorge J V; Bonfim-Mendonça, Patrícia S; Kioshima, Erika S",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,,215

Their common pathogenetic mechanism is progressive atherosclerosis in which oxLDL (oxidized LDL) plays major role. Receptor-mediated uptake of oxLDL by the monocyte-derived macrophages activates the long-term epigenetic reprogramming of innate immunity, which is termed ""trained immunity."" The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms and treatment possibilities that can control the activities of these specific macrophages. METHODS: Search in Medline and PubMed relevant articles on the trained immunity and cytokine storm of COVID-19. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: When oxLDL-trained macrophages encounter SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) in the lung, it causes unregulated cytokine secretion, leading to the alveolar damage. Therefore, blocking macrophage training by pioglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, could control the hyperactivation that the virus would trigger.","Erol, Adnan",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,215

434683,Presentation and Outcome of Congenital Heart Disease During Covid-19 Pandemic: A Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: School nutrition programs mitigate child food insecurity across the United States. With the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, kindergarten through grade 12 physical school campuses closed, which led to those programs transitioning to emergency feeding. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction has 4 action priorities that guided the assessment of school nutrition employees' emergency response during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to explore the experience of school nutrition employees as they provided emergency feeding services during the COVID-19 pandemic and evaluate their actions based on the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction . DESIGN: A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews (n = 34) was conducted via videoconferencing software. A purposive sample of school nutrition employees across all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions who were involved in the COVID-19 emergency feeding response participated during April and May 2020. PARTICIPANTS/SETTING: School nutrition employees were selected randomly for participation from those indicating willingness to be interviewed during their participation in a related survey. Recruitment continued until all 7 US Department of Agriculture regions were represented. Participants held various roles, ranging from state agency leaders to front-line supervisors, although most were district-level directors or assistant directors. ANALYSIS: Data were analyzed using a phenomenological qualitative analytic approach. RESULTS: Four themes emerged. First, participants described the progression of the initial shock associated with the pandemic and service disruption, the flexibility they practiced, and the development of new routines. Second, keeping people (children, coworkers, and the community) safe was highlighted. The next theme captured participants' feeling that they came ""out of the shadows"" as communities and stakeholders recognized their important contribution to children's food security. Finally, they shared insight on communication and accountability during the emergency feeding response. CONCLUSIONS: These programs demonstrated flexibility, resilience, and commitment to children during this crisis. As the pandemic continues and future disasters are considered, school nutrition programs and leaders can use the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction's ""build back better"" concept to refine disaster preparedness plans and advocate for changes that will continue to combat child food insecurity in the United States.","Patten, Emily Vaterlaus; Spruance, Lori; Vaterlaus, J Mitchell; Jones, Mckenna; Beckstead, Emma",J Acad Nutr Diet,,215

Update as of October 31st, 2020",2021,"PURPOSE: The Covid-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented stress to students and educational institutions across the world. We aimed to estimate the effect of the pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We used data on 419 first-year students (ages 18-20) at a large public university in North Carolina both before (October 2019-February 2020) and after (June/July 2020) the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. After evaluating descriptive data on mental health and stressors by students' demographic characteristics, we estimated the associations between Covid-19 stressors (including work reductions, health, distanced learning difficulties and social isolation) and mental health symptoms and severity controlling for students' pre-pandemic mental health, psychosocial resources, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found that the prevalence of moderate-severe anxiety increased from 18.1% before the pandemic to 25.3% within four months after the pandemic began; and the prevalence of moderate-severe depression increased from 21.5% to 31.7%. White, female and sexual/gender minority (SGM) students were at highest risk of increases in anxiety symptoms. Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, female, and SGM students were at highest risk of increases in depression symptoms. General difficulties associated with distanced learning and social isolation contributed to the increases in both depression and anxiety symptoms. However, work reductions as well as Covid-19 diagnosis and hospitalization of oneself, family members or friends were not associated with increases in depression or anxiety symptoms. CONCLUSION: Colleges may be able to reduce the mental health consequences of Covid-19 by investing in resources to reduce difficulties with distance learning and reduce social isolation during the pandemic.","Fruehwirth, Jane Cooley; Biswas, Siddhartha; Perreira, Krista M",PLoS One,,215

People across the globe are dealing with not only a health crisis but also an 'infodemic', a term coined by the World Health Organization to refer to the avalanche of contradictory information that is arousing widespread confusion and anxiety. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety and sleep disturbance at the early stage of the pandemic, and unveil the information coping process underlying differential susceptibility to COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance. The participants were 1,270 adults (47% men, Mage = 42.82) from the UK and US who completed initial (Time 1) and follow-up (Time 2) surveys from 16 to 22 March and 18 to 24 May 2020, respectively. The prevalence of probable clinically relevant anxiety was 61% and 45% at the first and second time points, and more than half of the participants in this anxiety group also reported mild to severe sleep disturbance. Moreover, 41% of the participants perceived themselves as not having enough COVID-19-related information and reported higher levels of COVID-19 infection anxiety and sleep disturbance over time than those who perceived themselves as having enough of such information. Moderated mediation analysis identified two groups who were more vulnerable to both psychological problems: high blunters who sought COVID-19-related information online more frequently and high monitors who sought such information offline less frequently. These findings highlight the importance of a good match between information coping style and strategy deployment in dealing with an infodemic surrounding a novel disease.","Cheng, Cecilia; Ebrahimi, Omid V; Lau, Yan-Ching",J Sleep Res,,215

437003,COVID-19 in Pregnant Women: Case Series from One Large New York City Obstetrical Practice,2020,"The effect of lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on air pollution in four Southern European cities (Nice, Rome, Valencia and Turin) and Wuhan (China) was quantified, with a focus on ozone (O3). Compared to the same period in 2017-2019, the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference). This study highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as O3 even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution.","Sicard, Pierre; De Marco, Alessandra; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Feng, Zhaozhong; Xu, Xiaobin; Paoletti, Elena; Rodriguez, José Jaime Diéguez; Calatayud, Vicent",Sci Total Environ,,215

Comprehensive reports from other countries are needed. We dissect the pattern, evolution and predictive value of such abnormalities in a cohort from Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Retrospective study with prospective 14-day follow-up of 373 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in five Madrid hospitals, including 50 outpatients. COVID-19 severe course was defined as need of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: A total of 33.1% hospitalised patients showed baseline AST elevation and 28.5% showed ALT elevation, contrasting with 12% and 8% of outpatients (P&#8804;0.001). Baseline AST, ALT and GGT levels correlated with LDH and C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (r&#8804;0.598, P<0.005). AST elevation was associated with other severity markers such as male sex, lymphopenia and pneumonia on X-ray (P<0.05 all). ALP and Bilirubin levels were rarely increased. Patients with elevated baseline AST displayed progressive normalization of this enzyme and increase in ALT and GGT levels. Patients with normal baseline AST showed a flattened evolution pattern with levels in range. Patients with a severe course of COVID-19 showed more frequently elevated baseline AST than those with a milder evolution (54.2% vs. 25.4%, P<0.001). Age, AST and CRP were independent risk factors for a severe course of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Mild liver enzyme elevation is associated with COVID-19 severity. Baseline AST is an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 course, while it tends to normalize over time. ALT and GGT show late elevation.","Fernández Carrillo, Carlos; Perelló, Christie; Llop Herrera, Elba; García-Samaniego, Javier; Romero, Miriam; Mostaza, José María; Ibáñez, Luis; Bañares Cañizares, Rafael; Bighelli, Federico; Usón Perón, Clara; Fernández Vázquez, Inmaculada; Hernández Castro, Olga; Albillos, Agustín; Lalueza, Antonio; Malo de Molina, Rosa; Muñez, Elena; Jiménez Tejero, Elena; Calleja Panero, José Luis",Rev. esp. enferm. dig,,215

Between 8th April and 2nd May 2020 we investigated levels and correlates of sexual activity and depression during COVID-19 lockdown in a sample of hospital workers and their acquaintances by an online survey on SurveyMonkey. Socio-demographic data, International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and Beck Depression Inventory were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MLRA) was used to test predictors of depressive symptoms and low sexual desire and satisfaction. A statistically significant difference in age, change in working habit, sexual satisfaction, sexual desire, and depressive symptoms was found between males and females. A statistically significant higher proportion of health care workers had low sexual desire (65.3% vs 56.8%, p = 0.042). At MLRA, age, being female, being a health care worker, having children at home, living with the partner, and having low sexual satisfaction were predictors of low level of sexual desire.

ObjectiveThe objective of this preliminary study was to assess whether we could identify (1) users who have reported on Twitter that they received Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period, and (2) reports of their pregnancy outcomes. MethodsWe searched for reports of Covid-19 vaccination in a large collection of tweets posted by users who have announced their pregnancy on Twitter. To help determine if users were vaccinated during pregnancy, we drew upon a natural language processing (NLP) tool that estimates the timeframe of the prenatal period. For users who posted tweets with a timestamp indicating they were vaccinated during pregnancy, we drew upon additional NLP tools to help identify tweets that report their pregnancy outcomes. ResultsUpon manually verifying the content of tweets detected automatically, we identified 150 users who reported on Twitter that they received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy or the periconception period. Among the 60 completed pregnancies, we manually verified at least one reported outcome for 45 (75%) of them. ConclusionsGiven the limited availability of data on Covid-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy, Twitter can be a complementary resource for potentially increasing the acceptance of Covid-19 vaccination in pregnant populations. Directions for future work include developing machine learning algorithms to detect a larger number of users for observational studies.","Klein, Ari Z; O'Connor, Karen; Gonzalez-Hernandez, Graciela",,,215
446216,Fear of COVID-19 and Stigmatization toward Infected People among Jordanian People,2020,"The prevalence of mental health problems among children (ages 0-21) in the United States remains unacceptably high and, post-COVID-19, is expected to increase dramatically. Decades of psychological knowledge about effective treatments should inform the delivery of better services. Dissemination and implementation (D&I) science has been heralded as a solution to the persistent problem of poor quality services and has, to some extent, improved our understanding of the contexts of delivery systems that implement effective practices. However, there are few studies demonstrating clear, population-level impacts of psychological interventions on children. Momentum is growing among communities, cities, states, and some federal agencies to build ""health in all policies"" to address broad familial, social, and economic factors known to affect children's healthy development and mental health. These health policy initiatives offer a rare opportunity to repurpose D&I science, shifting it from a primary focus on evidence-based practice implementation, to a focus on policy development and implementation to support child and family health and well-being. This shift is critical as states develop policy responses to address the health and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on already-vulnerable families. We provide a typology for building research on D&I and children's mental health policy.

However, previous knowledge pertaining to the related SARS virus and other human coronaviruses may prove useful. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may provide a pattern for estimating infection degrees and observing the development of the epidemic. In this study, we aimed to investigate the persistence of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 in recovered patients in Al Madinah region of Saudi Arabia. Materials and methods: A total of 150 recovered COVID-19 patients participated in this study. All the patients tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, using qualitative RT-PCR. An ELISA was used to measure anti-Spike (S) IgG antibodies in serum samples and screen for their persistence at various time points post-infection. Results: The patients were categorized as asymptomatic (27.3%), mild (28%) and moderate (44.7%) according to the disease severity. Amongst them, 35.3% were females (n = 53) and 64.7% were males (n = 97). Significant anti-S IgG antibody levels were observed among the different groups, with the patients in moderate group exhibiting the highest levels followed by the mild group;while the lowest levels were detected among the asymptomatic. There was a significant positive correlation between the patients' age and anti-S IgG antibody concentrations (Pearson r = 0.45;p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Our findings provide a solid evidence to support the use of an anti-S IgG ELISA as a diagnostic tool to indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgG seropositivity was sustained in recovered patients up to a hundred days' post-infection, the latest time point for antibody measurement in our study. Ours is the first report in Saudi Arabia to investigate the durability of humoral immune response in recovered COVID-19 patients.","Mahallawi, W.; Alzahrani, M.; Alahmadey, Z.",Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences,,215

DESIGN: This was a prospective clinical study. All women undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval were required to have a negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test 3-5 days prior to the procedure. Male partners were not tested. All cases used intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The first tube of follicular fluid aspirated during oocyte retrieval, drops of media following removal of the embryos on day 5, and vitrification solution after blastocyst cryopreservation were analysed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: In total, medium from 61 patients, vitrification solution from 200 patients and follicular fluid from 300 patients was analysed. All samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: With stringent safety protocols in place, including testing of women and symptom-based screening of men, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in follicular fluid, medium or vitrification solution.

452889,The aerosol box for tracheal intubation by a junior operator in patients with COVID-19,2020,"In this paper, a model is proposed of the pathophysiological processes of COVID-19 starting from the infection of human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed.","Morris, Gerwyn; Bortolasci, Chiara C; Puri, Basant K; Olive, Lisa; Marx, Wolfgang; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Athan, Eugene; Carvalho, Andre F; Maes, Michael; Walder, Ken; Berk, Michael",Life Sci,,215

Accordingly, it is important to examine social closeness in the context of computer-mediated communication in more detail and to take a closer look at the relation between the feeling of presence to achieve the maximum potential for such communication. In this paper we introduce the concept of sensory synchronization as a predictor for perceived social presence. To this end, social activities conducted virtually during the Covid-19 pandemic were surveyed and analyzed to understand the connection between a feeling of presence and possible sensory synchronization of communication partners. Context of activities were collected in preliminary interviews and examined more closely in an online survey (N = 234). Most frequently reported activities included video calls, playing virtual games and virtual meals. The results showed that there is a significant positive correlation between sensory synchronization and social presence in all activity categories. The activity categories significantly explain different variances of the evaluated social presence and sensory synchronization. The results of this work motivate further research on the topic of sensory synchronization and social presence. New predictors in social presence research were identified and a questionnaire for the assessment of sensory synchronization and social presence was developed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Becker, S.; Schrills, T.; Franke, T.","21st Congress of the International Ergonomics Association, IEA 2021",,215

Our computational study of unconfined and confined water clearly demonstrates that the TDSS reflects local, non-collective dynamics. Surprisingly, we found that the reaction field continuum model (RFCM) used to estimate TDSS curves solely from collective DRS spectra correctly transforms collective dynamics to local ones even in cases when the relaxation time trends are quite different.

As fraudes pela adição ou substituição de espécies infringem as legislações vigentes no Brasil e podem trazer graves consequências, incluindo perdas econômicas e riscos à saúde pública. Diversas técnicas estão disponíveis para a identificação da origem dos alimentos. Dentre essas, os métodos baseados na análise de DNA provaram ser práticos, confiáveis, específicos e extremamente sensíveis para a detecção de fraude. O presente trabalho teve como objetivo o desenvolvimento de teste de detecção de DNA das espécies Bos taurus, Sus scrofa, Ovis aries, Capra hircus, Gallus gallus, Meleagris gallopavo, Bubalus bubalis, Equus caballus, Felis catus e Canis familiaris em produtos cárneos. O método baseia-se na técnica de PCR em Tempo Real e combina o uso de iniciadores universais (utilizados como controle interno) e iniciadores específicos para a detecção do DNA alvo. Após cada reação de PCR, os produtos são submetidos à curva de dissociação, para confirmar se o DNA amplificado corresponde ao fragmento esperado de cada espécie. A precisão do método foi avaliada em 45 misturas experimentais de carnes nas proporções de 5050% ou 99-1% e em uma mistura com 10% de cada espécie do teste. O método detectou corretamente as espécies em cada mistura, inclusive aquelas presentes em 1% do total.

The transmission potential of 2019-nCoV has been modelled and studied in several recent research works. The key factors such as the basic reproductive number, $R_{0}$, of the virus have been identified by fitting contagious disease spreading models to aggregated data. The data include the reported cases both within China and in closely connected cities over the world. In this paper, we study the transmission potential of 2019-nCoV from the perspective of the robustness of the statistical estimation, in light of varying data quality and timeliness in the initial stage of the outbreak. Sample consensus algorithm has been adopted to improve model fitting when outliers are present. The robust estimation enables us to identify two clusters of transmission models, both are of substantial concern, one with $R_0:8\sim14$, comparable to that of measles and the other dictates a large initial infected group.","Li, Jun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03828v1.pdf,215

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using dual-eligible enrollment data and health care workforce data. METHODS: We determined the density of dual-eligible beneficiaries per 1000 population in 2017 for each of 3142 US counties. County-level supply of primary care physicians (PCPs), primary care nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was determined. RESULTS: One-third of the 791 counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries had PCP shortages. Counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries and the fewest primary care clinicians of any type were concentrated in Southeastern states. These areas also had some of the highest coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks within their states. CONCLUSIONS: States in the Southeastern region of the United States with some of the most restrictive scope-of-practice laws have an inadequate supply of primary care providers to serve a high concentration of dual-eligible beneficiaries. The fragmented care of the dually eligible population leads to extremely high costs, prompting policy makers to consider integrated delivery models that emphasize primary care. However, primary care workforce shortages will be an enduring challenge without scope-of-practice reforms.","Xu, Wendy Y; Retchin, Sheldon M; Buerhaus, Peter",Am J Manag Care,,215

457979,Complete heart block and itchy rash in a patient with COVID-19,2020,"Dengue virus (DENV) causes dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever in humans. Some DF patients suddenly develop severe symptoms around the defervescent period. Although the pathogenic mechanism of the severe symptoms has not been fully elucidated, the viremia level in the early phase has been shown to correlate with the disease severity. One of the hypotheses is that a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection leads to high level of viremia. To examine the plausibility of this hypothesis, we examined the relationship between in vitro ADE activity and in vivo viral load quantity in six patients with dengue diseases. Blood samples were collected at multiple time points between the acute and defervescent phases, and the balance between neutralizing and enhancing activities against the autologous and prototype viruses was examined. As the antibody levels against DENV were rapidly increased, ADE activity was decreased over time or partially maintained against some viruses at low serum dilution. In addition, positive correlations were observed between ADE activity representing in vitro progeny virus production and viremia levels in patient plasma samples. The measurement of ADE activity in dengue-seropositive samples may help to predict the level of viral load in the subsequent DENV infection.","Yamanaka, Atsushi; Imad, Hisham Ahmed; Phumratanaprapin, Weerapong; Phadungsombat, Juthamas; Konishi, Eiji; Shioda, Tatsuo",Sci Rep,,215

There is a sense of guilt, anguish, helplessness, uncertainty and powerlessness when one is fighting something on such a powerful scale with limited resources and no definite end in sight. There are circumstances when these feelings can overwhelm a person leading to demoralization and potentially a moral injury. Spiritual practices and advice may help to deal with moral paradoxes and ethical dilemmas when other secular supports are undermined or inaccessible. The Holy Indian Epic, the Bhagvad Gita has described the moral distress of the warrior Arjuna, during the battle of Kurukshetra and the advice given to him by the Lord Krishna the gist of which can be encapsulated in the form of the four Ds- Detachment, Duty, Doer-ship and Dhyana or meditation.

AIM: We sought to determine if testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is associated with worse clinical outcomes. METHODS: Through a retrospective chart review, we identified 32 men diagnosed with COVID-19 and on TRT. They were propensity score matched to 63 men diagnosed with COVID-19 and not on TRT. Data regarding comorbidities and endpoints such as hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, ventilator utilization, thromboembolic events, and death were extracted. Chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests examined differences in categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Logistic regression analysis tested the relationship between TRT status and the study endpoints. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups, and TRT was not a predictor of any of the endpoints on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TRT is not associated with a worse clinical outcome in men diagnosed with COVID-19. Rambhatla A, Bronkema CJ, Corsi N, et al.

Scientific air distribution design and operation management are crucial to ensure the environmental safety of medical staff. This paper proposes the application of adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation and evaluates this air supply mode based on contaminants dispersion, removal efficiency, thermal comfort, and operating expense. Adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation provides a direct supply of fresh air to the occupied zone. In comparison with a ceiling air supply or upper sidewall air supply, adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation results in a 15%-47% lower average concentration of contaminants, for a continual release of contaminants at the same air changes per hour (ACH; 10 h-1). The contaminant removal efficiency of complete mixing ventilation cannot exceed 1.0. For adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation, the contaminant removal efficiency is an exponential function of the ACH. Compared with the ceiling air supply mode or upper sidewall air supply mode, adaptive wall-based attachment ventilation achieves a similar thermal comfort level (predicted mean vote (PMV) of -0.1-0.4; draught rate of 2.5%-6.7%) and a similar performance in removing contaminants, but has a lower ACH and uses less energy.","Zhang, Ying; Han, Ou; Li, Angui; Hou, Li039; an,; Olofsson, Thomas; Zhang, Linhua; Lei, Wenjun",,,215

A Survey of UK Vascular Surgery and Interventional Radiology Trainees,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Management of acute severe UC (ASUC) during the novel COVID-19 pandemic presents significant dilemmas. We aimed to provide COVID-19-specific guidance using current British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines as a reference point. DESIGN: We convened a RAND appropriateness panel comprising 14 gastroenterologists and an IBD nurse consultant supplemented by surgical and COVID-19 experts. Panellists rated the appropriateness of interventions for ASUC in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Median scores and disagreement index (DI) were calculated. Results were discussed at a moderated meeting prior to a second survey. RESULTS: Panellists recommended that patients with ASUC should be isolated throughout their hospital stay and should have a SARS-CoV-2 swab performed on admission. Patients with a positive swab should be discussed with COVID-19 specialists. As per BSG guidance, intravenous hydrocortisone was considered appropriate as initial management; only in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia was its use deemed uncertain. In patients requiring rescue therapy, infliximab with continuing steroids was recommended. Delaying colectomy because of COVID-19 was deemed inappropriate. Steroid tapering as per BSG guidance was deemed appropriate for all patients apart from those with COVID-19 pneumonia in whom a 4-6 week taper was preferred. Post-ASUC maintenance therapy was dependent on SARS-CoV-2 status but, in general, biologics were more likely to be deemed appropriate than azathioprine or tofacitinib. Panellists deemed prophylactic anticoagulation postdischarge to be appropriate in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 swab. CONCLUSION: We have suggested COVID-19-specific adaptations to the BSG ASUC guideline using a RAND panel.","Din, Shahida; Kent, Alexandra; Pollok, Richard C; Meade, Susanna; Kennedy, Nicholas A; Arnott, Ian; Beattie, R Mark; Chua, Felix; Cooney, Rachel; Dart, Robin J; Galloway, James; Gaya, Daniel R; Ghosh, Subrata; Griffiths, Mark; Hancock, Laura; Hansen, Richard; Hart, Ailsa; Lamb, Christopher Andrew; Lees, Charlie W; Limdi, Jimmy K; Lindsay, James O; Patel, Kamal; Powell, Nick; Murray, Charles D; Probert, Chris; Raine, Tim; Selinger, Christian; Sebastian, Shaji; Smith, Philip J; Tozer, Phil; Ustianowski, Andrew; Younge, Lisa; Samaan, Mark A; Irving, Peter M",Gut,,215

Originating from military experiences, the phenomenon also has relevance for healthcare professionals dealing with wars, natural disasters and infectious diseases. The deontological basis of medicine prioritises duty to the individual patient over duty to wider society. These values may place healthcare professionals at increased risk of moral injury, particularly in crisis contexts where they may be party to decisions to withdraw or divert care based on resource availability.We conducted a systematic review of medical literature to understand the extent and clinical and socio-demographic correlates of moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodWe conducted a systematic review of reports included in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, BNI, CINAHL, EMBASE, EMCARE and HMIC databases using search terms: “moral injury” AND “covid” OR “coronavirus” OR “pandemic”. We also searched Google Scholar and Ovid Database and conducted reference searching. We searched for published quantitative primary research as well as advance online publications and pre-print research. Findings are reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA). Two authors independently assessed the included studies’ methodological quality using a seven-item checklist.ResultOur databases search identified 498 records and other sources identified 4 records. We screened 391 records after removing duplicates. 4 reports met our protocol requirements.Three papers used cross-sectional designs. One reported longitudinal outcomes of their sample already described in one of the three papers. Only one study used a MI scoring system validated for healthcare professionals. Others used scoring validated in military populations. These papers reported outcomes from 3334 subjects, with a higher proportion of females. The largest study (3006 subjects) reported MI in 41.3% of their sample. Overall, factors associated with greater MI included: providing direct care to COVID-19 patients;sleep troubles;being unmarried;aged &lt;30 years;female gender;and Buddhist/Taoist faith. Nurses reported a greater severity of MI than physicians. MI significantly correlated with anxiety, depression and burnout. The longitudinal study reported that more stressful and less supportive work environments predicted greater MI at 3 months follow-up.The average quality assessment score of these studies was 4/7.ConclusionIt is important that we are able to address moral injury awareness training as part of workforce preparedness and burnout prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic and other disaster responses across the globe.","Williams, Verity Bradley Rhian Faruqui Rafey Hynes Julia Anderson Julie",BJPsych Open,,215

This work proposes to treat automatic image meme generation as a translation process, and further present an end to end neural and probabilistic approach to generate an image-based meme for any given sentence using an encoder-decoder architecture. For a given input sentence, an image meme is generated by combining a meme template image and a text caption where the meme template image is selected from a set of popular candidates using a selection module, and the meme caption is generated by an encoder-decoder model. An encoder is used to map the selected meme template and the input sentence into a meme embedding and a decoder is used to decode the meme caption from the meme embedding. The generated natural language meme caption is conditioned on the input sentence and the selected meme template. The model learns the dependencies between the meme captions and the meme template images and generates new memes using the learned dependencies. The quality of the generated captions and the generated memes is evaluated through both automated and human evaluation. An experiment is designed to score how well the generated memes can represent the tweets from Twitter conversations. Experiments on Twitter data show the efficacy of the model in generating memes for sentences in online social interaction.","Sadasivam, Aadhavan; Gunasekar, Kausic; Davulcu, Hasan; Yang, Yezhou",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14571v1.pdf,215

472193,Are patients with lung cystic fibrosis at increased risk for severe and fatal COVID-19? Interleukin-6 as a predictor of COVID-19 outcome,2020,"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections continue, there is a substantial need for cost-effective and large-scale testing that utilizes specimens that can be readily collected from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in various community settings. Although multiple diagnostic methods utilize nasopharyngeal specimens, saliva specimens represent an attractive alternative as they can rapidly and safely be collected from different populations. While saliva has been described as an acceptable clinical matrix for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, evaluations of analytic performance across platforms for this specimen type are limited. Here, we used a novel sensitive RT-PCR/MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based assay (Agena MassARRAY®) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens. The platform demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when compared to matched patient upper respiratory specimens. We also evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the platform and determined the limit of detection of the assay to be 1562.5 copies/ml. Furthermore, across the five individual target components of this assay, there was a range in analytic sensitivities for each target with the N2 target being the most sensitive. Overall, this system also demonstrated comparable performance when compared to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva by the cobas® 6800/8800 SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR Test (Roche). Together, we demonstrate that saliva represents an appropriate matrix for SARS-CoV-2 detection on the novel Agena system as well as on a conventional real-time RT-PCR assay. We conclude that the MassARRAY® system is a sensitive and reliable platform for SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, offering scalable throughput in a large variety of clinical laboratory settings.","Hernandez, Matthew M; Banu, Radhika; Shrestha, Paras; Patel, Armi; Chen, Feng; Cao, Liyong; Fabre, Shelcie; Tan, Jessica; Lopez, Heidi; Chiu, Numthip; Shifrin, Biana; Zapolskaya, Inessa; Flores, Vanessa; Lee, Pui Yiu; Castañeda, Sergio; Ramírez, Juan David; Jhang, Jeffrey; Osorio, Giuliana; Gitman, Melissa R; Nowak, Michael D; Reich, David L; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E",J Med Virol,,215

However, whether Sesn1 exerts a cytoprotective role in neurons following cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury is unknown. The goal of this work was to evaluate the role of Sesn1 in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced neuronal injury in vitro. The induction of Sesn1 was found in neurons exposed to OGD/R treatment. The silencing of Sesn1 rendered neurons more vulnerable to OGD/R injury, while the up-regulation of Sesn1 ameliorated OGD/R-induced neuronal injury by reducing apoptosis and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, the up-regulation of Sesn1 promoted the activity of the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) by down-regulating the expression of the Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). The restoration of Keap1 or the suppression of Nrf2 remarkably abolished the Sesn1-induced neuroprotection effects in OGD/R-exposed neurons. In summary, our work indicates that Sesn1 is a remarkable neuroprotective protein that potentiates Nrf2 activation via Keap1 to ameliorate OGD/R-induced injury.","Yang, Fang; Chen, Ruping",Brain Res,,215

The goal of this study was to evaluate the changes in wounds treated with a hypothermically stored amniotic membrane (HSAM). In this prospective single-arm study, 15 female patients with venous leg ulcers were treated with HSAM from male donors and standard of care for 12 weeks. Over the course of the study, wound exudate was collected and evaluated using proteomic microarrays. Biopsies were collected during the course of treatment to detect the presence of HSAM tissue. By 4 weeks, 60% of subjects achieved 50% or greater reduction in wound size, and by 12 weeks, 53% of subjects achieved 100% re-epithelialization. HSAM DNA was detected in 20% of biopsies as determined by the detection TSPY4, indicating HSAM was no longer present within the wound bed approximately 7 days from the last treatment for the majority of wounds.

This study aims to analyze the role of probiotics on severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In the current retrospective single-center study, we collected data of 311 consecutive severe patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Union Hospital from Feb 3rd to Feb 20th, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical and medication characteristics were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotics. RESULTS: In total, 93 of the 123 patients (75.61%) who were treated with probiotics survived to hospital discharge with the median inpatient day of 32 days and mean virus clearance time of 23 days, which were significantly longer than those of patients without probiotics. There were no bias in laboratory parameters, except for IL-6 and ESR, which were significantly higher in patients treated probiotics. We tracked the dynamic changes of 8 selected laboratory parameters (IL-6, CRP, total T lymphocytes, NK cells, B lymphocyte, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and CD4/CD8 ratio) and found that probiotics could not reduce the increased IL-6 levels but possessed the ability to moderate the immunity and decreased the incidence of secondary infection in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotics could be an effective strategy for the treatment of COVID-19 patients to reduce the secondary infection and moderated the immunity.","Li, Qiang; Cheng, Fang; Xu, Qiling; Su, Yuyong; Cai, Xuefeng; Zeng, Fang; Zhang, Yu",Int Immunopharmacol,,215
478677,Single center trends in acute coronary syndrome volume and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Background. Acute respiratory failure from COVID-19 pneumonia is a major cause of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated whether PaO2/FiO2, oxygenation index (OI), SpO2/FiO2, and oxygen saturation index (OSI), commonly used to assess the severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), can predict mortality in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients. Methods. In this single-centered retrospective pilot study, we enrolled 68 critically ill mechanically ventilated adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Physiological variables were recorded on the day of intubation (day 0) and postintubation days 3 and 7. The association between physiological parameters, PaO2/FiO2, OI, SpO2/FiO2, and OSI with mortality was assessed using multiple variable logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the predictive models. Results. The ARDS severity indices were not statistically different on the day of intubation, suggesting similar baseline conditions in nonsurviving and surviving patients. However, these indices were significantly worse in the nonsurviving as compared to surviving patients on postintubation days 3 and 7. On intubation day 3, PaO2/FiO2 was 101.0 (61.4) in nonsurviving patients vs. 140.2 (109.6) in surviving patients, p = 0.004 , and on day 7 106.3 (94.2) vs. 178.0 (69.3), p &lt; 0.001. OI was 135.0 (129.7) in nonsurviving vs. 84.8 (86.1) in surviving patients (p = 0.003) on day 3 and 150.0 (118.4) vs. 61.5 (46.7) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7. OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p = 0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7. Similarly, SpO2/FiO2 was 130 (90) vs. 210 (90) (p = 0.003) on day 3 and 130 (90) vs. 230 (50) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7, while OSI was 12.0 (11.7) vs. 8.0 (10.0) (p = 0.006) on day 3 and 14.7 (13.2) vs. 6.5 (5.4) (p &lt; 0.001) on day 7 in the nonsurviving and surviving patients, respectively. All measures were independently associated with hospital mortality, with significantly greater odds ratios observed on day 7. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for mortality prediction was greatest on intubation day 7 (AUC = 0.775, 0.808, and 0.828 for PaO2/FiO2, OI, SpO2/FiO2, and OSI, respectively). Conclusions. Decline in oxygenation indices after intubation is predictive of mortality in COVID-19 patients. This time window is critical to the outcome of these patients and a possible target for future interventions. Future large-scale studies to confirm the prognostic value of the indices in COVID-19 patients are warranted.

In silico and in vitro studies suggest that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir may show antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Three clinical trials comparing sofosbuvir/daclatasvir-based regimens with a comparator in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were combined in a meta-analysis. The primary outcomes measured were clinical recovery within 14 days of randomization, time to clinical recovery and all-cause mortality. A two-step approach was used to analyse individual-level patient data. The individual trial statistics were pooled using the random-effects inverse-variance model. RESULTS: Our search identified eight studies of which three met the inclusion criteria (n = 176 patients); two studies were randomized and one was non-randomized. Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. Clinical recovery within 14 days of randomization was higher in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arms compared with control arms [risk ratio = 1.34 (95% CI = 1.05-1.71), P = 0.020]. Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir improves time to clinical recovery [HR = 2.04 (95% CI = 1.25-3.32), P = 0.004]. The pooled risk of all-cause mortality was significantly lower in the sofosbuvir/daclatasvir arms compared with control arms [risk ratio = 0.31 (95% CI = 0.12-0.78), P = 0.013]. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that sofosbuvir/daclatasvir improves survival and clinical recovery in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. However, the sample size for analysis was relatively small, one of the trials was not randomized and the designs were not standardized. These results need to be confirmed in larger randomized controlled trials.","Simmons, Bryony; Wentzel, Hannah; Mobarak, Sara; Eslami, Gholamali; Sadeghi, Anahita; Ali Asgari, Ali; Abbaspour Kasgari, Hamideh; Tirgar Fakheri, Hafez; Merat, Shahin; Hill, Andrew",J. antimicrob. chemother,,215

Previous researches have presented the common clinical manifestations including respiratory symptoms (i.e., fever and cough), fatigue and myalgia. However, there is limited evidence for neurological and psychological influences by SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we discuss the common neurological manifestations of COVID-19 including acute cerebrovascular disease (i.e., cerebral hemorrhage) and muscle ache.

480872,Lessons Learned from the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in a Vascular Surgery Department and Preparation for Future Outbreaks,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has casted a huge impact on global public health and the economy. In this challenging situation, older people are vulnerable to the infection and the secondary effects of the pandemic and need special attention. To evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on older people, it is important to balance the successful pandemic control and active management of secondary consequences. These considerations are particularly salient in the Asian context, with its diversity among countries in terms of sociocultural heritage, healthcare setup and availability of resources. Thus, the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia summarized the considerations of Asian countries focusing on responses and difficulties in each country, impacts of health inequity related to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed recommendations for older people, which are germane to the Asian context. More innovative services should be developed to address the increasing demands for new approaches to deliver healthcare in these difficult times and to establish resilient healthcare systems for older people.

481565,Incidence and case fatality rate of COVID-19 in patients with active epilepsy,2020,"BACKGROUND: Health care professionals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are facing high levels of stress. AIM: The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. METHODS: We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. RESULTS: Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .71, p < .01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (beta = -.69; p < .01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted R2 = .61, p < .01 for overall model). Higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .68, p < .01) and worse self-perceived mental status (beta = .25; p < .05) were independent predictors of the lower SF36 scores (adjusted R2 = .73, p < .01 for overall model). CONCLUSION: The major MH burden of health care professionals treating infected patients during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that they need psychological support.","Stojanov, Jelena; Malobabic, Marina; Stanojevic, Goran; Stevic, Milos; Milosevic, Vuk; Stojanov, Aleksandar",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,215

Several factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19 infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.","Zandavi, Seid Miad; Rashidi, Taha Hossein; Vafaee, Fatemeh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12270v1.pdf,215

BACKGROUND: Overcrowding in emergency departments has been one of the most prominent issues arising in these units for more than 20 years. However, it has become even more problematic due to the novelty of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced hospitals to recruit larger numbers of beginner nursing staff as the number of quarantined health professionals increases. METHODS: Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted in Spanish emergency departments, which were analysed and synthesized using content analysis. RESULTS: Three major themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) Fears and concerns, (b) Organisational issues and (c) Support for novice nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may help to understand how shadowing periods as a learning programme for nurses, continuing professional development, evidence-based apps and better planning are needed to ensure both novice nurses' confidence in emergency departments and expert emergency room nurses' ability to cope with complications in critical situations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Training periods that include shadowing expert emergency room nurses, along with evidence-based technology, provide an opportunity to support novice nurses' transition into the workplace. These measures would provide a safety net and would increase novice nurses' confidence as well as high-quality care.","García-Martín, Manuel; Roman, Pablo; Rodriguez-Arrastia, Miguel; Diaz-Cortes, Maria Del Mar; Soriano-Martin, Pedro Jose; Ropero-Padilla, Carmen",J. nurs. manag,,215

MEASURES: Receiver operator characteristic curves and the area under the curve to compare the sensitivity and specificity of identifying positive cases of staff within facilities based on community COVID-19 activity level including county positivity rate and county cases per 10,000. RESULTS: The detection of any infected staff within a facility using county cases per 10,000 population or county positivity rate resulted in an area under the curve of 0.648 (95% confidence interval 0.601â0.696) and 0.649 (95% confidence interval 0.601â0.696), respectively.

Originally, quinine was extracted from the bark of Chinchona trees by South American natives of the Amazon forest, and it has been used to treat fever since the seventeenth century. The recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by Sars-Cov-2 infection has forced researchers to search for ways to prevent and treat this disease. Based on the antiviral potential of two 4-aminoquinoline compounds derived from quinine, known as chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), clinical investigations for treating COVID-19 are being conducted worldwide. However, there are some discrepancies among the clinical trial outcomes.Thus, even after one hundred years of quinine use during the Spanish flu pandemic, the antiviral properties promoted by 4-aminoquinoline compounds remain unclear. The underlying molecular mechanisms by which CQ and HCQ inhibit viral replication open up the possibility of developing novel analogs of these drugs to combat COVID-19 and other viruses.","Bazotte, Roberto Barbosa; Hirabara, Sandro Massao; Serdan, Tamires Afonso Duarte; Gritte, Raquel Bragante; Souza-Siqueira, Talita; Gorjao, Renata; Masi, Laureane Nunes; Antunes, Marina Masetto; Cruzat, Vinicius; Pithon-Curi, Tania Cristina; Curi, Rui",Biomed Pharmacother,,215

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 306 volunteers aged 18-65 years participated in this study. All participants were tested during strict quarantine in April 2020. In order to diagnose the personality traits related to ambiguity tolerance, we used Budner's scale of tolerance-intolerance of ambiguity. To determine the features of experiences we used the survey, which included 40 statements and 12 emotional states related to the cognitive, emotional-evaluative, and behavioral components of the person's self-image. RESULTS: Results: The overwhelming majority of volunteers perceive the pandemic as a dangerous, threatening, uncertain situation and make hasty decisions on the base of polar judgments, react with anxiety, attempt to avoid uncertainty, rejection of everything unusual. Their experiences were filled with feelings of powerlessness and deterioration in mood. For the majority of our subjects, the situation of uncertainty is the source of intolerance. Negative consequences appeared in the behavior (loss of time management skills, laziness). There are direct relationships between the factor of shock and anxiety with the sources of intolerance, novelty and complexity, and general intolerance. The cognitive component of the experience was the least pronounced and involved only after an emotional experience. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: It has been established that cognitive rethinking of the self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic is possible after an emotional response and leads to a change in the behavioral stereotypes.","Pogorilska, N.

489572,Telemedicine in orthopaedics and its potential applications during COVID-19 and beyond: A systematic review,2020,"AIMS: The present study had two aims: (i) compare echocardiographic parameters in COVID-19 patients with matched controls and (2) assess the prognostic value of measures of left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in relation to COVID-19 related death. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective multicentre cohort study, 214 consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients underwent an echocardiographic examination (by pre-determined research protocol). All participants were successfully matched 1:1 with controls from the general population on age, sex, and hypertension. Mean age of the study sample was 69 years, and 55% were male participants. LV and RV systolic function was significantly reduced in COVID-19 cases as assessed by global longitudinal strain (GLS) (16.4% ± 4.3 vs. 18.5% ± 3.0, P < 0.001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) (2.0 ± 0.4 vs. 2.6 ± 0.5, P < 0.001), and RV strain (19.8 ± 5.9 vs. 24.2 ± 6.5, P = 0.004). All parameters remained significantly reduced after adjusting for important cardiac risk factors. During follow-up (median: 40 days), 25 COVID-19 cases died. In multivariable Cox regression reduced TAPSE [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.07-1.31], P = 0.002, per 1 mm decrease], RV strain (HR = 1.64, 95%CI[1.02;2.66], P = 0.043, per 1% decrease) and GLS (HR = 1.20, 95%CI[1.07-1.35], P = 0.002, per 1% decrease) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related death. TAPSE and GLS remained significantly associated with the outcome after restricting the analysis to patients without prevalent heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: RV and LV function are significantly impaired in hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with matched controls. Furthermore, reduced TAPSE and GLS are independently associated with COVID-19-related death.","Lassen, Mats Christian Højbjerg; Skaarup, Kristoffer Grundtvig; Lind, Jannie Nørgaard; Alhakak, Alia Saed; Sengeløv, Morten; Nielsen, Anne Bjerg; Espersen, Caroline; Ravnkilde, Kirstine; Hauser, Raphael; Schöps, Liv Borum; Holt, Eva; Johansen, Niklas Dyrby; Modin, Daniel; Djernaes, Kasper; Graff, Claus; Bundgaard, Henning; Hassager, Christian; Jabbari, Reza; Carlsen, Jørn; Lebech, Anne-Mette; Kirk, Ole; Bodtger, Uffe; Lindholm, Matias Greve; Joseph, Gowsini; Wiese, Lothar; Schiødt, Frank Vinholt; Kristiansen, Ole Peter; Walsted, Emil Schwarz; Nielsen, Olav Wendelboe; Madsen, Birgitte Lindegaard; Tønder, Niels; Benfield, Thomas; Jeschke, Klaus Nielsen; Ulrik, Charlotte Suppli; Knop, Filip Krag; Lamberts, Morten; Sivapalan, Pradeesh; Gislason, Gunnar; Marott, Jacob Louis; Møgelvang, Rasmus; Jensen, Gorm; Schnohr, Peter; Søgaard, Peter; Solomon, Scott D; Iversen, Kasper; Jensen, Jens Ulrik Staehr; Schou, Morten; Biering-Sørensen, Tor",ESC Heart Fail,,215
489759,The Perceptions and Views of Rural Residents Towards COVID-19 Recovered Patients in China: A Descriptive Qualitative Study,2021,"IntroductionVaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) has been reported after vaccination with the adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in European countries. To date, no case of VITT has been reported in Thais after COVID-19 vaccination. We determined the frequency of anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies in the Thai population receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate the prevalence of anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies in health care workers who received COVID-19 vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or CoronaVac within 7-35 days. A control population who had not been vaccinated was also included. Anti-PF4/polyanionic antibodies were detected using enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Functional assay with platelet aggregation was performed for all positive anti-PF4/polyanionic antibody ELISA tests. ResultsA total of 646 participants were included in the study. 221 received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 232 received CoronaVac, and 193 participants were in the control group. The prevalence of anti-PF4 antibodies was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7 to 5.2), 1.7% (95% CI, 0.5 to 4.4) in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and CoronaVac groups, respectively. There was no positive test in the control group. None of the PF4/polyanionic positive sera induced platelet aggregation. ConclusionWe found a low prevalence of anti-PF4 antibodies in Thais after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and CoronaVac. Low titer positive PF4/polyanionic ELISA results should be interpreted with caution when screening asymptomatic individuals after vaccination against COVID-19.

The analysis was carried out with a new method based on the combined use of a 3 Way Decisions model and graph theory. Specifically, the data about infected people in the Italian regions is assessed by means of an evaluation function which allows the tri-partitioning of Italy and the identification of high, medium or low critical regions. The tri-partition is performed, along the temporal evolution of the COVID-19 diffusion, by calculating two threshold values which take into account the containment actions that, from time to time, the decision makers have implemented. The effects of a containment action are related to a reduction in the centrality value of a region. To estimate the effect of containment actions, we evaluated two approaches. The first is based on a uniform reduction in the centrality values of the regions, the second estimates the effects of containment actions starting from the mobility changes data provided by the Google Community Mobility reports. The results of our evaluation based on real data of the COVID-19 diffusion in Italy are encouraging and represent a good starting point for future extensions of the method.","Gaeta, Angelo Loia Vincenzo Orciuoli Francesco",Applied Intelligence,,215
494246,Second Decline in Admissions With Heart Failure and Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV2 pandemic obligated most of the European countries to implement strict measures and lockdowns to minimize the spread of the virus. Universities closed and on-line classes started. However, COVID-19 epidemic has significant impact on mental health of population. AIM: To assess depression level of nursing students (undergraduate and master) in Greece, Spain and Albania during COVID-19 pandemic as well as to identify possible determinants of depression level. METHODS: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020. An on-line questionnaire was used to collect the data. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to evaluate the depression levels of nursing students. RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty-seven nursing students participated in the study out of which 83.9% were of female gender, 92.9% single and 94.7% lived with others. One third of the nursing student population experienced mild depression, with higher depression levels noted for Spanish students (59.1%) followed by Albanian (34.5%) and Greek (21.8%) students. Multivariate linear regression analysis identified that Spanish students experienced more depression than Greek and Albanian (p < 0.001). Also, decreased age was associated with increased depression. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown and quarantine on nursing students mental health is clear. Provision of university based mental health interventions should be a priority.","Patelarou, Athina; Mechili, Enkeleint A; Galanis, Petros; Zografakis-Sfakianakis, Michail; Konstantinidis, Theocharis; Saliaj, Aurela; Bucaj, Jorgjia; Alushi, Evis; Carmona-Torres, Juan Manuel; Cobo-Cuenca, Ana Isabel; Laredo-Aguilera, José Alberto; Patelarou, Evridiki",J Ment Health,,215
494742,COVID-19 and Emissions: An Opportunity for Sustainable Global Health,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To analyse the diagnostic performance of eosinopenia, alone or combined with polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) and/or lymphocytes, as a marker of active COVID-19 in patients hospitalized for suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A prospective observational study including patients hospitalized for suspicion of COVID-19 in a COVID unit was performed from 20th March to 5th April 2020, in Perpignan, France. Patients for which there was a doubt upon diagnosis, who were recently under oral corticosteroids, had myeloid malignancy or human immunodeficient virus infection were excluded. SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed using an RT-PCR assay, from nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Complete blood count were performed for all patients. RESULTS: One-hundred and twenty-one patient were included: 57 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, 64 patients were not. Eosinophil count was lower in the COVID-19 group (median: 0/µL versus 70/µL, p < 0.0001). To diagnose COVID-19, eosinopenia had a sensitivity of 89.5% and a specificity of 78.1% while lymphopenia's were 73.7% and 62.5% respectively. Using area under curve (AUC) of receiving operating characteristics (ROC) curves, eosinophil's optimal cut-off level was 10/µL, sensitivity and specificity were 86%, and 79.7% respectively. Regarding the eosinophil/PMN ratio, the optimal cut-off level was 3.344, sensitivity and specificity were 87.7% and 73.4% respectively. The AUC of lymphocyte/PMN ratio was significantly lower than eosinophil/PMN ratio's (0.621 versus 0.846, p = 0.0003). CONCLUSION: Eosinopenia - <10/µL - and eosinophil/PMN ratio are useful, low-cost, reproducible tools to help diagnose COVID-19, during an epidemic period, in a population of hospitalized patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19.","Outh, Roderau; Boutin, Caroline; Gueudet, Philippe; Suzuki, Marcelino; Saada, Matthieu; Aumaître, Hugues",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,215
495542,Single-Center Vascular Hub Experience after 7 weeks of COVID-19 Pandemic in Lombardy (Italy),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop a scale to assess social distance attitudes related to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictive validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity. PRACTICE IMPLICATION: A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 social distance attitudes could inform policymakers, researchers, and clinicians who seek to promote protective social distance behaviors.","An, Lawrence; Hawley, Sarah; Van Horn, M Lee; Bacon, Elizabeth; Yang, Penny; Resnicow, Ken",Patient educ. couns,,215

In this report, we aimed to (1) characterize health uncertainty levels among healthcare workers in a large, U.S. hospital system during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) examine factors associated with higher levels of health uncertainty. Methods: From March to June 2020, healthcare workers in a large, urban U.S. healthcare system were invited via hospital emails and departmental announcements to complete an online questionnaire (REDCap). Self-report measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics and job roles, health uncertainty, and emotional wellbeing variables (anxiety, depression, loneliness, self-compassion, and coping confidence). Health uncertainty levels were compared using t-tests and ANOVAs. Results: Healthcare workers (N=440) were on average 44.5 years of age, 88.9% female, and 84.5% non-Hispanic white. Over half (52%) of healthcare workers reported at least some health uncertainty;pharmacists had the highest uncertainty, and technicians had significantly higher uncertainty than physicians (p&lt;.05) and mental health and spiritual counselors (p&lt;.05). Additionally, higher health uncertainty was associated with higher anxiety (p&lt;0.001), depression (p&lt;0.001), and loneliness (p&lt;0.001), higher self compassion (p=0.02), and lower coping confidence (p&lt;0.001).

498139,Impact on rehabilitation programs during COVID-19 containment for children with pediatric and perinatal stroke,2020,"PURPOSE: A positive margin after breast conserving surgery has consistently been shown to be a significant predictor for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. Currently, there is no standard for intraoperative margin assessment during lumpectomy, and up to 20% of cases result in positive margins. MarginProbe is a device that provides real-time evaluation of lumpectomy margins during surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of MarginProbe as an adjunct to standard operating procedure (SOP). METHODS: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled for breast conserving surgery were consented for intraoperative use of MarginProbe. Shaved margins were excised based on margin assessment using the surgeon's SOP which included specimen radiography and gross pathologic examination, and feedback from the device. The primary endpoint was re-excision rate. Secondary endpoints included sensitivity, specificity, false-positive and negative rates. RESULTS: Of the 60 breast cancers, initial histologically close/positive margins were identified in 18 patients (30%). The re-excision rate in the overall cohort was 6.6%, compared to a historical re-excision rate of 8.6% (p < 0.01). Based on 360 measurement sites, MarginProbe demonstrated a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 60%, with a positive predictive value of 16%, and of negative predictive value of 94%, which was similar to the accuracy of SOP. CONCLUSIONS: MarginProbe performs equally as well as specimen radiography and gross pathologic examination. In this setting where the baseline re-excision rate was low, the use of MarginProbe as an adjunct to SOP resulted in a small 2% absolute reduction in re-excision rate.","LeeVan, Elyse; Ho, Be Thi; Seto, Sadie; Shen, Jeannie",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,215

501224,Development of pediatric surgical decision-making guidelines for COVID-19 in a New York City children's hospital,2020,"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has crushed daily routines and is still rampaging through the world. Existing solution for nonpharmaceutical interventions usually needs to timely and precisely select a subset of residential urban areas for containment or even quarantine, where the spatial distribution of confirmed cases has been considered as a key criterion for the subset selection. While such containment measure has successfully stopped or slowed down the spread of COVID-19 in some countries, it is criticized for being inefficient or ineffective, as the statistics of confirmed cases are usually time-delayed and coarse-grained. To tackle the issues, we propose C-Watcher, a novel data-driven framework that aims at screening every neighborhood in a target city and predicting infection risks, prior to the spread of COVID-19 from epicenters to the city. In terms of design, C-Watcher collects large-scale long-term human mobility data from Baidu Maps, then characterizes every residential neighborhood in the city using a set of features based on urban mobility patterns. Furthermore, to transfer the firsthand knowledge (witted in epicenters) to the target city before local outbreaks, we adopt a novel adversarial encoder framework to learn""city-invariant""representations from the mobility-related features for precise early detection of high-risk neighborhoods, even before any confirmed cases known, in the target city. We carried out extensive experiments on C-Watcher using the real-data records in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreaks, where the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of C-Watcher for early detection of high-risk neighborhoods from a large number of cities.","Xiao, Congxi; Zhou, Jingbo; Huang, Jizhou; Zhuo, An; Liu, Ji; Xiong, Haoyi; Dou, Dejing",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12169v1.pdf,215

Infants with SARS-CoV-2 were more likely to identify as Hispanic (P = .004), have public insurance or be uninsured (P = .01), exhibited lethargy (P = .02), had feeding difficulties (P = .002), and had lower white blood cell (P = .001), neutrophil (P < .001), and lymphocyte counts (P = .005) than the 81 infants without SARS-CoV-2 infection. None of the infants with SARS-CoV-2 had concurrent serious bacterial infection or detection of another virus. Overall, disease in infants with SARS-CoV-2 was mild. CONCLUSIONS: During the peak of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 was the predominant pathogen among febrile infants. Socioeconomic, historical, and laboratory features differed significantly between infants infected or not infected with SARS-CoV-2. None of the 20 infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection had an identified coviral or serious bacterial infection.","Leibowitz, Jill; Krief, William; Barone, Stephen; Williamson, Kristy A; Goenka, Pratichi K; Rai, Shipra; Moriarty, Shannon; Baodhankar, Prachi; Rubin, Lorry G",J. pediatr.

505109,"1011 Pregnancy affected by COVID-19, patient characteristics and outcomes based on Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)",2021,"BACKGROUND: The dissemination of rumor rebuttal content on social media is vital for rumor control and disease containment during public health crises. Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users' cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users' responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber's impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo's application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals' attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others' tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users' interaction content from three dimensions-sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility-to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users' information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Dandan; Qian, Yuxing",J Med Internet Res,,215
506020,"Like Legos, we are building great things together",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been established as a cause of severe alveolar damage and pneumonia in patients with advanced Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The consolidation of lung parenchyma precipitates the alterations in blood gases in COVID-19 patients that are known to complicate and cause hypoxemic respiratory failure. With SARS-CoV-2 damaging multiple organs in COVID-19, including the central nervous system that regulates the breathing process, it is a daunting task to compute the extent to which the failure of the central regulation of the breathing process contributes to the mortality of COVID-19 affected patients. Emerging data on COVID-19 cases from hospitals and autopsies in the last few months have helped in the understanding of the pathogenesis of respiratory failures in COVID-19. Recent reports have provided overwhelming evidence of the occurrence of acute respiratory failures in COVID-19 due to neurotropism of the brainstem by SARS-CoV-2. In this review, a cascade of events that may follow the alterations in blood gases and possible neurological damage to the respiratory regulation centers in the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID-19 are related to the basic mechanism of respiratory regulation in order to understand the acute respiratory failure reported in this disease. Though a complex metabolic and respiratory dysregulation also occurs with infections caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS that are known to contribute toward deaths of the patients in the past, we highlight here the role of systemic dysregulation and the CNS respiratory regulation mechanisms in the causation of mortalities seen in COVID-19. The invasion of the CNS by SARS-CoV-2, as shown recently in areas like the brainstem that control the normal breathing process with nuclei like the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BÖTC), may explain why some of the patients with COVID-19, who have been reported to have recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation and the occurrences of acute respiratory arrests seen in COVID-19. This debate is important for many reasons, one of which is the fact that permanent damage to the medullary respiratory centers by SARS-CoV-2 would not benefit from mechanical ventilators, as is possibly occurring during the management of COVID-19 patients.","Baig, Abdul Mannan",ACS Chem Neurosci,,215

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: To provide evidence of serum potassium changes in individuals taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) concomitantly with spironolactone compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for studies including exposure to both spironolactone and ACEI/ARB therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. The primary outcome was serum potassium change over time. Main effects were calculated to estimate average treatment effect using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I 2. Risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: From the total of 1,225 articles identified, 20 randomized controlled studies were included in the meta-analysis. The spironolactone plus ACEI/ARB group included 570 patients, while the ACEI/ARB group included 547 patients. Treatment with spironolactone and ACEI/ARB combination therapy compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone increased the mean serum potassium concentration by 0.19 mEq/L (95% CI, 0.12-0.26 mEq/L), with intermediate heterogeneity across studies (Q statistic = 46.5, P = 0.004; I 2 = 59). Sensitivity analyses showed that the direction and magnitude of this outcome did not change with the exclusion of individual studies, indicating a high level of reliability. Reporting risk of bias was low for 16 studies (80%), unclear for 3 studies (15%) and high for 1 study (5%). CONCLUSION: Treatment with spironolactone in combination with ACEI/ARB therapy increases the mean serum potassium concentration by less than 0.20 mEq/L compared to ACEI/ARB therapy alone. However, serum potassium and renal function must be monitored in patients starting combination therapy to avoid changes in serum potassium that could lead to hyperkalemia.","Villa-Zapata, Lorenzo; Carhart, Briggs S; Horn, John R; Hansten, Philip D; Subbian, Vignesh; Gephart, Sheila; Tan, Malinda; Romero, Andrew; Malone, Daniel C",Am. j. health system pharm,,215

511319,Position statement on how to manage patients with diabetes and covid-19,2020,"COVID-19 outbreak poses a severe health emergency to the global community. Due to availability of limited data, the selection of an effective treatment is a challenge. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a chloroquine (CQ) derivative administered for malaria and autoimmune diseases, has been shown to be effective against both Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2. Apart from the known adverse effects of these drugs, recently the use of CQ and HCQ as a potential treatment for COVID-19 is under flux globally. In this study, we focused on identifying a more potent analogue of HCQ and CQ against the spike protein of SAR-CoV-2 that can act as an effective antiviral agent for COVID-19 treatment. Systematic pharmacokinetics, drug-likeness, basicity predictions, virtual screening and molecular dynamics analysis (200 ns) were carried out to predict the inhibition potential of the analogous compounds on the spike protein. This work identifies the six potential analogues, out of which two compounds, namely 1-[1-(6-Chloroquinolin-4-yl) piperidin-4-yl]piperidin-3-ol and (1R,2R)-2-N-(7-Chloroquinolin-4-yl)cyclohexane-1,2-diamine interact with the active site of the spike protein similar to HCQ and CQ respectively with augmented safety profile.","Sinha, Meetali; Gupta, Anshika; Gupta, Shristee; Singh, Prakrity; Pandit, Shraddha; Chauhan, Shweta Singh; Parthasarathi, Ramakrishnan",Comput Biol Med,,215

Those epidemics are global health concerns and as well as serious economic issues. There is certain need to allocate scarce sources efficiently to fight such epidemics in both personal and global dimensions. Here we develop and propose two optimization models to maximize the total protection from any epidemic, pandemic or bioterror attacks; the first one is personal protection model or protocol and the other one is mass protection model that is inspired by the well-known weapon-target assignment problem of operations research. These efforts are optimal allocation of scarce medical and economic resources to save millions of lives- gift of life. We implement our general mathematical programming models with real-world data to fight the coronavirus pandemic for a person and the United States. Our personal protection protocol provides 99.99% protection from COVID-19 for an American through personal strategies when the mass protection model supplies 96.961% protection on average from coronavirus pandemic for the United States through countrywide policies. The mass protection model which recommends general policy frame for health care policy makers could be applied for any epidemic at any level from county to city, to state and country as well as in global scale. The mathematical relation between the personal protection protocol and the mass protection model also highlights the fact of unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno (one for all, all for one) for fighting epidemics- particularly the moving enemy, novel coronavirus which is double invisible due to its viral nature and the availability of the high level of asymptomatic cases. Recognize the enemy, as protecting yourself means protecting people, love life, follow the rules and stay at home.

Our group of clinicians and nurses developed and recorded short video messages to encourage viewers to stay home for the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays. We then conducted a two-stage clustered randomized controlled trial in 820 counties (covering 13 States) in the United States of a large-scale Facebook ad campaign disseminating these messages. In the first level of randomization, we randomly divided the counties into two groups: high intensity and low intensity. In the second level, we randomly assigned zip codes to either treatment or control such that 75% of zip codes in high intensity counties received the treatment, while 25% of zip codes in low intensity counties received the treatment. In each treated zip code, we sent the ad to as many Facebook subscribers as possible (11,954,109 users received at least one ad at Thanksgiving and 23,302,290 users received at least one ad at Christmas). The first primary outcome was aggregate holiday travel, measured using mobile phone location data, available at the county level: we find that average distance travelled in high-intensity counties decreased by -0.993 percentage points (95% CI -1.616, -0.371, p-value 0.002) the three days before each holiday. The second primary outcome was COVID-19 infection at the zip-code level: COVID-19 infections recorded in the two-week period starting five days post-holiday declined by 3.5 percent (adjusted 95% CI [-6.2 percent, -0.7 percent], p-value 0.013) in intervention zip codes compared to control zip codes.","Breza, Emily; Stanford, Fatima Cody; Alsan, Marcela; D., M.; Alsan, Burak; Banerjee, Abhijit; Chandrasekhar, Arun G.; Eichmeyer, Sarah; Glushko, Traci; Goldsmith-Pinkham, Paul; Holland, Kelly; Hoppe, Emily; Karnani, Mohit; Liegl, Sarah; Loisel, Tristan; Ogbu-Nwobodo, Lucy; Torres, Benjamin A.

METHODS: The trial (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04388514) was conducted in four different Italian centers (April-October 2020). Patients were treated according to best available standard of care (SoC) therapy, with or without O3-autohemotherapy (O3-AHT). RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were enrolled: SoC + O3-AHT (48 patients) were compared to the SoC treatment (44 patients). The two groups differed in steroids therapy administration (72.7% in SoC arm vs. 50.0% in O3-AHT arm; p = 0.044). Steroid therapy was routinely started when it was subsequently deemed as effective for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. No significant differences in mortality rates, length of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation requirement and ICU admission were observed. Clinical improvement in patients with pneumonia was assessed according to a specifically designed score (decrease in SIMEU class, improvement in radiology imaging, improvement in PaO2/FiO2, reduction in LDH and requirement of oxygen therapy &#8804; 5 days). Score assessment was performed on day-3 (T3) and day-7 (TEnd) of O3-AHT treatment. A significant increase in the score was reported at TEnd, in the O3-AHT treatment arm (0 [0-1] in the SoC arm vs. 2 [1-3] the O3-AHT arm; p = 0.018). No adverse events related O3-AHT treatment was observed. CONCLUSION: In mild-to-moderate pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2, adjuvant oxygen/ozone therapy did not show any effect on mortality, or mechanical intubation but show a clinical improvement a day 7 from randomization in a composite clinical endpoint. Larger Randomized prospective studies alone or in combination with steroids are needed to confirm our results.","Sozio, Emanuela; De Monte, Amato; Sermann, Giovanni; Bassi, Flavio; Sacchet, Davide; Sbrana, Francesco; Ripoli, Andrea; Curcio, Francesco; Fabris, Martina; Marengo, Stefania; Italiani, Daniele; Luciana Boccalatte-Rosa, Daniela; Tascini, Carlo",Int Immunopharmacol,,215
515766,Comparative Retrospective Open-label Study of Ayurvedic Medicines and Their Combination with Allopathic Drugs on Asymptomatic and Mildly-symptomatic COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Partial differential equation (PDE) models and their associated variational energy formulations are often rotationally invariant by design. This ensures that a rotation of the input results in a corresponding rotation of the output, which is desirable in applications such as image analysis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not share this property, and existing remedies are often complex. The goal of our paper is to investigate how diffusion and variational models achieve rotation invariance and transfer these ideas to neural networks. As a core novelty we propose activation functions which couple network channels by combining information from several oriented filters. This guarantees rotation invariance within the basic building blocks of the networks while still allowing for directional filtering. The resulting neural architectures are inherently rotationally invariant. With only a few small filters, they can achieve the same invariance as existing techniques which require a fine-grained sampling of orientations. Our findings help to translate diffusion and variational models into mathematically well-founded network architectures, and provide novel concepts for model-based CNN design.","Alt, Tobias; Schrader, Karl; Weickert, Joachim; Peter, Pascal; Augustin, Matthias",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13993v1.pdf,215

METHODS: Results of an observational assessment of operational and clinical pharmacy services at a community teaching hospital during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. Service outcomes of the inpatient pharmacy were evaluated from February 1 to April 8, 2020. Outcomes during the weeks preceding the first COVID-19 admission (February 1 to March 11, 2020) and during the pandemic period (March 12 to April 8, 2020) were compared. Evaluated outcomes included daily order verifications, clinical interventions, and usage of relevant medications. An exploratory statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t test. RESULTS: During the pandemic period, the number of new order verifications decreased from approximately 5,000 orders per day to 3,300 orders per day (P < 0.01), a reduction of 30% during the first 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to the weeks prior. Average daily pharmacokinetic dosing consults were reduced in the pandemic period (from 82 to 67; P < 0.01) compared to the prepandemic period; however, total daily pharmacist interventions did not differ significantly (473 vs 456; P = 0.68). Dispensing of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, enoxaparin, and sedative medications increased substantially during the pandemic period (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: The operational and clinical requirements of an inpatient pharmacy department shifted considerably during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacy departments must be adaptable in order to continue to provide effective pharmaceutical care during the pandemic.","McConachie, Sean; Martirosov, Dmitriy; Wang, Bryan; Desai, Neha; Jarjosa, Sabrina; Hsaiky, Lama",Am. j. health system pharm,,215

519624,800 Does delivery affect time to recovery in COVID-19-related ARDS during pregnancy?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic valve placement constitutes an effective endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) therapy in patients with severe emphysema and low collateral ventilation. After occluding the most destroyed lobe with valves, significant target lobe volume reduction leads to improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. In some patients, the effects are not consistent leading to long-term therapy failure. We hypothesized that surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) would re-establish ELVR short-term clinical improvements following ELVR long-term failure. METHODS: In this retrospective single-center analysis, we included all patients who underwent consolidating lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) by lobectomy after long-term failure of valve therapy between 2010 and 2015. Changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), residual volume (RV), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score (mMRC) 90 days after ELVR and LVRS were analyzed, and the outcomes of both procedures were compared. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients underwent LVRS after ELVR failure. In the majority (90%), a lower lobectomy was performed. The 30-day mortality of the cohort was 0% and 90-day mortality 5% (1/20). The remaining 19 patients showed a significant increase in FEV1 (+27.5 ± 19.4%) and reduction in RV (-21.0 ± 17.4%) and TLC (-11.1 ± 11.1%). This resulted in significant improvements in exercise tolerance (6MWD: +56 ± 60 m) and relief of dyspnea (&#916;mMRC: -1.8 ± 1.4 pts.). CONCLUSIONS: Consolidating LVRS by lobectomy after failure of previously successful ELVR is feasible and results in significant symptom relief and improvement of lung function.","Eichhorn, Martin E; Gompelmann, Daniela; Hoffmann, Hans; Dreher, Sascha; Hornemann, Katrin; Haag, Johannes; Kontogianni, Konstantina; Heussel, Claus P; Winter, Hauke; Herth, Felix J F; Eberhardt, Ralf",Ann. thorac. surg,,215

520162,Oncology patients' perceptions of and experiences with COVID-19,2020,"Importance: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, yet many individuals with OUD do not receive treatment. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of OUD treatments and association of these treatments with outcomes in the US. Design and Setting: This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis included a US population with OUD. Interventions: Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine, methadone, or injectable extended-release naltrexone; psychotherapy (beyond standard counseling); overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND); and contingency management (CM). Main Outcomes and Measures: Fatal and nonfatal overdoses and deaths throughout 5 years, discounted lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. Results: In the base case, in the absence of treatment, 42 717 overdoses (4132 fatal, 38 585 nonfatal) and 12 660 deaths were estimated to occur in a cohort of 100 000 patients over 5 years, and 11.58 discounted lifetime QALYs were estimated to be experienced per person. An estimated reduction in overdoses was associated with MAT with methadone (10.7%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (22.0%), and when combined with CM and psychotherapy (range, 21.0%-31.4%). Estimated deceased deaths were associated with MAT with methadone (6%), MAT with buprenorphine or naltrexone (13.9%), and when combined with CM, OEND, and psychotherapy (16.9%). MAT yielded discounted gains of 1.02 to 1.07 QALYs per person. Including only health care sector costs, methadone cost $16â¯000/QALY gained compared with no treatment, followed by methadone with OEND ($22â¯000/QALY gained), then by buprenorphine with OEND and CM ($42â¯000/QALY gained), and then by buprenorphine with OEND, CM, and psychotherapy ($250â¯000/QALY gained). MAT with naltrexone was dominated by other treatment alternatives. When criminal justice costs were included, all forms of MAT (with buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone) were associated with cost savings compared with no treatment, yielding savings of $25â¯000 to $105â¯000 in lifetime costs per person. The largest cost savings were associated with methadone plus CM. Results were qualitatively unchanged over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. An analysis using demographic and cost data for Veterans Health Administration patients yielded similar findings. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, expanded access to MAT, combined with OEND and CM, was associated with cost-saving reductions in morbidity and mortality from OUD. Lack of widespread MAT availability limits access to a cost-saving medical intervention that reduces morbidity and mortality from OUD. Opioid overdoses in the US likely reached a record high in 2020 because of COVID-19 increasing substance use, exacerbating stress and social isolation, and interfering with opioid treatment. It is essential to understand the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of MAT to treat OUD.","Fairley, Michael; Humphreys, Keith; Joyce, Vilija R; Bounthavong, Mark; Trafton, Jodie; Combs, Ann; Oliva, Elizabeth M; Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D; Asch, Steven M; Brandeau, Margaret L; Owens, Douglas K","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

In this work, the spread of Covid-19 is modelled as a differentiable game between the planner and population with appropriate disease spread dynamical equations. We first characterise the equilibrium dynamics of only the population with modifed Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) equations to highlight the qualitative nature of the equilbrium. Using this result, we formulate the joint equilibrium exposure profile between the planner and population. Additionally, as in case of Covid-19, the role of asymptomatic carriers, inadequacies in testing, contact tracing and quarantining can lead to a significant underestimate of the true infected numbers as compared to just the detected numbers. Therefore, it is vital to model the true infected numbers within the context of choices made by individuals within the population. To incorporate this, we extend our framework by modifying the dynamics to include additional sub-compartments of `undetected infected' and `detected infected' in the disease dynamics. The individuals make their own estimates of the total infected from the detected numbers and base their strategies on those estimates. We show that these considerations lead to a retarded optimal control problem for the players. We present some simulation results based on these results to demonstrate how population behavior, planner control, detection rates and trust in the reported numbers play a key role in how the disease spreads.","Vijayan, Sushant",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13175v2.pdf,215

METHODS: A retrospective review of the first adult elective cases performed between May 18, 2020 and June 14, 2020, after the end of lockdown was analysed in Belgium to answer the following questions: (1) for the 236 cancelled patients during the outbreak, how easy was rescheduling? (2) How useful was universal RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan for the 211 orthopaedic and trauma admissions? (3) How were surgical difficulty category, number of operations and complications different when compared to the pre-COVID period? (4) How would patients balance the benefit of surgery against the unknown risk of developing COVID-19? RESULTS: Before surgery, blood tests for anaesthesiology and imaging related to the surgical procedure were scheduled prior to universal testing (COVID-19 PCR and chest CT) performed 72–120 hours before surgery. Among the 211 asymptomatic patients who were tested before surgery, six had positive PCR, while no abnormality was found on the chest CT scan of all the patients. With this timing for tests, the 104 patients included in the current study for elective surgery were free of disease before undergoing surgery and remained without COVID-19 after surgery. Among the 366 cancelled patients during the outbreak, only 12% of the patients accepted to proceed with rescheduling immediately. Therefore, this resulted in a 70% reduction for elective surgery and in a 50% reduction for arthroplasties as compared to pre-COVID period. The rate of complications was not increased during the post-COVID period. A portion of patients have confused idea of screening and have difficulty to perceive the new rules of health organization. CONCLUSIONS: Resumption of elective surgical procedures appears more difficult for patients than for surgeons with a low percentage of cancelled patients accepting to reschedule surgery. Universal testing allowed securing patients; however, surgeons must explore better patient perceptions regarding COVID-19 to facilitate a fully informed decision in the current period.","Hernigou, Jacques; Valcarenghi, Jérome; Safar, Adonis; Ferchichi, Mohamed Amine; Chahidi, Esfandiar; Jennart, Harold; Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04728-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683461/,215

This systematic review has studied the initial epidemiological models. METHODS: Articles published from January to June 2020 were extracted from databases using search strings and those peer-reviewed with full text in English were included in the study. They were analysed as to whether they made definite predictions in terms of time and numbers, or contained only mathematical assumptions and open-ended predictions. Factors such as early vs. late prediction models, long-term vs. curve-fitting models and comparisons based on modelling techniques were analysed in detail. RESULTS: Among 56,922 hits in 05 databases, screening yielded 434 abstracts, of which 72 articles were included. Predictive models comprised over 70% (51/72) of the articles, with susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered (SEIR) being the commonest type (mean duration of prediction being 3 months). Common predictions were regarding cumulative cases (44/72, 61.1%), time to reach total numbers (41/72, 56.9%), peak numbers (22/72, 30.5%), time to peak (24/72, 33.3%), hospital utilisation (7/72, 9.7%) and effect of lockdown and NPIs (50/72, 69.4%). The commonest countries for which models were predicted were China followed by USA, South Korea, Japan and India. Models were published by various professionals including Engineers (12.5%), Mathematicians (9.7%), Epidemiologists (11.1%) and Physicians (9.7%) with a third (32.9%) being the result of collaborative efforts between two or more professions. CONCLUSION: There was a wide diversity in the type of models, duration of prediction and the variable that they predicted, with SEIR model being the commonest type.","Shankar, Subramanian; Mohakuda, Sourya Sourabh; Kumar, Ankit; Nazneen, P.S.; Yadav, Arun Kumar; Chatterjee, Kaushik; Chatterjee, Kaustuv",Med J Armed Forces India,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0377123721001258; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377123721001258; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mjafi.2021.05.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34334908/,215

Animals, and wild animals in particular, are considered to be the source of more than 70% of all emerging infections in humans. Two zoonotic influenza viruses that successfully spread from animals to humans are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus, originating from poultry, and pandemic H1N1 influenza (pH1N1) virus, thought to originate from domestic swine. In this review, we discuss our research on the host species barrier for these viruses, concentrating on three questions: how does HPAI H5N1 virus transmit from birds to humans; what are the within-host dynamics of HPAI H5N1 virus and pH1N1 virus in humans and other mammals; and what determines transmission of influenza viruses among humans. To contain and eradicate zoonotic influenza viruses requires not only strategic virus surveillance of both animal and human populations, but also a better understanding of the hurdles that such a virus needs to jump over in order to cross the species barrier and cause a human pandemic. Advances in these two areas will allow us to better predict the risk of emergence of zoonotic influenza viruses in the human population.","Kuiken, Thijs; Fouchier, Ron; Rimmelzwaan, Guus; van den Brand, Judith; van Riel, Debby; Osterhaus, Albert",Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children VIII,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-0204-6_6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125035/,215

METHODS: Primary care givers of children with CF and PCD aged 3–16 years were asked to enrol in the study. Primary care givers of TD children were included as control group. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) was used, and questions related to sleep habits during the pandemic were asked. Results of the three groups were compared. RESULTS: Primary care givers of 33 children with CF, 16 children with PCD and 66 TD children were included in the study. There were no differences in terms of age and gender between the three groups. Changes in sleep patterns during the pandemic were more common among TD children and their families, with 75% of the children and 80% of their families sleeping later than before. The sleep initiation and maintenance disorder scores were higher in TD children (P = 0.001), whereas the sleep breathing disorder scores were higher in children with PCD (P = 0.001), and the sleep hyperhidrosis scores were higher in children with CF and PCD (P = 0.011). No relationships were found between sleep parameters and clinical findings of children with lung disease. CONCLUSIONS: Children's sleep habits have changed during the pandemic.

For this purpose, first, graphitic carbon nitride and (gC(3)N(4)) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots were fabricated and characterized. After that, gC(3)N(4) and CdS were mixed well. The fabricated nanomaterials were characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy. Then, the CdS QDs-gC(3)N(4) nanocomposite was added to the solution containing chitosan as an amine-rich polymer to generate a Chitosan/CdS-gC(3)N(4) nanocomposite. Subsequently, the surface of the ITO electrode was modified with Chitosan/CdS-gC(3)N(4). After that, the amine-terminal aptamer probes were immobilized on the surface of the Chitosan/CdS QDs-gC(3)N(4)/ITO electrode by using glutaraldehyde as an amine-amine crosslinker. The electrochemical performances of the electrodes were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and photo-electrochemistry (PEC). The surface coverage of the immobilized aptamer probe was founded to be 26.2 pmol.cm(−2). The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed photo-electrochemical aptasensor can be used for the measurement of Sars-Cov-2 RBD within 0.5−32.0 nM. The limit of detection (LOD) was obtained to be 0.12 nM (at 3σ/slope). The affinity of the Aptamer/Chitosan/CdS QDs-gC(3)N(4)/ITO was also founded to be 3.4 nM by using Langmuir-typical adsorption systems. The proposed photo-electrochemical aptasensor was applied for the measurement of the spiked Sars-Cov-2 RBD in human saliva samples at two concentrations.

METHODS: We examined 3115 hospital discharges to a national cohort of 1068 adult care homes and subsequent outbreaks of COVID‐19 occurring between 22 February and 27 June 2020. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the impact of time‐dependent exposure to hospital discharge on incidence of the first known outbreak, over a window of 7‐21 days after discharge, and adjusted for care home characteristics, including size and type of provision. RESULTS: A total of 330 homes experienced an outbreak, and 544 homes received a discharge over the study period. Exposure to hospital discharge was not associated with a significant increase in the risk of a new outbreak (hazard ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.89, 1.47, P = .29) after adjusting for care home characteristics. Care home size was the most significant predictor. Hazard ratios (95% CI) in comparison with homes of <10 residents were as follows: 3.40 (1.99, 5.80) for 10‐24 residents; 8.25 (4.93, 13.81) for 25‐49 residents; and 17.35 (9.65, 31.19) for 50+ residents. When stratified for care home size, the outbreak rates were similar for periods when homes were exposed to a hospital discharge, in comparison with periods when homes were unexposed. CONCLUSION: Our analyses showed that large homes were at considerably greater risk of outbreaks throughout the epidemic, and after adjusting for care home size, a discharge from hospital was not associated with a significant increase in risk.","Emmerson, Chris; Adamson, James P.; Turner, Drew; Gravenor, Mike B.; Salmon, Jane; Cottrell, Simon; Middleton, Victoria; Thomas, Buffy; Mason, Brendan W.; Williams, Chris J.",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547872/; https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12831,215

Virtual training programs that support providers in caring for the physical and mental health needs of this population, as well provide psychological support to the providers themselves, are needed during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the design, delivery, and evaluation of a virtual educational COVID-19-focused Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program to support providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in caring for the mental health of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. METHODS: A rapid design thinking approach was used to develop a 6-session program that incorporates mindfulness practice, a wellness check, COVID-19-related research and policy updates, a didactic presentation on a combination mental health and COVID-19 related topic, and a case-based discussion to encourage practical learning. We used the first 5 outcome levels of Moore's evaluation framework-focusing on participation, satisfaction, learning, self-efficacy, and change in practice-which were rated (out of 5) by care providers from health and disability service sectors, as well as additional reflection measures about innovations to the program. Qualitative feedback from open-text responses from participants were analyzed using modified manifest content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 104 care providers from health and disability service sectors participated in the program. High levels of engagement (81 participants per session on average) and satisfaction (overall satisfaction score: mean 4.31, SD 0.17) were observed. Self-efficacy (score improvement: 19.8%), support, and coping improved. Participants also rated the newly developed COVID-19 program and its innovative components highly. Open text feedback showed participants felt that the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program expanded their knowledge and competency and created a sense of being part of a community of practice; provided value for the COVID-19 innovations; supported resource-sharing within and beyond program participants; and facilitated changes to participants' approaches to client care in practice and increased participants' confidence in supporting clients and families. CONCLUSIONS: The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes program is an effective model for capacity-building programs with a shared-learning approach.

595586,Eye Movement Abnormalities in Major Depressive Disorder,2021-08-10,"There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of “financialisation” to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive “business models”, including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.","Robinson, Jennifer; Harrison, Philip; Shen, Jie; Wu, Fulong",Prog Plann,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305900620300349; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.progress.2020.100513; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305900620300349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041436/,215

The first manufacturer-independent head-to-head comparison of two rapid high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassays targeting total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies against two different viral proteins, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S) (Roche Diagnostics), was performed in a routine setting during the exponential growth phase of the epidemic’s second wave. METHODS: The diagnostic specificity of Elecsys-N and Elecsys-S was initially evaluated on a panel of 572 pre-COVID-19 samples, showing 100% specificity of both assays. Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison used 3,416 consecutive blood samples from individuals that were tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 within commercial out-of-pocket serologic testing. RESULTS: Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed overall agreement of 98.68% (3,371/3,416; 95% CI, 98.23–99.03%), positive agreement of 95.16% (884/929; 95% CI, 93.52–96.41%), and a high kappa value of 0.996 (95% CI, 0.956–0.976).

CONCLUSION: The first Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S head-to-head comparison showed excellent agreement of two highly specific and rapid high-throughput automated anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. An important question is whether laboratories offering two different antibody assays could benefit from combining the assays; if so, should use be concomitant or sequential—and, in the latter case, in which order?

This paper focuses on a review of the available literature on the production of filaments for 3D printers from recycled polymers as the alternative to present approach of central selective collection of plastics. The possibility of recycling of basic thermoplastic materials and the impact of processing on their physicochemical and mechanical properties were verified (Lanzotti et al. 2019).

A therapeutic drug that is effective against FIP has not yet been developed. Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. In the present study, we synthesized 30 overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, and investigated their inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of poorly replicative type I FIPV. The efficiency of type I FIPV infection was increased by diluting the virus with medium containing a polycation. Of the 30 peptides, I-S1-8 (S461-S480), I-S1-9 (S471-S490), I-S1-10 (S481-S500), I-S1-16 (S541-S560), and I-S1-22 (S601-S620) significantly decreased the infectivity of FIPV strain KU-2 while I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 exhibited marked inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. The inhibitory effects on FIPV infection of these 2 peptides on other type I and type II FIPV strains, feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) were also examined. These 2 peptides specifically inhibited type I and type II FIPV, but did FHV or FCV infection.

It also evaluated the feasibility of the recruitment and study procedures; (2) Methods: From 45 participants recruited, 39 were allocated (mean age 65.31; 43.59% men) to PD-NC, PD-MCI and CG (13 per group). To assess attention, we used three tasks from the ROtman–Baycrest Battery for Investigating Attention: Simple Reaction time (RT), Choice RT, and Prepare RT. We conducted a mixed-model analysis of variance with a 3 (groups) × 4 (tasks) design to compare reaction times; (3) Results: PD-MCI had slower reaction times than PD-NC (p = 0.028) and the CG (p = 0.052); there was no difference between PD-NC and CG. PD-MCI might perform worse on monitoring tasks than PD-NC, Z = −1.68, p = 0.092.

600790,Description and functional outcomes of a novel interdisciplinary rehabilitation program for hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2021,"In order to investigate the functional and structural properties of cationic α-helical peptides in two different membranes, we studied the 20-residue peptide maximin H6 in two membrane-mimetic systems by NMR spectroscopy using partially (15)N-labeled peptide and paramagnetic relaxation enhancements. Maximin H6, which is found in skin secretions of frogs of the Bombinae family, attacks gram-negative bacteria and acts haemolytically. While the peptide spontaneously folds into similar structures in both neutral dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) and negatively charged sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles, its structure is more flexible in SDS as shown by (15)N relaxation measurements. In addition, it is bound closer to the surface of the micelle and rotated by ∼70° around its helix axis in the negatively charged membrane surrogate compared to the structure in DPC. This might form the basis for peptide–peptide interactions through a GxxxG motif, which could finally lead to membrane disruption and, thus, preferential attack of negatively charged microbial cell walls.","Kosol, Simone; Zangger, Klaus",J Struct Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847709003530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20045466/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2009.12.026; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1047847709003530,215

Despite this great potential and nearly 50 years of research, it is only recently that RBC-mediated drug delivery has begun to move out of the academic lab and into industrial drug development. RBC loading with drugs can be performed in several ways—either via encapsulation within the RBC or surface coupling, and either ex vivo or in vivo—depending on the intended application. In this review, we briefly summarize currently used technologies for RBC loading/coupling with an eye on how pharmacokinetics is impacted. Additionally, we provide a detailed description of key ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) changes that would be expected for RBC-associated drugs and address unique features of RBC pharmacokinetics. As thorough understanding of pharmacokinetics is critical in successful translation to the clinic, we expect that this review will provide a jumping off point for further investigations into this area.","Glassman, Patrick M.; Villa, Carlos H.; Ukidve, Anvay; Zhao, Zongmin; Smith, Paige; Mitragotri, Samir; Russell, Alan J.; Brenner, Jacob S.; Muzykantov, Vladimir R.",Pharmaceutics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32397513/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics12050440,215

The design (referred to as Pneumask) consists of a custom snorkel-specific adapter that couples the snorkel-port of the mask to a rated filter (either a medical-grade ventilator inline filter or an industrial filter). This design has been tested for the sealing capability of the mask, filter performance, CO2 buildup and clinical usability. These tests found the Pneumask capable of forming a seal that exceeds the standards required for half-face respirators or N95 respirators. Filter testing indicates a range of options with varying performance depending on the quality of filter selected, but with typical filter performance exceeding or comparable to the N95 standard. CO2 buildup was found to be roughly equivalent to levels found in half-face elastomeric respirators in literature. Clinical usability tests indicate sufficient visibility and, while speaking is somewhat muffled, this can be addressed via amplification (Bluetooth voice relay to cell phone speakers through an app) in noisy environments. We present guidance on the assembly, usage (donning and doffing) and decontamination protocols. The benefit of the Pneumask as PPE is that it is reusable for longer periods than typical disposable N95 respirators, as the snorkel mask can withstand rigorous decontamination protocols (that are standard to regular elastomeric respirators). With the dire worldwide shortage of PPE for medical personnel, our conclusions on the performance and efficacy of Pneumask as an N95-alternative technology are cautiously optimistic.","Kroo, Laurel; Kothari, Anesta; Hannebelle, Melanie; Herring, George; Pollina, Thibaut; Chang, Ray; Peralta, Dominic; Banavar, Samhita P.; Flaum, Eliott; Soto-Montoya, Hazel; Li, Hongquan; Combes, Kyle; Pan, Emma; Vu, Khang; Yen, Kelly; Dale, James; Kolbay, Patrick; Ellgas, Simon; Konte, Rebecca; Hajian, Rozhin; Zhong, Grace; Jacobs, Noah; Jain, Amit; Kober, Filip; Ayala, Gerry; Allinne, Quentin; Cucinelli, Nicholas; Kasper, Dave; Borroni, Luca; Gerber, Patrick; Venook, Ross; Baek, Peter; Arora, Nitin; Wagner, Philip; Miki, Roberto; Kohn, Jocelyne; Kohn Bitran, David; Pearson, John; Arias-Arco, Beatriz; Larrainzar-Garijo, Ricardo; Herrera, Cristián Muñiz; Prakash, Manu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439902/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244422,215

Transmission dynamics models are well suited to address infectious disease scenarios that do not conform to these assumptions. For example, these models easily account for changes in the incidence rates of infection as the proportions of susceptible and infectious persons change in the population. Fundamental concepts relating to these methods, such as the basic reproductive number, the effective reproductive number and the susceptible-infected-recovered compartmental models, are reviewed. In addition, comparisons and contrasts are made between the following concepts: microparasites and macroparasites, deterministic and stochastic models, difference and differential equations and homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing patterns.

The British SmPC for the BNT162b2 vaccine already includes reference to a contraindication for use in individuals who have had an allergic reaction to the vaccine or any of its components. As a precautionary measure, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued interim guidance to the NHS not to vaccinate in principle in “patients with severe allergies”. Allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare, but vaccine components are known to cause allergic reactions. BNT162b2 is a vaccine based on an mRNA embedded in lipid nanoparticles and blended with other substances to enable its transport into the cells. In the pivotal phase III clinical trial, the BNT162b2 vaccine was generally well tolerated, but this large clinical trial, used to support vaccine approval by the MHRA and US Food and Drug Administration, excluded individuals with a “history of a severe adverse reaction related to the vaccine and/or a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to a component of the study medication”. Vaccines are recognized as one of the most effective public health interventions. This repeated administration of a foreign protein (antigen) necessitates a careful allergological history before each application and diagnostic clarification and a risk–benefit assessment before each injection. Severe allergic reactions to vaccines are rare but can be life-threatening, and it is prudent to raise awareness of this hazard among vaccination teams and to take adequate precautions while more experience is gained with this new vaccine.","Klimek, Ludger; Novak, Natalija; Hamelmann, Eckard; Werfel, Thomas; Wagenmann, Martin; Taube, Christian; Bauer, Andrea; Merk, Hans; Rabe, Uta; Jung, Kirsten; Schlenter, Wolfgang; Ring, Johannes; Chaker, Adam; Wehrmann, Wolfgang; Becker, Sven; Mülleneisen, Norbert; Nemat, Katja; Czech, Wolfgang; Wrede, Holger; Brehler, Randolf; Fuchs, Thomas; Jakob, Thilo; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian M.; Gerstlauer, Michael; Vogelberg, Christian; Zuberbier, Thomas; Hartmann, Karin; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40629-020-00160-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33643776/,215

Anonymous health databases were used as source of information to identify persons with 14 chronic conditions. From laboratory records we assessed the likelihood of real‐time reverse‐transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and the frequency of positivity from February 29 to April 19, 2020, i.e., 7 weeks from the first case detected in the study area. Sex and age-stratified proportions were calculated in comorbidity subgroups. Multivariate regression was used to adjust for confounders. In the province, 236,623 persons had ≥1 chronic condition; 869 had positive tests. Persons with comorbidities were tested more than the others. However, most chronic conditions were not significantly associated with the prevalence of positivity, except psychiatric and neurological diseases and diabetes. In conclusion, despite more frequent testing, patients with most chronic diseases where equally likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 as the general population.

We evaluated the stability of flocked swabs inoculated with SARS-CoV-2-containing specimen incubated dry (i.e. without transport medium) at room temperature. METHODS: A pool of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimen was used to inoculate flocked swabs. Five swabs were placed immediately into UTM following inoculation, and tested immediately (day 0). Fifteen of the swabs were placed into sterile 15 mL conical tubes and incubated at room temperature for one, two, or seven days. Following incubation, swabs were hydrated in separate vials of UTM and tested. This protocol was repeated for viral transport media (VTM) and saline. As a comparison, a series of swabs was prepared and tested in parallel, but stored in the corresponding liquid transport media (UTM, VTM, or saline) and incubated at room temperature. Testing was performed at 1, 2, and 7 days post inoculation in duplicate. All molecular testing was performed using the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay. RESULTS: All dry swabs tested at days 1, 2, and 7 provided results that were within two cycle thresholds (Cts) of the average Ct values for swabs hydrated in the same media and tested on day 0. There was no statistical difference in Ct values between swabs incubated in liquid media versus dry swabs incubated at room temperature prior to hydration in liquid media. CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of “dry swabs” may simplify specimen collection, negate the need for liquid transport media, and mitigate safety risks while preserving the accuracy of testing.","Parikh, Bijal A; Wallace, Meghan A; McCune, Broc T; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Anderson, Neil W",J Appl Lab Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/jalm/jfab010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630059/,215

Thanks to the accelerated development of anti–SARS-SoV-2 vaccines in less than a year since the start of the global pandemic, patients with cancer were quickly prioritised in early 2021 for vaccination, however dependent on the very unequal availability at the global level. Impaired immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in immunocompromised patients was rapidly reported as early as April 2021, although the vaccination fortunately appears to be generally effective without increasing the spacing. Worryingly, the humoral response of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is, however, considered insufficient in patients followed for HM, in particular when they are on anti-CD20 treatment. Thus, improving vaccination coverage by strengthening immune stimulation should be evaluated in patients under active treatment against cancer. Here, we discuss three different approaches: a third dose of early vaccine (repeated immune stimulation), heterologous prime-boost vaccination (multimodal immune stimulation) and a double-dose strategy (maximisation of immune response). Dedicated therapeutic trials, currently almost non-existent, seem rapidly necessary.","Barrière, Jérôme; Re, Daniel; Peyrade, Frédéric; Carles, Michel",Eur J Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2021.06.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0959804921003725; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804921003725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34243079/,215

De multiples produits de synthèse sont désormais accessibles via internet : associé à la créativité des chimistes cela a participé à l'émergence de pratiques inédites allant du chemsex au purple drank. Les conduites addictives résultent d’un ensemble de facteurs individuels (vulnérabilités biologique et psychique) et contextuels (disponibilité et banalisation du toxique dans l’environnement). Les pathologies mentales autres sont des facteurs de vulnérabilité à la pathologie addictive, tout comme les conduites addictives peuvent révéler une pathologie émotionnelle ou psychotique. Le médecin se doit d’entendre l’impuissance du malade face au besoin irrépressible de consommer (craving) et proposer une thérapeutique qui peut être chimique (y compris traitement de substitution) et psychologique. Dans la majorité des cas un accompagnement social s’impose pour corriger les effets désocialisants du trouble de l’usage de substances ou des comportements addictifs. Abstract Despite the frequency of psychiatric comorbidities, substance use disorder must be understood as an autonomous pathology due to its own determinants, semiology and possibilities of evolution, either spontaneous or under treatment. The ease of access to multiple synthetic products via the Internet combined with the creativity of chemists are contributing to the emergence of novel practices ranging from chemsex to purple drank. Addictive behaviours result from a combination of individual factors (biological and psychological vulnerability) and contextual factors (availability and triviality of the toxicant in the environment). Other mental disorders are factors of vulnerability to addictive pathology as well as the addictive behaviours can reveal an emotional or psychotic pathology. The physician needs to hear the patient powerlessness hidden behind the craving and propose a therapy that may be chemical (including substitution treatment) and psychological. Most of the time, social support is necessary to correct the desocializing effects of substance use disorder or addictive behaviours.","Lucet, C.; Olié, J.

Spatial dynamics of the fatal zoonotic disease rabies among countries of the Middle East and surrounding regions is poorly understood. An improved understanding of virus distribution is necessary to direct control methods. Previous studies have suggested regular trans-boundary movement, but have been unable to infer direction. Here we address these issues, by investigating the evolution of 183 rabies virus isolates collected from over 20 countries between 1972 and 2014. We have undertaken a discrete phylogeographic analysis on a subset of 139 samples to infer where and when movements of rabies have occurred. We provide evidence for four genetically distinct clades with separate origins currently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. Introductions of these viruses have been followed by regular and multidirectional trans-boundary movements in some parts of the region, but relative isolation in others. There is evidence for minimal regular incursion of rabies from Central and Eastern Asia. These data support current initiatives for regional collaboration that are essential for rabies elimination.","Horton, Daniel L.; McElhinney, Lorraine M.; Freuling, Conrad M.; Marston, Denise A.; Banyard, Ashley C.; Goharrriz, Hooman; Wise, Emma; Breed, Andrew C.; Saturday, Greg; Kolodziejek, Jolanta; Zilahi, Erika; Al-Kobaisi, Muhannad F.; Nowotny, Norbert; Mueller, Thomas; Fooks, Anthony R.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811659/,215

We estimate the effectiveness of NPIs, ranging from limiting gathering sizes, business closures, and closure of educational institutions to stay-at-home orders. To do so, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that links NPI implementation dates to national case and death counts and supported the results with extensive empirical validation. Closing all educational institutions, limiting gatherings to 10 people or less, and closing face-to-face businesses each reduced transmission considerably.

A distribution dynamics approach is employed to reveal the trend and movement of disposable income per capita in each city before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the period when the COVID-19 was under the control. The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents. It also highlights the importance of stringent social distancing policies in containing the spread of virus in a short time and calls for special policy attention for rural regions in the recovery from the COVID-19.","Shen, Jianfu; Shum, Wai Yan; Cheong, Tsun Se; Wang, Lafang",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.687152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046393/,215

During the ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there have been increasing reports of bacterial and fungal co-infections occurring in COVID-19 patients, including COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We describe a case of mucormycosis occurring after COVID-19, in an individual who received a recent heart transplant for severe heart failure. Two months after heart transplant, our patient developed upper respiratory and systemic symptoms and was diagnosed with COVID-19. He was managed with convalescent plasma therapy and supportive care. Approximately three months after COVID-19 diagnosis, he developed cutaneous mucormycosis at an old intravascular device site. He underwent extensive surgical interventions, combined with broad-spectrum antifungal therapy. Despite the aggressive therapeutic measures, he died after a prolonged hospital stay. In this case report, we also review the prior well-reported cases of mucormycosis occurring in COVID-19 patients and discuss potential mechanisms by which COVID-19 may predispose to IFIs. Similar to CAPA, mucormycosis with COVID-19 may need to be evaluated as an emerging disease association.

However, the binding affinity of the pangolin ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 RBD was later on reported to be low. Here, we provide evidence that the pangolin is not the intermediate animal at the origin of the human pandemic. Moreover, data available do not fit with the spillover model currently proposed for zoonotic emergence which is thus unlikely to account for this outbreak.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records. SUBJECTS: Eyes prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device across 4 retinal practices in the USA. METHODS: Usage information was collected from the online ForeseeHome portal for all eyes prescribed. For a pre-determined subset of eyes, additional clinical information was collected through chart review and analyzed for clinical utility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures include frequency and length of use, number of eyes that used the device, established baseline and converted to nAMD, and number of alerts. RESULTS: 775 eyes of 448 patients were prescribed use of the ForeseeHome device. 649 eyes (83.7%) used the device at least once; among this population, 478 (73.7%) established baseline. Patients who established baseline were significantly younger than those who did not establish baseline (p<0.001). Among eyes that established baseline, 126 (26.4%) had an overall inadequate frequency of use (≥2 tests per week), and 250 (52.3%) did not use the device as frequently as instructed by the manufacturer (≥3 tests per week); 112 (24.7%) discontinued use within one year. Over a mean of 20.35 months, 106 patients had 152 alerts, indicating possible conversions to nAMD. Out of the 136 eyes that established baseline among 211 eyes prescribed the device at one clinical site, 52 alerts were recorded, 3 (6.8%) correctly identified conversion to nAMD and 47 (93.2%) represented false-positive alerts. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the prospective HOME study, utility of the ForeseeHome device in the current analysis of real-world clinical-practice application was limited. A meaningful proportion of eyes never used the device or could not establish baseline. Overall frequency of use was low and continuous usage of the device decreased over time. There is a need for improvement in home monitoring technology for eyes with iAMD at risk of conversion to nAMD.","Yu, Hannah J.; Kiernan, Daniel F.; Eichenbaum, David; Sheth, Veeral S.; Wykoff, Charles C.",Ophthalmol Retina,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468653020303316; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810682/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468653020303316?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oret.2020.08.003,215

While decades of research have led to numerous clinical and pre-clinical vaccine candidates, these efforts have been hindered by factors including HCV antigenic variability and immune evasion. Structure-based and rational vaccine design approaches have capitalized on insights regarding the immune response to HCV and the structures of antibody-bound envelope glycoproteins. Despite successes with other viruses, designing an immunogen based on HCV glycoproteins that can elicit broadly protective immunity against HCV infection is an ongoing challenge. Here, we describe HCV vaccine design approaches where immunogens were selected and optimized through analysis of available structures, identification of conserved epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies, or both. Several designs have elicited immune responses against HCV in vivo, revealing correlates of HCV antigen immunogenicity and breadth of induced responses. Recent studies have elucidated the functional, dynamic and immunological features of key regions of the viral envelope glycoproteins, which can inform next-generation immunogen design efforts. These insights and design strategies represent promising pathways to HCV vaccine development, which can be further informed by successful immunogen designs generated for other viruses.","Guest, Johnathan D.; Pierce, Brian G.",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13050837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063143/,215

Vitamin D deficient rats were intrajugularly given vehicle or vehicle containing 730ng of 1,25-(OH)2D3/kg of body weight. Intestinal mRNA was harvested from duodenal mucosa at 15min, 1, 3, and 6h post-injection and studied by Affymetrix microarrays. Genes significantly affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR with remarkable agreement. The most strongly affected gene in intestine was CYP24 with 97-fold increase at 6h post-1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. Intestinal calcium absorption genes: TRPV5, TRPV6, calbindin D9k, and Ca2+ dependent ATPase all were up-regulated in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3, supporting the currently accepted mechanism of 1,25-(OH)2D3 induced transcellular calcium transport. However, a 1,25-(OH)2D3 suppression of several intra-/intercellular matrix modeling proteins such as sodium/potassium ATPase, claudin 3, aquaporin 8, cadherin 17, and RhoA suggests a vitamin D regulation of tight junction permeability and paracellular calcium transport. Several other genes related to the immune system and angiogenesis whose expression was changed in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 provided evidence for an immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic role of 1,25-(OH)2D3.","Kutuzova, Galina D.; DeLuca, Hector F.",Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986104005132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15542054/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003986104005132,215

This led to a doubling in the magnitude of stock return patterns usually observed around ex‐dividend days. Our evidence indicates that dividend‐seeking investors are likely to be the main driver of the price patterns observed around ex‐dividend dates.","Eugster, Nicolas; Ducret, Romain; Isakov, Dušan; Weisskopf, Jean‐Philippe",International Review of Finance,https://doi.org/10.1111/irfi.12360,215
614223,Can hydroxychloroquine be useful in the prevention of COVID-19? An Italian survey in dermatological and rheumatological patients already under treatment.,2020-05-01,"Background: Successful containment strategies for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of the COVID-19 pandemic, have involved widespread population testing that identifies infections early and enables rapid contact tracing. In this study, we developed a rapid and inexpensive RT-qPCR testing pipeline for population-level SARS-CoV-2 detection, and used this pipeline to establish a clinical laboratory dedicated to COVID-19 testing at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) with a processing capacity of 6,000 samples per day and next-day result turnaround times. Methods and findings: Using this pipeline, we screened 6,786 healthcare workers and first responders, and 21,220 students, faculty, and staff from UCSD. Additionally, we screened 6,031 preschool-grade 12 students and staff from public and private schools across San Diego County that remained fully or partially open for in-person teaching during the pandemic. Between April 17, 2020 and February 5, 2021, participants provided 161,582 nasal swabs that were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, 752 positive tests were obtained, yielding a test positivity rate of 0.47%. While the presence of symptoms was significantly correlated with higher viral load, most of the COVID-19 positive participants who participated in symptom surveys were asymptomatic at the time of testing. The positivity rate among preschool-grade 12 schools that remained open for in-person teaching was similar to the positivity rate at UCSD and lower than that of San Diego County, with the children in private schools being less likely to test positive than the adults at these schools. Conclusions: Most schools across the United States have been closed for in-person learning for much of the 2020-2021 school year, and their safe reopening is a national priority. However, as there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 currently available to the majority of school-aged children, the traditional strategies of mandatory masking, physical distancing, and repeated viral testing of students and staff remain key components of risk mitigation in these settings. The data presented here suggest that the safety measures and repeated testing actions taken by participating healthcare and educational facilities were effective in preventing outbreaks, and that a similar combination of risk-mitigation strategies and repeated testing may be successfully adopted by other healthcare and educational systems.","Morgan, S.

Results from a rapid literature review,2021-06-16,"One of the priorities at our large Operating Theatres Department is to support awareness and basic education of the multi-disciplinary teams in clinical Human Factors, to help build competence and capacity in healthcare towards a resilient system. From May 2019 until February 2020, our Human Factors Champions embarked on a project called Observation of Non-technical Skills and Teamwork in the operating theatres (ONSeT), to monitor and evaluate the benefits of local Human Factors education. In September 2020, six months after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK and caused a major disruption of surgical services, we decided to investigate the usefulness of the project and the impact of COVID-19 in the operating theatres, looking through the eyes of the Human Factors Champions. Results pointed to a consensus about ONSeT having helped during the pandemic, with regards to how teams worked and in enabling team leaders to be more responsive. Human Factors Champions found that feedback on performance was received in a non-threatening way and observation of performance became ‘second nature’. As organisations need to develop critical thinking, we think that the ONSeT project has helped us build some capacity for this, from the front-line onwards.","Britton, Carolina Relvas; Hayman, Gareth; Stroud, Nicola",J Perioper Pract,https://doi.org/10.1177/1750458920978858; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292057/,215
615434,"Predicting severe outcomes in Covid-19 related illness using only patient demographics, comorbidities and symptoms",2020-09-09,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is dominated by the recruitment of myeloid cells (neutrophils and monocytes) from the blood which fail to clear the lung of colonizing microbes. In prior in vitro studies, we showed that blood neutrophils migrated through the well-differentiated lung epithelium into the CF airway fluid supernatant (ASN) mimic the dysfunction of CF airway neutrophils in vivo, including decreased bactericidal activity despite an increased metabolism. Here, we hypothesized that, in a similar manner to neutrophils, blood monocytes undergo significant adaptations upon recruitment to CFASN. To test this hypothesis, primary human blood monocytes were transmigrated in our in vitro model into the ASN from healthy control (HC) or CF subjects to mimic in vivo recruitment to normal or CF airways, respectively. Surface phenotype, metabolic and bacterial killing activities, and transcriptomic profile by RNA sequencing were quantified post-transmigration. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes were not metabolically activated, nor did they show broad differences in activation and scavenger receptor expression upon recruitment to the CFASN compared to HCASN. However, monocytes recruited to CFASN showed decreased bactericidal activity. RNASeq analysis showed strong effects of transmigration on monocyte RNA profile, with differences between CFASN and HCASN conditions, notably in immune signaling, including lower expression in the former of the antimicrobial factor ISG15, defensin-like chemokine CXCL11, and nitric oxide-producing enzyme NOS3. While monocytes undergo qualitatively different adaptations from those seen in neutrophils upon recruitment to the CF airway microenvironment, their bactericidal activity is also dysregulated, which could explain why they also fail to protect CF airways from infection.","Ford, Bijean D.; Moncada Giraldo, Diego; Margaroli, Camilla; Giacalone, Vincent D.; Brown, Milton R.; Peng, Limin; Tirouvanziam, Rabindra",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33802410/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22052530,215

616515,Virtual Care in Patients with Cancer: A Systematic Review,2021-09-08,"In this work a shared pressure-controlled ventilation device for two patients is considered. By the use of different valves incorporated to the circuit, the device enables the restriction of possible cross contamination and the individualization of tidal volumes, driving pressures, and positive end expiratory pressure PEEP. Possible interactions in the expiratory dynamics of different pairs of patients are evaluated in terms of the characteristic exhalatory times. These characteristic times can not be easily established using simple linear lumped element models. For this purpose, a 1D model using the Hydraulic and Mechanical libraries in Matlab Simulink was developed. In this sense, experiments accompany this study to validate the model and characterize the different valves of the circuit. Our results show that connecting two patients in parallel to a ventilator always resulted in delays of time during the exhalation. The size of this effect depends on different parameters associated with the patients, the circuit and the ventilator. The dynamics of the exhalation of both patients is determined by the ratios between patients exhalatory resistances, compliances, driving pressures and PEEPs. Adverse effects on exhalations became less noticeable when respiratory parameters of both patients were similar, flow resistances of valves added to the circuit were negligible, and when the ventilator exhalatory valve resistance was also negligible. The asymmetries of driving pressures, compliances or resistances exacerbated the possibility of auto-PEEP and the increase in relaxation times became greater in one patient than in the other. In contrast, exhalatory dynamics were less sensitive to the ratio of PEEP imposed to the patients.","Garcia Eijo, Pedro M.; D’Adamo, Juan; Bianchetti, Arturo; Duriez, Thomas; Cabaleiro, Juan M.; Irrazabal, Célica; Otero, Pablo; Artana, Guillermo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33945551/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250672,215

The G/BBG nanocomposite hydrogels were studied for their morphology, mechanical properties, and viscoelasticity. SEM images revealed a macroporous interconnected structure with particles scattered across the pore walls. Studies of water absorption and degradation confirmed that the nanocomposite scaffolds were hydrophilic and biodegradable. The addition of 5% BBG to the scaffold formulations increased the compressive modulus by 413% and the compressive intensity by 20%, respectively. At all frequency ranges tested, the storage modulus (G′) was greater than the loss modulus (G″), revealing a self-standing elastic nanocomposite hydrogel. The nanocomposite scaffolds facilitated apatite formation while immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF).

This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and 95% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically different. RESULTS: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 ± 10.6 years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (93.7%) via television and social media (72.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8%), although some misconceptions existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2%) maintained good practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10–1.41, P<0.05). Also, the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83–0.99, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more vulnerable in our community.","Huynh, Giao; Nguyen, Minh Quan; Tran, Thien Thuan; Nguyen, Van Tap; Nguyen, Truong Vien; Do, Thi Hoai Thuong; Nguyen, Phi Hong Ngan; Phan, Thi Hoai Yen; Vu, Thanh Thuy; Nguyen, Thi Ngoc Han",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,https://doi.org/10.2147/rmhp.s268876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32982515/,215
617697,The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of head and neck cancer survivors,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND: While much progress was made throughout the Millennium Development Goals era in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality, both remain unacceptably high, especially in areas affected by humanitarian crises. While valuable guidance on interventions to improve maternal and neonatal health in both non-crisis and crisis settings exists, guidance on how best to deliver these interventions in crisis settings, and especially in conflict settings, is still limited. This systematic review aimed to synthesise the available literature on the delivery on maternal and neonatal health interventions in conflict settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO databases using terms related to conflict, women and children, and maternal and neonatal health. We searched websites of 10 humanitarian organisations for relevant grey literature. Publications reporting on conflict-affected populations in low-income and middle-income countries and describing a maternal or neonatal health intervention delivered during or within 5 years after the end of a conflict were included. Information on population, intervention, and delivery characteristics were extracted and narratively synthesised. Quantitative data on intervention coverage and effectiveness were tabulated but no meta-analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: 115 publications met our eligibility criteria. Intervention delivery was most frequently reported in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and most publications focused on displaced populations based in camps. Reported maternal interventions targeted antenatal, obstetric and postnatal care; neonatal interventions focused mostly on essential newborn care. Most interventions were delivered in hospitals and clinics, by doctors and nurses, and were mostly delivered through non-governmental organisations or the existing healthcare system. Delivery barriers included insecurity, lack of resources and lack of skilled health staff. Multi-stakeholder collaboration, the introduction of new technology or systems innovations, and staff training were delivery facilitators. Reporting of intervention coverage or effectiveness data was limited. DISCUSSION: The relevant existing literature focuses mostly on maternal health especially around the antenatal period. There is still limited literature on postnatal care in conflict settings and even less on newborn care. In crisis settings, as much as in non-crisis settings, there is a need to focus on the first day of birth for both maternal and neonatal health. There is also a need to do more research on how best to involve community members in the delivery of maternal and neonatal health interventions.

While at first, the majority of COVID-19 diagnostic testing in the USA took place in healthcare settings, quickly a direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing market also emerged. In these DTC provision models, the test is initiated by a consumer and the sample collection occurs at home or in a commercial laboratory. Although the provision of DTC tests has potential benefits—such as expanding access to testing and reducing the risk of exposure for consumers and medical personnel—it also raises significant ethical and regulatory concerns. This article reviews these challenges and shows how they parallel and also diverge from prior concerns raised in the DTC health testing arena. The first part of this paper provides an overview of the landscape of diagnostic and serological tests for COVID-19, anticipating how provision models are likely to evolve in the future. The second part discusses five primary issues for DTC COVID-19 tests: test accuracy; potential misinterpretation of results; misleading claims and other misinformation; privacy concerns; and fair allocation of scarce resources.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID‐19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID‐19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID‐19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID‐19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID‐19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID‐19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID‐19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5‐10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID‐19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID‐19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007). CONCLUSION: Abnormal results of the liver blood test were found in COVID‐19 patients.

Macao was selected as the case not only because of the background of the authors, but also because Macao has been cited in many media coverage as a “good practice” example when it comes to fighting against this COVID-19 pandemic situation. Since there are already ample of articles on the background, development timeline, and overall commentary, this paper adopts a mixed approach by combining supplementary secondary data on the COVID-19 timeline in Macao (focusing on government interventions that can affect the tourism and hospitality industry) and primary qualitative in-depth interviews with senior management personnel (holding positions of Director or above) from major integrated resorts in Macao to get insights on industry strategic responses and expectation on future. A total of seven interviews were conducted with senior management members of five integrated resorts in May 2020. Four areas of responses were identified. They are 1. Survival; 2. The New Business Norm; 3. Business Rebound Strategies and 4. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

620832,Clinical Characteristics of Covid-19 in New York City,2020-04-17,"Literature survey shows that convolutional neural network (CNN)-based pretrained models have been largely used for CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) classification using chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) datasets. However, most of the methods have used a smaller number of data samples for both CT and CXR datasets for training, validation, and testing. As a result, the model might have shown good performance during testing, but this type of model will not be more effective on unseen COVID-19 data samples. Generalization is an important term to be considered while designing a classifier that can perform well on completely unseen datasets. Here, this work proposes a large-scale learning with stacked ensemble meta-classifier and deep learning-based feature fusion approach for COVID-19 classification. The features from the penultimate layer (global average pooling) of EfficientNet-based pretrained models were extracted and the dimensionality of the extracted features reduced using kernel principal component analysis (PCA). Next, a feature fusion approach was employed to merge the features of various extracted features. Finally, a stacked ensemble meta-classifier-based approach was used for classification. It is a two-stage approach. In the first stage, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) were applied for prediction, then aggregated and fed into the second stage. The second stage includes logistic regression classifier that classifies the data sample of CT and CXR into either COVID-19 or Non-COVID-19. The proposed model was tested using large CT and CXR datasets, which are publicly available. The performance of the proposed model was compared with various existing CNN-based pretrained models.

The used PPE kits, potentially being infectious, pose a threat to human health, terrestrial, and marine ecosystems, if not scientifically handled and disposed. However, with stressed resources on treatment facilities and lack of training to the health and sanitation workers, it becomes vital to vet different options for PPE kits disposal, to promote environmentally sound management of waste. Given the various technology options available for treatment and disposal of COVID-19 patients waste, Life Cycle Assessment, i.e., cradle to grave analysis of PPE provides essential guidance in identifying the environmentally sound alternatives. In the present work, Life Cycle Assessment of PPE kits has been performed using GaBi version 8.7 under two disposal scenarios, namely landfill and incineration (both centralized and decentralized) for six environmental impact categories covering overall impacts on both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, which includes Global Warming Potential (GWP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Acidification Potential (AP), Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) and Photochemical Ozone Depletion Potential (POCP). Considering the inventories of PPE kits, disposal of PPE bodysuit has the maximum impact, followed by gloves and goggles, in terms of GWP. The use of metal strips in face-mask has shown the most significant HTP impact. The incineration process (centralized−3816 kg CO2 eq. and decentralized−3813 kg CO2 eq.) showed high GWP but significantly reduced impact w.r.t. AP, EP, FAETP, POCP and HTP, when compared to disposal in a landfill, resulting in the high overall impact of landfill disposal compared to incineration. The decentralized incineration has emerged as environmentally sound management option compared to centralized incinerator among all the impact categories, also the environmental impact by transportation is significant (2.76 kg CO2 eq.) and cannot be neglected for long-distance transportation. Present findings can help the regulatory authority to delineate action steps for safe disposal of PPE kits.","Kumar, Harender; Azad, Amaanuddin; Gupta, Ankit; Sharma, Jitendra; Bherwani, Hemant; Labhsetwar, Nitin Kumar; Kumar, Rakesh",Environ Dev Sustain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071605/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01033-0,215

Adult basic life support,2021-05-21,"Objectives Studies on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) usually focus on middle aged and older adults. However, younger patients may present with severe COVID-19 and potentially fatal outcomes. For optimized, more specialized therapeutic regimens in this particular patient group, a better understanding of underlying pathomechanisms is of uttermost importance. Methods This study investigates relevant pre-existing medical conditions, clinical histories and autopsy findings, together with SARS-CoV-2-RNA, determined by qPCR, and laboratory data in six COVID-19 decedents at an age of 50 years or younger who were autopsied at the Charité University Hospital. Results From a total of 76 COVID-19 patients who underwent an autopsy at our institution, 6 (7.9%) were 50 years old or younger. Most COVID-19 decedents of younger age presented with pre-existing medical conditions prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included overweight and obesity, arterial hypertension, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea as well as graft-versus-host disease following cancer and bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, clinical histories and autopsy results revealed a disproportionally high prevalence of thromboembolism and ischemic organ damage in this patient cohort. Histopathology and laboratory results indicated coagulopathies, signs of immune dysregulation and liver damage. Conclusions In conclusion, pre-existing health conditions may increase the risk of severe and fatal COVID-19 in younger patients who may be especially prone to developing thromboembolic complications, immune dysregulation and liver damage.","Greuel, Selina; Ihlow, Jana; Dragomir, Mihnea-Paul; Streit, Simon; Corman, Victor Max; Haberbosch, Linus; Winkler, David; Meinhardt, Jenny; Aschman, Tom; Schneider, Julia; Trotsyuk, Iryna; Kunze, Catarina Alisa; Maurer, Lukas; Radbruch, Helena; Heppner, Frank L.; Horst, David; Elezkurtaj, Sefer",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221004720?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089883/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.05.069; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221004720,215

Those behaviors include 1) covering the nose and mouth with a mask to protect others from possible infection when in public settings and when around persons who live outside of one's household or around ill household members; 2) maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) of distance from persons who live outside one's household, and keeping oneself distant from persons who are ill; and 3) washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or, if soap and water are not available, using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol (1). Age has been positively associated with mask use (2), although less is known about other recommended mitigation behaviors. Monitoring mitigation behaviors over the course of the pandemic can inform targeted communication and behavior modification strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Data Foundation COVID Impact Survey collected nationally representative data on reported mitigation behaviors during April-June 2020 among adults in the United States aged ≥18 years (3). Reported use of face masks increased from 78% in April, to 83% in May, and reached 89% in June; however, other reported mitigation behaviors (e.g., hand washing, social distancing, and avoiding public or crowded places) declined marginally or remained unchanged. At each time point, the prevalence of reported mitigation behaviors was lowest among younger adults (aged 18-29 years) and highest among older adults (aged ≥60 years). Lower engagement in mitigation behaviors among younger adults might be one reason for the increased incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in this group, which have been shown to precede increases among those >60 years (4). These findings underscore the need to prioritize clear, targeted messaging and behavior modification interventions, especially for young adults, to encourage uptake and support maintenance of recommended mitigation behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Hutchins, Helena J.; Wolff, Brent; Leeb, Rebecca; Ko, Jean Y.; Odom, Erika; Willey, Joe; Friedman, Allison; Bitsko, Rebecca H.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6943e4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119562/,215

Increasing demand coupled with limited resources in a publicly funded system (e.g. Ontario, the largest province in Canada) resulted in a waitlist for this procedure. Our province has recommended maximum wait times (RMWT) for patients referred to CATH. The purpose of this study is to describe our experience over the past decade in attempting to meet RMWTs for patients needing CATH at our centre, and to discuss issues concerning capacity planning in providing timely service. METHODS: We measured the proportion of patients undergoing a procedure within the RWMT, and calculated both the mean number of patients and mean length of time on the wait list for each year over a decade for those referred to CATH using prospectively collected registry data. We identified factors that increased referrals or improved capacity. Wait time was compared to community standard RMWTs in order to establish if and how RMWTs were achieved. RESULTS: Despite a number of systematic and capacity improvements, RMWTs were not achieved until after the addition of a 4th laboratory. INTERPRETATION: Improving access to CATH in our centre was reactive to the increasing need of the community rather than based on anticipation of need and continuity of service within RMWTs. Registry data can help monitor key indicators (e.g. RMWT). Prudent use of this information should help policy makers with future expansion in our region.","Mercuri, Mat; Natarajan, Madhu K.; Holder, Douglas H.; Xie, Changchun; Gafni, Amiram",Health Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.01.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19223088/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168851009000219; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851009000219,215

METHODS: We used the LASSO aggression and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the predictive factors associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, and established the diagnostic nomogram for COVID-19 pneumonia using multivariable regression. This diagnostic nomogram was assessed by the internal and external validation data set. Further, we plotted decision curves and clinical impact curve to evaluate the clinical usefulness of this diagnostic nomogram. RESULTS: The predictive factors including the epidemiological history, wedge-shaped or fan-shaped lesion parallel to or near the pleura, bilateral lower lobes, ground glass opacities, crazy paving pattern and white blood cell (WBC) count were contained in the nomogram. In the primary cohort, the C-statistic for predicting the probability of the COVID-19 pneumonia was 0.967, even higher than the C-statistic (0.961) in initial viral nucleic acid nomogram which was established using the univariable regression. The C-statistic was 0.848 in external validation cohort. Good calibration curves were observed for the prediction probability in the internal validation and external validation cohort. The nomogram both performed well in terms of discrimination and calibration. Moreover, decision curve and clinical impact curve were also beneficial for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

624618,Symptoms of COVID-19 in a population-based cohort study,2021-03-22,"Health care professionals and the institutions in which they work are being stretched to their limits amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, a second longstanding pandemic has been brought to the fore: the entrenched system of racial injustice and oppression. The first pandemic is new, and to date, substantial resources have been allocated to urgently addressing its mitigation; the second has a long history with inconsistent attention and resources but has recently been spotlighted more intensely than at any time in the nation’s recent past. The authors contend that these 2 simultaneous pandemics have brought forth the need for institutions in the United States to make a renewed commitment to respect, wellness, diversity, and inclusion. While investment and leadership in these domains have always been essential, these have largely been viewed as a “nice-to-have” option. The events of much of 2020 (most notably) have illustrated that committing to and investing in policies, programs, centers, and leadership to drive change in these domains are essential and a “need-to-have” measure. The authors outline the necessity of investing in the promotion of cultures of inclusive excellence at both individual and organizational levels to coordinate a united response to the simultaneous pandemics. It is in the interests of health care systems to consider the wellness of the workforce to overcome the longer-term economic, systemic, and social trauma that will likely occur for years to come at both the individual and institutional levels. Maintaining or augmenting investment is necessary despite the economic challenges the nation faces. Now is the time to cultivate resilience and wellness through a renewed commitment to cultures of respect, diversity, and inclusion. This commitment is urgently needed to support and sustain the health care workforce and maintain outstanding health care systems for future generations.","Fassiotto, Magali; Valantine, Hannah; Shanafelt, Tait; Maldonado, Yvonne",Acad Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003905; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369903/,215

Critical perspectives on these new partnerships tend to frame them as an instance of market transgressions by tech giants into the sphere of health and medicine, in line with a “hostile worlds” doctrine that upholds that the borders between market and non-market spheres should be carefully policed. This article seeks to outline the limitations of this common framing for critically understanding the phenomenon of the Googlization of health. In particular, the mobilization of a diversity of non-market value statements in the justification work carried out by actors involved in the Googlization of health indicates the co-presence of additional worlds or spheres in this context, which are not captured by the market vs. non-market dichotomy. It then advances an alternative framework, based on a multiple-sphere ontology that draws on Boltanski and Thevenot’s orders of worth and Michael Walzer’s theory of justice, which I call a normative pragmatics of justice. This framework addresses both the normative deficit in Boltanski and Thevenot’s work and provides an important emphasis on the empirical workings of justice. Finally, I discuss why this framework is better equipped to identify and to address the many risks raised by the Googlization of health and possibly other dimensions of the digitalization and datafication of society.","Sharon, Tamar",Med Health Care Philos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721157/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11019-021-10006-7,215

The majority of severe episodes are triggered by viral colds. Unlike atopic asthma in adults and young people, the underlying pathology of this condition is poorly understood, and the label of “preschool wheeze” should therefore not be regarded as a diagnosis but a description of symptoms. It is important to consider other causes of wheeze, but, for the most part, serious conditions such as cystic fibrosis and foreign body aspiration are associated with atypical features on careful history and examination. There remain significant uncertainties about the optimal management of children with this condition. Short-acting bronchodilators are indicated for the acute treatment of wheeze, and current evidence suggests that daily inhaled corticosteroid therapy is an effective preventive therapy, at least in a subgroup of children. Some trials suggest that preemptive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids may be as effective as regular inhaled corticosteroids. Since wheeze is intermittent for the majority of children, preemptive therapy is a logical approach. However, more studies are needed to confirm whether preemptive inhaled corticosteroids are as, or more, effective than regular preventer therapy.","Grigg, Jonathan; Ducharme, Francine M.",Kendig's Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323448871000444; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323448871000444,215

With affordability being a key access barrier to clean cooking fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), pay-as-you-go (PAYG) LPG smart meter technology may help resource-poor households adopt LPG by allowing incremental fuel payments. To understand the potential for PAYG LPG to facilitate clean cooking, objective evaluations of customers’ cooking and spending patterns are needed. This study uses novel smart meter data collected between January 2018-June 2020, spanning COVID-19 lockdown, from 426 PAYG LPG customers living in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya to evaluate stove usage (e.g. cooking events/day, cooking event length). Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted in August 2020 to provide context for potential changes in cooking behaviours during lockdown. Using stove monitoring data, objective comparisons of cooking patterns are made with households using purchased 6 kg cylinder LPG in peri-urban Eldoret, Kenya. In Nairobi, 95% of study households continued using PAYG LPG during COVID-19 lockdown, with consumption increasing from 0.97 to 1.22 kg/capita/month. Daily cooking event frequency also increased by 60% (1.07 to 1.72 events/day). In contrast, average days/month using LPG declined by 75% during lockdown (17 to four days) among seven households purchasing 6 kg cylinder LPG in Eldoret. Interviewed customers reported benefits of PAYG LPG beyond fuel affordability, including safety, time savings and cylinder delivery. In the first study assessing PAYG LPG cooking patterns, LPG use was sustained despite a COVID-19 lockdown, illustrating how PAYG smart meter technology may help foster clean cooking access.","Shupler, Matthew; O'Keefe, Mark; Puzzolo, Elisa; Nix, Emily; Anderson de Cuevas, Rachel; Mwitari, James; Gohole, Arthur; Sang, Edna; Čukić, Iva; Menya, Diana; Pope, Daniel",Appl Energy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140750/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.116769,215

HCWs perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, in relation to depression were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceived high risk of contracting COVID-19 (close contact with cases, inadequate provision of personal protective equipment, insufficient infection control training, and presence of symptoms) would be significant predictors of depression. Our cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively. The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks. HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression. Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19.","Lam, Simon Ching; Arora, Teresa; Grey, Ian; Suen, Lorna Kwai Ping; Huang, Emma Yun-zhi; Li, Daofan; Lam, Kin Bong Hubert",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32765321/,215

The qRT–PCR showed ~80% reduction in M. hyopneumoniae genome when LiCl added post-infection. A direct effect of LiCl on bacteria was also observed. However, treatment of cells with LiCl prior infection, does not protect against the infection. Anti-bacterial activity of LiCl was further confirmed by IFA, which demonstrated a reduction in the bacterial protein. With 40 mM LiCI, the apoptotic cell death, production of nitric oxide and superoxide anion induced by M. hyopneumoniae, were prevented by ~80%, 60% and 58% respectively. Moreover, caspase-3 activity was also reduced (82%) in cells treated with 40 mM LiCl. LiCl showed activity against various strains of M. hyopneumoniae examined in our study.

Despite a wealth of experimental information already available, there is wide disagreement about the M(pro) monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant. Since the functional unit of M(pro) is a homodimer, the detailed knowledge of the thermodynamics of this equilibrium is a key piece of information for possible therapeutic intervention, with small molecules interfering with dimerization being potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug leads. In the present study, we exploit Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) to investigate the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) in solution as a function of protein concentration and temperature. A detailed thermodynamic picture of the monomer-dimer equilibrium is derived, together with the temperature-dependent value of the dissociation constant. SAXS is also used to study how the M(pro) dissociation process is affected by small inhibitors selected by virtual screening. We find that these inhibitors affect dimerization and enzymatic activity to a different extent and sometimes in an opposite way, likely due to the different molecular mechanisms underlying the two processes. The M(pro) residues that emerge as key to optimize both dissociation and enzymatic activity inhibition are discussed.","Silvestrini, Lucia; Belhaj, Norhan; Comez, Lucia; Gerelli, Yuri; Lauria, Antonino; Libera, Valeria; Mariani, Paolo; Marzullo, Paola; Ortore, Maria Grazia; Palumbo Piccionello, Antonio; Petrillo, Caterina; Savini, Lucrezia; Paciaroni, Alessandro; Spinozzi, Francesco",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-88630-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927258/,215

However, infectious diseases remain the leading cause of death in the world. There is global concern about the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which affects both developed and developing countries. AMR is a public health challenge with extensive health, economic, and societal implications. This paper sets AMR in context, starting with the history of antibiotics, including the discovery of penicillin and the golden era of antibiotics, before exploring the problems and challenges we now face due to AMR. Among the factors discussed is the low level of development of new antimicrobials and the irrational prescribing of antibiotics in developed and developing countries. A fundamental problem is the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) regarding antibiotics among medical practitioners, and we explore this aspect in some depth, including a discussion on the KAP among medical students. We conclude with suggestions on how to address this public health threat, including recommendations on training medical students about antibiotics, and strategies to overcome the problems of irrational antibiotic prescribing and AMR.","Dhingra, Sameer; Rahman, Nor Azlina A.; Peile, Ed; Rahman, Motiur; Sartelli, Massimo; Hassali, Mohamed Azmi; Islam, Tariqul; Islam, Salequl; Haque, Mainul",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.535668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33251170/,215
631752,COVID-19 pandemic and admission rates for and management of acute coronary syndromes in England,2020-08-14,"Pulmonary fibrosis is a relentlessly progressive and often fatal disease with a paucity of available therapies. Genetic evidence implicates disordered epithelial repair, which is normally achieved by the differentiation of small cuboidal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells into large, flattened alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells as an initiating event in pulmonary fibrosis pathogenesis. Using models of pulmonary fibrosis in young adult and old mice and a model of adult alveologenesis after pneumonectomy, we show that administration of ISRIB, a small molecule that restores protein translation by EIF2B during activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), accelerated the differentiation of AT2 into AT1 cells. Accelerated epithelial repair reduced the recruitment of profibrotic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages and ameliorated lung fibrosis. These findings suggest a dysfunctional role for the ISR in regeneration of the alveolar epithelium after injury with implications for therapy.","Watanabe, Satoshi; Markov, Nikolay S.; Lu, Ziyan; Piseaux Aillon, Raul; Soberanes, Saul; Runyan, Constance E.; Ren, Ziyou; Grant, Rogan A.; Maciel, Mariana; Abdala-Valencia, Hiam; Politanska, Yuliya; Nam, Kiwon; Sichizya, Lango; Kihshen, Hermon G.; Joshi, Nikita; McQuattie-Pimentel, Alexandra C.; Gruner, Katherine A.; Jain, Manu; Sznajder, Jacob I.; Morimoto, Richard I.; Reyfman, Paul A.; Gottardi, Cara J.; Budinger, G.

632795,Delirium and adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID‐19.,2020-08-24,"Résumé L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver. Si la littérature a déjà fourni des projections généralistes en la matière, les données concrètes concernent à ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques évaluations s’intéressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux généralisé. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cité et l’évocation de la « panique », au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que d’une légitimité clinique encore débattue, le trouble panique qualifié de « respiratoire » pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou être intensifié chez les patients qui en présentent déjà. D’éventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter à certaines précautions en matière de prescriptions médicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources d’hypokaliémie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhées et/ou vomissements. L’hypokaliémie est associée à un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc également d’être prudent en matière de prescription de psychotropes à risque : comme avec le citalopram et l’escitalopram, des antidépresseurs indiqués dans le trouble panique, ou encore l’hydroxyzine, à visée anxiolytique. Ces données sont de nature à resituer l’importance de la prise en considération du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandémie en cours. Abstract Although the ‘panic’ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder – i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities – are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L",Encephale,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32507556/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013700620300956; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013700620300956?v=s5,215

However, there are few data on Southern Hemisphere populations, and most studies to date have investigated a narrow spectrum of viruses using targeted qRT-PCR. Here we assessed respiratory viral co-infections among SARS-CoV-2 patients in Australia, through respiratory virome characterization. Nasopharyngeal swabs of 92 SARS-CoV-2-positive cases were sequenced using pan-viral hybrid-capture and the Twist Respiratory Virus Panel. In total, 8% of cases were co-infected, with rhinovirus (6%) or influenzavirus (2%). Twist capture also achieved near-complete sequencing (> 90% coverage, > tenfold depth) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in 95% of specimens with Ct < 30. Our results highlight the importance of assessing all pathogens in symptomatic patients, and the dual-functionality of Twist hybrid-capture, for SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequencing without amplicon generation and the simultaneous identification of viral co-infections with ease.","Kim, Ki Wook; Deveson, Ira W.; Pang, Chi Nam I.; Yeang, Malinna; Naing, Zin; Adikari, Thiruni; Hammond, Jillian M.; Stevanovski, Igor; Beukers, Alicia G.; Verich, Andrey; Yin, Simon; McFarlane, David; Wilkins, Marc R.; Stelzer-Braid, Sacha; Bull, Rowena A.; Craig, Maria E.; van Hal, Sebastiaan J.; Rawlinson, William D.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-83642-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594223/,215

Though intended to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the lockdowns have had sweeping impacts on life in ways which were not originally planned. This study’s purpose is to investigate the extent to which governmental responses to COVID-19 have impacted crime rates in the U.S. Compared to the pre-pandemic year of 2019, crime – as measured by calls for service to law enforcement – has decreased markedly. However, there are multiple indications that the crime drop is being driven by decreases in minor offenses which are typically committed in peer groups. At the same time, serious crimes which are generally not committed with co-offenders (namely homicide and intimate partner violence) have either remained constant or increased. As such, the crime drop appears to be hiding a very disturbing trend where homicides remain unchanged and intimate partner batteries are increasing. Since many offenders would presumably be committing less serious crimes in a non-pandemic world, we raise attention to the possibility that mandatory lockdown orders may have taken minor offenders and placed them into situations where there is rampant opportunity for intimate partner violence, serious batteries, and homicides. While crime in the U.S. appears to be down overall, this good news should not blind us to a troubling co-occurring reality – a reality that paints a dim picture of unintended consequences to public health and criminal justice finances as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns.","Boman, John H.; Gallupe, Owen",Am J Crim Justice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837168/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09551-3,215

Some elements of Internet gambling including isolation, lack of interruption, and constant, easy access have been argued to pose specific risks. However, identifiable player accounts enable identification of behavioral risk markers and personalized private interfaces to push customized messages and interventions. The structural design of the Internet gambling environment (website or app) can have a strong influence on individual behavior. However, unlike land-based venues, Internet gambling has few specific policies outlining acceptable and unacceptable design practices. Harm minimization including responsible gambling frameworks typically include roles and responsibilities for multiple stakeholders including individual users, industry operators, government regulators, and community organizations. This paper presents a framework for how behavioral science principles can inform appropriate stakeholder actions to minimize Internet gambling-related harms. A customer journey through internet gambling demonstrates how a multidisciplinary nexus of collaborative effort may facilitate a reduction in harms associated with Internet gambling for consumers at all stages of risk. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders could result in the implementation of appropriate design strategies to assist individuals to make decisions and engage in healthy, sustainable behaviors.","Gainsbury, Sally M.; Black, Nicola; Blaszczynski, Alex; Callaghan, Sascha; Clancey, Garner; Starcevic, Vladan; Tymula, Agnieszka",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598589; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33381059/,215

The present study aimed to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of imported COVID-19 patients with high body mass index (BMI) and the independent association of BMI with disease severity. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 455 imported COVID-19 patients were admitted and discharged in Zhejiang province by February 28, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were collected, analyzed and compared between patients with BMI ≥ 24and < 24. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients had BMI < 24, and 187 patients had BMI ≥ 24. Those with high BMI were mostly men, had a smoking history, fever, cough, and sputum than those with BMI < 24. A large number of patients with BMI ≥ 24 were diagnosed as severe/critical types. Some biochemical indicators were significantly elevated in patients with BMI ≥ 24. Also, acute liver injury was the most common complication in these patients. The median days from illness onset to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 detection, duration of hospitalization, and days from illness onset to discharge were significantly longer in patients with BMI ≥ 24 than those with BMI < 24. High BMI, exposure to Wuhan, any coexisting medical condition, high temperature, C-reactive protein (CRP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were independent risk factors for severe/critical COVID-19. After adjusting for age, sex and above factors, BMI was still independently associated with progression to severe/critical illness (P = 0.0040). Hemoglobin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), CRP, and serum creatinine (Scr) were independent risk factors associated with high BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Contrasted with the imported COVID-19 patients with BMI < 24, high proportion of COVID-19 patients with BMI ≥ 24 in our study, especially those with elevated CRP and LDH, developed to severe type, with longer hospitalization duration and anti-virus course.

C57BL/6 mice, subjected or not to Cs inhalation for 11 days, were infected with H1N1 at day 7. Maraviroc (10 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg) were given in a therapeutic schedule, followed by the analyses of lung function, survival rate, and inflammatory changes. As compared to mice subjected to Cs or H1N1 alone, the insult combination significantly worsened airway obstruction, neutrophil infiltration in the airways, and the survival rate. All changes were sensitive to Maraviroc but not dexamethasone. Maraviroc also reduced the accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages as well as CXCL1 production in the lung tissue, and serum levels of IL-6, whereas comparable viral titers in the lungs were noted in all infected groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that Maraviroc oral treatment could be an effective therapy for controlling acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases such as COPD.","Ferrero, Maximiliano Ruben; Garcia, Cristiana Couto; Dutra de Almeida, Marcella; Torres Braz da Silva, Jullian; Bianchi Reis Insuela, Daniella; Teixeira Ferreira, Tatiana Paula; de Sá Coutinho, Diego; Trindade de Azevedo, Carolina; Machado Rodrigues e Silva, Patrícia; Martins, Marco Aurélio",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203121/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14070620,215

This paper examines the evolution of Central Asia’s five national economies since 1991 and their economic prospects. The 1990s were dominated by nation-building and the transition from central planning. By 2000, the transition from central planning was essentially complete and the varieties of market-based economies have changed little in the 21st century. Political systems, established in the 1990s around a general pattern of strong presidencies, also changed little, apart from in Kyrgyzstan. Between 1999 and 2014, national economic fortunes were largely shaped by the resource boom. Since the end of the boom, to re-orient Central Asia from dependence on primary product exports and remittances to more diversified outward-oriented economies, domestic change will be necessary. This paper assesses the pressures for economic reform and the forces resistant to change. The economic context includes an improved infrastructure for overland trade across Eurasia as well as an uncertain global trading system and the consequences of the COVID-19 epidemic. The political context includes autocratic non-democracies with an elite that may be content with the unreformed economy, and generational change in leadership. Whereas the initial presidents had spent their entire lives in the planned economy, the current presidents have spent most of their adult lives in market-based economies, mirroring similar changes in the wider population, and may be less resistant to market-based reform and integration into the global economy.","Pomfret, Richard",Comp Econ Stud,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41294-021-00166-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483478/,215

The identification of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism of SARS-CoV-2. However, whether there is a specific target of SARS-CoV-2 in the kidney remains unclear. Herein, by using in silico simulation, co-immunoprecipitation, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, fluorescein isothiocyanate labelling, and rational design of antagonist peptides, we demonstrate that kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1), a molecule dramatically upregulated upon kidney injury, binds with the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and facilitates its attachment to cell membrane, with the immunoglobulin variable Ig-like (Ig V) domain of KIM1 playing a key role in this recognition. The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain and KIM1 is potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide AP2. In addition, our results also suggest interactions between KIM1 Ig V domain and the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, pathogens of two severe infectious respiratory diseases. Together, these findings suggest KIM1 as a novel receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. We propose that KIM1 may thus mediate and exacerbate the renal infection of SARS-CoV-2 in a ‘vicious cycle’, and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.","Yang, Chen; Zhang, Yu; Zeng, Xia; Chen, Huijing; Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Dong; Shen, Ziwei; Wang, Xiaomu; Liu, Xinran; Xiong, Mingrui; Chen, Hong; Huang, Kun",J Mol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493263/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jmcb/mjab003,215

Existing evidence indicates relatively low incidence and mild severity of COVID-19 in children as compared to adults. Although the precise underlying reasons for such disparity remain obscure. The article provides general information about the COVID-19 and epidemiological data of the disease in children and their clinical manifestations and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The main aim of this article is to exploring the reasons given for the mildness of the disease in pediatric patients. Several theories related to immunosenescence, vaccination and trained immunity, coinfection, ACE-2 maturation and expression, viral exposure, overall health and smoking have been proposed so far in recent literature. However, due to the newfound of this virus and lack of information about it, these reasons are not conclusive, but these points are considered as possible reasons for the low prevalence and mildness of the disease in pediatric patients.","Naserghandi, Alvand; Saffarpour, Reyhaneh; Allameh, Seyed Farshad",New Microbes New Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837728/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2052297520300937?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2052297520300937; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmni.2020.100741,215

However, it remains unclear to what extent increases in population scores on mental health assessments are due to changes in prevalence, rather than severity of symptoms. Further, it is not obvious that widely used assessments of aggregate symptoms retain their typical interpretation during an event that directly disrupts behavior. METHODS: Pre-pandemic data on workers age 18-69y in the 2019 National Health Interview Survey are reweighted to match distributions of demographic characteristics of Duke University employees surveyed nine months into the pandemic. The latter population was at low risk of infection or economic insecurity. Prevalence, severity, and scores for each of nine symptoms are compared overall and by age group. OUTCOMES: Elevated psychological distress is primarily driven by increases in prevalence of particular symptoms. Prevalence of trouble concentrating increased six-fold from 9.6% to 72.5%. Other symptoms increased by over one-third; feeling anxious, having little interest, feeling depressed, sleep problems and being irritable, while some symptoms rose only 10% or less. Severity also increased but magnitudes are small relative to prevalence changes. Escalation in prevalence and severity are greatest for the youngest. INTERPRETATION: Some of the least prevalent symptoms pre-pandemic became the most prevalent during the pandemic, affecting interpretation of indices validated pre-pandemic. Clinical and policy interventions should focus on specific symptoms that increased including trouble concentrating and anxiety.

639126,Targeting the Adipose Tissue in COVID‐19,2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory distress syndrome remains a heterogeneous syndrome for clinicians and researchers difficulting successful tailoring of interventions and trials. To this moment, phenotyping of this syndrome has been approached by means of inflammatory laboratory panels. Nevertheless, the systemic and inflammatory expression of acute respiratory distress syndrome might not reflect its respiratory mechanics and gas exchange. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort of two hundred thirty-eight patients consecutively admitted patients under mechanical ventilation presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome. All patients received standardized monitoring of clinical variables, respiratory mechanics and computed tomography scans at predefined PEEP levels. Employing latent class analysis, an unsupervised structural equation modelling method, on respiratory mechanics, gas-exchange and computed tomography-derived gas- and tissue-volumes at a PEEP level of 5cmH(2)O, distinct pulmonary phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome were identified. RESULTS: Latent class analysis was applied to 54 respiratory mechanics, gas-exchange and CT-derived gas- and tissue-volume variables, and a two-class model identified as best fitting. Phenotype 1 (non-recruitable) presented lower respiratory system elastance, alveolar dead space and amount of potentially recruitable lung volume than phenotype 2 (recruitable). Phenotype 2 (recruitable) responded with an increase in ventilated lung tissue, compliance and PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio (p < 0.001), in addition to a decrease in alveolar dead space (p < 0.001), to a standardized recruitment manoeuvre. Patients belonging to phenotype 2 (recruitable) presented a higher intensive care mortality (hazard ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.7–2.7, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies two ARDS phenotypes based on respiratory mechanics, gas-exchange and computed tomography-derived gas- and tissue-volumes. These phenotypes are characterized by distinctly diverse responses to a standardized recruitment manoeuvre and by a diverging mortality. Given multicentre validation, the simple and rapid identification of these pulmonary phenotypes could facilitate enrichment of future prospective clinical trials addressing mechanical ventilation strategies in ARDS.

639148,Trajectories of vital signs in patients with COVID-19,2020-09-10,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) treatment can reverse an established allergic airway inflammation in a BALB/c mouse model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation. METHODS: OVA sensitized BALB/c mice were challenged with aerosolized OVA on days 28 to 30, 34, 41 and 63. Mice were intranasal treated with BCG on days 35 and 42. Twenty-four hours after the last challenge, blood samples were collected to detect anti-OVA immunoglobulin isotypes, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was harvested for cell count. Additionally, lungs were collected for histological analysis, detection of the eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) activity and measurement of cytokines and CCL11. The expression of CTLA-4, Foxp3 and IL-10 was also determined in lung tissue by flow cytometry. RESULTS: BCG treatment was able to inhibit an established allergic Th2-response, by decreasing the allergen-induced eosinophilic inflammation, EPO activity, levels of CCL11 and IL-4, serum levels of IgE and IgG1. Mycobacteria treatment increased lung levels of IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β, and expressions of Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in CD4(+)T cells. Additionally, an increased production of IL-10 by CD8(+) T cells was observed, even though no detectable changes in CD4(+)IL-10(+) was noticed. CONCLUSION: BCG treatment inhibits features of allergic airway inflammation and the results suggest that the mechanism underlying the down-regulatory effects of BCG on OVA-induced airway inflammation appear to be associated with the induction of both Th1 and T regulatory immune responses.","Gouveia, Ana Cláudia Carvalho; Brugiolo, Alessa Sin Singer; Alves, Caio César Souza; Silva, Flávia Márcia Castro; Mesquita, Felipe Pereira; Gameiro, Jacy; Ferreira, Ana Paula",J Clin Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10875-012-9746-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22864629/,215

Since evidence supports the inflammatory crosstalk between the periphery and the central nervous system via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), Ni and Wu show that the “dampening inflammation,” particularly through the inhibition of cathepsin, appears to be a novel therapeutic approach delaying the onset of and enacting early intervention for Alzheimer's disease. While the acute inflammatory response aggravates an ischemic injury, the recovery and tissue repair depend on later inflammatory processes. [...]according to the authors, effective therapy should selectively inhibit the deleterious constituents of the inflammatory process during cerebral ischemia and simultaneously enhance the beneficial aspects of the inflammatory response. Using this model, Sarkar et al. have demonstrated that Azadirachta indica (Neem) bark extract suppresses MHV-induced neuroinflammation and neuropathogenesis by inhibiting cell-to-cell fusion and viral replication. [...]the authors suggested antiviral activity of Neem extract against other Spike expressing human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2.

We aimed to bridge the gap between disease classification and clinical outcome in intensive care patients, data of which are scarce and such classification could help in individual evaluation and provide effective triage for treatment and management. Specifically, we collected and filtered out 151 intensive care patients with complete medical records from Tongji hospital in Wuhan, China. We constructed a fully Bayesian latent variable model for integrative clustering of six data categories, including demographic information, symptoms, original comorbidities, vital signs, blood routine tests and inflammatory marker measurements. We identified four prognostic types of COVID-19 in intensive care patients, presenting a stepwise distribution in age, respiratory condition and inflammatory markers, suggesting the prognostic efficacy of these indicators. This report, to our knowledge, is the first attempt of dealing with classification of COVID-19 in intensive care patients. We acknowledge the limitation of ignoring the effect of treatment, but we believe such classification is enlightening for better triage, allowing for a more rational allocation of scarce medical resources in a resource constrained environment.","Lu, X.; Wang, Y.; Chen, T.; Li, Y.; Wang, J.; Yan, F.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.09.20058909v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20058909,215

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral RNA may persist in respiratory samples for several weeks after the resolution of symptoms. Criteria to assess the end of infectivity are not unequivocally defined. In some countries, time from diagnosis is the unique criterion used, in addition to symptom cessation. This study evaluates the role of the Lumipulse(®) Antigen Assay (LAA) for the safe end of isolation of patients ≥21 days after the diagnosis of infection. Methods. A total of 671 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with infection at least 21 days before were assessed by RT-PCR and LAA, and the role of LAA in predicting the absence of infectivity was evaluated by virus cell culture. Results. Viable virus was present in 10/138 cultured samples. Eight out of ten infective patients suffered from a concomitant disease, predisposing them to long-term shedding of infective virus. In particular, infectious virus was isolated from 10/20 RT-PCR+/LAA+ cultured samples, whereas no viable virus was found in all 118 RT-PCR+/LAA– cultured swabs. LLA and RT-PCR agreed in 484/671 (72.1%) samples, with 100% and 26.7% concordance in RT-PCR negative and positive samples, respectively. Conclusions. Viable virus can be found ≥21 days after diagnosis in immunocompromised or severely ill patients. LAA better than RT-PCR predicts non-infectivity of patients and can be safely used to end isolation in cases with long persistence of viral RNA in the respiratory tract.","Mencacci, Antonella; Gili, Alessio; Gidari, Anna; Schiaroli, Elisabetta; Russo, Carla; Cenci, Elio; Camilloni, Barbara; Graziani, Alessandro; Melelli-Roia, Arduino; Francisci, Daniela; Stracci, Fabrizio",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575147/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184037,215

The aim of the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study was to identify trajectories of anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related traumatic stress (CV19TS) symptomology during the first UK national lockdown. We also sought to explore risk and protective factors. The study was a longitudinal, three-wave survey of UK adults conducted online. Analysis used growth mixture modelling and logistic regressions. Data was collected from 1958 adults. A robust 4-class model for anxiety, depression, and CV19TS symptomology distinguished participants in relation to the severity and stability of symptomology. Classes described low and stable and high and stable symptomology, and symptomology that improved or declined across the study period. Several risk and protection factors were identified as predicting membership of classes (e.g., mental health factors, sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 worries). This study reports trajectories describing a differential impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of UK adults. Some adults experienced psychological distress throughout, some were more vulnerable in the early weeks, and for others vulnerability was delayed.

This patient Is a 30- year-old female healthcare worker with a past medical history of ITP, pancreatitis, GERD, anxiety and recurrent pneumonia. She presented in March 2020 with fever, nasal congestion, and dry cough. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March 2020, via PCR through employee health. She was treated with a course azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. Symptoms resolved, however in June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were negative. Seven months later in October, she once again developed symptoms which were milder. She was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin, normal immunoglobulin levels, and normal streptococcus pneumonia IgG antibodies. On immune work-up after recovery, she was found to have a decreased level of mannose binding lectin (<50 ng/mL), normal immunoglobulin levels, and protective Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG antibodies with appropriate vaccine response. Her SARS-CoV-2 IgG returned back as positive 8 weeks after her second infection.

We used the SARS-CoV-2 MA10 mouse model of acute lung injury to evaluate the immune response and potential for immunopathology in animals vaccinated with research-grade mRNA-1273. Whole-inactivated virus or heat-denatured spike protein subunit vaccines with alum designed to elicit low-potency antibodies and Th2-skewed CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced viral titers and weight loss post-challenge, but more severe pathological changes in the lung compared to saline-immunized animals. In contrast, a protective dose of mRNA-1273 induced favorable humoral and cellular immune responses that protected from viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract upon challenge. A subprotective dose of mRNA-1273 reduced viral replication and limited histopathological manifestations compared to animals given saline. Overall, our findings demonstrate an immunological signature associated with antiviral protection without disease enhancement following vaccination with mRNA-1273.","DiPiazza, Anthony T.; Leist, Sarah R.; Abiona, Olubukola M.; Moliva, Juan I.; Werner, Anne; Minai, Mahnaz; Nagata, Bianca M.; Bock, Kevin W.; Phung, Emily; Schäfer, Alexandra; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Chang, Lauren A.; Loomis, Rebecca J.; Boyoglu-Barnum, Seyhan; Alvarado, Gabriela S.; Sullivan, Nancy J.; Edwards, Darin K.; Morabito, Kaitlyn M.; Mascola, John R.; Carfi, Andrea; Corbett, Kizzmekia S.; Moore, Ian N.; Baric, Ralph S.; Graham, Barney S.; Ruckwardt, Tracy J.",Immunity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761321002624?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761321002624; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2021.06.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34270939/,215

The effects in Europe, with its mature healthcare system, have been far faster and greater than most authorities anticipated. Within six weeks of COVID-19 being declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organisation [WHO] in China, Europe had become the new epicentre of disease. A pandemic was finally declared by the WHO on March 11th 2020. Continued international travel combined with the slow response of some political leaders and a variable focus on economic rather than health consequences resulted in varying containment strategies in response to the threat of the initial wave of the pandemic. It is likely that this variation has contributed to widely differing outcomes across Europe.

In the case of multiple sclerosis, however, there is no such specific model able to provide an overview of the disease; multiple models covering the different pathophysiological features of the disease are therefore necessary. Development We reviewed the different in vitro and in vivo experimental models used in multiple sclerosis research. Concerning in vitro models, we analysed cell cultures and slice models. As for in vivo models, we examined such models of autoimmunity and inflammation as experimental allergic encephalitis in different animals and virus-induced demyelinating diseases. Furthermore, we analysed models of demyelination and remyelination, including chemical lesions caused by cuprizone, lysolecithin, and ethidium bromide; zebrafish; and transgenic models. Conclusions Experimental models provide a deeper understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved in multiple sclerosis. Choosing one model or another depends on the specific aims of the study.","Torre-Fuentes, L.; Moreno-Jiménez, L.; Pytel, V.; Matías-Guiu, J.

The restrictions imposed have undoubtedly led to impairment of the psychological well-being of both teachers and students, and of the way they experience interpersonal relationships. As reported previously in the literature, adverse effects such as loneliness, anxiety, and stress have resulted in a decrease in the cognitive performance of school and higher education students. Therefore, the objective of this work is to present a general overview of the reported adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic which may potentially influence the learning performance of students. Some neuroscientific findings related to memory and cognition, such as neuroplasticity and long-term potentiation, are also shown. We also discuss the positive effects of the practice of mindfulness, as well as other simple recommendations based on neuroscientific findings such as restful sleep, physical activity, and nutrition, which can act on memory and cognition. Finally, we propose some practical recommendations on how to achieve more effective student learning in the context of the pandemic. The aim of this review is to provide some assistance in this changing and uncertain situation in which we all find ourselves, and we hope that some of the information could serve as a starting point for hypotheses to be tested in educational research and their association with neuroscience.","Tortella, Gonzalo R.; Seabra, Amedea B.; Padrão, Jorge; Díaz-San Juan, Rodrigo",Brain Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11050552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925627/,215

As input data, we used COVID-19 epidemiological information collected in fifteen European countries either in private surveys or using official statistics. Thirteen countries implemented lockdown measures, two countries (Sweden, Iceland) not. As output parameters, we studied herd immunity level and time of formation. Comparison of these parameters was used as an indicator of effectiveness / ineffectiveness of lockdown measures. In the absence of a medical vaccine, herd immunity may be regarded as a factor of population adaptation to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2, the viral pathogen causing COVID-19 disease (SARS-CoV-2), and hence COVID-19 spreading stop. We demonstrated that there is no significant difference between lockdown and no-lockdown modes of COVID-19 containment, in terms of both herd immunity level and the time of achieving its maximum. The rationale for personal and business lockdowns may be found in the avoidance of healthcare system overburdening. However, lockdowns do not prevent any virus with droplet transmission (including SARS-CoV-2) from spreading. Therefore, in case of a future viral pathogen emergence, lockdown measures efficiency should not be overestimated, as it was done almost universally in the world during COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharov, Konstantin S.",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110295; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920306913; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994671/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920306913?v=s5,215

In this study, we describe respiratory infections associated with EV‐D68 in Beijing over a 4 year period. Total nucleic acid was extracted from 7,945 clinical specimens collected between January 5, 2011 and July 30, 2015 in Beijing and used for detecting EV‐D68 and other enteroviruses by real‐time PCR. Overall, 555/7,945 (6.99%) specimens were enterovirus positive: 12/7,945 (0.2%) specimens were EV‐D68 positive. Of these patients, 11 were pediatric patients and 1 was a 76‐year‐old man. The main symptoms for the 12 EV‐D68 positive patients were fever (10/12, 83.3%) and cough (6/12, 50%). Ten EV‐D68 infection cases were identified in autumn or winter season. The phylogenetic relationships of the 12 EV‐D68 viral strains with other strains were analyzed based on the sequences of viral protein 1(VP1). The EV‐D68 strains from 2011 to 2013 belonged to groups 1 or 3, while all strains in 2014 were clustered into group 1 together with the strains circulating in the USA. In conclusion, EV‐D68 played a role in respiratory infections in Beijing during this period. In addition, the most common EV‐D68 strain detected was similar to that circulating in the USA in 2014. J.

651026,The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and postpartum care provision,2021-08-14,"At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (10–14 March, 2020) we conducted a survey (n = 1028) of a nationally representative sample (age, sex, and locale) in Poland. Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study. The mediational relationships we found did not vary as a function of whether the data were collected before or after this announcement. The present results suggest that emotional reactions to perceived threats can serve an instrumental function by providing the motivation to engage in coping behaviors. Such a mechanism complements much research on stress that has focused on how coping mediates threat-emotion relationships.","Cypryańska, Marzena; Nezlek, John B.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33125435/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241464,215
652093,COVID‐19 and diabetes: Is there enough evidence?,2020-05-29,"OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused devastating morbidity and mortality worldwide. In particular, thromboembolic complications have emerged as a key threat in COVID-19. We assessed our experience with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with COVID-19 undergoing upper or lower extremity venous duplex ultrasonography at an academic health system in New York City between March 3 2020 and April 12 2020 with follow-up through May 12 2020. A cohort of hospitalized patients without COVID-19 (non-COVID-19) undergoing venous duplex ultrasonography from December 1 2019 to December 31 2019 was used for comparison. The primary outcome was DVT. Secondary outcomes included pulmonary embolism (PE), in-hospital mortality, admission to intensive care unit, and antithrombotic therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors for DVT and mortality. RESULTS: Of 443 patients (188 COVID-19 and 255 non-COVID-19) undergoing venous duplex ultrasonography, patients with COVID-19 had higher incidence of DVT (31% vs. 19%; P=0.005), compared to the non-COVID-19 cohort. The incidence of PE was not statistically different between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cohorts (8% vs. 4%; P=.105). The DVTs in the COVID-19 group were more distal (63% vs. 29%; P<.001) and bilateral (15% vs. 4%; P<.001). The result of duplex ultrasonography had a significant impact on the antithrombotic plan; 42 (72%) patients with COVID-19 in the DVT group had their therapies escalated while 49 (38%) and 3 (2%) patients had their therapies escalated and de-escalated in the non-DVT group, respectively (P<.001). Within the COVID-19 cohort, the D-dimer was significantly higher in the DVT group at the time of admission (2,746 ng/mL vs 1,481 ng/mL; P=.004) and at the time of the duplex exam (6,068 ng/mL vs. 3,049 ng/mL; P<0.01). At multivariable analysis, male sex (odd ratio (OR) 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-4.87; P=.035), ICU admission (OR 3.42; 95% CI, 1.02-11.44; P=.046) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 5.5; 95% CI, 1.01-30.13; P=.049) were independently associated with DVT. CONCLUSION: Given the high incidence of venous thromboembolic events in this population, we support the decision to empirically initiate therapeutic anticoagulation in patients with low bleeding risk and severe COVID-19 infection, with duplex ultrasonography reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion of VTE in which anticoagulation may pose a life-threatening consequence. Further study is warranted in patients with COVID-19 to elucidate the etiology of vascular thromboembolic events and guide prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in these patients.","Chang, Heepeel; Rockman, Caron B.; Jacobowitz, Glenn R.; Speranza, Giancarlo; Johnson, William S.; Horowitz, James M.; Garg, Karan; Maldonado, Thomas S.; Sadek, Mikel; Barfield, Michael E.",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039545/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213333X20305436?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213333X20305436; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvsv.2020.09.010,215

This cohort study investigated comorbidities and clinical outcomes by race among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Methods: This is a case series of critically ill patients admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The study included all critically ill hospitalized patients between March 6, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Clinical outcomes during hospitalization included mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and mortality stratified by race. Results Of 288 patients included (mean age, 63 +/- 16 years; 45% female), 210 (73%) were African American. African Americans had significantly higher rates of comorbidities compared to other races, including hypertension (80% vs 59%, p=0.001), diabetes (49% vs 34%, p=0.026) and mean BMI (33 kg/m2vs 28 kg/m2, p<0.001).

Our results show that the network of papers in a journal is scale-free and that eigenvector centrality (1) is an effective filter and article-level metric and (2) correlates well with citation counts within a given journal. However, closeness centrality is a poor filter because articles fit within a small range of citations.

Our aim was to assess the time to resolution of respiratory and systemic symptoms and their associated factors. METHODS: Cohort study including adult outpatients, managed with Covidom, a telesurveillance solution, with RT-PCR confirmed diagnosis, from March 9(th) 2020 until February 23(rd) 2021. Follow-up was 30 days after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among the 9,667 patients included, mean age was 43.2±14.0 years, and 67.5% were female (n=6,522). Median body mass index (BMI) (IQR) was 25.0 kg/m(2) (22.1-28.8). Main comorbidities were: hypertension (12.9%; n=1247), asthma (11.0%; n=1063), and diabetes mellitus (5.5%; n=527). The most frequent symptom during follow-up was dyspnea (65.1%; n=6,296), followed by tachypnea (49.9%; n=4,821), shivers (45.6%; n=4,410), and fever (36.7%; n=3,550). Median time to resolution of systemic and respiratory symptoms were 3 days (95% CI: 2−4) and 7 days (95% CI: 6−8), respectively. Ultimately, 17.2% (95% CI: 15.7%−18.8%) still presented respiratory symptoms at day 30. Longer time to respiratory symptom resolution was associated with older age, increased BMI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease, asthma, and heart failure. Regarding systemic symptoms, coronary artery disease, asthma, age above 40 years, and elevated BMI were associated with longer time to resolution. CONCLUSIONS: Time to symptom resolution among outpatients with COVID-19 seemed shorter for systemic than respiratory symptoms. Prolonged respiratory symptoms were common at day 30. Risk factors associated with later resolution included age, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases.","Dinh, Aurélien; Jaulmes, Luc; Dechartres, Agnès; Duran, Clara; Mascitti, Hélène; Lescure, Xavier; Yordanov, Youri; Jourdain, Patrick",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.08.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34481989/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X2100481X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X2100481X?v=s5,215

655192,COVID-19: the lessons learned amongst the losses,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation in intensive care for 48 h or longer is associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which might be present at the time ventilatory support is instituted or develop afterwards, predominantly during the first 5 days. Survivors of prolonged mechanical ventilation and ARDS are at risk of considerably impaired physical function that can persist for years. An early pathogenic mechanism of lung injury in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients is inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrin deposition, leading to thrombosis of the microvasculature and hyaline membrane formation in the air sacs. The main aim of this study was to determine if nebulised heparin, which targets fibrin deposition, would limit lung injury and thereby accelerate recovery of physical function in patients with or at risk of ARDS. METHODS: The Can Heparin Administration Reduce Lung Injury (CHARLI) study was an investigator-initiated, multicentre, double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial across nine hospitals in Australia. Adult intensive care patients on invasive ventilation, with impaired oxygenation defined by a PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio of less than 300, and with the expectation of invasive ventilation beyond the next calendar day were recruited. Key exclusion criteria were heparin allergy, pulmonary bleeding, and platelet count less than 50 X 10(9)/L. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1, with stratification by site and using blocks of variable size and random seed, via a web-based system, to either unfractionated heparin sodium 25 000 IU in 5 mL or identical placebo (sodium chloride 0·9% 5 mL), administered using a vibrating mesh membrane nebuliser every 6 h to day 10 while invasively ventilated. Patients, clinicians, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the Short Form 36 Health Survey Physical Function Score (out of 100) of survivors at day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes, which are exploratory, included development of ARDS to day 5 among at-risk patients, deterioration of the Murray Lung Injury Score (MLIS) to day 5, mortality at day 60, residence of survivors at day 60, and serious adverse events. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. There was no imputation of missing data. The trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register, number ACTRN12612000418875 . FINDINGS: Between Sept 4, 2012, and Aug 23, 2018, 256 patients were randomised. Final follow-up was on Feb 25, 2019. We excluded three patients who revoked consent and one ineligible participant who received no intervention. Of 252 patients included in data analysis, the mean age was 58 years (SD 15), 157 (62%) were men, and 118 (47%) had ARDS. 128 (51%) patients were assigned to the heparin group and 124 (49%) to the placebo group, all of whom received their assigned intervention. Survivors in the heparin group (n=97) had similar SF-36 Physical Function Scores at day 60 compared to the placebo group (n=94; mean 53·6 [SD 31·6] vs 48·7 [35·7]; difference 4·9 [95% CI −4·8 to 14·5]; p=0·32). Compared with the placebo group, the heparin group had fewer cases of ARDS develop to day 5 among the at-risk patients (nine [15%] of 62 patients vs 21 [30%] of 71 patients; hazard ratio 0·46 [95% CI 0·22 to 0·98]; p=0·0431), less deterioration of the MLIS to day 5 (difference −0·14 [–0·26 to −0·02]; p=0·0215), similar day 60 mortality (23 [18%] of 127 patients vs 18 [15%] of 123 patients; odds ratio [OR] 1·29 [95% CI 0·66 to 2·53]; p=0·46), and more day 60 survivors at home (86 [87%] of 99 patients vs 73 [73%] of 100 patients; OR 2·45 [1·18 to 5·08]; p=0·0165). A similar number of serious adverse events occurred in each group (seven [5%] of 128 patients in the heparin group vs three [2%] of 124 patients in the placebo group; OR 2·33 [0·59 to 9·24]; p=0·23), which were a transient increase in airway pressure during nebulisation (n=3 in the heparin group), major non-pulmonary bleeding (n=2 in each group), haemoptysis (n=1 in the heparin group), tracheotomy site bleeding (n=1 in the heparin group), and hypoxaemia during nebulisation (n=1 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: In patients with or at risk of ARDS, nebulised heparin did not improve self-reported performance of daily physical activities, but was well tolerated and exploratory outcomes suggest less progression of lung injury and earlier return home. Further research is justified to establish if nebulised heparin accelerates recovery in those who have or are at risk of ARDS.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, and depression among people with chronic diseases working in healthcare and in other professions. The study participants were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of 441 healthcare workers, and the second consisted of 572 non-healthcare professionals. Correlation analysis showed a strong correlation between autoimmune diseases and an increase in GAD-7 scale, ISI score, and PHQ-9 scale. Therefore, only autoimmune diseases were included for further analyses as a predictor of insomnia, depression, and anxiety. After adjusting the results for gender, age, smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and profession, the group with autoimmune diseases showed a more than a 2-fold increase in the risk of anxiety symptoms, a more than 2.5-fold increase in the risk of depressive symptoms, and a 4-fold increase in the risk of insomnia symptoms. This study shows that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety disorders, and depressive disorders may depend on the pre-existent health status of an individual rather than on their profession.","Wańkowicz, Paweł; Szylińska, Aleksandra; Rotter, Iwona",Brain Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439620/; https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11081001,215
657377,Hospital admission and mortality rates for non-covid diseases in Denmark during covid-19 pandemic: nationwide population based cohort study,2021-05-25,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected clinical practice in oncology, leading to organizational, ethical, and medical issues. In particular, it has raised challenges in the context of competing care priorities between COVID-19 and cancer treatment. Residents on the front line face difficulties related to increasing care needs and urgent reorganization of health care systems while managing psychological stress and uncertainty. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oncology residents. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a national survey (39 questions) in France among oncology and radiation therapy residents to determine the psychological impact and professional difficulties (eg, reassignment, training/research time, supervision, teleworking, management of patients) associated with the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 222 residents (medical oncologists, 61%; radiation therapists, 39%) participated in our survey, representing approximately one third of all residents and fellows in France. One third of respondents had been reassigned to a COVID-19 ward. Training and research activity decreased for 89% and 41% of respondents, respectively. Two thirds (70%) of respondents declared that they had faced ethical issues, 35% felt worried about their own health, and 23% experienced psychological distress. According to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, 32% were anxious and 17% depressed. Consumption of tobacco, psychostimulants, and alcohol increased in 31%, 24%, and 29% of respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: French oncology residents were highly affected by the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of professional activity and psychological impact. This national survey can be used as a basis for improved management, medical reorganization, and training of residents during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Hilmi, Marc; Boilève, Alice; Ducousso, Anabelle; Michalet, Morgan; Turpin, Anthony; Neuzillet, Cindy; Naoun, Natacha",JCO Glob Oncol,https://doi.org/10.1200/go.20.00376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151771/,215
657833,Retrospective Analysis of Retinal Imaging in COVID-19 Positive Patients at a Tertiary Eye Care Center,2021-09-03,"COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, is thought to cause a milder illness in pregnancy with a greater proportion of asymptomatic carriers. This has important implications for the risk of patient-to-staff, staff-to-staff and staff-to patient transmission among health professionals in maternity. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of previously undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health professionals from two tertiary-level maternity units in London, UK and to determine associations between HCW characteristics, reported symptoms and serological evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. 200 anaesthetists, midwives and obstetricians with no previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were tested for immune seroconversion using laboratory IgG assays. Comprehensive symptom and medical histories were also collected. 5/40 (12.5%; 95% CI: 4.2-26.8) anaesthetists, 7/52 (13.5%; 95% CI: 5.6-25.8%) obstetricians and 17/108 (15.7%; 95% CI: 9.5-24.0%) midwives were seropositive, with an overall total of 29/200 (14.5%; 95% CI: 9.9-20.1%) of maternity healthcare workers testing positive for IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of those who had seroconverted, 10/29 (35.5%) were completely asymptomatic. Fever or cough were only present in 6/29 (20.7%) and (10/29 (34.5%) respectively. Anosmia was the most common symptom occurring in 15/29 (51.7%) seropositive participants and was the only symptom that was predictive of positive seroconversion (OR 18; 95% CI 6 to 55). 58.6% of those who were seropositive had not self-isolated at any point and continued to provide patient care in the hospital setting. This study was the largest study of baseline immune seroconversion in maternity healthcare workers conducted to date and reveals that 1 in 6 were seropositive, of whom 1 in 3 were asymptomatic. This has significant implications for the risk of occupational transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for both staff and patients in maternity and regular testing of staff, including asymptomatic staff should be considered to reduce transmission risk.","Bampoe, Sohail; Lucas, Dominique Nuala; Neall, Georgina; Sceales, Penny; Aggarwal, Reena; Siassakos, Dimitrios; Odor, Peter Mark",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20139352; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20139352v1?rss=1,215

The analysis shows that economic growth contributed to most of the reduction in all periods. Increasing inequality has adverse effects on poverty elimination in that it makes people vulnerable to poverty, which bodes ill for future poverty alleviation. Wages explain most of poverty change for both the urban and rural areas in recent years and are the main reason for increasing inequality in rural areas. Agricultural income played a significant role in reducing rural poverty and inequality in early periods when China experienced many agricultural reforms. In the future, pro-poor growth, reducing inequality and building a relatively integrated urban–rural poverty alleviation system will be most important jobs for China’s poverty reduction.","Fang, Yingfeng; Zhang, Fen",Soc Indic Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-021-02716-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34025006/,215

Significant efforts to improving safety have been employed, including the use of personal protective equipment, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the use of a modified surgical mask barrier. OBJECTIVE: To reduce the risks of pathogen transmission during endoscopic skull base surgery. METHODS: This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. Our study utilizes a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed mask with an anterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports to accommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube. As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar served as a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub endosheath to create an airtight seal. Surgical freedom and aerosolization were tested in both modalities. RESULTS: The ventilated mask allowed for excellent surgical maneuverability and freedom. The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches. Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar. CONCLUSION: The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era. The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available. Additional studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings.","Helman, Samuel N; Soriano, Roberto M; Tomov, Martin L; Serpooshan, Vahid; Levy, Joshua M; Pradilla, Gustavo; Solares, C Arturo",Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown),https://doi.org/10.1093/ons/opaa168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472685/,215
658816,Diagnostic and prognostic values of cutaneous manifestations in COVID‐19,2020-06-02,"Viruses do not carry their own protein biosynthesis machinery and the translation of viral proteins therefore requires that the virus usurps the machinery of the host cell. To allow optimal translation of viral proteins at the expense of cellular proteins, virus families have evolved a variety of methods to repress the host translation machinery, while allowing effective viral protein synthesis. Many viruses use noncanonical mechanisms that permit translation of their own RNAs under these conditions. Viruses have also developed mechanisms to evade host innate immune responses that would repress translation under conditions of viral infection, in particular PKR activation in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Importantly, the study of viral translation mechanisms has enormously enhanced our understanding of many aspects of the cellular protein biosynthesis pathway and its components. A number of unusual mechanisms of translation initiation that were first discovered in viruses have since been observed in cellular mRNAs, and it has become apparent that a diverse range of translation mechanisms operates in eukaryotes, allowing subtle regulation of this essential process.","Roberts, Lisa O.; Jopling, Catherine L.; Jackson, Richard J.; Willis, Anne E.",Prog Mol Biol Transl Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/s1877-1173(09)90009-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20374746/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877117309900096; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877117309900096,215

Oxygen delivery by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a feasible option that enables a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and may theoretically reduce the need for intubation compared to HFNC but direct comparative evidence is lacking. METHODS: We plan to perform an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised trial at an intermediate-level COVID-19 cohort ward in Helsingborg Hospital, southern Sweden. We have estimated a required sample size of 120 patients randomised 1:1 to HFNC or Helmet CPAP to achieve 90% power to detect superiority at a 0.05 significance level regarding the primary outcome of ventilator free days (VFD) within 28 days using a Mann-Whitney U test. Patient recruitment is planned to being June 2020 and be completed in the first half of 2021. DISCUSSION: We hypothesise that the use of Helmet CPAP will reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the use of HFNC without having a negative effect on survival.

659656,The Cochrane Systematic Review on Thoracic Imaging Tests for the Diagnosis of COVID-19,2021-03-23,"OBJECTIVES: This paper review trends in emerging infections and the need for increased clinical and laboratory surveillance. METHODS: Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.","Petersen, E.; Petrosillo, N.; Koopmans, M.",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X17306419; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X17306419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29155018/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2017.10.035,215

The aim of the current study was to assess the effects of perceived social support on compliance with stay-at-home orders in response to a COVID-19 outbreak during the Persian New Year (Nowruz) holydays, since Nowruz holidays of 2020 coincided with the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 20.5% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first 2 weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered people’s compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR = .874, 95% CI = .803, .950, p < .005), friends (OR = 1.147, 95% CI = 1.076, 1.222, p < .001) and a significant other person (OR = .926, 95% CI = .849, 1.010, p = .084). CONCLUSIONS: Public health messaging may need to emphasize the role that friends and families can play in helping to protect those in their friendship/family groups by promoting compliance with social distancing.

E. rectale, butyrate-producing bacteria, was administered to BD mice. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and lymph node cells were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry. 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis was performed in the feces of mice to determine the differences in the composition of the microbial population between normal and BD mice. Serum cytokine levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The frequency of DC activation marker CD83 positive cells was significantly increased in PBL of BD mice. Frequencies of CD83+ cells were also significantly increased in patients with active BD. 16S rRNA metagenomic analysis revealed different gut microbiota composition between normal and BD mice. The administration of E. rectale to BD mice reduced the frequency of CD83+ cells and significantly increased the frequency of NK1.1+ cells with the improvement of symptoms. The co-administration of colchicine and E. rectale also significantly reduced the frequency of CD83+ cells. Differences in gut microbiota were observed between normal mice and BD mice, and the administration of E. rectale downregulated the frequency of CD83, which was associated with BD deterioration. These data indicate that E. rectale could be a new therapeutic adjuvant for BD management.","Islam, S. M.

664795,ENT manifestation in COVID-19 patients,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Chronic and palliative care are rapidly gaining importance within the physician’s range of duties. In this context, it is important to address the four dimensions of care: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. Medical students, however, feel inadequately equipped to discuss these dimensions with the patient. To bridge this gap, a new assignment was developed and implemented, in which students talked to a chronic or palliative patient about the four dimensions of care during an internship. This study, reports the evaluation of this assignment by students and teachers using a design-based approach. METHODS: Mixed methods were used, including a) student questionnaires, b) student focus groups, c) teacher interviews, and d) student’s written reflections. Two researchers performed analyses of the qualitative data from the focus groups, interviews, and written reflections using qualitative research software (ALTLAS.TI). Descriptive statistics were computed for the quantitative data using SPSS 21.0. RESULTS: Students and teachers valued talking to an actual patient about the four dimensions of care. Reading and providing peer feedback on each other’s reports was considered valuable, especially when it came to the diversity of illnesses, the way that patients cope and communication techniques. The students considered reflection useful, especially in the group and provided it was not too frequent. All the dimensions were addressed in the interviews, however the spiritual dimension was found to be the most difficult to discuss. The analysis of the written reflections revealed an overlap between the social and spiritual dimensions. Students pay a lot of attention to the relationship between the illness and the patient’s daily life, but the reflections do often not show insight in the potential relationship between the four dimensions and decisions in patient care. CONCLUSIONS: During internships, medical students can practice talking about four dimensions of care with a chronically ill or palliative patient. Due to the format, it can be implemented across existing internships with relatively little extra time and effort. Reflection, peer feedback, and group discussion under the guidance of a teacher are important additions.

One of the great concerns and challenges, mainly in low-income and middle-income countries, is the identification and monitoring of COVID-19 cases. The large-scale availability of testing is a fundamental aspect of COVID-19 control, but it is currently the biggest challenge faced by many countries around the world. We aimed to synthesise and critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the influence of the testing capacity for symptomatic individuals in the control of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review will be conducted in eight databases, such as Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, ISI-of-Knowledge, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, SCOPUS, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, PsycINFO and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, from inception to 30 July 2020. No restriction regarding the language, publication date or setting will be employed. Primary outcomes will include the sensitivity as well as the specificity of the tests for COVID-19. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Methodological assessment of the studies will be evaluated by the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomised controlled trials, the MINORS for non-randomised studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort or case–control studies. Findings will be structured according to the test type and target population characteristics and focused on the primary outcomes (sensitivity and specificity). Moreover, if sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be performed. Pooled standardised mean differences and 95% CIs will be calculated. Heterogeneity between the studies will be determined by I(2) statistics. Subgroup analyses will also be conducted. Publication bias will be assessed with funnel plots and Egger’s test. Heterogeneity will be explored by random effects analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required. The results will be disseminated widely via peer-reviewed publication and presentations at conferences related to this field.

Anxiety is one of the most important consequences of coronavirus. The nurse-led telephone follow-ups (tele-nursing) are a way to train nurses to further improve nursing services and increase the patients' well-being. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nurse-led telephone follow-ups (tele-nursing) on the level of anxiety of people with coronavirus who spend their quarantine and treatment at home. METHODS: In this semi-experimental study, the number of sample was 100 newly diagnosed patients with Corona, who were tested positive using the CT scan of the lungs and were selected by continuous sampling. In this study, Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory was used to collect data before and after the intervention. Samples were randomly divided into control and intervention groups (50 subjects in each group) after receiving initial training in the form of lectures on the corona disease, and the tele-nursing program was implemented on the intervention group every other day for 21 consecutive days. Finally, after the end of the 21(st) day and the completion of the tele-nursing intervention, the questionnaire was again completed by the control and intervention groups and the results of both groups were compared. RESULTS: The results indicated that the level of anxiety in the two groups after the training program and tele-nursing were significantly different (p < 0.001) and the mean score of the anxiety level after the training program and tele-nursing was significantly reduced (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study showed that tele-nursing has had a significant effect on reducing the anxiety level of people with Cavid-19 virus. As the telephone technology is available in most clients' homes and its use is easy and accessible, it is recommend including this technology in the field of nursing care and training especially in relation to people with coronavirus.","Chakeri, Azin; Jalali, Ehsan; Ghadi, Maryam Rostami; Mohamadi, Maryam",J Family Med Prim Care,https://doi.org/10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_847_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409214/,215

In this commentary, we discuss the unintended consequences the pandemic has had on various social determinants of health among FSW. We draw on a review of scholarly and grey literature, complemented by our experience with the Exit Doors Here program, a sex work exiting program implemented in Toronto, Canada. Due to COVID-19, many FSW suddenly lost their main source of income, work conditions became riskier, and sheltering-in-place presented challenges for women with no safe housing. The slowdown of social and health care services also meant FSW were not receiving the required attention. We make recommendations for intersectoral mitigation strategies to limit the short- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 on FSW health and livelihoods. Recommendations focus on addressing women’s marginalizing circumstances and speak to a gender transformative approach to the COVID-19 recovery. Our recommendations are relevant to FSW and other marginalized groups, in the current context and in the context of future health, social, and economic crises.","Shareck, Martine; Hassan, Maha; Buhariwala, Pearl; Perri, Melissa; Balla, Ermelina; O’Campo, Patricia",J Prim Care Community Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/21501327211031760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34235993/,215

Moreover, the current health crisis is going to force governments to review the structure of the public budget to most effectively alleviate the negative economic and health effects on the population. Objective: The aim of this paper is to analyze the relative importance of globalization and the public budget composition—specifically the participation of public expenditure on healthcare, social services and environment in gross domestic product (GDP)—on life expectancy at birth in European countries during the period 1995–2017. Methods: The Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) methodology was applied to analyze the socioeconomic determinants of life expectancy at birth. Results: Our findings show that globalization has no relative importance as an explanatory variable of life expectancy in European countries, while government expenditure on social protection is the most relevant followed by public expenditure on health, gross national income per capita, education level of the population and public expenditure on environmental protection.

We used data from the 2018 Wellcome Global Monitor survey (comprising nationally representative samples from 144 countries) to examine levels and correlates of trust in governments and health workers and attitudes toward vaccines. Only one-quarter of respondents globally expressed a lot of trust in their government (trust was more common among people with less schooling, those living in rural areas, those who were financially comfortable, and those who were older), and fewer than half of respondents globally said that they trust doctors and nurses a lot. People's trust in these institutions was correlated with trust in health or medical advice from them, and with more positive attitudes toward vaccines. Vaccine enthusiasm varied substantially across regions, with safety being the most common concern. Policy makers should understand that the public may have varying levels of trust in different institutions and actors. Although much attention is paid to crafting public health messages, it may be equally important, especially during a pandemic, to identify appropriate, trusted messengers to deliver those messages more effectively to different target populations.","Moucheraud, Corrina; Guo, Huiying; Macinko, James",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34339250/,215

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A delay of more than 21 days in the planned chemotherapy was defined as “delayed chemotherapy.” Forty-five patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer were delayed between January 1 and March 30, 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Thirty-two cases were enrolled in this study. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used in 8 cases; palliative chemotherapy was used in 5 cases; and maintenance chemotherapy was used in 19 cases. Data included age, pathological type, surgical pathological stage, chemotherapy time and CA125 levels were collected. The half-life of CA125 and the decrease in CA125 levels before and after delayed chemotherapy were calculated. RESULTS: No patient got coronavirus disease. Compared with patients of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube epithelial cancer and peritoneal epithelial cancer in the same periods in 2019, the half-life of CA125 in neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and recurrence chemotherapy group were more than 20 days, but there was no significant difference. Only when the delayed chemotherapy took place before CA125 turned negative, accompanied by an interval of more than 60 days, the CA125 half-life and the decreased range of CA125 were totally affected. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence to support that once chemotherapy was delayed it would influence the decrease of CA125, but whether it would affect the long-term effects such as recurrence and five-year survival rate remains to be further followed up.","Yi, Qiang; Ran, Yu; Li, Cong",Cancer Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33500665/; https://doi.org/10.2147/cmar.s289773,215

This study aimed to provide an overview of the current situation of anti-COVID-19 measures in Japanese enterprises, considering company size. Methods: This study was an Internet-based nationwide cross-sectional study. Data were collected using an online self-administered questionnaire in December 2020 during the third wave of COVID-19. The chi-squared test for trend was performed to calculate the p-value for trend for each workplace measure across company sizes. Results: For the 27,036 participants, across company sizes, the most prevalent workplace measure was encouraging mask wearing at work, followed by requesting that employees refrain from going to work when ill and restricting work-related social gatherings and entertainment. These measures were implemented by approximately 90% of large-scale enterprises and by more than 40% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. In contrast, encouraging remote working and restricting eating and drinking at personal workspaces were implemented by less than half of large-scale enterprises and by around 15% of micro- and small-scale enterprises. There were statistically significant differences in all workplace measures by company size (all p-values < .001). Conclusions: We found that various responses to COVID-19 had been taken in workplaces. However, some measures, including remote working, were still not well implemented, especially in smaller enterprises. The findings suggest that occupational health support for MSMEs is urgently needed to mitigate the current wave of COVID-19.","Ishimaru, T.; Nagata, M.; Hino, A.; Yamashita, S.; Tateishi, S.; Tsuji, M.; Ogami, A.; Matsuda, S.; Fujino, Y.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.14.21251716v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.14.21251716,215

An effective vaccine should be able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies to prevent the virus from attaching to the host cell receptors. However, to elicit the protective levels of antibodies, a vaccine may require multiple doses or assistance from other immunostimulatory molecules. Further, the vaccine should be able to induce protective levels of antibodies rapidly with the least amount of antigen used. This not only decreases the cost of a vaccine and make it affordable, but also reduces the quantity of the antigen used. As the pandemic has hit most countries across the globe, there will be an overwhelming demand for the vaccine in a quick time. Incorporating a suitable adjuvant in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may address these requirements. This review paper will discuss the experimental results of the adjuvanted vaccine studies with similar coronaviruses (CoVs) which might be useful to select an appropriate adjuvant for a vaccine against rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2.

We examined whether land-based gambling product supply restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted gambling problems and gambling engagement. In a three-wave, online, longitudinal study, 462 Australian adults (M(age) = 44.94; 87% male) who gambled completed survey measures of demographics, gambling engagement (land-based and online), gambling problems, and psychological distress. Analyses were pre-registered and examined the impacts of restrictions on gambling problems and engagement. During the period of restrictions, there were no significant differences in gambling problems (OR = 0.88 [95%CI 0.55–1.42], p = .610) nor online gambling (B = 4.48 [95%CI-0.40–9.35], p = .071) between states experiencing and not experiencing restrictions. There was a small overall reduction in gambling engagement at 2-(t = 2.03, p = .043) and 5-months (t = 2.37, p = .019) post-restrictions, but no change in gambling problems (t = 1.25, p = .211; t = 1.50, p = .134). Amongst those at moderate-to-high risk of problems at baseline, there were no significant reductions in gambling engagement (t = 0.58, p = .564; t = 1.20, p = .232) or problems (t = 0.92, p = .359; t = 1.53, p = .126) at 2- and 5-months post-restrictions. Findings show only a modest impact of COVID-related supply restrictions on gambling engagement and no impact on gambling problems up to 5 months follow-up.

675146,"Letter to the Editor response regarding ""COVID-19 and neurosurgery consultation call volume at a single large tertiary center with a propensity-adjusted analysis""",2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: Low sexual desire and arousal are the most common sexual concerns in women, but most women lack access to effective treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Web-based psychological interventions, which are economical, private, easily accessible, and potentially effective, may increase the reach of evidence-based treatment. AIM: To determine the feasibility of translating cognitive behavioral therapy for the most common female sexual dysfunction, Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, into an online format. The present study examined the feasibility of an introductory psychoeducational module of eSense, an online program currently being developed that is based on existing empirically supported in-person treatments, which delivers content to the user in a visually appealing and interactive manner. METHODS: Sixteen cisgender women (M age = 31.9) with female sexual arousal/interest disorder worked through a pilot module of eSense inperson at a sexual health laboratory. OUTCOMES: Qualitative semistructured interviews and online questionnaires were used to assess participants’ experiences of usability of the platform, clarity/relevance of the content, satisfaction with the experience, and any changes in clinical outcomes of sexual function and distress. RESULTS: Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the website’s functionality and presentation. They reported greater knowledge, felt validated and more hopeful, and were eager to continue the remaining modules. Participants also reported notable prepost improvements in sexual desire, arousal, and satisfaction. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Initial user-experience assessment may represent a method of simultaneously improving online interventions and providing therapeutic education to participants. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: This is one of the first studies, to our knowledge, to test a graphics-rich, interactive online intervention for sexual difficulties that does not require direct contact with expert providers or support groups. Limitations include the high level of education, motivation, and technical fluency of the sample and the potentially confounding effect of the researcher’s presence during interviews. Because this was a feasibility study, the sample size was small, and no control group was included, limiting conclusions about efﬁcacy and generalizability. CONCLUSION: The format of eSense appears to be feasible and usable, lending support to the growing evidence that it is possible to take in-person therapeutic interventions online.

Several groups have focused on the potential treatment utility of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) for hypertensive COVID-19 patients, with inconclusive evidence thus far. We couple electronic medical record (EMR) and registry data of 3,643 patients from Spain, Italy, Germany, Ecuador, and the US with a machine learning framework to personalize the prescription of ACEIs and ARBs to hypertensive COVID-19 patients. Our approach leverages clinical and demographic information to identify hospitalized individuals whose probability of mortality or morbidity can decrease by prescribing this class of drugs. In particular, the algorithm proposes increasing ACEI/ARBs prescriptions for patients with cardiovascular disease and decreasing prescriptions for those with low oxygen saturation at admission. We show that personalized recommendations can improve patient outcomes by 1.0% compared to the standard of care when applied to external populations. We develop an interactive interface for our algorithm, providing physicians with an actionable tool to easily assess treatment alternatives and inform clinical decisions. This work offers the first personalized recommendation system to accurately evaluate the efficacy and risks of prescribing ACEIs and ARBs to hypertensive COVID-19 patients.","Bertsimas, D.; Borenstein, A.; Mingardi, L.; Nohadani, O.; Orfanoudaki, A.; Stellato, B.; Wiberg, H.; Sarin, P.; Varelmann, D.; Estrada, V.; Macaya, C.; Nunez Gil, I.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20223594; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.30.20223594v1?rss=1,215

Despite the existing infection prevention strategies in hospitals, the disease continues to spread and causes extensive and numerous outbreaks. Hence, there is a need to investigate the possibility of airborne transmission of norovirus. In this study, we developed an experimental setup for studies on the infectivity of aerosolized murine norovirus (MNV), a model for the human norovirus. Two aerosol generation principles were evaluated: bubble bursting, a common natural aerosolization mechanism, and nebulization, a common aerosolization technique in laboratory studies. The aerosolization setup was characterized by physical and viral dilution factors, generated aerosol particle size distributions, and the viral infectivity after aerosolization. We found a lower physical dilution factor when using the nebulization generator than with the bubble bursting generator. The viral dilution factor of the system was higher than the physical dilution; however, when comparing the physical and viral dilution factors, bubble bursting generation was more efficient. The infectivity per virus was similar using either generation principle, suggesting that the generation itself had a minor impact on MNV infectivity and that instead, the effect of drying in air could be a major reason for infectivity losses.","Alsved, Malin; Widell, Anders; Dahlin, Henrik; Karlson, Sara; Medstrand, Patrik; Löndahl, Jakob",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994471/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72932-5,215

On March 29, 2020, a staff member in a correctional and detention facility in Louisiana developed symptoms† and later had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. During April 2-May 7, two additional cases were detected among staff members, and 36 cases were detected among incarcerated and detained persons at the facility; these persons were removed from dormitories and isolated, and the five dormitories that they had resided in before diagnosis were quarantined. On May 7, CDC and the Louisiana Department of Health initiated an investigation to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among incarcerated and detained persons residing in quarantined dormitories. Goals of this investigation included evaluating COVID-19 symptoms in this setting and assessing the effectiveness of serial testing to identify additional persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of efforts to mitigate transmission. During May 7-21, testing of 98 incarcerated and detained persons residing in the five quarantined dormitories (A-E) identified an additional 71 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection; 32 (45%) were among persons who reported no symptoms at the time of testing, including three who were presymptomatic. Eighteen cases (25%) were identified in persons who had received negative test results during previous testing rounds. Serial testing of contacts from shared living quarters identified persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection who would not have been detected by symptom screening alone or by testing at a single time point. Prompt identification and isolation of infected persons is important to reduce further transmission in congregate settings such as correctional and detention facilities and the communities to which persons return when released.","Njuguna, Henry; Wallace, Megan; Simonson, Sean; Tobolowsky, Farrell A.; James, Allison E.; Bordelon, Keith; Fukunaga, Rena; Gold, Jeremy A.

Understanding and monitoring the genetic evolution of the virus, its geographical characteristics, and its stability are particularly important for controlling the spread of the disease and especially for the development of a universal vaccine covering all circulating strains. From this perspective, we analyzed 30,983 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 79 countries located in the six continents and collected from December 24, 2019, to May 13, 2020, according to the GISAID database. Our analysis revealed the presence of 3,206 variant sites, with a uniform distribution of mutation types in different geographic areas. Remarkably, a low frequency of recurrent mutations has been observed; only 169 mutations (5.27%) had a prevalence greater than 1% of genomes. Nevertheless, fourteen non-synonymous hotspot mutations (> 10%) have been identified at different locations along the viral genome; eight in ORF1ab polyprotein (in nsp2, nsp3, transmembrane domain, RdRp, helicase, exonuclease, and endoribonuclease), three in nucleocapsid protein and one in each of three proteins: spike, ORF3a, and ORF8. Moreover, 36 non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RBD of the spike protein with a low prevalence (<1%) across all genomes, of which only four could potentially enhance the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor. These results along with mutational frequency dissimilarity and intra-genomic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 could indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 is not yet adapted to its host. Unlike the influenza virus or HIV viruses, the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 makes the development of an effective global vaccine very likely.","Alouane, Tarek; Laamarti, Meriem; Essabbar, Abdelomunim; Hakmi, Mohammed; Bouricha, El Mehdi; Chemao-Elfihri, M.

In beef cattle, agronomic biofortification with Se is a more practical alternative for Se supplementation, whereby the Se concentration of hay is increased through the use of Se-containing fertilizer amendments. It has been previously demonstrated that agronomic Se biofortification is an effective strategy to improve immunity and performance in Se-replete weaned beef calves. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of feeding beef cows Se-enriched alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hay during the last 8 to 12 wk of gestation on passive transfer of antibodies to calves. At 10 wk ± 16 d before calving, 45 cows were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups with 3 pens (5 cows/pen) per treatment: Control cows were fed non-Se-fortified alfalfa hay plus a mineral supplement containing 120 mg/kg Se from sodium selenite, Med-Se cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 45.0 g Se/ha as sodium selenate, and High-Se cows were fed alfalfa hay fertilized with 89.9 g Se/ha as sodium selenate; both the Med-Se and the High-Se groups received mineral supplement without added Se. Colostrum and whole blood (WB) were collected from cows at calving, and WB was collected from calves within 2 h of calving and at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h of age. Concentrations of IgG1 and J-5 Escherichia coli antibody in cow colostrum and calf serum were quantified using ELISA procedures. Selenium concentrations linearly increased in WB (P < 0.001) and colostrum (P < 0.001) of cows and in WB of newborn calves (P < 0.001) with increasing Se concentration in alfalfa hay. Colostrum concentrations of IgG1 (P = 0.03) were increased in cows fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay, but J-5 E. coli antibody (P = 0.43) concentrations were not. Calf serum IgG1 (P = 0.43) and J-5 E. coli antibody (P = 0.44) concentrations during the first 48 h of age were not affected by prior Se treatment of cows. These data suggest that feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay promotes the accumulation of Se and antibodies in colostrum but does not affect short-term serum antibody concentrations in calves.","Wallace, L.

681351,Informed Consent for Scholarly Articles during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, medical journals have emphasized the increasingly critical role that social media plays in the dissemination of public health information and disease prevention guidelines. However, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter continue to pose unique challenges for clinical health care providers and public health officials alike. In order to effectively communicate during public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly critical for health care providers and public health officials to understand how patients gather health-related information on the internet and adjudicate the merits of such information. OBJECTIVE: With that goal in mind, we conducted a survey of 1003 US-based adults to better understand how health consumers have used social media to learn and stay informed about the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which they have relied on credible scientific information sources, and how they have gone about fact-checking pandemic-related information. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted with a sample that was purchased through an industry-leading market research provider. The results were reported with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of 3. Participants included 1003 US-based adults (aged ≥18 years). Participants were selected via a stratified quota sampling approach to ensure that the sample was representative of the US population. Balanced quotas were determined (by region of the country) for gender, age, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: The results showed a heavy reliance on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic; more than three-quarters of respondents (762/1003, 76%) reported that they have relied on social media at least “a little,” and 59.2% (594/1003) of respondents indicated that they read information about COVID-19 on social media at least once per week. According to the findings, most social media users (638/1003, 63.6%) were unlikely to fact-check what they see on the internet with a health professional, despite the high levels of mistrust in the accuracy of COVID-19–related information on social media. We also found a greater likelihood of undergoing vaccination among those following more credible scientific sources on social media during the pandemic (χ(2)(16)=50.790; φ=0.258; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that health professionals will need to be both strategic and proactive when engaging with health consumers on social media if they hope to counteract the deleterious effects of misinformation and disinformation. Effective training, institutional support, and proactive collaboration can help health professionals adapt to the evolving patterns of health information seeking.","Neely, Stephen; Eldredge, Christina; Sanders, Ron",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/29802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043526/,215

The potential of DNA vaccines to act in presence of maternal antibodies, its stability and cost effectiveness and the non-requirement of cold chain have heightened the prospects. Even though great strides have been made in nucleic acid vaccination, still there are many areas that need further research for its wholesome practical implementation. Major areas of concern are vaccine delivery, designing of suitable vectors and cytotoxic T cell responses. Also, the induction of immune responses by DNA vaccines is inconclusive due to the lack of knowledge regarding the concentration of the protein expressed in vivo. Alternative delivery systems having higher transfection efficiency and the use of cytokines, as immunomodulators, needs to be further explored. Recently, efforts are being made to modulate and prolong the active life of dendritic cells, in order to make antigen presentation a more efficacious one. For combating diseases like acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), influenza, malaria and tuberculosis in humans; and foot and mouth disease, Aujesky’s disease, swine fever, rabies, canine distemper and brucellosis in animals, DNA vaccine clinical trials are underway.

682320,"Remdesivir and COVID-19 infection, therapeutic benefits or unnecessary risks?",2021-01-12,"BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-qPCR) is the most accurate measure of gene expression in biological systems. The comparison of different samples requires the transformation of data through a process called normalisation. Reference or housekeeping genes are candidate genes which are selected on the basis of constitutive expression across samples, and allow the quantification of changes in gene expression. At present, no reference gene has been identified for any organism which is universally optimal for use across different tissue types or disease situations. We used microarray data to identify new reference genes generated from total RNA isolated from normal and osteoarthritic canine articular tissues (bone, ligament, cartilage, synovium and fat). RT-qPCR assays were designed and applied to each different articular tissue. Reference gene expression stability and ranking was compared using three different mathematical algorithms. RESULTS: Twelve new potential reference genes were identified from microarray data. One gene (mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 [MRPS7]) was stably expressed in all five of the articular tissues evaluated. One gene HIRA interacting protein 5 isoform 2 [HIRP5]) was stably expressed in four of the tissues evaluated. A commonly used reference gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was not stably expressed in any of the tissues evaluated. Most consistent agreement between rank ordering of reference genes was observed between Bestkeeper© and geNorm, although each method tended to agree on the identity of the most stably expressed genes and the least stably expressed genes for each tissue. New reference genes identified using microarray data normalised in a conventional manner were more stable than those identified by microarray data normalised by using a real-time RT-qPCR methodology. CONCLUSION: Microarray data normalised by a conventional manner can be filtered using a simple stepwise procedure to identify new reference genes, some of which will demonstrate good measures of stability. Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S7 is a new reference gene worthy of investigation in other canine tissues and diseases. Different methods of reference gene stability assessment will generally agree on the most and least stably expressed genes, when co-regulation is not present.","Maccoux, Lindsey J; Clements, Dylan N; Salway, Fiona; Day, Philip JR",BMC Mol Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17651481/,215
683262,"Incidence, Management, and Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19 and Pneumothorax",2021-09-03,"Elective surgical and endoscopic procedures were suspended nationwide during the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic to minimize exposure and healthcare resource utilization. This resulted in an unprecedented backlog of procedures in most clinical practices including pediatrics. Our group developed an internal process toward the rational development of an algorithm prioritizing elective procedures. This was based on patient disease severity defined by the presence of alert symptoms, symptom severity for dysphagia and abdominal pain, and diagnostic investigation findings. The underlying rationale is to prioritize patients in whom suspected disease course would be greatest impacted by endoscopy. We developed a nurse phone call-based process utilizing REDCap®, identifying relevant symptoms categorized by severity, and a validated functional impairment questionnaire for abdominal pain. We abstracted key laboratory and radiological findings also categorized by severity. The order of priority of procedures was established on the basis of a 4-tiered system factoring both presence and severity of symptoms or prior diagnostic testing results. We present the framework that we have adopted toward prioritizing procedures with the assumption that it offers an objective methodology and that can be efficiently and more broadly applied to other similar practice scenarios.

684844,Virtual Physical Therapy and Telerehabilitation,2021,"Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly implemented in Portugal by the National Institute of Health in collaboration with a nationwide consortium of >50 hospitals/laboratories. Here, we track the geotemporal spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a mutation (D839Y) in a potential host-interacting region involving the Spike fusion peptide, which is a target motif of anti-viral drugs that plays a key role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The Spike Y839 variant was most likely imported from Italy in mid-late February and massively disseminated in Portugal during the early epidemic, becoming prevalent in the Northern and Central regions of Portugal where it represented 22% and 59% of the sampled genomes, respectively, by 30 April. Based on our high sequencing sampling during the early epidemics [15.5% (1275/8251) and 6.0% (1500/24987) of all confirmed cases until the end of March and April, respectively], we estimate that, between 14 March and 9 April (covering the epidemic exponential phase) the relative frequency of the Spike Y839 variant increased at a rate of 12.1% (6.1%–18.2%, CI 95%) every three days, being potentially associated with 24.8% (20.8–29.7%, CI 95%; 3177–4542 cases, CI 95%) of all COVID-19 cases in Portugal during this period. Our data supports population/epidemiological (founder) effects contributing to the Y839 variant superspread.

Patients: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 between 5 February and 5 May 2020 in five hospitals in the South of Spain. Intervention: Patients received calcifediol (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)) treatment (0.266 mg/capsule, 2 capsules on entry and then one capsule on day 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) or not. Main Outcome Measure: In-hospital mortality during the first 30 days after admission. Results: A total of 537 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19 (317 males (59%), median age, 70 years), and 79 (14.7%) received calcifediol treatment. Overall, in-hospital mortality during the first 30 days was 17.5%. The OR of death for patients receiving calcifediol (mortality rate of 5%) was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.08 to 0.61) compared to patients not receiving such treatment (mortality rate of 20%; p < 0.01). Patients who received calcifediol after admission were more likely than those not receiving treatment to have comorbidity and a lower rate of CURB-65 score for pneumonia severity ≥ 3 (one point for each of confusion, urea > 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate ≥ 30/min, systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≤ 60 mm Hg, and age ≥ 65 years), acute respiratory distress syndrome (moderate or severe), c-reactive protein, chronic kidney disease, and blood urea nitrogen. In a multivariable logistic regression model, adjusting for confounders, there were significant differences in mortality for patients receiving calcifediol compared with patients not receiving it (OR = 0.16 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.80). Conclusion: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with calcifediol, compared with those not receiving calcifediol, was significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality during the first 30 days. The observational design and sample size may limit the interpretation of these findings.","Alcala-Diaz, Juan F.; Limia-Perez, Laura; Gomez-Huelgas, Ricardo; Martin-Escalante, Maria D.; Cortes-Rodriguez, Begoña; Zambrana-Garcia, Jose L.; Entrenas-Castillo, Marta; Perez-Caballero, Ana I.; López-Carmona, Maria D.; Garcia-Alegria, Javier; Lozano Rodríguez-Mancheño, Aquiles; Arenas-de Larriva, Maria del Sol; Pérez-Belmonte, Luis M.; Jungreis, Irwin; Bouillon, Roger; Quesada-Gomez, Jose Manual; Lopez-Miranda, Jose",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064175/,215
687154,Study Protocol: The Heart and Brain Study,2021-03-31,"The community health worker (CHW) asthma home-visiting model developed by Public Health-Seattle & King County (PHSKC) is an evidence-based approach proven to improve health outcomes and quality of life. In addition, it has been shown to be an effective and culturally appropriate approach to helping people with asthma understand the environmental and behavioral causes of uncontrolled asthma, while acquiring the skills they need to control their asthma. This paper describes the development and implementation of training curricula for CHWs and supervisors in the asthma home visiting program. To facilitate dissemination, this program took advantage of the current healthcare landscape in Washington State resulting from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approval of the 1115 Medicaid Waiver project. Key aspects of the training program development included: (1) Engagement: forming a Community Advisory Board with multiple stakeholders to help prioritize training content; (2) Curriculum Development: building the training on evidence-based home-visit protocols previously developed at PHSKC; (3) Implementation of the training program; (4) Evaluation of the training; and (5) Adaptation of the training based on lessons learned. We describe key factors in the training program's improvement including the use of a community-based participatory approach to engage stakeholders at multiple phases of the project and ensure regional adaption; combining in-person and online modules for delivery; and holding learning collaboratives for post-training and technical support. We also outline our training program evaluation plan and the planned evaluation of the home visit program which the trainees will deliver, both of which follow the RE-AIM framework. However, because the COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed training activities and prohibited the trainees from implementation of these CHW home visit practices, our evaluation is currently incomplete. Therefore, this case study provides insight into the adaptation of the training program, but not the delivery of the home visit program, the outcomes of which remain to be seen.","Elkugia, Nuha; Crocker, Mary E.; Stout, James W.; Bolt, Kaylin; Weiner, Bryan J.; Kramer, C.

The entire scientific community across the globe is working diligently to tackle this unprecedented challenge. In silico studies have played a crucial role in the current situation by expediting the process of identification of novel potential chemotypes targeting the viral receptors. In this study, we have made efforts to identify molecules that can potentially inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) using the high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) has a large flexible binding pocket that can accommodate various chemically diverse ligands but a complete occupation of the binding cavity is necessary for efficient inhibition and stability. We augmented glide three-tier molecular docking protocol with water thermodynamics to screen molecules obtained from three different compound libraries. The diverse hits obtained through docking studies were scored against generated WaterMap to enrich the quality of results. Five molecules were selected from each compound library on the basis of scores and protein-ligand complementarity. Further MD simulations on the proposed molecules affirm the stability of these molecules in the complex. MM-GBSA results and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis also confirm the thermodynamic stability of proposed molecules. This study also presumably steers the structure determination of many ligand-main protease complexes using x-ray diffraction methods. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma","Sobhia, M.

689548,COVID-19 length of hospital stay: a systematic review and data synthesis,2020-09-03,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between work‐family enrichment and two contextual factors (job support and family support), together with two personal factors (family boundary flexibility and prosocial motivation) among Chinese nurses assisting Wuhan in its fight against the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has now spread worldwide, which has brought attention to the pivotal role of nurses in public health emergencies. Work‐family enrichment is a bidirectional structure, including work‐to‐family enrichment and family‐to‐work enrichment, that can yield many mutually beneficial results in both work and family domains among clinical nurses. However, few studies have investigated work‐family enrichment and its influential factors among front‐line nurses during public health emergencies. METHODS: A cross‐sectional research design was adopted with a snowball sample of 258 Chinese nurses assisting Wuhan’s anti‐pandemic efforts. Data were collected from March 21, 2020 until April 10, 2020 through a battery of online questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate, and hierarchical linear regression analyses and a Pearson correlation test were performed. A STROBE checklist was used to report findings. RESULTS: The results showed that prosocial motivation, family support and job support predicted high work‐to‐family enrichment in those nurses, while prosocial motivation, family support, and family boundary flexibility predicted high family‐to‐work enrichment. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed the importance of paying attention to the work‐family enrichment of front‐line medical workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic, so that they could concentrate on their anti‐pandemic work and maintain their enthusiasm for disaster nursing. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The findings can help health administrators in affected countries around the world identify the influential factors of work‐family enrichment among front‐line nurses during infectious disease outbreaks, specifically in the areas of mobilizing nurses’ prosocial motivation and giving sufficient job support.","Zhang, Yinying; Yang, Min; Wang, Rong",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15677; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33506553/,215

690107,"Frequency, Associated Risk Factors, and Characteristics of COVID-19 Among Healthcare Personnel in a Spanish Health Department",2020-08-18,"INTRODUCTION: Some COVID-19 patients evolve to severe lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome triggered by both the coronavirus infection and the subsequent host-immune response. Accordingly, the use of immunomodulatory agents has been suggested but still remains controversial. Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: and analysis: TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. Patients are randomly assigned (1:1) to one of two arms (42 patients in each group). The primary aim is to assess the time to clinical stability after initiating randomization. Clinical stability is defined as body temperature ≤37.5 °C, and PaO2/FiO2 > 400 and/or SatO2/FiO2 > 300, and respiratory rate ≤24 rpm; for 48 consecutive hours. DISCUSSION: Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm. Interestingly, both drugs are low-cost and can be manufactured on a large scale; thus, if effective and safe, a large number of patients could be treated in developed and developing countries.

The paper begins with a discussion of President Trump’s racist rhetoric towards Blacks but notes that a history of racism is woven into the US presidency. We employ critical race theory as a theoretical framework to demonstrate why institutional racism has always been pervasive in the American presidency. Using a case study analysis, the authors conduct a comparative study of the history of racism of American presidents with the presidency of former president Donald J. Trump. The authors conclude that for most of the nation's history, racism and indifference to African Americans permeated the US presidency. It has only been since the advent of the second half of the twentieth century, for the most part, that there have been meaningful efforts by US presidents to address the concerns of African Americans.","Clayton, Dewey M.; Moore, Sharon E.; Jones-Eversley, Sharon D.",J Afr Am Stud (New Brunsw),https://doi.org/10.1007/s12111-021-09543-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34230821/,215
